 Do as the directions state site in at 25ft and that is about as good as you will hit at that distance says you should be on the paper at 100yds . Not even close . Not worth the money .
 Too bad I was hoping this machine branded with Brookstone on it will be worth the price tag , but unfortunately it turned out to be a disappointment . My first impression is this . When I opened the box and took out all the items , I can feel that it was a returned item . After I assembled it , the handle bars was wobbly even after the screws were in tight . The pole that extends up to your waist -LRB- I have it at the lowest setting -RRB- was very shaky when you step . The weirdest thing happened was it drained my duracell batteries overnight . I noticed that when the pulse was malfunctioning and the readout was very dim . I put in fresh duracell and it solved the problem , but boo hoo , the next day the batteries were drained again . It is not worth the price tag I would say . It is going back to Brookstone . Better to buy the cheaper model . Hope this helps . ** Update ** I noticed that they shipped me one with the control panel different from the one in the catalog . The one I had was one LCD screen with the info on board . The one in their catalog and online shows individual readouts and has a red button in the center . I think it is wrong to get something different from the one shown in the catalog and online . It is false advertising . I am glad to return it back to Brookstone . They say you can not take it back to the store since they do not stock it , but I was not happy with it I took it to the store anyways and returned it to the sales manager . Be careful what you order !
 I was initially excited to purchase this stepper . The shipment was fast , payment was easy , but it was a nightmare after that . First , the parts did n't match up like it did in the manual . Not only that , but I put in batteries for the computer part of the stepper and the batteries burned within seconds !! The actual stepper part could not be adjusted and did n't even move up and down ! It was honostely , the WORST online purchase I have ever made . Now I have to deal with the Brookstone catalog people and figure out a way to return it . I would have brought it to the nearest store , but they said they could n't do anything about it . Do NOT buy this machine ! : -LRB-
 Not worth the money . Very poor quality . After very little use , the joint at the peddle base began to wobble . Can not even use it at this point . When it did work it was very noisy .
 This item is under engineered and nothing but trouble . The pulse rate monitor did n't work and they sent me another panel , which did n't work either . I found that the only way to keep the unit from draining batteries is to remove them after each use . After about 4 months , the drive cable broke . I was informed by their `` customer service '' that the part was not available . I have spent 3 years trying to redesign the drive belt system to actually work . Its still a work in progress . I would never do business with Brookstone again .
 This thing was great for about 4 weeks then stared disintegrating . Not happy with it at all .
 SSI Sight-Rite Bullet Laser Bore Sighter 12 GaugeThe SSI Sight-Rite Bullet Laser Bore Sighter for a 12 Gauge Shotgun was defective right out of the box . The primary issue was that the laser refused to turn on no matter how you turned the `` control key '' . The laser , when you got it to turn on by shaking the unit repeatedly , would cut in and out . It never stayed on long enough to get it into the bore of my Mossberg 500 RoadBlocker . Additionally , the laser has exceptionally poor focusing , resulting in a diffused aim point at 20 feet / 3 meters -LRB- resulting in a 6 '' + / 15 cm red blotch -LSB- yes , I took a ruler and measured it -RSB- -RRB- . For a Shotgun , this might not be a horrible thing . However , the aim point shifts by over a foot -LRB- at 20 feet / 3 meters -RRB- as you rotate the `` shell '' , rendering any attempt to use it ineffective . Overall , the `` shell 's '' casing was made of a very nice , heavy material . However , the laser within was absolutely worthless .
 Went to the range to sight in my 12 ga. slug gun with this bore sighter and wasted two boxes of sabots without being able to sight in . I Finally had to give up on it and do it the old fashion way .
 At my old training facility , we were n't required to wear headgear so I did n't know what to get . I train mostly in Muay Thai and American boxing , have been for a good five years now.I chose this , mainly for the price . After using it all of once in sparing , I realized I needed something that would not slide sideways after each punch to the head.I ended up shelling out the big bucks , but I also use mine a lot . If you are not competative or are a light user this would be fine.If you are looking for solid protection from frequent or heavy hitters , invest in the good stuff .

 This product is very small . It was extremely difficult to open the tiny battery space and insert the battery . The switch to turn it on is also very small . You need excellent dexterity to use this product . It is not designed for most elderly .
 Both of these ear buds immediately started a high pitched tone as soon as I tried to use them . You have to move the product around to make it stop but why should it be like this ? I only found one or two positions where the tone stopped . it is so loud other people can hear it . No type of adjustment seemed to make any difference . Useless devices . I did not expect much but still feel i was taken .
 I bought one of these pieces of junk . I put it one ear , and used a regular ear plug in the other . I shot a couple of times using a 1911 45 ACP . It was LOUD . When I took out both ear plugs , the ear that had the SSI plug it in felt muted . It was n't ringing , but I felt that I did do damage to my hearing from using this product .
 This product is actually a safety hazard . I have tested it as I am an Audiology student writing a thesis about low-cost hearing aids . The device puts out so much sound that it can be dangerous to your hearing , especially if you are hunting and the sound blast from a rifle goes off . Please spend at least $ 300 if you are going to spend money on your hearing at all , otherwise , you put your hearing at risk and also risk making a hearing loss worse than it already is . Plus , you are not asked to sign a medical waiver when you buy this product . This means that it is actually illegally distributed according to the FDA .
 Marballizer is great paint but ordering it from amazon is a terrible idea . The paint I 've received was bad . The packaging was horrible and some of the paint was broken . and then the rest of the paint was football shaped and my marker was chopping balls all day . Do yourself a favor and do n't buy paint from amazon , they must not understand how selling bad paint can ruin someones day at the field . I took my marker apart probably 15 times just to clean the paint out . And when you have someone 15 feet from you but ca n't shoot them because your just spraying paint , it makes you not even want to play . So buy paint from a local shop or from an actual paintball dealer so you get good paint . I had the worst experience on the field because of ordering it from amazon . DO N'T DO IT

 I was thrilled to find this Browns apron for a friend . I was disappointed when I received it . While it is packaged nicely you immediately notice how thin & flimsy the fabric is - it is actually see through !! This is a good novelty item but DO N'T BUY if you want to actually WEAR IT/USE IT .
 it feels cheaply made i got it as a gift for my brother and it looks cheap lets see how long it will last
 This apron is made of cotton , but is extremely thin . More of a gauzy material than anything that would actually protect your clothing during cooking . And for the price it does not live up to expectations .
 The logo is about 1/5th the size of the pictured apron . As well , the quality of the fabric is very poor . It 's very lightweight and not coated , so not sure how much it would actually protect . Disappointed .
 My husband loves all things Miami Dolphins so he was happy to receive this . I felt the apron was thin and cheaply made and will not likely hold up to many washings . I am not happy with this purchase .
 It took my wife examining this apron for me to realize that it is not well-made . As with other clothing she has examined from Pakistan , the quality control is poor , the stitching in some places looks like it was done by someone who was not paying attention . It wanders around , instead of being in a straight line , with loose threads hanging here and there . Unless you can take this item out of the package and examine it carefully , I would recommend finding something else to buy .
 I purchased this item on NOV. 21 , and I have not recieved it yet . I do have the tracking information , but from Nov. 24th , it shows the same information telling me that the pakeage is in transit . I want to know if I can ever get my stuff .

 This DVD has very poor picture quality and looks like it was recorded with a $ 50 video camera . Most of the DVD was just watching 2 people walking around the ring using the focus mitts without setting up any drills . In addition , when the people did talk , you could maybe make out one out of every 3 words that they said .

 I bought these thinking I was getting a higher quality product , the price was the only thing higher.After less than 6 weeks of use , they are ripping in multiple places and one is ripped all the way up the side . I also bought them from my 8 year old son and the same thing is happening to his as well , just at a slightly slower rate . I guess they are not meant for solid contact , maybe just point sparring or lightly tapping a bag/target . Next time I will just buy the cheapest pair expecting to throw them in the trash and I would n't be so disappointed.UPDATE : The company did replace the product free of charge so I updated my review since they did stand behind their product . Unfortunately The new pair is starting to rip again same as the old pair . I think these are decent if you are not kicking hard ie . light sparring . I would not use they for kick any bags or targets with force -LRB- this is why I got them -RRB- . Light kicks to people with these will protect your opponent , but using these for power kicks to a bag results in them falling apart , also they do not stay in place well after a few hard kicks and I have to adjust them .

 I am very disappointed in the T-Shirt that I received . Not only does it have small flaws but it is NOT the T-Shirt that is pictured on the web site . I will NOT be ordering anything else from this vendor .
 We have purchased Russell Athletic tshirts in the past and they were very true to size . My husband is 6 ' 6 '' and this `` tall '' size is at least 4 '' -6 '' short in the length compared to Reebok , Nautica and Cutter & Buck . Such a disappointment . I even washed them in cold water . I will say that the quality of the material of the shirt is good but does me no good if he wo n't wear them . Will NEVER buy these again !
 I bought these shirts because i have a hard time finding good shirts for tall people -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' 270lbs -RRB- . These shirts all shrank up in just a couple of washed the carhartt tall shirts have been far superior to these and so I will not be buying any more of these shirts .
 Disappointing ! This t-shirt shrank about five -LRB- ! -RRB- inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label .
 I order 2 extra long shirts to try . I ordered 1 red 1 grey . When the package came the first thing noticed was the red shirt was in a smaller bag size than the grey shirt . Upon opening , the grey shirt had cardboard that the sirt was wrapped around . The red shirt had no cardboard that the shirt was wrapped around . The grey shirt had no size tag on the back of the neck for the size just a stamp and made in Pakistan . The red shirt had tag with the size Russel brand and made in Pakistan . I put the grey shirt on , it on and it was very good in size and length . Loose fitting all around and nice and log . I then tried the red shirt , it was tight fitting , almost choking me around the neck and clearly shorter in length than the grey shirt that came in the same package . I placed both out on the bed and the red shirt was around 2 inches shorter in width 3 inches shorter in length and the neckline was an inch shorter and the sleeves were not as wide.Maybe they shipped me a returned shirt that was washed and shrunk ? Who knows but a 2XT with 2 different packaging , tags and sizes is not acceptable quality imho . I will be returning both shirts .
 Quality not very good . My expectations for a Russell Athletic product were not met . To me , the material was of a very low grade .
 this shirt started out at 34 '' length after wash and dried on low heat it was 32 '' inches long so cant where it which is bad new because it cost a lot more than the others i bought of other brands , i would recommend no one over 6.0 to 6.2 buy this i am 6.7 and it is way to short unless you like showing you back off and if that 's the case save the money and do n't wear a shirt
 For years I have loved Russell Athletic products -LRB- I have one shirt that I have worn at least 500 times and it still looks new -RRB- , but then my local Academy stopped carrying them . Although I prefer to buy locally , I had no choice and so ordered from Amazon . One of the shirts I bought came out of its third laundry cycle with the sleeve seams split in several places . Not what I had expected !
 The first time my son wore this shirt the length was great , as soon as I washed and dried -LRB- on low -RRB- the shirt shrunk . Do not wash , this shirt will shrink drastically . At least 3 inches .
 The packaging had dead insects in it , and in one of the 3 shirts there was a hole in it , near the collar . Whether it was a sewing mistake or insect munching , I do n't know .
 At first I was thrilled that I finally found a 2XT Tee Shirt that was actually cut for a tall person and not a fatty.The material also had a nice thickness to it , which has become a problem with many garments of late.After some inspection , I realized that the construction of one of the shirts was so far off that I had to go back to see if I ordered a blemish or factory second.If you pay $ 30.00 -LRB- with shipping -RRB- for a Tee Shirt , you should n't expect such an awful job . One of the side seams is fine , but the other starts at the armpit and then takes a sharp turn , ending close to the middle of the back . Not only does this look ridiculous , but I feel the pulling from this terribly made shirt.The packaging said that this shirt was made in Pakistan , which might be the reason for this reject of a shirt.Shirt companies were having shirts made in Mexico and Honduras , which was a slight decline from what is made in the US , but this is just unacceptable.What is next , $ 40.00 for a Tee Shirt made in Madagascar ?????
 I ordered 3 of these and they were not only on the small side , they also had significant size differences between supposedly equal sized shirts ... Someone slip some irregulars into this batch ?
 I bought these thinking I was getting a higher quality product , the price was the only thing higher.After less than 6 weeks of use , they are ripping in multiple places and one is ripped all the way up the side . I also bought them from my 8 year old son and the same thing is happening to his as well , just at a slightly slower rate . I guess they are not meant for solid contact , maybe just point sparring or lightly tapping a bag/target . Next time I will just buy the cheapest pair expecting to throw them in the trash and I would n't be so disappointed.UPDATE : The company did replace the product free of charge so I updated my review since they did stand behind their product . Unfortunately The new pair is starting to rip again same as the old pair . I think these are decent if you are not kicking hard ie . light sparring . I would not use they for kick any bags or targets with force -LRB- this is why I got them -RRB- . Light kicks to people with these will protect your opponent , but using these for power kicks to a bag results in them falling apart , also they do not stay in place well after a few hard kicks and I have to adjust them .
 Not a quality hat . I thought the team was funny , and it would be a cool hat to have , but it just looked bad .

 The cover -LRB- the thing you sleep on - not the bag -RRB- is like a rubber membrane and not a canvas or woven cloth . It does n't have any strength and wo n't take any abuse without ripping . It might be OK for a spare bed in the house , but do n't even think of taking it camping because it ca n't stand up to real wear . Even hauling it around in the car will probably damage it beyond use . I called the company to complain , they said I could get a new cover if they had one , but they do n't have them and have n't had them for a year . So do n't expect any customer support from Slumberjack . My recommendation is get a cot that advertises a cover with ripstop nylon or canvas . Do n't buy this cot if you plan on using it .
 When I first used this cot it seemed excellent . The frame is very sturdy and the cot was comfortable . If I had written a review at that point I would have given it 5 stars . But the second trip I took the cover burst like a balloon . Really , I could feel it give a little , and by the time I could get off it there was a 4 foot long rip . It was then I started looking closely at the material of the cover - it is some rubberized material with a few threads in it - not a real canvas . And it has zero rip-stop capability . I tried to sew it but it was like trying to sew a balloon - it just does n't work . The Slumberjack people say they will give me a new cover , but they never seem to have one in stock to send -LRB- for 4 months ? -RRB- . Only get this cot if you plan on using it once ! My previous cot lasted 8 years.Update Oct. 2009
 Just got this cot yesterday , and I have mixed feelings about it . The length and width are great , but I have serious concerns about the construction . Anyone who has slept on a military issue cot of this style -LRB- I slept on one in Iraq for 11 months -RRB- knows they are built like rocks . But this cot wobbles forward and backward in a very disconcerting way . The brackets on the joints are undersized , and I think that is what leads to the instability . Secondly , the connectors for the endpoles are of a style -LRB- kinda like a dovetail joint -RRB- that is very likely to break during normal use -LRB- assembly and disassembly in particular -RRB- . Army cots have a much better ball and socket type joint between the side and end poles . Lastly , this sucker is HEAVY . I 'm talking like four or five times what it should weigh . Which makes me boggle even more at the wobbliness of it.Overall , I think the poles are well constructed , but the joints are weak . Maybe a redesign is in order . But if you 're careful not to put any forward/backward stress on the cot , I think it ought to hold out for a while . I 'm 6 ' tall , so I 've always hated the old 75 '' army cots for being too short for me -LRB- head and heals hit the end poles -RRB- , but I 'm going to return the slumberjack and get one of the issue cots instead . Proof that there is a reason that the army buys what it buys .

 There is no need to bash this tent because it is very simple to set up . I like the compartments and the looks , but I found the zipper to enter was getting stuck from the initial set up . It 's one of those things you do n't expect , but when you are out camping and the rain and wind are in effect , that zipper getting caught allowed for rain and wind to get in . It also is for two people rather than four . Do yourself a favor and buy a bigger size tent than what you initially shop for . It is much more worth it .
 These shin guards look great but do n't work well for kick boxing . I found that they slide around on my leg and do n't protect my shin when kicking , particularly when I sweat . They have a velcro and stretch strap fasteners at the knee and at the bottom around the ankle , perhaps a third strap around the calf would help .

 SAVE YOUR MONEY !! TOO SIMPLE . YOU CAN GAIN EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION ON YOUTUBE . Pilates Ladder Barrel with Dr Godoy , in one short video shows you multiples exercises that will help you . I 'm shocked at the lack of exercises listed on this dvd . The information in the video is good and well explained . But GOOD GRIEF ! Save your MONEY ! IT IS RARE THAT I WOULD LIST THIS KIND OF REVIEW BUT THIS DVD DESERVES IT ! It 's worth about $ 1 . & I know its the Trainer Series . Still worth $ 1 .
 First you need to know that the sizing runs very BIG on these gloves . I first got the large which was way too big for me . I returned and got the medium which was still somewhat too big . Apparently there is no small -LRB- at least not on Amazon -RRB- . At first I thought these were great gloves giving good wrist support and good grip . Then after a few weeks of using them I noticed weakness in my wrists . I just assumed I 'd been working out too hard but after a few more days the pain was severe and it was clear why.These gloves include a wrist strap which is fed through a metal buckle and then pulled back on itself to secure . The metal buckle is large -LRB- the width of the strap ... about 1.5 inches -RRB- . If you tighten the strap tight , the buckle moves around to the back of your hand . So , when you do bench presses and your wrists bend back , the metal buckle digs into the back of your hand and your lower forearm . In my case the buckle came almost behind my thumb and was digging into the tendons there . This caused an injury in both hands that I am still recovering from two months later.I would recommend using gloves that do not have any metal buckles or fittings .
 Mine fell apart very quickly . I have since purchased a $ 10 pair from Target and they have lasted longer .
 I bought these gloves after reading the reviews , but once I received them I was very disappointed with the quality . They are made of low quality synthetic materials and they do not assist one in lifting weights comfortably . This product should be avoided by those serious about fitness training . You can find better training gloves at discount sports stores that are made of real leather for the same price which give you better grip . My personal trainer bought me such a pair from a sports outlet for $ 18 and they are fantastic .
 picked a pair of these up at a Target . Lasted 2 trips to the gym . Diamond tread started tearing from bad stitching . Also the thumb stitching irritated my skin almost into a rash from scratching it inside the glove . I do n't know why people regard these ase great lifting gloves.Just so everyone knows , the only gloves I 've been satisfied with in the past three years are the Flexsports power wrists -LRB- white and black . Only seen them on bodybuilding.com -RRB- I 've had two pairs of those ones and both hav elasted over half a year -LRB- heavy lifting only , at least 2 a week , 2 hour regiments -RRB-

 While using it for the third time the red -LRB- medium side -RRB- broke and pulled apart leaving a big hole in the product . Online Sports is an outstanding company and replaced it with the Black Power web per my request .

 To be honest I have no clue how these will work . If they were dry and unbroken and not sitting in a huge glop at the bottom of the bag , well maybe . Every one of the four bags had massive breaks . The box was only half hazardly protected and it was clear that Fed Ex had sent this box through the ringer . Ive cleaned up what I could and threw out probably 500 balls ... the glops of paint were that huge . My feeling now after doing this is to make sure there are as few middle men between me and the manufacturer as possible and try to find someone that ships . I suspect you might be better off choosing to not go the free shipping route . Maybe then you can get Fed Ex out of the mix .
 When i got the balls , everyone of the 4 bags had breaks . I hand cleaned every ball , about 1800 -RRB- left . When I tried to shoot them , I could get 1 or 2 balls off then the rest would break in the barrel . I tried lowing my marker pressure and other balls . The problem is these all star balls , probably because they were broken or old . I have a Bob Long marker and keep it in good condition . This was the first and last time I order balls off the internet .
 I 'm not rating the All Star paintballs themselves as a 1 , because these paintballs are usually awesome . But Amazon shipping is horrible on paintballs ! Like the reviewer below me , my paint arrived in gobs . I have never seen so many broken paintballs in one box . I have spent so much time trying to clean these things off , and saving a few bucks here at Amazon definitely was not worth the hassle . What 's worse , the outter shipping box had only a little ding on it when it arrived , but the paintball box itself was totally smashed in , which means that the paintabll box was already smashed when they packed it and shipped it to me , and yet they sent it anyway ! THIS IS RIDICULOUS ! Now I have ordered many things from Amazon and have never had a problem before , so my review of Amazon 's horrible shipping only applies to paintballs and other delicate items . But still , this definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth for amazon.com
 It is actually impossible for me to review this product because Amazon.com sent me Evil paintballs instead of the RPS All Stars that I ordered :-LRB- I will however , write a review of the paintballs that I did receive . The paint came with at least twenty breaks in each of the four bags in the case -LRB- no warranty on paint -RRB- . I tried to clean them and use them for practice paint but , every other ball would break . I was forced to throw them away . They were on sale for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- and shipped directly from Amazon . I should have just burned the money instead . Shame on you Amazon ! First , you send me the wrong product , and then I open the box and find that it 's all ruined . Until this purchase , I have had nothing but good luck with Amazon . I will never buy paint from you again . So , based on this review I would not recommend buying any kind of paint from Amazon.com .
 This canopy has served us well for camping in the mountains , but just ca n't handle the constant 15 mph winds on the beach . I used it until it failed . The side cross members flex and the leading leg in the wind bends until it ca n't take it no more . I 'm looking for replacement parts , and have found that the cost looks like more than it 's worth . I purchased a Wal-Mart replacement while at the beach , and it is an EZ up , and is of the same design and wo n't hold up either . In my quest for replacement parts , I have found that there is a much sturdier design frame out there made by Northstar , Ez Up Encore and a few others that I am considering in the future .
 Well i took it to the beach for camping and the first day a leg broke with light wind it bent at the top and have not been abel to use it.would not buy again hard to find parts even order them . -LSB- ... -RSB- thank you
 We bought this canopy to use for tailgating at sporting events and backyard shade for gatherings . We only used it 3 times and the nylon roller bag that came with it completely fell apart . Then one of the structure tubes in the canopy bent so the thing was useless . We were very careful setting this up and taking it down and still have no idea how the tube got bent . We never forced it open or shut . I contacted Variflex through their Quik Shade product web site and filled out a warranty claim to see if I could get a replacement part -LRB- they claim you can -RRB- . I got an automated reply saying I would be contacted in 24 hrs and never heard a thing . Do not buy this product . Try the EZ Up brand instead , we found out it is a much better product at a similar price .
 This product is terrible . It may be great for shade but do n't get caught in a sudden thunder storm . The canopy sags and allows water to buid up . The weight of the water will cause the canopy to collapse . I bought this a week ago and set it up in the backyard . We went out for the evening and while we were out the area had a sudden thunder storm . when we got back home the canopy had collapsed on on side and was laying on the picnic table . the support peices were all bent and there was a pool of water in the material . I 'm returning mine to where I bought it . In my opinion the frame should have 4 additional roof bars , each from the center to the middle of the side scissors bars . If your looking for a 10 X 10 to keeps you out of the sun AND rain , my suggetions is go buy one for 39.95 with poles you assemble yourself . I had one and it lasted for 5 years . I bought the quick shade as a repalcement because I thought it would be easier to set up . Well it is ... It 's just not better .
 Nice shade except for durability . Being in FL the canopy does a nice job blocking the heat , taking it up/down requires more than one person . The stinker here is that a connection bolt fixture broke and the bolt was lost , cost a chunk to order replacements . Not long after one of the metal arms snapped in 2 at a connection point . I find myself looking for a new one , better built , than sinking more cash into what looks like a neverending repair job . And oh yeah , the bag is handy , just expect it to rip within short order ... duct tape helps
 I was trying to save a little money so I went with the Variflex/Quick Shade brand . It ended up costing me a lot more because now I have to go out and purchase another more expensive canopy that will hold up under normal use . As for this product , the plastic holding the main crossbars across the top broke in two places by the time I had used the product 3 times -LRB- I think the first break happened the first day we used it -RRB- . The 4th and last time I used the product , we had to tape the crossbars together in the middle so they would n't fall on our heads and the top of the canopy was flaccid and waving around in the wind.But that 's not all ... there 's already a hole in the canopy fabric , the bag tore and the zipper came completely off . I contacted the company by email 2 days ago because there is a 2 year warranty , but I have n't had a response yet .
 Purchased Variflex Compact Recreational 10 x 10 Quik Shade Instant Canopy to use at my son 's birthday party . The tent was easy to set up with my husband 's assistance . However , the tent did not make it to the party . The tent did not even last 1/2 hour once it assembled.I live in Orlando . Unfortunately , we had a rain storm which blew in & out in less than 10 minutes . There was not enough time for us to close the tent down . The tent metal assembly poles & frame are not strong to withstand even a light rain storm . The poles and frame bent beyond repair and one area broke entirely . Luckily I had some beach umbrella 's to put out for our guests , since it was hot in the 90 's & sun came out right after the rain.I would not buy again . Looked like a great product , I was disappointed with how flimsy it really was once assembled .
 I bought the 12 x 12 Recreational canopy several months ago . The VERY thin bag tore within 2 uses , and the wheels locked , wore down , and failed on the the very first use . The whole thing is garbage now.One of the plastic caps that connect the roof supports broke on the 2nd or 3rd use , so I used a very small bungee to wrap around it to keep it together , but a support from another corner had bent ... just bent it back , but there was a crease in it ... and a second cap broke , needing a bungee too . Additionally , the accordion section bent in and broke some connectors , causing the walls to bow in.I called the number on the label stuck to the frame , and the first lady was very helpful . She walked me through what I needed , offered to send me an entire accordion piece to use for parts and the cap I needed . I called back later to ask if the bag was under warranty , and it was , so they added it . I called a third time to tell them about the second cap and the torn top ... I got interrogated by a woman , Kathleen I think , and she kept insisting that this was wind damage that is not covered in the warranty . She asked `` So you had some wind damage and you just need me to add these parts you need ? '' I said `` Yeah , I need ... '' She stopped me and said `` The warranty does n't cover wind damage '' `` I said well that 's not what it was '' `` So you first said it was wind damage and now you 're trying to say it 's not ? '' I had to explain that `` NO , I did n't FIRST say it was wind damage , as this is not my first call to your company '' `` Well , that 's what you just told me on this call '' `` Fine '' I said `` It 's not wind damage , I did n't pay attention to the way you asked the question . '' She asked if I have ever had it up outdoors -LRB- duh ! -RRB- ... if there has ever been wind outside -LRB- duh ! -RRB- I said I do n't put this up near tornado 's , but yes I put it up outside and I anchor the legs to the ground ... she said `` this is not meant to be a permanent structure '' ... She was driving me nuts ! ... I said , `` It 's not , it 's temporary , we set it up , go motocrossing , and when we 're done we pack it up and put it away '' ... She says `` Ahhhh , so you leave the unit unattended and have no idea that wind has cause the damage '' ... `` I said , we do n't ALL motocross , some people stay in the pit '' ... she says `` So , when there 's wind these `` people '' take the canopy down for you then ? '' `` So why did n't you tell anyone about these parts the first time ? How did you not know you needed them ? '' `` Honestly , I was going from memory , I did n't have the canopy open and I had n't used it in some time , so I was going from memory , I have since opened it and discovered that I missed some parts '' She was a pain in the you know what . Ultimately they figured that it would be cheaper to send me a completely new unit than to send me parts . It 's on it 's way , but I think that I 'm going to return it to the store to buy and EZ-UP or a commercial/professional model.The original order was wrong BTW as the nightmare customer `` service '' agent pointed out . The accordion piece was not on the order ... and that was another nightmare discussion with that woman ! They have an official name for that piece or pieces , and I forget what they called it , but she kept asking me if that 's the piece I needed , using their official name . I kept telling her I have no idea what that part name was , but if it 's what I 'm calling the `` accordion '' that is on each of the four sides then yes ... but she kept repeating the name of the part and demanding that I confirm that it was the part I needed ... what a difficult woman she really was ! I , at one point addressed her as `` Counselor '' and later as `` your honor '' , and I let her know that she was stressing me out with her interrogations.I previously had an EZ-UP ... I was happy with that ;
 After waiting for 6 weeks for the EZ-UP brand , I finally ordered the Bravo Canopy , based on the Description `` Heavy Duty Frame '' . When I received the order , the box did not represent the item too well . Upon unpacking the canopy and putting it up , I find the frame is a thin walled , smaller tubing than the brands walmart , and kmart and lowes carry . Additionally , it was already flexing at the joint on the legs . It was CLEARLY not heavy duty at all . I am returning the item . I shopped every canopy I could find , and base on the manufacturers description I chose the most appropiate item for my purpose . I was very disappointed .
 2nd time in use - some breezes at the beach - and the thing snapped in two places while one of the sides bent beyond repair . There were about 50 other tents on the beach and I kept watching to see if anyone else was having the trouble that we were - nope . Just us - Absoute piece of CRAP ! Save your money because they wo n't replace it if it breaks ... put these people out of business !
 I ordered yellow paint and received orange . The company emailed me and asked if I wanted to send it back or they would give me $ 10 refund . I took the refund but find this whole experience kind of lame .
 I bought this bike carrier for my 1971 VW Squareback . While I was able to attach it to my car , I did not feel it was secure enough to stay on with the weight of a bike on it . The clips on the ends of the top straps were not designed well ; it seemed like it would n't take much to pull the out from the hatch of the car . They should also have had a rubber coating on them . The bottom straps had these huge hooks , which did n't attach well to anything on the car . I also think it needs side straps to really stabilize it . The plastic Michelin Man `` padding '' was cheesy.I 'm not sure if this is typical for all bike carriers , but I did n't like that I could n't open my hatch without removing the whole carrier , not just the bike . I transport bike and dogs , and since the car has only 2 front doors , I need to be able to open my hatch to let the dogs out.Another problem I had was with folding it . It 's supposed to be foldable , but it was really difficult for me to pull the cross bars into place without catching my fingers . I sent it back .
 I loved these shorts they were comfortable and easy to wear ... however I have washed them many times and I ca n't get the sweat smell out of them , it seems to have clung to the fabric .
 Very disappointed ... Ordered the seats to make the most of our kayak over the last weeks of Summer ... BUT ... The disappointment is n't with the seats , but the couriers ... The seats have been in a couriers warehouse in New Jersey for over a month and Summer has turned to Autumn ... Still do n't have the seats !!
 It was supposed to be my daughter 's Christmas gift . She opened the gift today and tried it out couple times . Then we heard the noise and found 1 of the clip -LRB- plastic -RRB- was broken . The label said the maximum weight for a person to use this product is 250lb . My daughter 's weight is 105lb only
 These shin guards look great but do n't work well for kick boxing . I found that they slide around on my leg and do n't protect my shin when kicking , particularly when I sweat . They have a velcro and stretch strap fasteners at the knee and at the bottom around the ankle , perhaps a third strap around the calf would help .
 The unit maybe compatable with some type of feeder control , but not with a good unit like HCR or THE TIMER which in my opinion have far above qualities than my experiences with this remote . It was cheap to buy and that makes it easier to throw away.Eddie from Texas
 After much hesitation we bought our son this vehicle . We were concerned because we did not want to set a precedent of $ 300 toys . It was a huge hit on Christmas . We loved the radio and blinkers . It was fun and watching him made all the previous concerns disapper . The problem has arisen a little over a year later . The rear wheel drive is not working properly and the vehicle constantly gets stuck . Without repair this vehicle has been rendered worthless . I should also add that we have taken meticulous care of this vehicle . It has never been left out in inclement weather and always garaged when not in use . My neighbor has a peg perego and the reverse broke on her Gator . The Peg Perego website was easy to manuve and listed a host of places in our state -LRB- MA -RRB- that repair their vehicles . I know this because I did the research for her . Within a week and for $ 40 she has her vehicle back repaired . I could not even locate where the Satety First listed their ride on toys much less find a place where they repair them . The vehicle was not worth the money for $ 300 and a little over a years worth of use . For my money if I had to do it again I would buy the Peg Perego ! I should also note that I never write reviews . When I was making this purchase repairing it never entered into my thoughts while making my decision . It should be a consideration for anyone making a purchase like this .
 We ordered this Corvette as the `` big '' present for our Granddaughter as a Christmas present just this past year . When taken out of the box the film on the windshield was scratched and wrinkled , plus a corner of the hood was broken . My husband assembled it anyway , we put it on charge for 24 hours , and stored it in our shop for Christmas . Christmas morning everyone was so excited to watch her open her Corvette . This was the present that she was going to open last . Boy was she surprised when she saw it ! She immediately jumped in , turned the key on , turned on the radio that sounded great , the car made a real engine sound , and we all told her to push on the pedal . She did and NOTHING happened . My husband and Son checked out everything and it still would not go forward or backwards . This was a very big disappointment , not only for us , but especially for her ... her big present did not even work.Upon further research of this vehicle we found there was a recall on parts of it . Need we say we would not have bought it had we known that ?? We were in contact with the company immediately , and I must say , they were very nice in working with us on this defective car . Would I buy it again ?? NEVER . We have one very disappointed 4 year old right now that thinks Santa brought her something that does n't work .
 Two HUGE issues with this :1 . Each rear wheel spun in different directions , in other words it would never go anywhere . I was told one of the motors was installed backwards , and that I would have to take it to the repair center 2 1/2 north of my house ... yea right tell that to my daughter on her birthday ... not that it mattered much -LRB- see below -RRB- :2 . My 3 year old daughter is not tall by any means , and is a hair shorter than her friends , but nothing extreme . She did not even come CLOSE to being able to touch the gas pedal . She would have to wait at least 6 months before being able to drive it . She has driven every other type of car her friends have with no issues . I took this back and got a Hummer instead - she is happy and so am I. . . after all both wheels go in the same direction .
 My son got this car for Christmas -LRB- it 's now May 31 -RRB- and he 's gotten maybe one month of use out of it . It routinely breaks -LRB- battery lasts maybe 2 weeks -RRB- and the retailer has referred us to Safety 1st -LRB- the manufacturer -RRB- to resolve this . Safety 1st has taken an inordinate amount of time to send me parts and is now taking their time to provide me the contact information of someone who might be able to fix the car . It 's been a total pain to deal with . My poor son -- this has been a disaster for him . He use to always ask what was wrong with his corvette -- now he just wishes he had a Gator instead . Do n't waste your money . Ours was a total lemon .
 Well , here it is , Christmas Day 2007 . We purchased a variation of this Corvette for our 5 year old daughter for Christmas . The version we have is the `` Barbie '' pink Corvette , purchased at Toys R Us . I actually spent about two hours assembling this on December 23rd , and then placed it in our garage , hooked up to the charger . The instructions state to charge the car for a full 24 hours before use . I did go ahead and put in the batteries for the radio -LRB- per the directions -RRB- , and upon fiddling with it , I found it to be of very poor quality . The sound is sufficient , but the channel scan button is inconsistent . At times , tapping it advances the channels , while other times pressing it does nothing.Unfortunately , after about 36 hours of charging , we brought the car into the living room to have it ready for Christmas morning . When she woke , she made a beeline for it , turned the key , and NOTHING . No sound , no movement when touching the pedal . The sounds play as long as the car is plugged in , but we have yet to see it move . Oddly , the wiring for the turn signals is also screwed up , when the front left turn signal flashes , the RIGHT rear flashes , and vice versa . Obviously quite disappointing that our daughter 's big present this year is flat out busted.I guess I should n't be surprised ... try Google-ing `` Kid Trax '' ... there is no website that I can find . They are supposedly owned by Safety 1st , but upon going to the Safety 1st website and searching `` Kid Trax '' , shockingly , I received an error message . This does not bode well ... it 's packed in the back of the wife 's van and will go back to Toys R Us tomorrow . What a disappointment ! Stay away from this toy !
 This care is extremely adorable but after a few times of use it will stop working . It over heats and needs to cool off after only a few minutes . The battery will not hold a charge and it has a recall . Do not buy this product . We were lucky that we had bought an extended warantee from toys r us . They sent us a check with in just a couple of days for a full refund of the car . I have 3 small children who each have there own vehicle . The power wheels brand is the only brand that has not had a mechanical problem . There is a recall on this product .
 I BOUGHT THIS CORVETTE FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD SON FOR CHIRSTMAS 05 AND HE 'S USED TWICE BEFORE THE CAR WENT HEYWIRE AND NOW DOES NOT FUNCTION AND SINCE THERE ARE NO SERVICE CENTERS IN HAWAII SO THEY ARE TRYING TO REFUND ME FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE I PAID WHICH ISNT REALLY A BIG HELP SINCE THE ITEAM SELLS FOR $ -LSB- ... -RSB- AND UP AND THEY WANT TO GIVE ME $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . HOW DO I EXPLAIN TO MY 3YR OLD YOU CANT HAVE A NEW CORVETTE BECAUSE SAFETY 1ST ISNT WILLING TO SHIP ONE TO HAWAII :-LRB- I WILL NEVER BUY A SAFETY 1ST RIDE ON CAR AGAIN .
 My twin boys so wanted a Corvette like their grandpa . So when I saw this it was great . We bought two for their 3rd birthday . First of all they can not touch the peddles very well -LRB- they are tall for their age -RRB- . There are no adjustable seats so it is hard for them to drive . Second me having two boys you know there will be a few times the crashes happen , well after the first crash , the radios stopped working . They drive them , but not as much as we had hoped -LRB- for the price it is not worth it -RRB- . The lenses for the blinkers have fallen out and after many times of the headlights being popped up and down they are loose and only one on each cars work . Granted my boys may be a little rough , but come on , can the toy manufacturer not make it to take the play ? I would not recommend this at all . It is also very CHEAP looking . I hate saying it but the neighbors Mustang looks more authentic than this ... we are now taking these to the dumps -LRB- after only having them for four months -RRB- and saving up to get the new Fisher-Price PowerWheels Jeep ... maybe that will hold up to my active boys who like to treat a car like a real one ...
 The knife in the picture is a hobbytech knife also sold by the same company for 49.95 . Even though it clearly says puma sportec knife is what I bought they sent me a hobbytec knife . I needed it for a present and was extremely dissapointed that this company has false advertisement and also does not give you a tracking number our a reciept in the box . The knife was wrapped in newspaper . VERY UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY . Look at the picture it is not a sportec knife dont go by the title because you will be sent a hobbytechPuma Hobbytec Clip Point Lockback KnifeITS THE SAME PICTURE !!!
 Have went through several pairs and Lycra does n't last long . Less than 4 months . Too bad that they ca n't come up with something that you get your moneys worth ... Bought my last pair ...
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .
 I purchased this funnel from amazon in Feb. of 2012 . It was one of the first items I bought as I slowely gathered parts for a 55 gallon feeder . Once I got my barrel and assembled everything I found out that this was not 23.5 '' in diameter like it is suppose to be but in fact 22.5 '' in diameter . -LRB- my fault for not measuring it sooner so I ca n't fault amazons return policy -RRB- I just received this exact same item from bass pro shop which also stated that it was a 23.5 '' funnel , low and behold this one is also 22.5 '' so it 's to late to return the one from amazon but the one one that I got is getting returned . American hunter states nothing about demensions on there website for this item and if you call ther customer support number you get connected to what sounds like some third party company who is just reading from there website . I 'm glad to see that this has worked for some people but it wo n't for me . If other people are getting ones that are the correct size all the way to a inch shorter then it seems like there is a problem somewhere in there quality control area and are producing none standard sizes . This is the first american hunter product that I have bought and I can tell you that if they ca n't even standardize a piece of plastic i would be concerned about any other product that they are selling so no more for me . Your taking your chances if you purchase this item from anywhere not just amazon .
 I ordered this bike and assembled the bike fairly easily . First off the bike looks great . Although while riding the bike there was a notable loud clunk coming from the crank shaft which I think may have needed to be tightened -LRB- with special tools which I did not have -RRB- Also the front derailleur was not working properly . If I had wanted to spend the extra money at a bike shop theses issues may have been able to be fixed . I did not want to dump extra money into this bike . I ended up returning the bike and Amazon was terrific with the return .
 in the span of one week and 50 miles i had to return one of these bikes . i received another three days later . within three commutes , i was stranded three times
 I would just say be very careful with this bike . Growing up on Schwinn I loved the product in the late 90 's and owned a full suspension Homegrown . For those out to get a great deal this is the bike for you . Just do n't expect it to last much more than 500miles . Now if you are serious about riding that will be about 2 weeks . You do get what you pay for and the problem you are going to run into is obsolete chain store parts . There is a reason a good road bike costs upwards of 3k . I did n't even think they made a 7 speed bicycle anymore . I know just this year I had a very hard hard time finding an 8 speed cassette replacement . I do n't work for a shop but when I saw this pop up on daily deals I just has to say buyer beware . I would be afraid to ride this even if it was assembled at a good bike shop .
 I 'm a brand new Triathlete , and the money to invest in a road bicycle was minimal . After searching around Amazon 's website for a while , I made my choice on the Katana without any real knowledge on road bikes . The unit was not difficult to put together , but like some of the other reviews on this site , there were a couple small pieces missing from shipping.Like with any brand new bike , you 're supposed to take it to a bike shop -LRB- unless you are a bike tech -RRB- to get it fine tuned and ready for serious riding . Once at the shop , the tech 's laughed under their breath at this bike because of the cheap derailleurs and accessories fastened to the bicycle . Even after a $ 55 tune up fee , they promised NO perfection in the overall quality of the riding.After my first two rides , the stem and the left pedal completely stripped out causing my rides to turn into walks . Schwinn was kind enough to send replacement parts , but ironically they shipped two pieces that were twice the quality as the ones received on the stock product.All in all , road bikes range from $ 300 to $ 20,000 . I understand the more you pay , the smoother the ride and quality the accessories may be . But $ 300 is a lot to spend on a bike that has DISSAPPOINTMENT written all over it . On the top of the handlebars the logo displays , `` Schwinn Quality . '' This just is n't so . In my opinion , if you 're looking for a piece of equipment that is fully functional and a good ride ... stay away from Schwinn and invest some more dime . It will be worth it .
 just opened the box and found a black bike as opposed to a gray one as shown that i wanted . the components are not shimano as shown and stated in the description . it came with no assembly instructions . so i basically got nothing i wanted because i didnt want a black bike that doesnt come with shimano components . i feel ripped off and duped and i want my money back ! dont buy ! maybe if i had ordered a black bike with some off brand components i would have gotten a gray bike with shimano components and some damn assembly instructions ! dont buy ! dont buy dont buy ! did i say dont buy ? because youre gon na get exactly what you didnt pay for . i knew i wasnt getting an expensive bike but at least send me what i bought . i dont think thats TOO much to ask being that im spending my money . dont buy this bike ! dont buy this bike ! even if you want to spend the same amount for an entry level bike , take your money elsewhere . bait and switch !
 I would not recommend this bike . The gears do not work properly - when I change from low to high gear the chain will fall off completely . Also , the tires needed air added to them before every ride . I would suggest spending a couple of hundred dollars more and get a higher quality bike .
 when is this bike going to be back at 279 ? this bike should be worth 349 $ . . Reasons :1 . the ancient shifters . . the newer shifters are at the brake controls .2 . the frame is an outdated one . handler bars is lower . the newer bike 's geometry is fixed so that the handle bar 's higher than the seating .
 Quality not there for the price . For example , had to immediately add lock nuts -LRB- 9.5 mm x 26 -RRB- to keep rear hubs adjusted . Also bought a large frame and needed to buy a threadless headset extension to `` match the seat . '' Quality of Schwinn bikes seems to have declined in last few years .
 I started spending on the bike to maintaine it since day one . I took it to the bike store when I received it to finish assembling it . Since it did n't come with any instruction 's manual . After a week of using it , it started making noises and started to go out of balance . And for people that ride road bikes , they know how risky it is . I wish I spent more money and got a better bike than this shwinn Katana . Now the bike is back for the 3rd time at the bike store for maintenance . I already spent about $ 150 for maintenance and it 's not even been a month from receiving it.I was expecting to have a manufacture warranty from Shwinn , but I never received anything with the bike that mentions that .
 I should have known something was wrong when bike shops in my city had never heard of this bike and when Schwinns own website does n't have any type of info on it . Sure , the bike only cost 279.00 up front , but that does n't cover any of the costs incurred immediately after purchasing the bike.My bike was missing the bolt on the front brake caliper that secures the cable . I do n't know about all bike shops , but the ones in my city do n't carry just the bolt . You have to buy the whole brake . While the frame of the bike itself was fine , both front and back brakes looked as if they had been used before . The chain had 2 bad links in it which of course caused the chain to jump . The second time I took the bike out , BOTH inner tubes blew out with `` snake bite '' punctures while riding on a flat cement road.I have spent hours fixing and tuning this bike while I have spent a maximum of 30 minutes actually riding it . I should have spent the extra $ 300 to buy the Trek 1000 from the bicycle shop , at least then I would have left knowing the bike was usable and reliable.Terrible , terrible product . I would highly recommend that no one purchases this bike . It gives a bad name to both Schwinn and Amazon .
 I purchased this bike one year ago -LRB- June 2010 -RRB- . It really got me into cycling as a sport , and I put about 500 miles on it before I bought a Cannondale CAAD9 . The schwinn became my ` commuter ' , which means I rode it to class and left it locked up outside in the rain . I live in Cleveland , so there 's plenty of that . I did n't ride it for most of December - early February , but it came out again before the snow had melted and got its healthy dosage of road salts . I kept it clean , and stored it indoors every night , and the drivetrain -LRB- amazingly -RRB- withstood the beating . I estimate that I have around 1100 miles on this bike so far , and pushing 3500 on my Cannondale.I 'm 5 ' 11 '' , 32 '' inseam , and I ride the 54cm version of this bike , which is a decent fit for me . My CAAD is a 56cm and is perfect . I would n't do well on the 58cm of this bike , as the description recommends.I now train seriously and race a lot , and I have learned quite a bit about taking care of bikes . So here are a few things you should know before you buy this bike : Cons :1 . The stem failed after about a month . The metal that had been threaded in the stem actually just popped right out , no warnings . Luckily I was only going 5 or 6 mph when it happened , and I was able to grab the brake lever while the handlebar -LRB- ! -RRB- dropped off the front of the bike . If I had been going faster , that could have been a serious problem reeeal fast . Highly recommend replacing the stem with a 4-bolt model . They can be had fairly cheap .1.25 I had to replace the bottom bracket after three months . I 've seen that complaint in some other reviews . -LRB- at this point , the guy at my LBS said `` I see this bike more than I see my mother '' -RRB- 1.5 Both tubes went within two weeks of setting up the bike . Put in some Qtubes , have n't had a flat since . Definitely order some new tubes with this bike .2 . The cassette is an ancient thread-on -LRB- from what I can tell -RRB- , and will be nearly impossible to replace once it wears out . It will need a new rear wheel before the cassette can be replaced . Luckily , you can upgrade it to 8/9 speed at that point , though you 'll also need a new shifter . I believe the derailleur will work with 8/9 speed .3 . I 've had two of the cables fray and snap under normal conditions , for the rear derailleur and rear brake . I just replaced all the cables -LRB- more on that later -RRB- so it 's not an issue for me anymore . A cable set should run you about twenty bucks , so not a huge deal .4 . The components just feel generally cheap . After feeling how solid a decent set of components can be , I immediately relegated this bike to the ` campus ' realm .5 . But it 's not particularly well-suited for that , either . The clearance on the brakes is so low that I had to order a set of fenders from the UK - I could n't find any here that would fit . There is also no way to mount a standard rack , something that I really really want to do now , for carrying groceries and books . I 've managed to carry about 40lbs of groceries home with it by stuffing things in my backpack and with plastic bags dangling off the handlebars . That was n't a particularly good idea .6 . The wheels are heavy . Reeeeally heavy . If you ever start caring about weight , upgrading the wheels will easily shave a pound and a half , maybe two if you spend decent money .7 . The way they put the handlebar tape on is ridiculous . I spent about an hour earlier today wiping the gunk from the old stuff off with rubbing alcohol . .8 . Only one water bottle cage mount . I can only ride for about 45 minutes with one water bottle . Ended up strapping another one to the top tube.Okay , now for the pros :1 . It 's survived cleveland . ` nuff said .2 . It 's got a threadless steerer .3 . Dual-pivot brakes . -LRB- single-pivot are those awful things you see on bikes from 1970 -RRB- 4 . Upgradeable . Most of the stuff it uses -LRB- except the rear hub , apparently -RRB- is compatible with current , widely available components.I decided a few days ago that I was tired of this being a crud bike , so I put about two hundred dollars into making it solid . I replaced the brake levers -LRB- huge difference in feel - the old ones were no good -RRB- , the brake calipers , the shifters -LRB- installed bar-end shifters -RRB- , the chain , and all the cables and housings . I might slap new wheels on it soon , because currently I ca n't upgrade the cassette -LRB- tried - now I have a useless 7-speed cassette lying around -RRB- . In retrospect , it would have been much easier to just spend another 300 in the first place - now I 've put at least that much into this bike . I got my CAAD9 -LRB- with full Shimano 105 -RRB- for the same amount . That was a steal , but not unheard of.If you 're considering this bike , I have some advice for you .1 -RRB- if you think you would be interested in the sport , spend more money . You wo n't regret it . -LRB- it 's a great sport , too -RRB- 2 -RRB- if you just want something to knock around campus or the neighborhood , it 's not awful . Might even get you into cycling -LRB- it could happen to you ... -RRB- , but there are better options for that .3 -RRB- if you think it looks cool and that 's why you want to buy it - I 've gotten waaaaay too many jokes about the `` aero '' frame . Go for something a little classier . This frame is not at all `` aero '' - in fact , I suspect it 's less aerodynamic because of the rectangular cross-section downtube . Does n't matter , though , the thing weighs 24 pounds.I 've also crashed the bike once , and the front wheel needed retruing . Absolutely pummeled the ground at 25mph . The components were all fine , though it needed new tape .
 Overall I am very disappointed with this scope . I thought I would save some money and not buy a more expensive Leupold like others I have . The BDC reticle on the Nikon Monarch is way too thick and takes up way too much of the field of view . When shooting at 100 yards , the reticle hides the bulls eye on the targets I use . Makes it difficult to get good groups or even sight the scope in . I have also found it difficult to focus the scope for different yardage . Lettering on the targets are blurry with the Nikon while crystal clear with a Leupold at 100 yards . To be fair , I have not tried the scope past 100 yards where it may do better but I do n't have these issues with the Leupold 's I own -LRB- even the cheaper ones -RRB- . Again , to be fair the Leupold I am comparing to costs almost twice as much as I paid for the Nikon , but I wish I would have spent the extra money . I have talked to several people at the range who love their Nikon Monarch but I have not been impressed with mine .
 This line is junk . The braid unravels and snarls upWould not recommend it to my worse enemy .
 I was pleased with this chair when it first arrived at the beginning of summer . It was big and comfy . Here is the problem I had with it
 The product looked exciting and my son was eager to try it out even though he received it as a X'mas present . Unfortunately as soon as we tried it we realized it was defective , the line would not reel back in . We tried to look for instructions but nothing is available except what it is on the back of the packaging and the link to the manufacturer 's web site did not provide any additional information . The one year warranty is a joke since they require you to send in $ 8.95 to cover shipping and handling and ship the defective part back . Given that the entire assembly cost less than that it is a pretty worthless warranty .
 The child who received this was thrilled with it because it has Spiderman on it . However , when the fishing line got tangled and we tried to pull it out , the entire reel broke off . The plastic just came apart in two pieces . It ruined our fishing trip . Very disappointed . This does n't live up to the Shakespeare name .
 This is a poorly made fishing rod . While I didnt expect much for the price , I did n't expect it to break minutes after my son started using it . Not worth the money !
 Well , I was pretty excited to go fishing with my grandson during the local labor Day derby . Ordered the pole in plenty of time -LRB- 1 month -RRB- but it still has n't arrived -LRB- 7 weeks later -RRB- . So I am not very happy . And I had to buy a new pole for him . Not trusting this vendor .
 ... it does n't come with a hook ! You ca n't actually fish with it . My 4 and 7 year old boys loved casting in the back yard but were disappointed they could n't take it to the pond and catch anything .
 Have went through several pairs and Lycra does n't last long . Less than 4 months . Too bad that they ca n't come up with something that you get your moneys worth ... Bought my last pair ...
 when you purchase something like this , you would want to have all the technical specifications IN ADVANCE so you are not surprised ... . so this is what you would really get if order this one : FeederMax # 20578 12-volt solar charger . It is NOT the one pictured with the clips , but it does have a protective flex conduit around the cable . It is sold as a solar pannel -LRB- which it is of course -RRB- but what it is really made for is a very low power charger - specifically it is only 1.26 Watts ... . ya just ca n't do much with that . with no load on it , in bright sun it generates 20 volts -LRB- so be careful with small devices -RRB- but the box says max 18V . So if you are a hunter and need a to charge something small for low use , this might be great , but other applications - not so much .
 I PURCHASED THIS , AND RECIEVED SOMETHING DIFFERENT . IT WORKS HORRIBLEY AND I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE .
 Bought this board for my son and after using it 2-3 times on carpet the board cracked ! You will have to buy another board to use with the `` plastic training trucks '' .
 This thing could n't shake a baby.Seriously though , this platform is inexpensive , reasonably well made for the price , but in the end you also get what you pay for . It would be great for older folks or people out of shape ... but to a person serious about fitness this thing has nothing to offer . It has * NO * settings for intensity -LRB- not to be confused with frequency -RRB- . The vibrations did n't penetrate much above my knees -- which a massager could have done just fine at a fifth the price.Once again -- this platform might be good for the elderly or weak , but not much else .
 Found this last year on the lightning deal . Hubby and I have dirty minds and it looked like a cheap Sybian knockoff to us so we bought it . Tried it as that . Meh . Tried it for exercise but meh . I am not a home gym person . Rather go to the gym . Kids liked it the best , one year old would laugh and laugh every time she turned it on . Finally donated it . Just another exercise machine taking up needed space .
 Not real sure if this works or not because the second day I used it -LRB- following the video with the elderly lady -RRB- , I ruptured several blood vessels in my knee and thigh . I have been on crutches for the last 5 weeks . I nor my orthopedic dr. can state for sure this was a result of using the machine but if it is not , it was quite a coincidence . I would love to try it again but at this point I am afraid .
 One reason I chose to purchase this product over others is that it had wheels for ease of moving . When I received this unit and put it together I noticed there were no wheels . I called the manufacturer about it , they told me that Amazon has the wrong product number listed as they build one with wheels and one without . They were not able to just send me the wheels as the bases are different . I did try the machine and found it to be cheaply made . I would not recommend this unit to anyone .
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .
 The listing states that the product is normally $ 34.40 in what universe , you can get this product at your local sporting goods store for less than the supposed deal of $ 7.92 . This deal is a total rip off you can find a better price pretty much anywhere else . I have lost all faith in supposed deals here , before you buy anything here check elsewhere to make sure you are getting the deal they claim.I have heard that the mountain house product line was really good food , unfortunately I have not had the personal enjoyment of eating one of their products as I returned it due being deceived by the supposed savings which were non-existent . I will however be buying mountain house food from a local store where I can get the products for less .
 Said you got 6 but you get 1 ... . Not sure how it 's such a great deal.Product itself is fantastic as usual .
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .

 I bought some 10-lb test Berkley Vanish a few weeks ago , and re-spooled both my spinning reels with it . I bought it mostly because I liked what I had read about fluorocarbon being less visible to fish underwater . I fish in a clearwater lake , and the fish can be pretty discriminatory when it comes to deciding what to eat , so I did n't want them seeing my line . Anyway , I caught some fish , so I 'm not giving the line a 1-star rating , but , in the end , Berkley Vanish can only muster 2-stars . Cons
 In general , fluorocarbon lines have weak knot strength and Field & Stream 's objective testing showed that Vanish has the weakest knot strength of them all , losing on average 25 % of its rated stength with the simple Palomar teminal tackle knot . Lots of folks use alternative knots

 Came as expected , but did n't last too long . I used it for a fence gate . After about 6 months of use outdoors , it was getting rusty and got to a point where it would not close . Indoors or kept out of the rain it might have done better .
 Despite its claims , this lock is made in China , not the USA . As soon as I saw that I returned it.I wish Amazon would make it easier to find products that are -LRB- truly -RRB- made in the USA .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .

 Have went through several pairs and Lycra does n't last long . Less than 4 months . Too bad that they ca n't come up with something that you get your moneys worth ... Bought my last pair ...
 The description of this product was misleading . It indicated that I would receive a case of 6 and I only received one . With an `` original price '' of $ 45.00 , this also assured me that this must be for a case of 6 .
 The Chicken Teriyaki with Rice was one of the entrees sampled recently at a camping club taste test . Unfortunately , it ranked the lowest of all of the entrees . Nobody liked it.It had a sweet taste with an odd , off flavor . Both the appearance and the texture were unappealing , the flavor even less appealing . -LRB- It looks like something your dog yakked up . -RRB- The only thing drawn to it was the flies , which at least kept them away from more desirable dishes . We all thought it was awful , and none of us will be willing to carry this around with us for a future meal.Pass on this one , there are much better Mountain House meals than this glop .
 As a self-proclaimed USB gadget geek , I thought this light would be useful for traveling . Unfortunately , the neck length makes transportation difficult because it fairly long and must be stored straight or awkwardly bent . Depending on your USB port arrangement , it can be difficult to position without interfering with more critical equipment -LRB- like a mouse -RRB- . It also turns out the light itself is n't even value-added because most laptop monitors provide enough light - even in a pitch black room . From yet another functional angle , I 've found that the only reason I use a laptop in a dark room is because I need the room to be dark -LRB- for watching movies , or not disturbing someone 's sleep -RRB- . Unfortunately , this LED light is bright enough to disturb the people next to you.Overall , I find this USB LED Light awkward to carry and use . It 's a waste of a USB port .
 I ordered this clock on the 21st of Dec , prior to Christmas , and paid for 3 day shipping . The ad said order by this date to get your product before Christmas . Well , when I got my confirmation email it said `` Shipping Method

 My 12 year old daughter is a very small framed girl , this ` jr ' sized release is too small . I can not imagine anyone smaller capable of shooting a bow . Its just OK , adjustable it is but it just does n't feel up to the , even inexpensive as it was , quality I expected .

 These darts look great , but flights are very poor quality . They fall of the shafts and then do not go back on . One of the shafts broke within the first few throws of the dart . Not very useful if they do not work .
 After 6 months of usage this pump quit working . This pump is mounted in the bilge of my boat which gets wet/moisture with saltwater but not `` in water '' ... and I have other equipment and pumps in there that have lasted 8 + years . In addition , the body of the pump is beginning to rust . OK ... I did some trouble shooting and discovered the '' + '' lead inside the pressure switch -LRB- see blue cover from the product image -RRB- had corroded and broke . The cover for the switch was not sealed as well as it should have been and allowed moisture to enter . No dielectric grease was utilized for the connections and they were severely corroded . I corrected the problems by utilizing better connectors and silicone dielectric grease and returned the pump to service . I also notice the wire quality was poor ... although it was tinned.The pump performs well but should have never had this problem . The manufacturer should know this and in my opinion did not follow best practices at the time of assembly . If you buy one of these pumps be proactive about this area , -LRB- of the pump -RRB- prior to installation ... especially if the installation is inside the bilge . If you have a boat you 'll understand.The original shurflow pump lasted 8 years .

 Watch out , this dessert has trans-fat in it . I have n't eaten it , so ca n't comment on the meal itself . I grabbed it off the shelf , thinking it sounded good , but then realized yikes , it has trans-fat . Why do companies still use that stuff ?

 I love the Harbinger products , been using Harbinger gloves for years , the belts are great . However , these hooks are no good . Threw them away after a couple of uses . I all fairness , I 've tried other lifting hooks , and none help me with the heavy weights .
 DO NOT BUY THESE . I had not used the lifting hooks for over a week before the material covering the hooks started to tear apart . It wo n't be long before it rips through leaving the hook bare and exposed . Apparently Harbinger does not care about this issue as there have been many bad reviews about it over the years . I had read warnings about them on other web sites not to buy them because of this issue . Since the articles dated back a few years , I thought the company would have taken notice and redesigned the hooks so the bare thread would no longer be an issue . DO NOT BUY THESE . Caveat emptor.Lifting Hooks
 To begin the hooks are awful , they feel awkward and easily slip off the bar , then the material holding the hooks in place ripped which left me with no hook at all rendering them entirely useless . I had them for no longer than one month dont waste your money
 These hooks are dangerous , , I lift heavy and they slip off the bar I had it happen several times I ended up throwing them away .
 I 've used these for about a year . I use them for lat pulldowns because I have a weak grip.They are better than nothing , but not that great . The reason they are n't that great is that the hook is a very shallow J shape - more like a cross between an L shape and a J shape . Therefore , when I use them , I 'm always scared that the bar is going to slip off the hook . During my last work out the bar actually * did * slip off the hook , causing the weights to unceremoniously crash to the ground.Thus , I do n't have confidence when pulling and I ca n't pull to failure because the bar keeps sliding off the hook.Also , the cloth covering the hook has torn off , exposing the metal hook.I 'm going to try Versa Gripps Classic Series Weight Lifting Grips . We 'll see how those work .
 These things are only good if you 're trying to hold something that 's just a little too heavy for you . The hooks slip off if you attempt to put real wieght on them . I shrug 540 lbs and wanted something easier than straps , but these simply wo n't cut it . The design is bad ... Plus they simply do n't work for many excercises like inverted lat pull downs ... I ended up just giving them away after the first night I tried them ... terrible
 This product is not what it seems to be ! I 'm referring to the fact that these lifting hooks do not support the weight for very long . Once strapped and weight is in hand , the user is able to do a few reps of whatever exercise until the bar starts to slip from your hands as well as the hooks.I 'm my opinion , the overall comfort is great . But the usefulness is almost none existent .
 I used these for two workouts . I used them for deadlifts and dumbbell shrugs . They worked ok with deadlifts , but as soon as I used them for my shrugs I found out how poorly these designs these hooks are . These hooks could not support 85 lb dumbbells for me to complete my workout and actually fell out of the hook almost smashing my foot ! After that I knew I had to get my money back for these . I just got some regular Harbinger lifting straps instead and they work so much better ! Now I am much more confident lifting heavier weights , allowing me to progress much faster .
 The install instruction states that the grip needs to be `` GLUED `` to the handle bar . I do n't want to glue it to my carbon handle bar , so I used water as lubricant . After 24 hours , I can still twist the grip . It feels very insecure.I ordered the 22.2 mm one , which turns out to be too big . -LRB- I wear large gloves -RRB- .
 I like the way they look . They went on easily by using zip ties . However , after riding once for about 15 minutes , they became very uncomfortable . The grip is horrible and hard on your hands . In order to get my original grips off my bike , I had to cut them and I wish I would have kept them instead .

 This seller has failed to contact me and my stuff has not been received 2 weeks after it was supposed to be here . Do Not Buy From Them
 I ordered two Eastbay shorts and was dissapointed when they arrived to see that they had a snug fit , not the loose , hanging fit depicted in the online catalogue . I returned the merchandise -LRB- $ 19.98 value -RRB- using the pre-paid shipping label provided , realizing I forfeited my $ 8.98 shipping charges , but believing the return shipping to be `` free . '' Upon receiving my credit card statement , I noted that Eastbay retained an additional $ 6.50 for a `` restocking fee . '' So , I ended up spending $ 15.48 for two pairs of shorts that I did not indeed keep . Hmmm , so much for a great deal at a mere $ 9.99 each ! That will be an end to my online shopping through Amazon or Eastbay for apparel .
 Material is very stiff and irritates the rist . Old school cotton is the way to go .
 I do n't understand the good reviews , either you are lifting very light weights that do not require straps or you really have no clue .1 -RRB- These carries some rubber coating on the webbing which if used they will rub against your wrist and they will give you bruises .2 -RRB- These are thicker than the standard harbinger and do need more adjustment than the regular webbing which offers a better value , thinner and more manageable straps it has also some neoprene around the wrist for padding .3 -RRB- These are shorter than the regular harbingerYou ca n't go beyond 3 plates with these with comfort just forget about it and look elsewhere .
 These straps might be OK in theory -LRB- wide , gripping material sewn in -RRB- , but they 're so stiff they immediately cut into my wrists under any load whatsoever . Also , since I pretty much sweat all over while at the gym -LRB- including my hands and palms -RRB- , this material became even more difficult to hold onto lift after lift . I guess the gripping material provides more friction against the bar than other straps I 've used , but what good is that when the straps slip against your fingers?Save your money & look elsewhere . I 'm currently using Schiek Sports Schiek Lifting Strap Dowel 1000 , which I 'm much happier with . Nice material , no slipping .
 I bought these based on some of the good reviews and ratings , but after using them , the negative reviews were probably more on target than the positive ones . Whether you are a novice or a veteran workout buff , you will find that the basic harbinger or valeo straps will deliver a nice grip without the cumbersome adjusting and higher price tag . You wo n't get a better grip with these straps , just more inconvinience and loss of workout time trying to adjust to them . Keep the straps simple ; stick to the basics .
 I bought Harbinger 20600 after reading all the reviews but still not being able to discern which were honest authentic reviews . So after three months of use they simply are not as comfortable as the classic cotton . Yes , the classic cotton fray and wear out after three years but they are comfortable and easily conform to the wrist .
 I 've been weightlifting for years , using wraps on my heavy deadlift sets and I never had a problem with wraps ... until I bought these . In one month , I lost my grip doing heavy sets , the latest literally slamming me to the ground , hitting my head . The problem with these wraps are their design . The rubber , which grips the bar does a great job , but the fabric is too thick and extremely slippery on the hand . It 's extremely difficult to get a firm grip . In the 2 instances where I completely lost my grip , my hands slipped off the material , but the rubber gripped to the bar , throwing me forward . Unable to get my hands loose , I could n't catch myself before hitting the ground . I have tried getting as much of my hand on the metal part of the bar as possible to avoid slipping , but the fabric is so thick , it 's still hard to wrap the part of your hand that is in contact with the wrap . I even tried coating the wraps with pine tar ! It helped a little , but again , with the material being thick , you still do n't get a firm grip . Being 6 ' 2 , my hands are reasonably big . This should n't happen . After my second fall , I was so disgusted that I borrowed some basic cotton wraps and was amazed at how much better my grip was . Do yourself a favor , save the few extra dollars and buy a good set of cotton wraps . They are far superior and you save money . I ca n't believe Harbinger still makes these .
 I have been using lifting straps for a few years and these are the worst I 've seen . The material is rubber and really great . However , the strap is way too rigid and makes keeping it on your wrist a tough thing to do . I had to eat these because they are too much work . If you really want a great strap , get these -LSB- . . -RSB-
 I 've used Harbinger 's padded cotton straps happily for several years . When it came time to replace them , I decided to `` upgrade '' to the padded non-slip model . These simply do not work.In a typical strap , there is enough slip between the strap and the bar so that you can use your wrist to `` ratchet '' the strap tightly against the bar . Once the load is applied , friction in the strap fabric prevents the wrap from coming loose . It actually gets tighter as the set progresses.The Harbinger Big Grip Non-Slip Lifting Strap inverts this design . The strap is made from tightly-woven nylon , with grippy rubber woven into the side of the strap that faces the bar . The rubber surface is so grippy that it 's impossible to tighten the strap against the bar . When the load is applied , the nylon material is too slick and plastic-y to keep the wrap from slipping . You start with a loose wrap , and it gets even looser as the set progresses.Skip these -- a generic cotton strap is more effective . Embarrassing for Harbinger .
 These wrist wraps were a disappointment . I usually just borrow plain cloth ones at the gym where I go or just wear gloves and use over/under grip , but I figured that I might as well get my own set.I used them for the first time yesterday for a back workout , lifting -LRB- or pulling -RRB- 250 + lbs , and they were very uncomfortable . The adjustment takes forever , getting them tight around the bar is inconvenient , and worst of all the material is rough , which left me with 2 pretty bruised up wrists .
 World Standard Fitness has been producing a padded rubberized strap for about 6 or 7 years now . They actually received a Canadian and U.S. patent on the rubberized lifting strap a few years ago . I even saw pictures of Phil Heath using them in the Nov. 2006 edition of Flex magazine . I read more about this company , the rubberized lifting strap , and its patents at its dot com website . btw , the rubberized lifting straps work brilliantly when you wrap them with the rubber side towards the hand , not the bar , as per the instructions that WSF give with their straps .
 I purchased the chair for my son and had it delivered to him at camp . I just got word from him that the chair broke on the first use .
 this watch came without a box or paperwork . It did not work . I took it to a jewleler and he replaced the battery and said it was missing the rubber gasket which keeps it waterproof . I could not get a replacement gasket from Nike . The watch now keeps time with the new battery but it is not waterproof as advertised .
 stopped working in under a year -LRB- no output -RRB- . My xantrex charger lasted over 10 years , and I found a new 30A model for $ 85

 Do you know what is 12 inches regarding this ball?That 's how high it bounces when you slam it to the ground pissed off that it is actually 8 inches!Lying scummy dishonest seller . -LRB- plus it 's about as cheap a ball as you can find ... -RRB-
 Our daughter wanted a beach ball from Santa last month , so Santa ordered these beach balls , so he thought . First of all , the advertising for this `` beach ball '' is misleading . The picture shows lots of beach balls , 5 of them to be exact . Well , my fault for not reading closely , but I was in a hurry comparing beach balls and seen the picture , clicked on it thinking I just bought 5 beach balls and got one . My fault . Secondly , the beach ball was supposed to be 12 '' . Well , it was more like 8 '' . Thirdly , there was no check valve on the air valve . You know how most inflatable things allow you to blow air in and it holds the air in so it wo n't blow back out when you remove your mouth from the valve . This did not so it was IMPOSSIBLE to get the ball fully inflated because it was so small . SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!
 Does n't hold air for very long ... but I guess that 's part of the fun for my kids .
 This is not a 12in ball and it is about 10in . It is hard to blow air and seal it . This is not a quality product and it is a waste of money .
 This ball is more like 7 inches in diameter . It is near impossible to inflate because the air rushes back out before you can seal it . It does n't matter , because it wo n't stay inflated anyway .

 If I knew that it was an iron on decal I wold not have bought this . Already peeling off . Disapponted
 I was very disapointed with these tires as the studs wear down very quickly . I have been using these tires for approx . 2 months , mainly in snowy conditions . The studs have worn down so considerably that I do not expect them to survive the winter . Very disapointing .

I returned the merchandise -LRB- $ 19.98 value -RRB- using the pre-paid shipping label provided , realizing I forfeited my $ 8.98 shipping charges , but believing the return shipping to be `` free . '' Upon receiving my credit card statement , I noted that Eastbay retained an additional $ 6.50 for a `` restocking fee . '' So , I ended up spending $ 15.48 for two pairs of shorts that I did not indeed keep . Hmmm , so much for a great deal at a mere $ 9.99 each ! That will be an end to my online shopping through Amazon or Eastbay for apparel .
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .

 The watch itself is very nice but it appears to be blue when you look at it online . The watch is not blue until you get it under certain light . It is actually irridescent and not as appealing as it looks online .
 These have a seem and when ran though a gun , brake in half.They then break parts . Always buy .20

 I ordered this to be shipped to grandma 's house for a recent visit , when our 4-y-o would n't have a bed . She 'd gotten him a sleeping bag , and we thought this would be good padding below it on the floor so he 'd be comfortable.It turned out that when inflated , this was actually too small to be comfortable for him to sleep on , signficiantly smaller than the sleeping bag , and so `` poofy '' once it plumps up that he would have just rolled off of it . Because it did n't meet our needs , I returned it.It was , however , apparently well constructed , had a valve that operated easily to allow you to roll it up / roll the air out of it and keep it compressed , and when compressed took up a very small amount of storage . Came with a patch kit and a set of velcro straps that hold it rolled up and provide a handle . If it had been just a bit bigger , and maybe had a few more `` quilting '' points to keep it from being so pillowy , it would have been perfect .

 I was shocked that after my husband blew this up , a sticker stating that it contained a materials that causes cancer and reproductive issues became visible . We were going to let my 1-year old play with it but threw it away immediately . I know it was made in Taiwan , but really , a beach ball that children will play with ? Waste of money and scary to think of the material decomposing in the sun . DO NOT GIVE THIS TO YOUR CHILDREN . Are there any regulations ? There are many inflatable objects that do n't contain this type of carcinogen . Would have appreciated knowing this so I did n't purchase . Too much of a hassle to return . Wonder what my husband ingested blowing it up . Buy at your own risk but please do n't expose your children to it .
 was not correct size as advertised was only about 36 inches not 48 as ad stated i would not buy this item again
 Not a 48 '' ball , more like 30 '' . Do n't buy it if you want a 48 '' ball . I plan on sending back .
 I bought this carrier , and before I could even use it , one of the ratchet straps fell off . I returned it to Amazon for a new one . On the replacement carrier one of the straps was not even attached when I opened the box . So all in all I have had two of these and not been able to use either one even one time . Perhaps I was just unlucky , but I would not recommend this product to anyone . It is poorly constructed with rivets that do n't hold the straps on , so I would be wary of even using this thing with a bike , since the straps ca n't remain attached when they are not under load . At least Amazon is good about returns , but even so my experience with this item is you will be out the high cost of a really low quality item for as long as it takes to receive a refund and be making a few trips to the UPS Store .

 Just for your info , the seller Do It Sports did not send me this bag but the other model which I would never even consider buying . It created just hassle for me because I needed to resend the item back and bag the Amazon and seller to bear the shipping costs .
 Purchased this product about 6 months ago and only issue with product is that I have to continue to pump the ball up for each practice . It does n't hold air very well at all .
 You are showing it with a handle and there is none . It is made good but it is not like in the picture .

 This was not for me , the movements were too slow and I was bored w/in 10 minutes of putting the dvd in the player .
 Deante DanceThis the most boring dance DVD I have ever done . The moves are repetitive and I ca n't see how they can possibly be effective . The music is light jazz which I am not fond of and it does n't encourage one to get up and move . After doing one of the sessions and watching most of the others I threw this DVD away . -LRB- Yes , it 's that bad -RRB- . Try Yoga Booty Ballet instead .
 Why oh why , when I plugged in Urban Rebounding CD did I wind up with a DANCE CD ? because the author is JB Berns ? Why is it labeled REBOUNDER when you do n't even use a rebounder ? It 's dance moves ; very misleading . PS/SO - I ordered Urban Rebounding System Compilation # 1 ... but that 's not a workout either so why the description includes COMPILATION ? It is confusing because it 's just an introduction to moves and a warmup . So I 'm on to finding the correct description of a CD that will give me a basic workout on a trampoline .
 I bought this light at a local bike shop . Initially , I was very happy with it . It does a good job of projecting light at night . However , a month after buying it , and with average use -LRB- 2-3 times a week -RRB- , the switch to turn the light on and off has broken.Now that I have used this light for a while , I think there are much better lights out there to buy and would look elsewhere for another light to fit your needs .

 The steering stopped working after one month . There is a one year warranty on the bike , so they will send a replacement . But they have been around for a while now . So are the parts just going to keep dying ? Why have n't they fixed this problem yet ? I bought two bikes , and both of the steerings died after one month.Besides this , the tension on the bike is very low . It is very easy to peddle on the hardest setting . It 's too weak .

 Had FogDog actually sent me these high altitude balls , I 'm sure that they would be fine . However , they did n't have them in stock , so sent me regular balls . Not sure why FogDog thought that it would OK to knowingly send me the wrong product . If I did n't need high altitude balls , I would n't have ordered them . I can not recommend ordering anything from FogDog .

 This light is nice because it is small and light weight . It gives off enough light to get you noticed by other cars on the road . It 's not intended to light your path.What I do n't like about this light is the strap . It is somewhat difficult to attach to your bike . If it is n't on just right , the light will fall off and there is no alternate way to attach it .
 I 'm not an intense cyclist - commuter bicyclist . The light worked well , but after one week of use , the guts flew out of the case when I hit a not so big bump on a paved street . I was able to find only one battery the next morning , so ca n't verify quality of design , but it should have been able to resist a relatively minor jolt without falling apart .
 I mean that literally . I live in an older part of town , some of the streets are pretty rough , uneven , bumpy , potholes , etc. . First day I used this light I ran over a rough patch in the road and the light just blew apart . There was a lot of traffic so I did n't stop to try to gather all the pieces . In praise of Amazon I returned the parts I had left and Amazon refunded my money . Do yourself a favor and spend about $ 5 more . I now use a Planetbike beamer3 , read the reviews about this light . Everything they wright about how good it is are true.Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mount
 It 's easy to put on and pull off -LRB- although sometimes TOO easy to pull off -- it can come off if you brush against it -RRB- . It will get you seen . My main complaint is that one of the led 's soon stopped working and now its even less effective . If I could redo it , I would just buy a more powerful model .

 They were selling this on sale , probably below cost . I do n't know the reason for the price I tried to purchase it at , but that 's not an issue for me . Instead of shipping me this case of balls at the agreed upon price , they welshed , canceling the order . Not a very gentlemanly thing to do . I was counting on them when they were expected to be shippep.Otherwise , these balls are way over-priced . You 'd have to be insanely desperate for a case of balls or utterly devoid of intelligence to purchase these at the regular price offered here .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .

 Yes it is true , the unit will not automatically turn on when the wheel starts spinning.So therefore , you go out on a trip and forget to push the button to turn it on and lose the mileage for your tripThis a fatal flaw I do n't think any bike computer acts this way.I wasted my money on this piece of junk .
 I was really looking forward to this device , as its big enough for my middle age eyes to read , and it looked like it had nearly all the functions I was looking for . However , I do n't know what the designers were thinking , maybe they were n't ... First , the mounting mechanism WILL fall apart . One would hope that you would only have to deal with this once , but alas not . It is another bike crazy super lightweight approach , that has no rigidity . I have it mounted on my road bike , and it has fallen off several times . I finally fashioned my own mount , and it does n't fall off anymore . But the mount is junk.Second , and more importantly , the buttons and button combos simply do NOT work . I have NEVER been able to set the wheel diameter . Resetting the mileage and elapsed time is a crapshoot at best , and doing anything else simply has never worked correctly . There are plenty of examples of multi function buttons working , but this device is not one of them.Finally , the directions are absolutely terrible ... no make that horrible . I 'm an engineer , and can usually figure out most things , but the directions are simply mind boggling . There are arrows and flow charts and button combos that lead nowhere , and in most cases do nothing.All in all , this design is a failure in nearly all respects except the basic concept . Unfortunately , this has been my experience with all the Topeak products I 've bought . I will look elsewhere from now on

 The main odometer worked , and the current speed , but none of the other screens worked . I did get customer service once after several tries ; someone very knowledgeable helped me get the screens unlocked . But then every time I pressed the button to go to another screen , it would go for about a second and then go right back to the first screen . I kept pressing the button while on other screens to set them and then losing my main odometer mileage reading back to zero . I called and left messages . There are several choices of tech help voicemail boxes to call and leave messages . I tried all . I finally reached someone who said he would find out about my problem and call back . He did n't . I called and left more messages , even saying I had seen reviews on Amazon that said that Topeak 's customer service was good . I was pleasant in my messages . Still no callback . This was last October , mostly . I since bought a different device but have n't installed it yet - too cold out there for me !
 I read the reviews that mentioned difficulty in installing . They were correct . The directions are so small they are all but impossible to read . Going to the WEB and using a PDF file was the only way to read the directions . Once mounted my experience was exactly as the other reviewer . Will only provide information on the one screen . Will not switch to any other screen . Will not reset the odometer . Very disappointed . Do not waste your money .

 If you 're used to the sturdy equipment available at most half-way decent gyms , you 'll be sorely disappointed with anything from this line of products . Though it 's relatively affordable , its wobbly , rickety construction makes you worry more about the stability of the equipment rather than concentrate on your own workout . You get what you pay for , I guess .

 The cap gets a few stars for looks but the plastic is not durable at all and the first time it dropped from my backpack it broke -LRB- compared to my Nalgene bottle that 's been dropped thousands of times and never breaks -RRB- . If you are going to get the bottle , I recommend getting the bottle bandit to help you hold the bottle on or get the screw top instead which looks more durable.Plus , if it does break , you have to spend about $ 2 + a lot more for shipping to replace it .
 This is just the cap to go over a sport top . The product description is misleading - there is no screw top , there is nothing to drink from . This cap snaps onto a diferent bottle top . If you are looking for a sport-top , pick a different item .
 I wish Sigg would make a better cap for their water bottles . My kids have broken 4 of them in the past 6 months just by dropping them . I do n't want to buy new water bottles for them , but I really hate these caps - such a waste of plastic from a company who tries to be eco-friendly .
 Very annoyed ... I looked through several other listings before choosing this one because it sounded like it included the piece you screw onto the bottle -- it does n't !
 I bought this because I thought it was a sports cap . Instead , it 's somehow a cap to the cap - completely useless , as there was no way I was able to determine how to use it as a replacement for my other sports cap . Again , DIRECTIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL !!!

 i bought this marker for my friend , we bought markers at the same time and he liked this one . i looked it up and found that it was a good gun for beginners . but i have to say i am very dissapopinted in this purchace . the gun arrived defective , leaking CO2 from every possible area it could . also as i had been expecting from the reviues the feedneck they provide is cheep and split in half within two days of use , thankfully i always have ducktape ready . the oil bottle that came with the gun was broken and leaking all over the inside of tha package and the mask that was provided was terrible , the lense fogged up quickly and it scratched very easily ... imy friend had to buy a new mask . the gun also shoots terribly , it is ok if you want to shoot 1-2 paintballs a second , but if you try shooting any faster than that the gin will start to chop paintballs like no other , infact you can not even shoot half a hopper before the gun is completely jammed . this problem is also a caused because the gun is an autococker so when the blow back of CO2 occures a gust of gas is shot up the feed neck into the hopper causing the paintballs to become chilled and very brittle . i really would not recommed this gun for anybody who wants to play close range and shoot at a higher BPS . if however you are more of a sniper this gun may suit you , the velocity can be turned way up and the guns pretty accurate , and since you would be sniping you would only be shooting one paintball at a time anyway . i dont recomend the seller however , the packaging was terrible -LRB- no protective wrap everything was simply tossed into the box -RRB- it arrived 10 days after they originaly said it would arrive -LRB- the date kept getting bumped back -RRB- and getting any usefull help from customer service is a joke .

 I was excited to try out Nikon 's bullet drop reticle -LRB- the reason I bought this scope -RRB- when I received the scope I was disappointed to find out it was just the plain Nikoplex . The description specifically says it has the BDC reticle . This is not the case . Amazon could not exchange the wrong scope , so I was stuck with just a refund . Ordering straight from Nikon now .

 you put it in the water . Worked for about 30 seconds after that . Water gets into the battery compartment fairly easily . Save your money on this one .
 The description of the product on Amazon is the Precept Lady S III Pearl Series . They did not send me pearl series but the regular Lady S III .

 This bat case is flimsy and unsecure . Very poor quality - bot not nearly as bad as the company it came from ! Worst company that I have ever dealt with on amazon and I will never , ever purchase from them again.It was shipped to me in a brown shipping box . When I opened the box , the case was simply shrink-wrapped inside the shipping box . When I tried to put a bat in the case , it would n't stay secure and the edges of the case would not stay shut . I requested a return , was given a return label , reboxed the case , and then paid $ 12 to ship the case back . A few days later , I got an email from this company stating that they would n't credit me because the case was n't returned in it 's `` original box '' . I made several attempts to explain that the case was n't shipped to me in a box besides the shipping box - it was only shrink-wrapped . The company would n't believe me and insisted that it was in some `` manufacturer box '' which I can only assume should have looked like the one in the above picture . The black end-pieces on the bat case had little pieces that stuck out on each side - presumably to attach the case to the wall if you so wish . So , with these sticking out , I 'm not quite sure how the case I received would fit in an `` inner box '' anyway . We exchanged several emails back and forth and I finally stated that I was giving up - they can keep my money , but at least send me the crappy case back . However , they are not responding to my email so I do n't expect that I will get the case back . I see no reason why they should keep my money and the case!Needless to say I am way less than thrilled with the whole experience of dealing with this company . Never again .
 JUST got home to my purchase . Sealed and all . But upon opening the safe itself . The grey plastic money tray is broken in the upper left hand corner . I hope customer care can resolve this PROBLEM . And I hope this is n't a habit of sentry safe . Many people trust that you will deliver their purchases IN TACT . I 'd like a replacement . I 'd happily rewrite my review upon a resolution .
 Way too heavy for my elderly mother to carry . Returning it would cost me around $ 9 so it 's not worth it . I guess we 're stuck with it now or I will have to sell it myself on ebay or something . If you have Rheumatoid Arthritis and have a hard time carrying things , this product will be a waste of money .
 I received the wrong item and have no idea what to do so that I could receive the one I want ... . So pretty much I got a combination lock , rather than a sentry safe large cash box -_-
 The box itself is great . however the key/lock mechanism is unbelievably cheap . it took my friend only a minute to pick it with a paper clip .
 I do n't really like this safe it dosent look very protective it is a large metal box with a small lock that could be breaken into easily and is not fireproof

 This product does not fit Bladerunner Blades pre 1998 and is actually labeled ROLLERBLADE ... NOT Bladerunner . Especially if you use BladeRunner Discovery Skates this will not fit . You need one with the hole on the side of the brake and not the top .
 I was in love with the first game so I thought the second would be the perfect next step . I have never been more wrong.I 'm not a particularly fit or active person and I still find that these workouts are simple and boring . My set workouts do n't even take 10 minutes , and I ca n't find a way to extend the workout duration . That < 10 minutes even includes extra time while the game forces you to watch your `` trainer '' display terribly cheesy facial expressions and encouraging gestures . After EVERY exercise . Rather than encouraging me to keep working out , it frequently encourages me to pick a different method of exercising.This was a huge disappointment . It might as well have been marketed under a different title completely , because it was barely comparable to the first at all , let alone being a satisfying upgrade .
 For the most part this video is easy , but I found it too slow . It is definitely not aerobic . There is too much time between each exercise while the instructor is moving from one exercise to another and then the reps are pretty slow as well . It works some muscle groups well , but it is not at all what I expected & there are definitely too few different exercises . I can not do push-ups and it is difficult to get the game to skip this exercise . I will use it , but not as often as others I already had .
 Overall I do n't think this is a good use of your money . I found the workouts to lack everything , honestly . They were n't very hard , i do n't even break a sweat unless I do one of the challenges . So if you just want to do challenges , then pick this game but there are a lot better wii exercise games out there than this one .
 I am used to Wii Active that goes from on exercise to the other . This one was a little slow and the work outs are too short to be of any realy benefit .
 My Fitness Coach 2 is n't as good as the first one . Although they have incorporated the wii balance board in this one , the first one is still the best one if you want to keep track of how many calories you burn and choose wich part of the body you want to work out . also the first one keeps steady track of how much work out time you have left this one does not .
 I bought this game thinking that it would be an extension of the first , with new exercises and tips , but found that is entirely a new game altogether . I love the original game because it does not require me to use controllers , this one does and it does not register your movements as quickly as it needs to . I plan on keeping the game , and will use it occasionally to add variety to my routine ; but would not recommend it as a primary fitness game .
 If you liked the original stay as far away from this one as possible . The developers removed all the positive aspects of the original My Fitness Coach and replaced it with flashier graphics and less quality workouts.Aspects of My Fitness Coach 1 not included in My Fitness Coach 2
 I was so excited about the new My Fitness Coach 2 , and braved snowy roads to purchase mine today . What a huge dissapointment ! First of all , I paid almost $ 30 for it at Walmart , so I really had high expectations . I got home , read the instruction manual and created my profile , easy enough , a few questions and weight . -LRB- It does incorporate the Wii balance board -RRB- . I did my first * workout * , it only took about 15 minutes and included 8 super easy excercizes . Never even broke a sweat or breathed hard ! There is alot of lag time between excersizes , you take a look at your progess , feedback , etc. . Each of the excersizes used the Wii remote and some incorporated the balance board . The pace was so slow , the number excersizes and reps so few , I think only those who hadnt got off of the couch in years would be challenged . Im a 52 year old , overweight female , only excersize occasionally , and My Fitness Coach 2 was a total breeze . I have used the original My Fitness Coach for a year now , and it is far superior . My Fitness Coach 2 does contain a nutrition section , that I did look at , but didnt see anything I didnt already know.Update
 I 've updated my review after a 2nd workout - see below.I am fairly new to Wii exercising , and had read so many great reviews on My Fitness Coach -LRB- the original -RRB- . I decided to hold out for the 2nd version to get the latest and greatest . I put the game into the console for the first time yesterday , and was very pleased to find there were 25 DIFFERENT `` goals '' within the set-up menu for my profile . I figured this was going to be super-sophisticated and give me exactly what I needed . I set up my profile with my two goals of `` Weight Loss '' and `` Heart Health '' , thinking I 'd get a lot of heart-pounding cardio with a little bit of toning . The workout began , with no indication of how long it was going to be . It gave me a fancy , dazzling graphical list of the exercises , where each one flipped over -LRB- animated -RRB- named the exercise plus the number of reps or duration -LRB- such as 3-minutes -RRB- . But nowhere could I tell how long the full workout was - unless I could mentally add up each exercise as it flipped by , and guess how long 12-reps of something would take.Anyhow , the workout consisted of ten exercises . Two of them were push-up based , one twisted into alternating T-stands after each push-up ; and the other had me lift alternate legs after each push-up . If I had put `` Upper Body Strength '' into my profile as a goal , I could understand the selection of these exercises as a full 1/5 of the 10 exercises given to me ; but certainly was n't expecting them in my `` Weight Loss '' and `` Heart Health '' routine . I couldn not even finish them because the balance board was not registering my movements properly , and the game kept asking me if I was `` having trouble '' . Finally , it gave me the option to skip these exercises , so I got to actually DO eight of the ten exercises in my routine . The routine itself -LRB- minus all the tutorials -RRB- was probably only 20 minutes long . It was definitely not anything that would make me think I would either lose weight doing it , or improve the health of my heart . Perhaps , if I could stick with the game , the workouts would improve . But for my limited exercise time , I doubt I will waste time trying.The other frustrating things were the extremely LONG time it took to score my performance after each exercise . I had to wait while flashing bars and various percentages and scores counted their way up to my overal performance level on that one exercise . Eventually , the evaluation screen rewarded me w / a certain score -LRB- like 89 % -RRB- and a certain color medal -LRB- like Silver or Gold -RRB- . Sure , I could skip that section by pressing the A-button , but it was another distraction I did n't need when trying to `` exercise '' rather than be `` mesmerized '' by the graphics . It seemed like it was geared towards providing instant feedback , but instead it just broke the flow of the workout . They could have just as effectively put all of this information at the end of the workout if you were curious about your `` timing '' or `` effort '' or `` balance '' on one specific exercise.Then , my virtual trainer offered me the same `` encouragement '' phrases over and over and over again . `` Way to go '' , `` You 're looking strong on this one '' , `` Keep it up '' , `` You make this look easy '' . There were also occasional helpful tips thrown in like `` Try to hold your arms steady when you lift your leg '' , which made me think the programming had some degree of sophistication to match the comments w / the exercises ; however most of the chatter was inane and repetitive . Then at the end of EACH exercise , I got a camera shot of the trainer raising his thumb up and saying what a great job I 'd done ; but his LIPS did n't move ! He just stood in front of the camera and smiled , while his voice said I was doing so well . That was really weird , since the trainers look almost like living actors , and you 'd think they could have at least had their mouth move to speak these words of praise.I spent a lot of time after the workout trying to find some what to turn OFF those inane words of encouragement and just keep the helpful tips , but there is no way I could find in the menu to do that . All I found was a way to adjust the trainer 's voice volume . And that took me a while to figure out , due to the style and layout of the menus.The menus in My Fitness Coach 2 are flashy and exciting - lots of eye-candy . They are Apple Computer/I-Pod Touch-like in form - lots of flipping square images and zooming graphics . But it 's slow to navigate and was n't intuitive to remember how to find an express workout , etc. . The extra workouts provided are OK , but still repetitive each time you do them ; so the boredom factor will set in quickly , I 'm afraid.All together , this was the biggest disappointment of all the Wii exercise games I have purchased so far -LRB- EA Sports Active , EA SA More Workouts , WiiFit Plus , Biggest Loser , Gold 's Cardio -RRB- . I will be trading `` My Fitness Coach 2 '' to GameStop and will replace it with the original `` My Fitness Coach '' game to get all the features I had hoped this one would improve upon . In this case , I think a downgrade to the old game will actually be an upgrade in quality of exercising.Update
 I was very disappointed in the game . I really like my fitness coach -LRB- 1 -RRB- you really get a work out . There are no pauses in the game like my fitness coach 2 . Granted they have 4 different trainers you can chose from but they will show you one move you conduct that move then you wait till you get the next instructions . I really did n't like this because you really do n't get a work out . If you want a good work out I suggest my fitness coach -LRB- the first version -RRB-
 As some reviewers have noted , My Fitness Coach 2 has absolutely nothing in common with My Fitness Coach other than the name . Here 's why.The original My Fitness Coach was developed by a company called Respondesign -LRB- who had created the original version , called Yourself!Fitness for the Playstation 2 -RRB- . It was a runaway hit on the Wii . Granted , it was little more than a glorified exercise video -LRB- the exercises consisted mainly of calisthenics , with no usage of the Wii 's unique controllers -RRB- . But you could definitely get a great cardio workout from it.In the meantime , in the UK , there was another completely different fitness game called NewU Fitness First
 I LOVED MFC1 and actually lost 50 pounds using it and counting calories . I could n't wait to buy the new version , and I ca n't believe how bad it is . I used it once and I will never use it again . The graphics are cheesy , and the work outs are pathetic . It 's like that took everything that was wrong with WiiFit -LRB- original -RRB- and copied it !
 I have several workout games for the Wii and this has to be the worst . It does n't register half the moves , so im working out twice as hard and getting no credit . The workouts are very short and simple ... I started with the `` moderately active '' and even went to the next level , still , very short , easy moves . I wanted a game that used my hand weights and ball , like the images on here shows , this game does not use them . As a vegetarian , the nutrition menu is useless . I really should just join a gym , I keep hoping Ill find a `` game '' that does n't require that , but alas , it seems inevitable !
 I thought this would be an actual upgrade from the original My Fitness Coach w/new exercises music , landscapes , etc. . Instead , it 's an entirely new game and nothing I would have ever purchased . Lousy ! I work out regularly and give this game Two thumbs down . Back to using My Fitness Coach original .
 not that many exercises in it , prefer the Wii Fitbut good for recipes , not what i bought it for !
 The overall idea of the game is good . But Very poor interaction with the wii fit board and controller . Contacted their tech support . They have to be one of the worst out there . The directed me to read three different forums , one being their own , none had any titles for the product!It alternates between your two goals you pick . The general progression is good it will back off when you flatten out and then step it up again when you progress . Also , it does have some good ideas for meals .
 I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this . Luckily , it was a Lightning Deal , so I did n't pay full price . Just as other reviewers have said , this is a terrible workout game . The trainers are cheesy -LRB- giving you big thumbs up or looking frustrated if you do n't perform well -RRB- and the time between the exercises is such that you lose any momentum/heart rate you had going . I 'm going back to Maya and the original version ASAP .
 If you loved the original My Fitness Coach and were hoping for more of the same , forget it . My Fitness Coach 2 is a major letdown . There 's no fitness test to get you started and have the game tailor exercise routines for you . The exercises are only about 15 minutes and way too easy . There 's no yoga . You do n't even enter your weight to see any progress . I have been using the original version for years and was so excited that this new one was coming out . Very disappointing and not worth a penny . The old My Fitness Coach is so much better and suits me just fine !
 I am a fit person who goes to the gym 3-4 times per week , runs , and cycles . I bought the original My Fitness Coach a year ago and love it so much I have completed 90 workouts even though I honestly do n't even like to work out at home . I like it so much that my own dedication to it has been a pleasant surprise for me . I was so looking forward to My Fitness Coach 2 that I bought it before there were even any reviews for it . I 'll never do that again . What a waste of money . It 's horrible ! I 've used it a few times to see if I could find any redeeming qualities and there really are n't any . I agree with all the bad things the other reviewers have said and wo n't bother repeating what 's already been said other than it really is all flash and no substance . The workouts are so short and slow moving that I did n't feel I got anything from them at all . It was a total waste of my time . I 'd be surprised if anybody at Ubisoft actually tried it before they brought it to market . Stick with the original My Fitness Coach for a cardio workout or EA Sports Active for toning .
 I also pre-ordered this expecting this to be a more improved version of the MFC1 . I really had high hopes for this game but got nothing but disappointment and anger knowing I spent $ 30 on this . It is nothing like the first version . As Antoine meriweather from Men on Film from In living color would say ... '' `` HATED IT '' This is nothing like the first version . They have corny human trainers that give you a creepy thumbs up when the exercise is finished . Nothing is cohesive , its very broken up with rocky transitions btw exercises . Too much time btw exercises . I do n't like how you ca n't choose the length of time you work out . You ca n't choose what you want to work on , -LRB- ie arms , abs , flexibilty , etc -RRB- The workouts are not long enough whatsoever . I do n't like how you ca n't use weights or balance ball or things like that . I know people are all about the balance board but I would rather use my other equipment . I will never buy something without reading the reviews first . I thought this would be in great demand so I wanted to jump on the ball . NEVER AGAIN !!! Truly , I think I will use this to supplement my workouts if that . Do some cardio workout , WII fit , MFC1 and then maybe this too . I dont know , but they need to do some serious revamping of this . I feel bad for the trainers who had to give those stupid looks after the exercises . Man the criticizim they are facing ! sucks for them . Dont waste your money !
 I really thought this was going to be great . Was I wrong . The first one is so much better . They really should of kept the same concept of the first one , but incorporate new things to make it better , like different animated trainers and different places to train and harder workouts . I hated the graphics on the second one . It looked so fake . The trainers to me were very annoying . I did n't like that it used the balance board and the wii remote . I found that you really had to swing the remote high in the air if you were jogging , or it did n't count . The balance board also did n't recognize that I was doing the push ups . Very annoying . I do n't know if anybody else had this problem , but I am definately bringing this back .
 I had such high hopes for this sequel to My Fitness Coach . My hopes were shattered . I bought this without reading any reviews or seeing any information about what the game was about . Wo n't make that mistake again . All of the functionality that was in the previous version is no longer here -LRB- select length of workout , what exercise you want to do , change the level , change the music , etc. -RRB- . You do not have much control at all over your workouts . I am a fit person so I need something that challenges me . The previous version still challenges me . The 2nd version barely gives you any workout . Even those who never exercise will get any benefit from this . My advice , do not spend your money on this ! This is yet another one of UBISOFT 's disappointments -LRB- just like Your Shape -RRB- .
 Just another review to add to the list of those who say that this is nothing like My Fitness Coach 1 . Very disappointing . If you 're looking at this because you liked the first one , do n't get this . It 's a waste of money . Poorly made . Cheesey .
 I do n't care for this game . It is flat and boring , it does n't keep track of when I work out , it just keeps it 's own schedule . I do not recommend .
 If you are new to working out or have been out of a routine for awhile , say 15 years or more , then you may want to consider this game . For someone like me who starts and stops exercise routines multiple times a year , this game is a complete waste of money . When I start a workout , I like to do that to the end . I do not like to stop for more time than a specific exercise to get rated and praised . Praise from a video game sound is just as hollow as getting a certificate in class for best teeth.Then there are the menus . Sure it is nice to have ideas of healthy meals . Just try to cook them though . There is no way to print the menus and I really do n't like the idea of having to drag the television and Wii setup to the kitchen . As for finding old recipes that you liked , good luck.If you can do fast walk for over 20 minutes , It is just not worth the money .
 First time writing a review and I thought I should so people wo n't waste their money on this one . . After reading all review I decided to risk it and bought it anyway . Well , it is my second week of training only but I am not really trilled about it.Negative : - There is no way to find out how much time you actually spend training - no time indication . - No way to customize your workouts unless you change your goal - I did not get much of flexibility exercises however it was my secondary goal . - The board does n't register push ups properly no matter how hard I try . - I was looking forward to use stability ball or other equipment - no chance , there is no option - Workout is too short - I would say about 15 min no longer . If you try challenges part - then maybe 25-30 min in total.Positive : - Nice interface - You can choose no meat , fish in nutrition part and it will give you vegetarian recipes . I did n't use any of the recipes so it was not useful for me . I am not a person who will read recipes and then cook it following your TV screen .
 I ordered this game , thinking it would be an updated version of My Fitness Coach 1 . It is not . Sure you get your own personal trainer and to pick your scenes , but that is the extent of the similarities.Pros : Gives you a menu and will even create a shopping list.The personal trainers are real people , not computer generated.You can pick 2 out of 25 goals to be your focus.It incorporates the Wii Balance Board.With use of the balance board , and wii remote it charts your progress.If you do n't have time for a full workout you can do a quick workout that only takes about 10 minutes.It weighs you to let you better track your progress.Different challenges to kick it up a notch!Cons : There is a lag between exercises , but just keep clicking A and the lag is only about 10 seconds.It does n't let you use hand weights or a stability ball like My Fitness Coach 1 does.Bottom line , if you are looking to get another workout in , because you are a little bored with the first My Fitness Coach , this one seems to be pretty good . I 'll probably use both of mine alternating days . I really like that it has healthy recipes on here , and with pictures , makes them look super yummy ! I think I will be happy with this game . I tend to get bored easy , so hopefully this will keep me motivated.UPDATE
 I purchased this `` game '' -LRB- MFC2 -RRB- because I liked the first installment -LRB- MFC1 -RRB- , but I was only disappointed by most aspects of the program . I agree with most other reviews on this site , that if you enjoyed the first My Fitness Coach , you will likely hate this one.Fitness : Where MFC1 's trainer is one animated computer generated -LRB- CG -RRB- trainer and environment , MFC2 has four awkward `` real '' trainers who 's likeness is overlaid onto four different `` green-screen '' style backgrounds.Whereas MFC1 , would run you through and entire 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , or 75 minute workout , MFC2 does not offer this feature . In MFC2 , during your initial set-up you choose a primary and secondary fitness goal and it -LRB- supposedly -RRB- creates a fitness plan to meet those goals . As far as I could tell , the only way it measures progress is by measuring your weight -LRB- and body mass index - BMI -RRB- every time you sign in , so if you were wanting to work on your six-pack -LRB- one of the actual 12 or so goals -RRB- , I do n't see how it can measure your progress.In contrast , MFC1 would have you occasionally take body measurements to allow you to monitor your own progress ; however , if your goal is not necessarily to lose weight , but inches , MFC1 is still going to prompt you to choose `` weight loss '' as your suggested goal if your BMI is over 25 or so . In other words , it too does not take into account body composition in its analysis.MFC1 would run you through your workout by beginning with a warm-up to get your heart rate -LRB- HR -RRB- up and muscles warm . As far as I can tell , MFC2 does not do this . MFC2 runs you through a pre-determined series of exercises with pauses in between . You never seem to get any type of cardio benefit from the workout.Nutrition : One new addition in MFC2 is the nutrition aspect . Though , not very comprehensive by any stretch of the imagination , the nutritional program offers you several recipes for every day of the week . For every day you are offered two recipes for each meal
 My wife and I had the original MFC and when we saw MFC2 we were excited thinking they took the old one and added some new things ... WRONG ! I can barely get warmed up doing the workout programs and the constant stopping between workouts is just annoying . The best part of the first MFC was the fact it was a cardio workout so you actually were burning more calories and toning because you were going at it full force with short rests towards the end . The MFC2 game is nothing more the Wii fit with out the balance games and added nutrition information that is readily available online . If you played the original like my wife and I stay away from this game . You will be extremely disappointed and just wasting money . Since you have a balance board you 'd have Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus and so you already have what this game offers for quality of work out.To end on a positive the graphics were extremely improved from the first .
 I bought the second version of My Fitness Coach because I enjoyed the first one so much . It was a total disappointment . There is no place to add what equipment I own , no place to control the duration of the workouts or how challenging they are . The workouts are too short . I like the fact that I can use the Wii board and monitor the weight ; however , I do n't like the new set up with the instructors and I do n't use the nutrition part . Total waste of my money !
 Why ca n't someone make a great work out for the WII ? My Fitness Coach , the original , is SO CLOSE to `` just right '' that I had to try this one . The daily workouts consist of 8 exercises ... that 's it . And if the controller does n't communicate with the unit , well , eventually it becomes annoying . I was hoping for a good workout that could progressively get more challenging as I got better . I need the `` company '' during my workouts to help me keep focused and motivated . This is just not the tool I was looking for . Even with its minor flaws , the original is still the best one for the money . I 'm really disappointed !
 I love My Fitness Coach and could n't wait for the follow up . The creators only needed to add some workout moves and update the graphics/backgrounds and they would have had gold but no they revamped the whole thing . Do n't bother buying My Fitness Coach 2 it will only disappointment and the cheesy thumbs up from the trainers only adds insult to injury . -LRB- Hey creators ... start on 3 and go back to the original format with a few more moves and poses . You owe us ! -RRB-
 My sister sent me the first fitness coach about six months ago . I have a very physically strenuous summer job , and it 's important that I stay fit during the winter months . I have loved the first fitness coach exactly because of this . It 's a simple game , does n't require any extra equipment , and I can hop out of bed without thinking and show up in front of the TV to work out every morning at 6:00 . Easy.Not so with the new fitness trainer . I 'm not even sure what to do with it . I added my info like with the first game , picked my personal trainer , and was ready to get started . I found the work-out menu -LRB- the menus are too complicated ... why ? -RRB- and was ready to get started . But I found I did n't get started . I was sent through a weird tutorial segment ... and then a start segment ... and if I did n't move my arms enough during the march ... the `` orb '' turned yellow . So then I started moving my arms more , and the orb turned green for a bit , and then back to yellow . It 's TOO complicated ! I just want Maya , and 60 minutes of fitness with the music , setting and physical focus area that I choose . Why make something that was SO simple before , now so difficult ? Argh . I 'm glad I got this one on sale . I 'm giving it to a friend.Bethanie
 When I saw that there was a second `` My Fitness coach '' I was so excited . I love the first version and so figured they had improved on an already good thing . What a complete waste of my money ! The exercises are easy , the workout time is very limited ... mine are 10 minutes each . There are not near the number of options , and the nutrition section is a joke , just a bunch of recipes you can find online or in a book ... no way of tracking what you are eating , or ways to track your calorie/carb intake . The biggest let down is the exercise routine itself . There is no way you will ever get any cardio benefit from the way it is set up . You do an exercise , then they make you wait through a bunch of irrelevant garbage before you can go on to the next exercise ... you loose whatever increase in heart rate you may have gained ; unless it is elevated in frustration . Plus the workouts are so very short . Just ca n't say too much bad about this program ... hope not too many people get duped as I did ... I really wish I could get my money back . Buy the first one , it is the best program I have found !
 I have to agree with everyone 's bad reviews on the exercises and trainers . It is hard to look at the screen during some of the exercises to get the timing down ... the trainers are obnoxious ... etc.But the nutrition section is even worse ! I was hoping to get some recipe ideas , but the recipes are all written using British English and British measurements ! How should I know how high to put the oven on when it tells me gas 5 , gas mark 3 , or gives the temperature in Celsius ? The ingredients and instructions are also in British English , so without using the internet to translate you ca n't even follow most of them . If you view the credits , you will see that it was produced in the UK.We contacted UbiSoft , and they looked at their disk and the recipes were the same for them , so it is not like there is another version . The game was only tested in the UK , not in the US . We asked about a patch and were told that most people who use this type of a game do not have their Wii online -LRB- we do n't -RRB- , so there was probably nothing they could do , though it will be brought up to management . The game should not have been distributed without testing . The tech guy was puzzled by this but offered no solution.This was not a satisfactory response , in my opinion . A refund or replacement offer would have been nice , instead of just `` oops '' . No more UbiSoft games for us ! -- Laura
 well , with this product i 'm not sure what to think have n't had a chance to play game it would not work in my wii game and my game system is practiacly new only had a few months or so and it could not read any of the wii excirse 2 game and i , v tried like about 3 of them none of them could be read but my other games work fine so , i 'm not sure if those games were bootlegged games or not ...
 I purchased this because I loved MFC and was hoping that MFC2 was just an improved version . I was way wrong . There is no real workout . You do exercises with lots of lag between . The only time I can see using this game is when I only have 10-15 minutes to exercise .
 This is not a workout ... . by the time each exercise actually gets started -LRB- tons of lag time between exercises -RRB- you heart rate is down . All bells & whistles and no substance . The Biggest Loser Wii is MUCH MUCH better .
 I ordered two Eastbay shorts and was dissapointed when they arrived to see that they had a snug fit , not the loose , hanging fit depicted in the online catalogue . I returned the merchandise -LRB- $ 19.98 value -RRB- using the pre-paid shipping label provided , realizing I forfeited my $ 8.98 shipping charges , but believing the return shipping to be `` free . '' Upon receiving my credit card statement , I noted that Eastbay retained an additional $ 6.50 for a `` restocking fee . '' So , I ended up spending $ 15.48 for two pairs of shorts that I did not indeed keep . Hmmm , so much for a great deal at a mere $ 9.99 each ! That will be an end to my online shopping through Amazon or Eastbay for apparel .

 I have a MPL , a gift from Ameritrade , and it worked like a champ all the way until its first refill . I used some Ronson Mult-Fill butane , available at Wal-Mart , to fill it up . It sends a flame like a blow torch , unfazed by the flame setting knob . In just a couple/few uses , it is out again . It is as though something is stuck or jammed fully open . When I checked the web site for warranty instructions , they will fix it but want you to send them a $ 5 check for shipping , plus pay the shipping and insurance to get it to them . That is at least another ten dollars invested in an item that costs about $ 25 new , right ? If it is working , I give it 5 stars . However , this sinks it to 2 stars for me .

 Ordered this based on the good reviews I saw . By the way , the shipping cost me as much as the cheap product . Was not happy . When I received , it 's some flimsy , piece of junk unfortunately . The seller was nice enough to refund the product cost after I paid to ship it back to them , but they would n't refund my original shipping costs . Apparently they found the product was not defective as I thought it was - maybe just a piece of junk to start with ! Would not recommend .

 The rack is nice and sturdy but does not fit my bike.I have to connect the rails to my seat closer.and needed to get different screws so i could connect it to my back wheel.The rack is now on an angle but it will work for me .
 The bike rack is completely incompatible with my bike . They claim 1 size fits all , but
 I ordered this bike rack to go with the Topeak trunk bag which I ordered through Amazon at the same time . When I received this bike rack , it was missing 4 of the lock nuts and the instructions are mostly in picture form and several languages but only a few words in English , none of which explain how to properly attach the bike rack to the bike . The attachment to the bike is not that difficult to figure out , however it is impossible to accomplish without all the parts . I will have to go to my local hardware store to obtain the rest of the parts needed . Another disappointment is that I did n't receive the truck bag which I ordered and paid for . Instead I received a Aero Wedge pack which is not at all what I need to go with this bike rack . I have yet to see if they send me the correct item.By the way , I have ordered many items though Amazon and have always been pleased with my purchases . This is the first time I felt compelled to write a review due to being so very disappointed .
 I was very excited to recieve this bike rack yesterday . After reading all the reviews and considering the product itself claims that it `` fits ALL '' , I figured I 'd have no trouble installing . Well , I was wrong . The instructions have two steps , each with one vague sentence describing what to do . I tried to install the product as vaguely described and the provided hardware is all the wrong size . I 'm not even sure how to more specifically describe it , but I can not mount this on my bike whatsoever . I 'll be sending it back and getting one from a different manufacturer .
 I will keep this simple , this rack wont work on a bike without threaded rear seat stays . Unfortunately the info forgot to mention that . I have an old Cannondale road bike and it does n't have the threaded rear seat stays . I did n't even know what they are , but they are two little holes on the forks coming down to the rear wheel . Quite frustrating when Amazon does n't have these types of details . Look at the picture of the rack , see those metal arms coming out of the front , you will need holes in your bike to attach those arms . Product itself seems to be decent quality , not sure why those two arms are not black metal like the rest of it though , not to pretty .
 Came with not enough bolts ! The bolts do n't really work for what they are intended to do . Had to resort to using metal wire to attach it to my bike . My suggestion is to go to a bike shop for this job and have somebody fit the right rack to your bike . lesson learned .
 Please be careful and CHECK YOUR BIKE before deciding to buy this product !! - This rack only fits on bicycles that are made specifically to accept accessories
 1 . To the people who had issues with disc brake caliper mounting , there is another Topeak product just like this that is made specifically for mounting in concert with disc brakes mounted . It should be mentioned in the product description or a configurator of some sort , because additionally ... 2 . If you are planning on mounting panniers in concert with a top bag , look at other Topeak products . There is another one that is just like this , but is has mounts specifically for panniers that do n't interfere with the top bag mount , which can obscure the rail that people are putting their panniers on in the pictures for this product.I want to mount both panniers and disc brakes , so I 'm going with the product linked below , which is perfect , but it was n't clear that it was necessary until this rack arrived and the included paperwork showed me the additional options.Topeak Super Tourist Tubular Bicycle Trunk Rack DX with Side Bar for Disc Brake Bikes
 The rack came with 8 bolts that do not fit the nuts that came with them and do not screw into the bike . Naturally , in my efforts to force the bolts to screw in , I scratched up the `` hard '' paint . The store will not take it back in that condition . I suspect they got a bad batch of bolts and did not bother QA-ing them . I have email into their US distributor . I suspect I have a trip to Ace Hardware in my near future .
 There were no screws for mounting the bottom connections . The two bikes I have need # 4 metric screws . I had to drill out the holes on the bottom connections to accept these screws . Also you need somewhere to connect the adjustable top connections . If you are ok adapting , drilling , getting screws then go with this rack . Otherwise stay away .
 It is very difficult to install , and there are the lack of nuts.When you open the packets , you will find there only two nuts . I do n't know how to intall it with two nuts . Leave it . If you are not the professional , I suggest to go to walmart or local store to get it .
 Includes tail light brackets but no screws to attach them , even though they show them in the installation instructions . Bike also needs threaded holes on the frame to attach top mounting strips . No instructions on what to do if you do n't have the threaded holes .
 They ship me 8 screws and 3 washers that do not fit . I have tried to contact the manufacturer , who is not readily accessible . You have go through a set of complicated popups to write a message . Of course , they could not be bothered to respond .
 The only reason I am giving this a 1 is so hopefully people see that this only fits bike frames that do NOT have disc brakes . Unfortunately , this is not listed in the description of the product , it only states `` fits all bike frames . `` However , amazon does sell the disc brake version of this bike rack , and I did a simple return through amazon to get the disc brake version , which fit perfectly onto my Cannondale.Great product , amazon just needs to update the product description .
 This is a great rack , and it was very easy to install . It is nice that it comes with the two extenders , allowing you to install it level in many different models .
 WARNING-It comes with little instruction and parts which do not fit . I had to purchase tools to try to fit this on a bike-I am telling you IT IS VERY DIFFICULT . If you are a bike engineer maybe you can figure this product out !
 Not recommended for cruiser bicycles . Ordered it for mine and didnt work so I had to send it back .
 I tryed to buy this item for a gift for one person 2 times . I placed my order 2 times because the item said that was in the stock and I never get the product and in one time my credit card was already charged and I did not have the product . I wrote to amazon team and they cancel my order but I do not like that an item that you want to buy seems as available and is not really . The amazon team should check what products are really in stock in order to give to the costumer a currently information .
 It took nearly 4 days for the seller to tell me the product is discontinued when it was `` in stock '' when I ordered it . Buyer beware .

 After i bought this wire i saw i can get it for $ 42.00 locally.But the wire itself is good but the price is way too high .

 I have a MPL , a gift from Ameritrade , and it worked like a champ all the way until its first refill . I used some Ronson Mult-Fill butane , available at Wal-Mart , to fill it up . It sends a flame like a blow torch , unfazed by the flame setting knob . In just a couple/few uses , it is out again . It is as though something is stuck or jammed fully open . When I checked the web site for warranty instructions , they will fix it but want you to send them a $ 5 check for shipping , plus pay the shipping and insurance to get it to them . That is at least another ten dollars invested in an item that costs about $ 25 new , right ? If it is working , I give it 5 stars . However , this sinks it to 2 stars for me .

 I started to purchase rebound products 3-4 years ago when my mildly austic son responded positively to the product . The jumping action -LRB- more or less vertical rocking -RRB- is very soothing and calming to his well being . I initially purchased the cheap units from the local discount stores , however , they were quickly destroyed . I have been buying and maintaining two needak rebounders for the past 3 years . The needak rebounder make a very fine unit and has an excellent warranty . However even the Needak unit can not withstand the stress/endurance test that my son puts the unit thru . The rebounder is used approximately 8 to 9 hours every day ... 7 days a week . My son weighs about 170 lbs . and from the use of the rebounder has zero body fat . I typically rebuild a Needak unit every 4 to 5 months -LRB- new mat , springs , pins -RRB- . I purchased the ReboundAir unit as a christmas present for my son . Within 3 weeks all of the springs had snapped and the frame pins were extremely worn ... nearing failure . I was unable to return the unit -LRB- 30 day return policy plus original packing materials required -RRB- . Telephone calls to the company are directed to voice mail . I have not talked to a real person yet and am currently still trying . The RebounAir unit was a major disappointed .
 I wanted to buy this product from this company but wanted a little more information than was available on the web-site . I called them three times and left messages and they never returned my calls . I emailed them , they did email me back once but I did n't get the information I requested . I 've decided to give up and try to find another vendor who actually wants my business .

 no valves or purge valve so you have to be ready to clear it the old fashioned way -- i found it better to use my old rigid snorkel stored under a wing of my bcd . that way , if i actually decided to use it , i would have a pleasant time swimming

 I purchased this case not realizing that the large metal zipper terminated inside the case where it could inevitably mar the finish on both the butt-stock as well as the muzzle of the firearm . Another problem I encountered was the zipper pull came off one end . I contacted Plano and several emails later they instructed me to return the case to the factory where they replaced it with another case of equal or greater value . The case I received in return has a plastic zipper vs. the metal one on the original case , which I surmised would be far more durable . I must admit that there is FAR less chance it will beat up my firearm , I just am not sure how long the plastic zipper will endure . I must admit , although I was less than satisfied with my original purchase , Plano DID make every effort to make it right in a timely manner and make me a `` Happy Camper '' ! Kudos Plano !

 I bought 10 of these for my Physical Education classes . I have taught Phys Ed for 20 plus years and have seen balls last as long as two years . These lasted between 1-2 days at my middle school . Most would not hold air . Those that did would pop within 3-5 hours play .
 If you 're looking for a rubber playground ball that looks a little like a soccer ball , then I guess this would be ok . If you 're looking for a real soccer ball , however , this is n't it .
 This is like a smooth playground ball - not the typical raised patches of a soccer ball . It does n't hold air for more than a week or two - we have go add air before practice each week . That said , our young -LRB- 4 and 6 -RRB- kids loved it . It does the job and is nice to not worry about losing it , or if you 're not ready to invest in pricier balls , its ok .
 I ordered 3 balls from Amazon.com for the police toy drive . The football and basketball arrived looking great . This soccer ball arrived as a piece of flat rubber in a plastic sack -- completed uninflated and without the means to inflate it . The ad should say that this will arrive not ready for play -- and additional supplies will be needed before a child can use it . Such a disappointment -- it is going right back !
 I was lead to believe that the ball would come looking like the picture , they did not state that it would not come inflated . So now I have to go and buy a pump to inflate the ball . Thanks alot for making me waste my time and money , so close to christmas . I should have gone to Walmart I would have paid less buying an inflated ball instead of buying a ball and a pump .

 I bought my Plano HS rifle case thinking it was as advertised great for a scoped rifle.Unfortunately , my Browning BAR Mark ll Safari 300 WSM with a Nikon Monarch Gold scope is just way too tight of a fit for it to be `` protective '' ... just the opposite . You have to struggle a bit to even get the zipper around and past the scope ! A tight fit can cause the scope to be jarred and set off alignment , way too easily.This is poorly designed . . an extra inch or so of room would make this a very doable and functional case.The carry strap is flimsy and simply not padded enough . Once again , a dollar more worth of material and padding on the sling would make this a higher class and grade of case for carrying a $ 1,800 rifle and scope around.Want to buy mine ? It is pretty useless to me as a rifle not correctly and always sighted in is a worse thing .
 I bought a dozen to check them out before I bought a bucket . 3 out of my dozen were so poorly covered that the leather was bubbling and loose , maybe I can use these for soft toss . The rest are OK , the leather is real but the seams are very erratic . these ball will be good for infield outfield practice but I will try and find a better ball for BP and pitching practice .
 The price is right but the quality of the balls is n't great . Next time i would opt for a more expensive one ...
 These same baseballs are available on this site for $ 35 per dozen . That 's already too much for practice balls . You can get game balls for less than that on most baseball sites . However , in this package you 're playing $ 200 for five dozen balls , which equals $ 40 per dozen . Sure , you get a bucket ... which is a $ 3 value at any Home Depot . Or , you can go to any building-supply place and usually get one for free . So , here you 're paying game-ball price for practice balls and $ 25 for a plastic bucket . Wow , what a deal ...

 I thought that I could use this call while bow hunting in order to stop a buck for the shot . The pitch of this call is way too high . I went on the knight and hale website to watch a video of the call and my call sounds nothing like theirs . Kind of disappointed and there is n't really a good way to adjust the pitch . I tried moving the reed and holder around and the pitch is really dependant on the pressure on the reed holder . I can not get it to sound good . Obvious the call should make a deeper sound as shown in the knight and hale video .
 This gun has alot of good reviews , unfortunately this is not one.The gun i purchased may have a defect , so I am posting this as a precaution.I took my JBL Mini carbine out on the weekend and it misfired 4 times.When loading this gun , Do it in the water only and point it downwards and NEVER at another person.I was swimming next to my brother and it went off without warning , luckily it was not pointing at him , and shot past the side of his body.It went of twice when it was loaded and I tried to push in the safety button . Yes , I was pushing the safety button and it went off.I always check the shaft is secure by pulling after I pushed it in and it still misfired.I ended up only using it far away from others and keeping my finger in the safe position as in when shooting a firearm , incase it was do to a sensitive trigger.I also disarmed it if I was not using it immediately.Some pros : I did shoot a fish with itIt is easy to load and unload.Modifications : I did put on a barb on the thread , the flopper installed in the factory was two small for what I am targeting.I recommend getting a barbI am going to change the cord it came with , it is not strong enough for what I am spearing , I bought a coil spring speargun cord that coils up like a telephone cord , 200lb test strength.I want to put a double rubber on to give it more range.Basically from my experience it is most effective point blank , so I need double rubber for extra reach.Unless my JBL mini carbine is an exception to the batch of these guns , I would not buy it again.I will have to have a closer look at the trigger to see why it is misfiring .
 Leasure pro is a very reputable company , they did no wrong , but the JBL D6 Speargun is horrible , it lacks power , it simply isnt what JBL promised it would be , I would not purchase this product , i am a very dis satisfied customer . It was unable to take out a trigger fish . The range is horrible . Spend more money and purchase a double banded gun .

 Excellent seller !!! Item shipped and arrived quickly . Order was filled as expected ... However , the Flag/Banner was not accurately described on product page . Colors are vibrant , but the material is `` see-through '' mesh . Background shows through the material . I was expecting solid flag material to prominently display the excellent design outdoors . I will keep the flag/banner and display indoors instead .
 You are showing it with a handle and there is none . It is made good but it is not like in the picture .
 These shorts were awful ! I got them for my 21 year old dauther who goes to Juilliard . She is of normal height and stature -LRB- 5 ' 5 '' size 5 -RRB- . They came down to her knees and looked terrible . Worse than that they will not let me return this useless item .

 Steelers logo looks cheap , but that does n't even matter because the damn thing did n't even work . Does n't pop bottles . Garbage .
 Either I got a bad opener or this thing is that bad . I normally do n't write bad reviews , I just leave them alone , but this is awful -LRB- Bought in 2010 -RRB- . When it takes someone 5 minutes , standing on one foot , bending over looking to open a bottle , just get a glass of water!The appearance of this is great , but that 's about it .

 The metallized area of the goggle is only at the front of it . Therefore , very unconfortable the light passing around the goggle where there is not metallized color .
 Thses types of gloves do not hold up well . Not only this brand , but the others also . They need to be made without the rubber type material , and made with the other material on both sides . The rubber splits at the seams . However , they are better than nothing . Product materials need to be improved

 I am currently looking for the Dallas Cowboys -LRB- side and front -RRB- panels for this SkyBox by Maytag vending machine , since I am having no luck at all , can not find that particular team anywhere . These here are out of stock , and the wrong team , so if anyone out there knows where i can find/buy them online , please reply and let me know.Thank you !
 The idea of a small ping pong table seemed appealing , but the disappointment here is the flimsy surface , which causes the ball not to bounce well . This is not a smaller version of a big ping pong table table .
 I was disappointed when this table finally arrived , it is not a small version of a large ping pong table even the grand kids were disappointed with table top quality . If you want a small folding table then this maybe for you but I 'm sure you can find it cheaper some where else
 After many pnone calls to Calcamp to return product . I have had no responce and had to call Amex to place in dispute for refund . Never opened box and ordered this item on Amazon by error .
 The jersey is fine - a mass produced item that is of the quality you would expect . The item was poorly packaged and arrived with the no shipping invoice enclosed.My problem was this was received as an xmas gift . Based on the return address I recognized the vendor as fansedge . I found out when I went to exchange this that amazon.com merchandise orders are not the same as direct orders.Most disappointing fansedge will not exchange items ordered via amazon.com EXCEPT for a different size - as if it were a video game or DVD-I was surprised that clothing can not be returned for a different product or a credit . In this case , I received a jersey that I would prefer to exchange and may not.There was basically no customer service . fansedge claims that they may not exchange items ordered via amazon.com due to amazon.com policy . amazon.com claims that this is a fansedge policy . No one I spoke to was doing more than reading a script . The amazon.com guy was very polite . The fansedge crew was less polite . The supervisor I spoke with `` tom '' was amazingly rude . Neither company solved the problem.I did send it back for a refund so no tragedy here - but so annoying .

 I bought these pads for Promax mechanical disc brakes ... and they did n't fit . My advice to the seller
 I was hoping this would fit from the reviews I read . But they did n't fit my Trek 3900 Disc Promax brakes . One side pad is to thick and wont fit unless all brake componets are all the way loosened and the rotor still rubs . Waste of money , not worth the time to send back .
 While I was most impressed with Bryan Kest 's `` Power Yoga Complete Collection '' released in 1995 , this 2003 release was disappointing in more ways than one : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Bryan Kest
 this description does not give proper dimensions , you would assume it is 4x8 but it is not . Do n't be fooled , it is smaller than normal .

 Purchased one after demonstration at a pro shop . Found it to be absolutely useless during a round at another course . Turns out that all of the flags were changed to reflective white for the demo . On a real course , can not give yardage to a flag beyond 100-125 yards if the color of the flag is not white . Very weak laser mechanism , frequently can not give distances to bunkers . Good for yardages to trees if you aim 10-20 ' feet up at the foliage , not the trunks.Returned this unit and compared the Bushnell Yardage Pro Tour and Pinseeker 1500 w & w ; / 0 slope . Yardage Pro Tour is also useless for golf . Either version of the Pinseeker 1500 is terrific and what a rangefinder should be . Purchased Pinseeker 1500 w/slope . Do not scrimp , save your money for a Pinseeker 1500 and you will be happy . Might be OK for hunting , but NOT FOR GOLFERS !

 I bought these to get traction while pushing a snow blower up an inclined driveway and to wear while jogging cross country . After wearing them for the FIRST time on a 3 mile off road jog in about 3 '' of snow , I was really surprised how much the `` tungsten '' spikes were worn down . Apparently tungsten has gotten soft as all of the spikes showed excessive wear and I was n't even jogging on black top ! I am really disappointed that such soft spikes would be used - I have 10 yr old golf shoes with `` tungsten spikes '' and they show very little if any wear after 10 yrs of walking golf courses . I guess everything is made cheap these days .

 Excellent seller !!! Item shipped and arrived quickly . Order was filled as expected ... However , the Flag/Banner was not accurately described on product page . Colors are vibrant , but the material is `` see-through '' mesh . Background shows through the material . I was expecting solid flag material to prominently display the excellent design outdoors . I will keep the flag/banner and display indoors instead .
 This tent did not hold up well . The floor got a rip fairly soon even with just one responsible adult using it . This past summer it pretty much deteriorated and we had to throw it away .
 Bought this halter because the headline said `` Yearling '' halter . NOT MINI YEARLING which is how it arrived . I 'm so angry they need to be very specific with their advertising whether these are actual HORSE size or miniature horse size .
 We have a baby -LRB- 3 year old -RRB- shire who keeps breaking out of his halters , and any replacements we find are all too small ... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin , and have no complaints . Even though the description says 1100 + pounds , it 'll fit your 1600 + Draft with no problems . : -RRB- Edit
 I give this product a poor rating . The packing case is nice , but little else . The included plastic bottles are available from various retailers and are adequate . I do not like the Lexan eating utensils , which seem to have a greasy feel even after being washed with hot soap and water at home.Worst of all are the pancake turner and cooking spoon , which are not heat-resistant in any way . The tip of the cooking spoon melted immediately upon contact with the bottom of the small pot I was using when attempting to stir ramen noodles . The `` pancake turner '' melted and stuck to the griddle surface as I was trying to flip pancakes . By the time I was finished , all three edges were completely melted and small patches of plastic were adhered to the -LRB- non-stick -RRB- griddle surface.I would not recommend this product.Edit >> This review does not reflect poorly on this seller . I purchased this product elsewhere .

 I ordered this for my husband who is avarage size for a man . I think it will be better suited for my 8 year old son . They dont give you the size but I found that it is not for a grown man to wear . So much for game day BBQ 's and him supporting his team . Guess I will keep shopping and find one that fits , at least him and our son will get to match .
 I received this so called value pack the other day in the mail for my 4 1/2 year old and thought maybe her grandmother made a mistake when she ordered it because I asked for one that came with both knee and elbow pads , but the packaging on this set clearly states `` knee OR elbow pads '' and does only have 1 set in the package . I went on Amazon to review the product description and it does state it comes with both ... but DOES N'T !! Only 2 left in stock Amazon ? Here comes a 3rd because I am returning this today . Not only is the product description wrong about the contents , it is misleading because it states the nylon straps are soft ... they are made out of the same nylon material used for strapping down cargo and are far from being soft in any way . I can not comment on the actual quality of the 1 set of pads in the package because I did not open it all of the way -LRB- the straps are hanging out -RRB- , but the helmet does n't seem that it could protect a dolls head if dropped off of a bicycle . I would not dare trust my childs head in this helmet . Shame on Disney for putting their name on such a low quality ` safety ' product . They should also consider moving the flower pattern holes on the top of the helmet to the sides in some way to help with airflow ... I ca n't imagine too much airflow can get inside the helmet to help cool the head off while playing and wearing this helmet . My daughter currently has a Trek helmet and I will be sure to buy her another one of those from now on .
 My daughter is five with a larger than average head . This helmet says it will fit 5 + and it is too big on my daughter . Furthermore the actual plastic wrap for the helmet was cut open by someone prior to delivery it looks like someone bought it and changed their mind . I would n't recommend this unless you have a 6 + y/o .
 This gun is a major ball slicer , and is not even accurate to start with !!! It also can not even come close to working in bad weather ... DO NOT GET THIS GUN ! Get the Spyder Sonix , Spyder TL-R , or Tippmann A-5 instead . -LRB- I 'm still waiting for it to blow up ... -RRB-
 I bought two prs . and both rubber liners came off , within the first couple of wearings . glued them together . work ok
 When I wear them in water , everything goes blur and I feel very dizzy . They are just like presbyopic glasses .
 Bike is really made by Kent Bicycles -LRB- Who ??? -RRB- and rebadged and marked up in true GM fashion . For the price of this bike you can get full carbon and Dura Ace from a reputable brand from your local bike shop .
 As state above , this is a Kent bike . For the money , you can easily get into a full carbon bike . Trek , Giant , Felt , Cannon dale , you name it they have a comparable bike at this or a lower price . Better warranties , better accessories , easier to find parts . Do yourself a favor and go to a real bike shop and see what a quality bike is like . Many shops have used bikes that are in great condition , do n't buy junk off the internet .
 The item description is misleading . I have a mountain bike - Raleigh Mojave 5.0 and this rack does NOT accommodates the tires . The top rack is design to tilt at a slight angle to hold the tire firmly but it is not tilted enough to accomodate my regular mountain bike 's tire . Eventually I have to bent the hook down in order to muscle my tire onto the hook . But it was a pipe construction so the structure integrity is compromised this way -LRB- you do n't really want to bent the metal pipe and expect it to hold the same weight -RRB- . If you have a `` phat , chunky mountain tires '' , DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM . Guarantee you 'll regret it .
 This product comes with 2 anchor screws and claims to support 40lbs . My bike is 22 lbs . It ripped the unit right off the wall . This product really needs to be attached to a stud with strong screws.I advise not to purchase this product unless you can find a solid wood support to attach it to .
 the bike came off the wall along with the top mount within three weeks and shattered an aquarium . my bike is not even 20 lbs . While the instruction says it can be mounted on any type of walls , it does NOT stay on a dry wall . The screw they provide is not long enough to even reach studs . very poor product .
 first of all just want to say that i have a road bike , and its less than 40lbs . it holds the bike right after install . but when i put the back on for the 2nd time . it pulls the wall rack out and made 2 holes on the wall.they should make an angle down the screws and not flat into the wall !
 It does n't withstand the weight of an average mountain bike . It 's a bike rack designed only for very light ones . Unfortunately , they not warn you before you buy your product .
 These are great but be ready to go to your local hardware store and pick up some better wall anchors . The ones that come with them can barely support the weight of a bike .
 I am sure this might be useful for some people , but not sure who . It says that this is the right size for all bikes , but the wheels on my mountain bike -LRB- standard one , not anything special -RRB- were too fat for it . : - -LRB-
 This is my first review for any product I 've purchased on Amazon . I feel obligated to leave a review because there are a lot of conflicting reviews for this product.First , this product does NOT accommodate any wheel size . I have a XC/trail mountain bike , and my tires barely fits . My tires are 2.25 '' , which are relatively small compared to all mountain / downhill bike tires . My front tire does not sit nicely into the holder as it should . It 's also very difficult to hang and remove the bike given the size of the tires . This product probably works really well for most road bikes , but not worth the hassle for mountain bikes.Second , the screws that come with this product are literally garbage . One of the screw heads was misaligned , which contributed to stripping of the screw when trying to install . In fact , both screws were stripped as I tried to screw into a stud . The screws never did make it all the way into the stud and so I had to remove the screws . I ended up scratching the heck out of my wall and the product , as I had to use a hammer to try to remove the screws . Fortunately , I had some spare screws I ended up using , which worked a lot better . I also had some paint to touch up my wall , but it was an ordeal I should n't have had . Do not attempt to use this product without installing into a stud if you have a mountain bike.I still have the product and am using it , simply because I do n't want to go through the ordeal of returning this item for $ 15 . It 'll be useless when I upgrade to a better mountain bike . If only I road bike ...
 Received this apron with the old block `` VIKINGS '' lettering and expected the apron as pictured with the script lettering . Returned it for possible correction .
 As good as any other apron . What I did not like was that it only has the Viking logo . It does n't say `` VIKINGS '' and so it looks a little empty without it
 I ordered the purple one and got this one it was a Xmas present so I did n't have time to ship it back
 I would say these should not be more then $ 20 . Very cheap quality and only a basic plastic shell . Extremely disappointed .
 Not breathable and very uncomfortable to wear . You would be better off just wearing black garbage bags on your legs ...
 Claims to be a `` Michigan St. Spartans '' helmet and shows a picture of a Michigan Wolverines helmet . If this is truly sold by Riddell , they need to learn something about the teams that make products for .
 I purchased two of these cages for my father 's bike . He used them and loved them since he got them , but during a ride -LRB- we were together -RRB- just 7 months later , one of his cages came apart at the mounting bracket welds . He was left with a bottle and half of the cage in his hand . The mounting bracket was still mounted to the bike . We pitched the cage and he put the bottle in his back jersey pocket for the rest of the 50 miles , but what a bummer this was . This cage saw light use , too , as he rides a couple of times a week . These cages did n't even get as much use as some on my bike would . Moral of the story , for $ 7 bucks a piece , buy something that is going to last instead of this . You can find full carbon bottle cages on ebay for 20-25 shipped for the pair and they will last a lot longer than these will .
 The water bottle cage broke after three short mountain bike trips . I did n't run in to anything or stress it in any way and it just fell off while riding a straight line . I do n't think it 's meant for the turbulence of mountain biking .
 We purchased four of these because of the cool looking design . They do look nice on your bike . However ; we had to send back one because the plastic button broke during shipping . We thought that was a fluke , but now I think they are just a poorly designed . Of the four bottle cages we ended up with , only two of them survived over a year . The other two split down the center . Not only are the plastic buttons fragile , but the welding seems to be hit and miss .
 The cage looked nice , which Is the reason I purchased it , but the split top makes it susceptible to bending and eventual breakage . I found that if I had n't tied my pant legs down that they would occasionally catch on the cage , and this ended up breaking it as the metal is really not that strong . I will be going a simpler design for a replacement .
 Bought four of these for our new tandem . One was delivered without buttons . One had a broken -LRB- split in two -RRB- button . The other two cages were ok but I do n't have a matched set . After several rides the two cages seem to work ok but some bending was necessary for a good bottle fit . Black glossy finish was acceptable on all four cages .
 I purchased and installed three of these for my touring bike . The cage that I most frequently pull my water bottle from broke at the weld after about 3000 miles on my bike . Not bad ? We have four `` plain Jane '' no-name cages on our tandem with 13K miles that are all still going strong . I emailed pictures to Planet Bike about the broken weld and they sent me a replacement , no questions asked -LRB- NICE customer service ! -RRB- . HOWEVER , the replacement cage only lasted 3 months before the weld on that broke at the same spot as the first.The Planet Bike SuperFlash is an incredibly bright taillight -LRB- drivers have said it looks like an emergency vehicle light -RRB- ; the Planet Bike fenders are perfect on our tandem ; their customer service is painless , but in my experience , this cage does n't have the metal - where it needs to be .
 The bottle holder worked well enough . However , the split design makes it susceptible to snagging on clothing and bending out of shape . Once it is bent , it is impossible to bend back without cracking the aluminum . If you only ride your bike wearing shorts , it 's probably OK ; otherwise , stick to the traditional shape .
 I would say these should not be more then $ 20 . Very cheap quality and only a basic plastic shell . Extremely disappointed .
 Not breathable and very uncomfortable to wear . You would be better off just wearing black garbage bags on your legs ...
 Like my title says , it is pretty much useless as a keyring hook , which is how it was described when i purchased it last year . That little football on the end of the hook is the problem ... it is too big to be useful . It looks kind of cool , but the football really should have been made smaller . Also , this thing is very fragile . It fells off the wall , less than two feet onto a bookshelf that was under it and his feet broke off . I dont bemoan spending $ 4 on this thing , but really , it isnt worthy of your time , money , or consideration .
 i bought this thing a few weeks ago i thought it was a blast until i threw it in the fire i thought this thing should be tested . it broke almost atomatically . im really ashamed because i thought this thing was durable . but you proved me wrong . all i can say is dont make another one and go back and sit in your corner.love always , a hating customer
 Once upon a time , maybe in the 80s when it looks like this thing was made , this might have been a good workout . Now , it 's just plain boreing and stupid . And to charge almost $ 20 for it ? A total rip off . Step routines are supposed to be fun , challenging , filled with variety and move you all over the step . This thing has one , and I mean one pattern and she just repeats if four times . Then she basically has you doing squats over and over and over ... this is where the `` buns '' workout comes in . Why not just call the thing , the squat workout.It 's a stupid video and I wasted my money . Do n't waste yours .
 I killed 2 of these in 6 months ... no better than any other refillable butane lighter .
 Alright , so I 've read some of the other reviews and will admit that I did n't read the instructions , but to me a lighter should just `` light '' . That 's why we call it a lighter , is n't it?I 've had mine for about half a year now , and I have to say I just do n't trust it . Too finicky . I do have some good things to say about it , so let 's get that out of the way first.I liked the construction , generally . Granted it 's not made from uranium-reinforced titanium or anything , but for the price I 'd give it high marks for durability and can report that despite a daily rough ride in my pocket there are only minor signs of wear.When it lights , it does exhibit a hint of wind-proofedness , although I doubt it would live up to the manufacturer 's claims of 60MPH or whatever it was.When camping it 's handy not to have to worry too much about getting it wet , and the `` shiny '' parts offer just enough reflectivity to find it in the dark without getting a search team involved.So that 's it for the good , and now the bad.It 's really hard to get it to light . I know I already said that , and I know that the instructions are supposed to make it better , and I know that it 's fairly cheap for what it is , but despite all those things if I had to choose one thing for a lighter to be good at , it would be lighting . This one just is n't . I also have to join in with the other reviewers who 've pointed out that the button gets very hot very quickly , so using this to light a campfire might be painful -LRB- unless you prepare and build a really good fire , but that 's not the subject here -RRB- . So there you are . In retrospect I would n't buy the same one again , but I am still glad I have it because it is still much better than a bic lighter or nothing at all for outdoor use .
 The price is high for this cheap lighter . It rarely lights on the first click and I found it difficult to fill up . The waterproofing appears durable but I have not tested this yet . It lights in moderate wind but not did not stay lit in stronger winds . Do n't count on this as reliable in the toughest conditions .
 this lighter offers very little in the way of flame control and fuel observation ; after filling , no fuel level is visible - the ` flame ' is quite diminutive and not very visible - would only light after maxing out the flame control - not worth the price , IMO , but i guess you get what you pay for - do n't expect to use this lighter for cigars , lighting BBQs , or other tasks - it wo n't work - it 's more designed for cigarettes

 What a horrible product . Horrible ! Why would someone sell a product without a valve for inflation ? That is correct . No valve . No way to put air in it -- it does contain air so it can leak out ; and , it does .
 Do n't believe it , the ball does go flat . No way to inflate the ball because the valve is blocked . Do n't waste your money .
 We bought this for a hike down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon last week , thinking that it would provide us with a quick and easy as well as a tasty meal after a long 8 hour strenuous hike to the Colorado river . We were looking forward to a nice hot meal instead of just cooked meats and bread for sandwiches . After eating salty nuts and chips all day , we were not expecting a gourmet meal but something more along the lines and quality of a frozen dinner . Boy , were we wrong ! It looked like nothing in the picture . The potato was dry and almost a solid mass with the slices of turkey embedded in it . You could tip the whole tray upside down and it would not fall or drip out . We were prepared to give the first one the benefit of being one bad packet , but when all four that we took with us turned out that way , we were very disappointed . We looked for other explanations to make sure we were n't doing anything wrong in preparing it , but the whole package is sealed at all times during the heating process , so there is no way of moisture evaporating or leaking out of the package . We also heated it for longer and shorter than the durations stated in the instructions - no change.We were hungry so had to eat it , but we should have taken sandwiches - they would have tasted better , weighed less and most of all cost much less . We had low expectations , but even then were extremely disappointed .
 i OBSERVE KOSHER LAWS AND SINCE I TRAVEL A LOT I HOPED LABRIUTE WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO MANY FRUSTRATING SEARCHES FOR A KOSHER MEAL . I BOUGHT THIS TURKEY MEAL AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED . THE PACKAGING AND PREP ARE CLEVER AND EASY TO DO - THE BOX WAS HEATED IN 15 MINUTES . THE PROBLEM WAS WHAT WAS INSIDE THE BOX ! IT WAS TERRIBLE - MOSTLY DRY SORT OF MASHED POTATOES AND A FEW SLICES OF PROCESSED TURKEY -LRB- I THINK IT WAS TURKEY BECAUSE THE BOX SAID SO - IT TASTED LIKE PAPER -RRB- . WELL AT LEAST I KNOW WHAT NOT TO BUY IN THE FUTURE .
 Picture in listing was of a black bike tire . I received a white wall tire . After talking to supplier they said listing said WSW . Initials only . They said it stood for White Side Wall . . Why ca n't they spell full words ? Especially with pic of solid black tire . VERY MISLEADING . Supplier said it was my fault .
 I was shocked and disappointed to find a tent that was called a 3-4 season tent had 2 large vents that had no way to zip them closed . This tent was freezing cold at night , even with the fly up , and even in temperatures in the upper 40 's . What a waste of $ 190 !
 I went hunting this weekend and it rained and snowed . This tent could not take any of it !! One pole bent under a little snow and the floor leaked !!! Worst tent I have ever used . I AM GOING TO JUST DUMP THIS IN THE TRASH AND CHALK IT UP TO A LOSS . I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE IT TO ANYONE . Do n't even consider this thing . Pay the price and get a good tent , like I should have .
 Why advertised as a 4 season tent , based on price alone I knew it was n't . That would have been fine . I really just needed a standard tent that was closed up a little more for cooler weather . By cooler weather , I mean north Texas , not Canada.My first camping trip probably would have been fine but I got a little rain . Unfortunately , the doors leaked like a sieve.I 'm not sure what to do with the tent now . A previous reviewer commented that his was headed to the trash . I am seriously considering this with mine .
 Unfortunately , the collars were machined quite poorly . I workout and train clients at a gym with various types of olympic bars and the `` IF '' the collars fit on a bar at all , they were very snug if they did . The screw to secure the collars to the bar are almost completely ineffective . As I mentioned earlier , the collars already fit so snug there was hardly any need for tightening . Also , the collars were not thick enough for the screw to take a good hold . One turn to loosen them and they would fall off . This problem could have been easily remedied with an attachment / weld of a thicker nut over the hole on the collar -LRB- you 're welcome -RRB- . Without it the screws barely stays on . Last but not least , it would have been nice if the bolt and nut that secured the chain were replaced with an easier / efficient `` quick pin '' of some sort . Some of us like to change out different chain sizes . Thank 's for reading .
 just did not fit ! way too tight and small compared to all other clothing of that same size that I have ordered on the web
 The item did not fit and that 's fine , it happens ... but there was no invoice in the packet so it will be difficult to return .
 Fast shipping which was good , as for the item ? Well it is okay if you like to repair things you just bought . One of the straps was sewn on twisted so I had to cut it and repair it . I would have sent it back but I had already washed it as I always wash new apparel before I wear it . That is when I realized the strap was twisted . I also bought a white cami and that one was fine . I suppose you get what you pay for in the end , may-be that is why they were cheaper than the other products listed ? Would I buy from this seller again ? I might give them one more chance . Thank-you .
 This camisole is the MOST uncomfortable cami I have ever worn . The shelf bra is very tight while the straps are extremely loose and thats after they are tightened as far as they can go and then the top creeps below your bra ! It 's horrible . Looks nothing like the picture .
 There are several problems with this camisole . As a Yoga teacher Im always looking for Yoga tops and hoped this might work out . It wo n't . The material is thin with virtually no support . I like being held in not only the obvious breast area but all over when I 'm working , this top will not do at all . I 'm only 5 ' 3 '' and this camisole is very short on me -LRB- just below the navel -RRB- and being short I always prefer the shorter style camisole but not this one . My biggest frustration is that I was following a link for `` shelf bra camisole '' and this came up so I was VERY surprised when it arrived and had no built in bra . I kept it because it was inexpensive and I did n't want to spend more money on the return . The only thing this will be good for is lounging around the house .
 I ordered XXL . The item that arrived SAID that it was a 2xL but no way ! Perhaps if you are a size 12 or less , this size might fit . Good luck . I sent it back , and do not plan to order from this vendor again .
 These are very well-made camis , however the other reviews are right about the sizing being way off . I wear a size 6 , sometimes a 4 . My other camis -LRB- made by esprit -RRB- are medium and fit beautifully . After reading the reviews , I decided to play it safe and order a large . When I put it on it was so tight I could barely breathe and fit more like and extra small .
 these were well made but so very small . I gave them to my daughter who is about a size 6 and they were even too small for her . She gave them to her daughter who is about a size 0 . I ordered and received an x-large . Hmmm . Not pleased at all . Sorry .
 it did not fit i gave it away . much too small for an extra large . iguess ineed a 2x large size
 I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this item . The sizing is n't right at all ; the product runs at least 3 sizes too small , if not more . I bought a 2x , because I normally wear a large and wanted it to be big and loose , and it felt like I had tried to squeeze myself into a small or medium . Buyer beware !
 I purchased four of these tops . I sent all four back to exchange for a larger size.I normally buy these sorts of tops in a medium ... well , this manufacturer has a messed up idea of medium because even the extra large is a bit too snug.However , the material and construction of these tops is phenomenal but the sizing is off.If you decide to purchase one or more of these be sure to get them AT LEAST a size larger than what you normally purchase .
 The material was nice and the color red was perfect , but the band on the shelf bra was so tight I could n't get the camisole over my bust .
 This comes in a 2x , with a built in bra , so I bought it . Oh , dear ! It is skin tight , maybe even tighter than my skin and the bra is laughable . Or it might be if it were n't such a horrifying sight . If you 're really skinny , go ahead and get this , but otherwise you should probably pass .
 While the material is very comfortable on the skin , the size is not . This camisole seems to run a size below the tag . The large is really a medium , when up against several comparable products I own .
 Title says it all . I normally wear either an XL or XXL . I got the XXL . it is way too small .
 I am a professional athlete ; was looking for something to use as a recovery aid to work out sore and tight areas in my legs post training . We have a dozen of these `` Sticks '' in our gym . I tried it once and found two major problems :1 . The device flexes far too much to be used as an effective massager .2 . Requires muscular effort in order to use -LRB- practically an arm workout just trying to use it -RRB- . Save your money and buy a foam roller instead -LRB- Black High Density Foam Roller - Extra Firm - 4 Sizes Available -RRB- . Or , you can even make one with a 4x12-36 '' piece of PVC pipe , wrapped with an isopore mat , and then covered with two or three wraps of 100mph tape . I chose to just buy a foam roller , as I consider that time = money , and my time being worth around $ 25 an hour , if it takes me two hours to gather/buy supplies and build one , well then I 've just lost money . And with a foam roller , you 're using body weight vice muscular effort to get an effective massage . We have the benefits of gravity , might as well use it .
 I know that the Marathon Stick is shown here , but I wanted to let everyone know my thoughts on a very similar product by the same company - the Sprinter Stick . I read another review in which the author said his/her Stick has a really bad smell - so bad that the person has to keep it outside in the garage . I sort of ignored the review since I had not read about any similar issues and plus it seemed silly anyway . Well , when my Sprinter Stick arrived , sure enough , it smelled . Bad . Really bad . I tried to suck it up and ignore it as I rolled my muscles for about 15 minutes . I put the stick on the carpet next to the bed and tried to sleep , but the smell was everywhere - on my hands , on my legs , in the air . I washed my hands and legs , but the Sprinter Stick on the floor still emitted such a strong odor that it was in the air . I had to move the Stick farther away before I could go to sleep.I left my Sprinter Stick out in the open for over 2 weeks , hoping that the smell would go away , but it seems to be infused in the rubber handles . The best description I can think of for this horrible smell is ... a pungent industrial rubber/plastic smell that makes you wonder if it 's toxic . I can not get rid of the smell so this thing is going to be returned .
 I 'm a personal trainer as well an athlete training for Ironman triathlon . At a recent event expo , I stopped at the `` Stick '' exhibit to explain that I was in fact terribly disappointed with their product . He agreed with me !!! But offered that the problem was in the model , that I needed to purchase the larger model to get the proper effects . Ohhh , I need the more expensive one to actually benefit , is that it ? He began to demonstrate , causing me to abruptly insist that he stop because it was hurting me . He became extremely agressive in his demonstration and within seconds , actually brutalizing my muscles with this ridiculous gadgetry , inflamming nerves along the back of the leg which spurred severe cramping of the foot and toes !! Do not walk ... run . This is a terrible , worthless product sold by idiot nitwits that think its okay to man-handle people with detriment !!! They and their product have worsened any muscle fatigue or soreness that I had and I would give anything to hit him in the head with that ridiculous `` STICK '' .
 I already own ` The Big Stick ' and it 's a great product . This one however falls short.I picked this one up so I could have something small at work to use since I 'm terrible with getting around to using it at home.The size is good and all , however there is far too much flex on this thing which does not allow me to get enough pressure on my target areas . The core rod is thinner than the larger models and therefore causes all this flex . I would say stick with something larger . This may be good for light work , but not for heavy tension such as I have .
 Bought this tent from `` WW Bargains '' expecting a water proof floor ! NOT !!! Tent must have a ground barrier or you will be wet!Made contact with seller and had a very disapointing respons ! Kinda like , to bad so sad , customer service had a very limited and unacceptableresponse to issue at hand!Partially my fault for not asking the right question before ordering . ALWAYS ask first!I will not be doing business with them again!I will not use , nor recommend using , this tent if wet weather is forcasted ; however , it does work very well in dry conditions!Hope this is helpfull and have a great campout!FYI , AMAZON IS FABULOUS!Brad
 Do n't let the picture fool you there is only two pieces . but then again I suppose I need to read the description a little better next time I buy . Not a bad gift mind you just a little pricey for just holding four rods . . and there are no pre made drill holes , so your going to have to figure out how to mount it yourself . So basically all you get is two blocks of wood in a bag .
 The slots to insert the swords are only 2 '' wide . If you have fantasy swords , they will likely not fit . I will have to use power tools to open up the slots and paint it with india ink to get this display to work for even a single sword . I bought this item through ` cheap humidors '' so I do n't know if it would be different through different vendors , but it is the same item from valor 6049 . There are 2 connecting pieces between the fans to stabalize them . The tongue and groove slots that are cut into the fan do n't mate on 1 side , so only one stabalizer can be installed . The black laquer on the particle board was crushed/dented from shipping as it lay in a pile at the bottom of a cheap box that was held together by packing tape and not much else.Buy a display stand that has adjustable slots to ensure that your swords will fit without the hassle of reengineering this thing from the ground up .
 Disappointed >> strap was shredded and this is a gift >> heat pack can only be used once
 I bought this back in 2008 , but the pedal mechanism was n't designed well -LRB- or I had a defective one -RRB- . Within a year of casual use , the right pedal would fall off . After falling off , I would put the pedal back on , only to have it fall off again . After having not used this bike much for the last couple of years , I finally studied the pedal in detail . The threaded hole in the pedal was completely striped , so I have junked my unit and plan to buy a different product . Other than the pedal issue , I was happy with the product because this bike did its job , especially for the price .
 I did n't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery . This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable . It does the job , but only just . I 've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably . Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories / time and sometimes it just wo n't come on . At first it worked great . Also , the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly . Not in danger of falling off or anything , but just not a secure connection to the base . Overall , the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work , but I did hope for better quality .
 The instructions clearly state 3 tools are included . I only received one , the allen wrench . I called the company and stated the tools were missing and they said they would send them priority mail . Never came . Called back , then I 'm told there 's a mistake with the packaging and those tools are not included . So apparently I need to go find the appropriate tools to put the dang thing together . The bike itself is probably fine but it p * sses me off to no end that this company ... 1 . gives different answers at different times and 2 . cant provide the 10 cent tools that would allow me to put the bike together .
 We were so excited to get this bike , after purchasing it here on amazon.com . The box it came in was completely banged up and some of the parts were sticking out . We were concerned , but thought we 'd check out the situation . We opened up the box and made sure we had all the parts ; they were all there . So we go to start putting it together , and then we see that the mainframe is bent along the bottom . It 's bent so far back that we ca n't put the first screw in . It 's a thick frame , and we ca n't just bend it back to shape -LRB- at least without using a hefty mallet -RRB- . We 're so disappointed ... we wanted to use the bike but it 's not even possible to get past the first step , because of how much it was bent . It was either packed damaged , or damaged by the shipping company . Either way , whoever did it , I hope to get this replaced otherwise we 're expecting our money back , obviously .
 I recieved this bike today . Easy to put together -LRB- about 20 minutes tops -RRB- A lot of the brakets did n't line up perfect ... The first thing that was dissapointing was that one of the bolts holding the seat on stripped out with hardly any force . The second was the seat itself . I can hear the wood cracking on one side and I weigh 220lbs ... the biggest disapointment is the thing they call a `` computer '' this thing is a joke . It 's supposed to start up when you begin but doesnt come on till you are off the bike thinking its busted . As far as the readouts , God knows what your looking at cause as soon as you can read the number being displayed it automaticly changes to something else . Overall , it feels cheaply made and I am debating on shipping this turd back . The only good thing I can say about it is that it is very quiet ...
 I was so excited to get this comforter for my lil guy . I have purchased the item , paid for it with paypal within 1 minute after the purchase . I was wondering how come the price was that low . Maybe they are getting rid of a lot of stuff and I found the sale of the century ? No no such luck . I have received an email days after the email that thanked me for my purchased and said that both Talon -LRB- the seller -RRB- and amazon.com cares about their customers satisfaction ... . that said that the item is out of stock and they are really sorry but have to cancel my order . I am quite sure I am not the only person to find this upsetting.However it is really obvious that Talon Deals Wholesale forgot to post a 0 after the $ 15.00 for the item , and are not willing to hold up their end of the bargain nor take responsibility for their mistake . I could n't get away with that ... not at my work , and not even in my personal life.What ever happened to honor ? I am amazed that amazon.com stands behind them in such a case.Talon is still selling the comforter on several websites for $ 150.00 so it is clear that the item is not out of stock , in fact it never was.They should have owned up to their mistakes and honor their contract to the customer and Amazon should have done the same .
 Beautiful bag , warm , no to heavy ... but is going back , as the zippers just catch every single time and then I would had to fussle for 5 minutes to get them free . You would think after a month of using I would had found a technic , but there is non , unless you are much taller than me -LRB- 5 ' 4 '' -RRB- and push with your feets as you pull with one hand to keep it very very tight and with the other zip it up or down . And when close and the zipper gets catch trying to open it and you ca n't get out , some claustrophobia arises , not a pleasant sensation . Much less if you have to go to the bathroom ! Would have love to love it , but is not the case , sad .

 This item , titled `` Custom Products Long Regulator w / Gauge - Black '' DOES NOT INCLUDE A GAUGE . It includes a gauge port adapter , which allows you to add a gauge , but no gauge is included.The item description also states `` This regulator has a built in flush mount macro line fitting already in the bottom of the reg . '' This is an outright lie . This regulator does not include macro line fittings . You will need to purchase those separately.The regulator itself is obviously brand-new and arrived in retail packaging . It feels well-made , and is what I would expect from a CP regulator . I will update further once I receive the adapter I ordered and I go buy all of the missing pieces . I can only give this item the lowest possible rating though , as the seller blatantly lies to you in the title and item description . I will also be contacting Amazon customer service to file a complaint .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 While this is a great looking bag and it looks exactly like the picture , it does n't prove to be what I wanted in a bowling bag . I needed to transfer an indented styrofoam ball holder into the bag so that the ball would not roll around . This bag is for my disabled 20 year old daughter who wears a size 4 shoe and the only place to store them is on top of the ball . -LRB- not nice -RRB- The side pockets and front pockets are too small for her size 4 shoes . We use it still as it does roll well but it is n't the best BOWLING rolling bag .
 Like most `` 5-in-1 '' style pieces of survival gear , this is a poorly made hodge-podge of flimsy , weak , and unreliable swag . Items like this are sold to people on the basis of the inaccurate notion that anything is better than nothing . No . The right gear is better than nothing . If you are preparing to take care of yourself in a pinch , spend a few more bucks and get stuff that works , works well , and survives rough conditions . This toy will not do any of those things.And , as with all emergency tools , practice using it in real-world , adverse environments before you hit the road , or trail , or whatever . Tools are worthless until you have practiced with them enough to know how to use them even in the worst of conditions ; because , if you ever need them , it will almost certainly be in the worst of conditions . Learn from my experiences , or you will be compelled to learn from your own , and you might not be as lucky as I have been .
 Great to have for your BOB or maybe on a boat or hiking . It 's not very good quality , especially the compass , but hopefully it will last in storage long enough for when I have a need for it -LRB- and I hope that 's a really long time -RRB- For the $ 5 price I would buy it again with free Amazon shipping , but I would n't pay more . I think I could probably find it for $ 2-3 in a clearance bin at some sporting goods store .
 Very low quality . A child 's toy . Either build your own survival kit , or buy the SOL Origin . I have written an extensive review of the origin .
 It did not keep my matches safe from getting damp over 24 hours . The compass is small , barely readable , but if it was all you had with you , better than nothing . I purchased this for my day trip backpacking kit and was slightly disappointed . I would not recommend this for anything other than a kids overnight camping adventure at a local Park . Not a serious tool . ` Pro ' - Inexpensive , small and lightweight , bright color , great toy . ` Con ' - Did not keep matches dry and usable , great toy .
 ... really , what could you expect of a cheap piece of made-in-China plastic ? I got two of these for a set of stick-in-the-car emergency kits , and while one seemed fine , the compass on the other did n't know what was up , down east or west . A 50 percent failure rate is not particularly reassuring if I 'm planning on using this thing to get out of a messy situation . It is very , very orange , though , so it 'll be quite easy for the search crew to find my remains after I get thoroughly lost trying to use this thing to navigate to safety .
 Where do I begin ? Emergency equipment should not be a liability . This device is just that . A liability . When you need it , you will find it will not function as intended . I had purchased three of these devices for ` gift ' emergency kits I made . In testing the gear , I discovered on each device the same identical problems : The whistle - barely worksThe flint - is worthless , does n't function at all.The compass - has a bubble and consistently reads completely wrongThe waterproof case - is n't very waterproofThe only thing that works on this device : It 's orange . That means it 's bright and can be noticed easilyThe lanyard - because seriously , how do you screw up a nylon rope ? Apparently even a blind squirrel can find a nut once in a while.If you 're willing to look at this device as a gimmick or novelty , then by all means it 's worth the low price . But if you are relying on it for safety or emergency gear , you 're going to be sorely disappointed should said emergency ever occur .
 The Lifetime web site says `` Made in USA '' , but the bottom of the table says `` Made in China '' .
 Horrible experience . Bought this sheet and did n't need to use it for four months , and when I finally got to use it for first time it soaked completely through during the first rain we used it for . Contacted seller who said tough luck it 's been more than 30 days since the purchase , even though I patiently explained I was n't able to use it on my pony during the first 30 days since it was summer here and we do n't use rain sheets until the fall . We were n't looking for cash back , we just wanted a sheet that was waterproof and we would be happy with an exchange for one that was . Again tough luck they said . So now I have a sheet that I paid $ 83 for that is useless . So I guess now I 'm basically stuck with a stable sheet I have no use for ! Rep I talked to was rude and snotty . Never will buy from them again !

 I ordered a Black shirt and received a Grey one . When order was placed and they took my money ... no word was mentioned that the did not have Black shirts in stock . I do not want to waste my time sending back a shirt that I did not order.What is the deal ... Simple solution ... Refund my money
 I like a hard work out but the moves were so fast and confusing I felt I did not get a good work out at all . She starts fast with a lot of confusing moves and then stops every minute to talk and give high fives . If you like a stop and go work out over and over and are very coordinated it may be for you .
 I have this helmet next to a Riddell Proline helmet and it looks totally out of proportion -LRB- too small -RRB- to the other helmet . If you are going to display multiple helmets in your collection look carefully at the description before your purchase
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 The look of the hat is nice but they need to list what size the hat fits . After buying this I realized this style of hat runs small so order bigger than you would normally wear
 I go to the indoor pool at least 3 times a week . Needed to find an inexpensive suit , because the chlorine fades them a lot . When I got the suit , I was satisfied with the color , but trying it on I found it uncomfortable . The size I ordered was not the size of what I expected . Their size chart is wrong , order bigger .
 I dont remember what size i bought but it was too small . I will create a video to show you how small it was .
 i ordered a large swimsuit and guess what ? they sent an XS swimsuit . there is no way i will fit into this . 1 star . wouldve been 0 if possible
 Size was too small . I ordered the size I have bought in similar suits yet this one was very small . I had to return it .
 This swimsuit has faded completely after 2 weeks of wear . I am very unhappy with the wear and would not suggest anyone buying it . I have been swimming for 20 years and never had a suit fade this badly !
 The product arrived with a hole we could not find . We bought this with several other toys for a pool party we were throwing . The adults eventually laid it out on the patio and used it to sit on so their swimsuits would n't snag . I saw in other product reviews that it showed up with a hole , and I took a chance anyway . My bad .
 I have ordered two of these , with the second a replacement for the first after it was returned as defective . Neither one would hold air . There is obviously a manufacturing issue with these and to avoid disappointment and the return process , do not buy .
 It only lasted a week , then there 's a 1 '' tear between the edge of the neck and shell , it was fun to use when it works .
 It got a hole in it after 2 weeks . My grandkids love it , but it 's already done for . the patch that was included did not work .
 This item was a ripoff . It is advertised as a full size replica helmet at 73 % off , you will receive a mini helmet at a higher price than you could have paid anywhere else . The mini helmet itself is a nice helmet , just not what I paid for.The seller -LRB- Online Sports -RRB- claims it was Amazon who gave the wrong description and after waiting a week for a response they best they could do would give me a 20 % discount on a helmet I already overpaid for or return it . Remember when there was customer service and companies actually took responsibility for their mistakes . I want what I paid for , I want what was advertised and I want to pay the advertised price.Do NOT buy from Online Sports on Amazon , they will only take your money and run

 While hardly inexpensive , they are cheaply made . I like the longer pull strapbut that 's it . The picture does n't depict what you get ; The visibility piping is non-existent , and the Velcro started falling off after opening the pouch the first time . My daughter could do a better stitching job as a 9 year old than the manufacturer did with these .

 this pack fell apart on first use , webbing pulled off , zippers broke . i bought it back in 2007 , cant believe it is still for sale !
 although i had stretched the limits of this bag by taking it on a 15 day backpacking tour of europe it did not hold up very well . i had only filled the bag with 3 days worth of clothes and essential survival necessities . being a soldier and veteran of deployments i am not exaggerating when i say bare essentials . this bag had a ripped top handle within 3 days and would sustain many more rips in seams as the trip progressed . it did make the tour but barely . if your looking to do something as rugged invest the money for a tougher pack . this is ideal for a quick hike through some woods that you might spend the night . much past that its weight capacity to size ratio is deceiving

 WOW !!! What a shocker . I just got off the phone with Dalesa and Kimberly in repairs at Citizen . They are nothing if not relentlessly dogged about the company policy ... which is well aweful.The WatchWorked fine for 6 months , then the date stopped moving . I called cust svc/repairs and tried to fix over the phone but we couldnt . He recommended I send it in.The Repair ProcessI had to pay to ship the watch insured ... $ 16Then once there , they found an imperfection in the crystal and the crown . Huh ?? I wanted you to fix the date . Well , I am an honorable man , how about I pay for one , say the crystal , and you pay for the other ? Thisis where you would have though I asked for those ladies fistborn . Do you know they would not budge on an $ 12 crown repair ? insisted I pay $ 43 for the crown and crystal.Warranty 101 : For every dollar spent , it is a loss to the company ... and eats into the profits of that particular product line . So , service folks are taught to find something ... anything extra wrong with your device to offset the costs of the warranty claim ... in this case the date feature not working . So , now they add the crystal and the crown fix at $ 46 , and it offsets the costs of the date feature fix . Eureka ... another satisfied executive!As for the customer ??? Talk about extortion ... I mean , what am I going to do ... be out of a $ 300 watch ? And get this , Kimberly was the manager ??? So why even ask for the manager at Citizen.I have read some of the sterling reviews ... and for 6 months , I would have agreed ... but if you ever have to send this thing back ... be ready for the run around .
 I bought this Eco-Drive Calibre 8700 Perpetual Calendar watch from Amazon in July , 2010 . I purchased it because it was supposed to be hassle free , solar and perpetual calendar . What else can you ask for ? However just five months after I got it , it suddenly stopped working when I was wearing it . It was behaving as if it was out of battery . Nothing was moving , not even if I tried to adjust time . I originally thought it was not charged enough , then I realized I had been wearing it in bright sunlight and shorting sleeve for the last few weeks , so it has to be related to charging mechanism . Anyway , I left it on desktop and it resumed running on the third day after incident . After it resumed running , I tried to reset the time and date , but the adjusting mechanism seems to be messed up now . When I pull out the crown , it moves to 2 o'clock or 8 o'clock instead of 12 o'clock . I realized that I ca n't return it to Amazon since the return window has passed , so I am contacting Citizen service center to find out my choices . Hopefully it is not going to be too much hassle . At $ 300 , I was expecting it to last 5 years , not 5 months.Update with repair
 I 've owned this watch for almost three years now and although I like the styling and durability of the case and band I have had some problems which prohibit me from giving it a glowing review.First off , the crystal is flush with the top of the case . I 've already had it replaced once and within a couple of months it is once again scratched to high hell . I 'm by no means `` gentle '' with my watches by I expected it to be a little more durable.Second , the Day of Week dial broke after 2 years . The arm seems to trail off to positions behind the actual day . Saturday , for example , points to no-mans land.Third , this watch tends to die unexpectedly when not given enough sunlight . I live in sunny San Diego and still have problems keeping it charged . At lunch I have to take it for `` walks '' outdoors to make sure it keeps accurate time.Fourth , God help you when the watch DOES lose track of time . Setting the time and date is not only confusing - but extremely time consuming.So , why 2 stars ? Because I still really like the way it `` looks '' . I want to love this watch but I ca n't . For my birthday I 've asked my wife to replace it with a cheap battery powered digital Casio . At least then I 'll always know what time it is !
 I got one last september . After about 2 weeks I noticed it would be late by 15 to 30 minutes . I 'd reset . A few days or a week later same thing . I left it in the sun for 8 hours to charge . Same thing happened a few days later . This is a complicated watch . I have read and reread the manual . There is nothing I am not understanding about operating the watch . You should be able to charge it once and leave it run . It get plenty of sun.Exchanged it for another of the same model . Same exact thing is now happening after about 3 months . Thought I got a good one but guess not . If two of these do the same thing for one guy , I would seriously suspect the quality of this watch . I 've never had any problem with a decent quality watch before this .
 The watch is very nice looking , solid and accurate -LRB- while it works -RRB- . Then , a day comes and it does n't respond to anything - can not change date , time , nothing . None of hands move , exposure to extra light helps none.Warranty is limited to 5 years , and my watch died after 6 years and 2 days being on my wrist . There was no abuse at all , I loved and ` babied ' it . I was hoping to get 15 + years of service from the watch made in Japan and costing that much ... The reason I gave it a star - it was a good watch when it worked , I liked it . I think I gave Citizen too much credit when I parted with about $ 400 exchanging it for this watch.My watch was not purchased thru Amazon , thus there are no complaints going that way .
 It 's a very nice watch and I 've been using it for more than 3 years now . I bought it from Kohls when they had a 30 % coupon , so I got it for around $ 200 after all the discounts and cash backs . It has been running perfectly ever since . The blue dial is darker than pictured and is almost black , but looks great.Now the problem . It 's a scratch magnet . The dial window is supposed to be a hardened mineral , but it looks like acrylic after 3 years of use . It has lot of scratches all over it . May be I use it rough , but my 4 year old Skagen that cost me $ 50 does not have even a single scratch on the glass ! For a $ 300 watch , I would expect a sapphire window or at least a harder material .2 stars for the movement . -3 for the materials .
 I ca n't even express in words how much I hate this watch . Bought it for my husband for Christmas of 2007 , by summer it had been back to Citizens 3 times . They want to blame it on my husband , -LRB- who has read the book that came with the watch cover to cover -RRB- . He knows how things work with the watch . It suppose to forever almost hold a charge . Husband works outside full sun most of the time . They have replaced insides twice , if it was husbands fault , why replace insides , if watch is n't to blame . Wo n't just admit it 's a lemon , will not get refund on piece of you know what . Had it back 4th time when it was n't keeping accurate time again . They charged it and sent it back to us . They have done that before and within a week or 2 was keeping inaccurate time . Would never ever buy a Citizen 's watch again . I tried to give no stars , but was stuck giving 1 .
 I have always bought cheep $ 100 watches and I said that I would not do that again . I wanted something that would last more than 1 year befor it need to be replaces . I got this watch on a cruse -LRB- Not through Amazon -RRB- . I paid $ 275 and was told about how to charge it under a light . For the 1st month I had very little problems . After 1 month I started loosing time . I had to charge it under a 100W light for an hour every day and it would still be 5 minutes slow at the end of the day.DON ' T BUY THIS WATCH !!!!! IF YOU DO , JUST REMEMBER , I TOLD YOU NOT TO BUY THE WATCH !!!!!!!
 I bought this watche and i hate it.I spent 356 dollars in a watche very small and the collor that i have choosen is diferent than the main pictures shows.The dial is not blue , it is very very dark blue and seems to be black.Iam very disapointed with this model !!!
 Bought a Citizen Eco watch at Sams . Only kept it a couple weeks . Complicated , hard to use , had to get the instructions out just to reset the time , and I hated it . The date is so small , I needed a magnifying glass to read it . The only thing that kept it from going in the garbage is that my daughter was visiting and I gave it to her for my son in law . He has a Timex . He tried the Citizen for a few days , but since then I see he is wearing the old Timex . He said he did n't like the Citizen either . Guess I wasted my money
 I thought I would try this seat since it 's not extremely expensive . I was looking for something more comfortable since I 'm a large person . This seat is poorly made and is very uncomfortable . It was far worse than any seat that comes with most bicycles . I would not recommend this seat to anyone regardless of body size and/or weight . I did n't even take a ride using this seat as I saw no point in doing so . I just threw it in the garbage since I would n't give this seat too anyone .
 I bought this seat years ago and after sitting on it for a few seconds took it off , it hurt and did n't fit right . I ca n't imagine anyone but some super skinny short person using it , but even then it 's a hard seat .
 I ordered the Easy Seat and used it for several days . If one is only interested in easing pressure on the nerves and arteries of the perineum , then one can be reasonably satisfied , for the product certainly accomplishes this.Early on however , it became apparent that if one removes one 's hands from the handlebars , especially while peddling , it is nearly impossible to balance the bike . Apparently , one needs to apply subtle pressure through the inner thighs to the horn of the saddle in order to maintain balance . Of course , the Easy Seat has no horn . In addition , no matter how tightly I fastened the thumb screws to separate the pads , they would invariably come together . I am convenced that the osillating motion of the pads as one peddles , and the friction this generates , requires more effort from the rider to propel the bike.I have retired the Easy Seat and replaced it with a split saddle which seems to solve the perineal pressure problem . What looked good on paper proved a disappointment in practice .
 After reading glowing reviews of Easyseat I was most anxious to try it . After 50 miles of constant adjustments , I 'm ready to give up . I ache in places I did n't ache previously . I 'm sore in places that were n't sore before . I average 40-50 miles per week , and the Easyseat is causing that average to drop drastically . I ca n't suffer more than 8 miles per ride with this mis-named product , and I 'm forced to skip every other day because of the soreness . I 'm trying to be patient and give the seat every chance to live up to the glowing reviews . My patience is wearing thin .
 The easy seat appeared to be built well but it did not fit my physical requirements . The vendor was most helpful when we return the item . I Would work with them again .
 Woe to me as I made the mistake of going by the photo which clearly makes it look like a brass cowbell . I did not read the fine print which states it is painted steel . I had spent a fair amount of time looking for the brass version , which I owned years ago . Still felt mislead . I spend thousands at amazon each year since 1994 and this is only the second time a seller hass misled me . tried to phone the vendor and not even voicemail capability . Why am I NOT surprised ?
 Claims to be a `` Michigan St. Spartans '' helmet and shows a picture of a Michigan Wolverines helmet . If this is truly sold by Riddell , they need to learn something about the teams that make products for .
 This is the watch for you , if you do n't need it to monitor your heart rate . It keeps time , nice light , etc , BUT only works sometimes ... I would not purchase again .
 This watch is fine if you are walking for exercise , but not for much else . While I was running I would ALWAYS have to stop to take my heart rate . If it was over 70/75 % it often would n't take my heart rate at all . I could n't even get it to register my heart rate while I was spinning . I would not recommend this watch to anyone who exercises to really push up their heart rate .
 I used this watch last night when running on the treadmill . It would n't take my heart rate while I was running . I had to stop and then -- after a few attempts -- it would finally get a reading . Frequently the readings were way off . It was tremendously frustrating . I do n't think I can return it , because it is used . Thankfully I got it on sale .
 I love the functionality and ease of use of this watch , but I 've had two now in the last two years . They just are n't made well and do n't last . The first one just quit working completely , everything went blank after about a year and changing the battery did n't make a difference . The second one all of a sudden started freaking out , all fields would show 8 's and it would just start beeping incessantly until I either removed the battery or it died . This was particularly irritating when it happened at 3am .
 Purchased this product to prevent going too fast too soon , I 'm running again after sixteen years bringing up children . Only problem is , whenever my heart rate is rapidly approaching my max , the fitwatch fails to give a reading . After I 've slowed down it works , however that is n't when I need it .
 I got this about a year ago . I am a little disappointed with this watch . I noticed that there were a few times while running and trying to take my pulse it would just give up and go back to time . The plastic face piece fell off I would have to snap it back on but it kept coming off . It also did not count my laps , this is a feature I had got used to with a previous watch . I did like that it counts down from five seconds on the timer feature . That is the one feature I am going to miss when I replace it .
 I purchased this watch for my wife as a gift and 5 months later it stopped functioning properly . The concept of a no strap heart monitor is a great one , but in the long run it did not pass the test time . Buyer Beware !
 Purchased from Amazon and a button broken after one month.Contacted with Reebok but got no feedback.Bad quality and bad service !
 Read all the reviews , was OK with not getting a continous heartrate reading , but was a little concerned with the reviews saying the monitor simply did not work . Took a chance anyway and bought one . Guess what ? My monitor simply did not work . Sometimes I would get a heartrate , other times nothing . Unacceptable . Kudos to Amazon for a quick and easy return .
 I bought this heart rate monitor for my daughter who works out regularly . Her feedback is that the monitor does not seem to work very well . First , she has to stop running to take the reading , as other reviewers have mentioned.She finds this annoying because she loses her momentum Then she finds she has to take the reading 4 or 5 times before she gets one that seems reasonable . If you take a few readings within a minute or so , they are not consistent and actually fluctuate quite a bit . She 's stopped using it because it appears to be unreliable .
 Worked great for the first six weeks , then the heart rate function stopped working . Returned to Amazon , but they charged me an $ 8 restocking fee . Huh ? How can they re-sell it ? It 's defective . When you place your order , make sure you ask Customer Service to not ship you THIS ONE .
 I received this watch as a gift . After wearing if for a couple of months doing aerobics , tennis , walking etc I found the calorie count to be way off . There is just no way I spent that many calories . I returned the watch . And I agree the heart rate monitor is a pain to operate . Looking for a new heart rate watch with an accurate calorie count .
 The stopwatch feature on this watch does not allow one to record times for splits . For my wife , this is an essential feature in a running watch . Other potential purchasers might not have a problem with this.The heart rate measuring function works sometimes , not always .
 Alhtough this was an inexpensive heart rate monitor I was drawn to its simplicity and strapless operation . Trouble is it only recorded my heart rate about a quarter of the time . I tried getting it wet underneath and on probes as recommended -LRB- and doing a lot of slobbering ; but it still seldom worked . Just finally beeped and went back to the time . It is also difficult to press probes while running and hold and wait . If you want just a watch and timer it is ok . Does not record amount of time spent in `` zone '' that you set . Not recommended .
 The watch works well as a heart rate monitor , but is terribly inaccurate as a calorie counter .
 This monitor really sucks , it just stopped working ... I mean , if you just need a watch that shows you the current date and time , it 's perfect for you!The monitor stopped working like one month after I bought it , now it 's pretty difficult for me to use the warranty since I 'm outside the US.Bottom line , do n't buy it ... I suggest you to save your money or invest a bit more in a better monitor .
 The calorie counter function is extremely inaccurate . In addition , the heart rate function does not work , even after I tried all the suggestions in the manual . In addition , I contacted the manufacturer to see if I could either return the watch or upgrade to a more accurate watch . Since it had been over 30 days since I purchased the watch they would not help me . Do not buy this watch , it is a piece of junk !!
 I tried to change the batteries and the screws warped so they could not be turned by the screwdriver . I went to a jeweler and they were able to change the batteries for me .
 Received the watch and it looks cheap and it does n't work . I call Reebok and no one called me back . I think it needed a battery , but that is not a good way to send a new product to a customer . I am sending it back and going to a sporting goods store this weekend to pick one up . I really should not even have given it one star .
 I loved this watch/monitor . But after just a few uses , the pin attaching the buckle to the plastic strap just sliced right throught the plastic ! Imagine butter and a knife , and you 'll understand the effect of what happened . This is completely useless now . No idea how they could design such a weak piece of plastic to support a metal pin . That was -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks down the drain !
 I am very unhappy with this watch . I bought it specifically for the calorie counter and heart rate monitor . The heart rate monitor works sometimes when I am not working out and NEVER when I am working out . When I check the heart rate it will just kick back and show me what time it is . Yeah it says to wet your fingers and try again , lower your wrist below your heart , wait 3 minutes and try again ... bla bla bla . When you 're at your peak you want to know where your heart rate is . Not 3 minutes later after you are cooling down . I know that I burn at least 1,300-1 ,500 calories during my back to back spin/strength training class and my watch states that I burn less than 1 calorie per minute ?? REALLY ?? Come on !! I would really like my money back . I bought it because it was inexpensive and had decent reviews , but I guess you get what you pay for sometimes ?? My spin instructor bought the same watch from Amazon and she is having the same exact issues . Guess it 's not just me ...
 Calorie counter measures about the same , whether I am sleeping or using the stair stepper at a rate of 3 miles in 30 minutes .
 I was attracted to this watch because of the lack of chest strap ... but there 's a reason REAL heart rate monitors have a chest strap - because they WORK . This monitor works fine when you 're standing still . But if you actually want to use it to work out , think again . It 's really annoying to have to press and hold down the sensors with two fingers to get a read and it barely reads when you 're moving . By the time it reads , you 've already stopped your work out . Also , there 's no way for it to do a calorie count because it 's not monitoring your heart rate during your work out . It must `` guess '' based on the 1 or 2 readings you 're able to get at some point during your work out ... far from accurate.Trust me , go for the strap . I 'm sure you get used to it after a day or two . Wish me luck on returning this one .
 the heart monitor did n't always work ... it would work when I was walking , but not running ... I would even stop a second when I was running to check my heart rate , and it would never work . I ended up returning the product ...
 I recently bought this product for a gift , however from the moment we opened it up it was problematic . It would completely turn off in the middle of use and have to be reset again , this happen at least 20 times in the course of 2 days . We ended up returning this product to Amazon , and it could n't have been easier . Amazon took it back quickly and with no problems , that was really the only bright spot in this pruchase . We may have just had a defective one , but we did end up going with a watch from Polar , and I give that one 5/5 stars . It was much easier to use with absolutely no problems .
 Gives me a reading about one in every ten times I try . I tried making my wrist and fingers damp like the booklet said ... still no luck . I would definitely not recommend this product .
 I love the idea , but unforunately , not quite right . I spent 2 days comparing the rate for the watch to my B/P monitor every hour and found that the watch was off by at least 10 beats too rapid , even just sitting at my computer . The only time they about matched was when I was laying down watching TV . My PCP also does not like these watches for just that reason . Too bad . I read the other reviews before I bought it , and thought it would be great . Use caution when using these watches .
 All arrived fine and seemed to be all it promised . But it does n't pick up the senses from my fingertips so is completely useless to me . I plan to send it back and get a wireless Polar model.For the record , I also have an iPod speaker unit that does n't respond to my fingers . So could be me . Or perhaps is n't for people with smaller fingers .
 I found this hard to use . Even my trainer at the gym tried setting this up for me and said it was more difficult than others out there . I wish I had bought a different brand that was more automatic .
 I loved the idea and purchased it . It was very difficult to hold down the buttons that would not hold down very well . I was very disappointed in the item and am sending it back .
 I wore this watch about 5 times and it quit working . Not sure what is wrong with it . My husband said it was n't the battery and waited to long to return it . I could n't see the display without my reading glasses but they are all that way so I ca n't blame that on the watch . You might have better luck . I may have just got a lemon .
 I bought this watch for my wife - she wanted a heart rate monitor watch with calorie counter . The watch was light and easy to use but the heart rate monitor was 20 - 30 beats per minute above what her heart rate really was . It was also hard to tell if the calorie counter was accurate since it would continue to count calories after you took the watch off . I would not advise anybody to get this watch .
 I wish there were an option of giving NO stars because that 's what this would earn from me . This thing sucks . First of all , you ca n't wear it while swimming . Secondly , the heart rate buttons work only when they feel like it , and third -LRB- and most annoying -RRB- , the calorie counter continues to count calories being burned AFTER YOU 'VE TAKEN OFF THE WATCH !!! What a ripoff !
 i just got mine and i ca n't even figure out how to turn it on .
 Purchased 3 watches to give as gifts . On one the strap broke away from the watch , on another it was impossible to take a pulse . Needless to say , I returned them for credit
 Worked for 2 days then would no longer take HR . Called the company they told me to mail it to them -LRB- at my cost -RRB- and they would fix and return . No thanks !! Great and speedy return process with Amazon . Five stars for customer service from Amazon .
 Watch has great fit and finish . The watch measures heart rate well when you are NOT exercising hard , but is not consistent when you are moving quickly . Obviously that is the time when I want it to work ... Additionally , it will not read heart rate wit dry skin underneath the watch . If you are not sweating , you must moisten the skin under the watch to make good contact . This is most inconvenient . Overall , the idea is great , but not carried out well . I would not recommend the watch to anyone who is looking for consistent , simple heart rate monitoring .
 I was very disappointed by the performance of this watch and ended up returning it . The heart rate function simply would not work consistently . Most of the time , I would press the button and nothing would happen . When I did get a reading it would be wildly different than the reading on my stationary bike -LRB- which I consider to be quite accurate . -RRB- Others seemed to have similar problems with this watch and I should have heeded their advice ! On a positive note , Amazon was great about letting me return it and I got a complete refund . Buy this watch with extreme caution !
 I purchased this watch to monitor my aerobics workouts . It worked fine testing it prior to my work out . I checked my heart rate between each song to make sure I was working in my ` target zone ' . The first 3 checks read fine , then it stopped working completely . The heartrate just would n't register . I tried wetting my fingers , drying my fingers , nothing . When I got home after the workout , it worked fine.It 's also very thick and hits my wristbone uncomfortably .
 When starting to exercise after recovering from heart surgery , keeping tract of your heart rate is important . This watch seemed like a great way to monitor how hard your heart is working . Just put the watch on , press two sensors and you have the answer . Great premise , but it does n't always work ! Your fingers may be too dry , your skin too oily , the watch too loose , your pressure too weak or too strong , etc. . You may find yourself pressing without results so many times that it 's frustrating - a great way to increase your heart rate without even trying . Sometimes it might be easier just counting out the beats yourself .
 It simply does n't work . It did a fine job of taking my heart rate for about three days , and then simply stopped working . The calorie counter never worked , but I did n't particularly care about that feature . I really just wanted to be able to reliably check my heart rate , and I did n't want to spend the money for a Polar heart rate monitor . The manual has VERY limited troubleshooting , and there is no help number or customer service number . Save your money .
 The watch works great until I try to use it when I EXERCISE . It NEVER works for me when I am sweating . What is the point of a heat rate montitor that does not work when you exercise ?
 I was unhappy with this . I reset itself twice in the first couple of weeks requiring me to renter date and time . It did not work while swimming laps . The band was hard to get on and off .
 This watch works fine and all the other features seem to be great , but as a HRM it simply does n't do the job I need ! In one 45 minute session on an elliptical it thought I burned 700 + calories , while the machine and another heart rate monitor both read as me burning about 250 . I got this for Christmas otherwise I would have been shopping for a HRM with a chest strap like the Polar F6 , which I will probably buy soon .
 Unhappy enough to write my first review . I 've owned two seamasters , both automatics . First I purchased online , did n't work . I am a tri-athlete , scuba-diver and mountain climber . I run at least three miles per day with the watch on , but usually exercise more , so movement to charge watch is n't an issue . Anyway , the first one stopped working about three weeks after I bought it . I 'd taken it swimming , running and diving . So I returned it and bought one from an authorized Omega dealer . This one was better , it worked for about three months . Up to that point , I 'd only taken it running , never even got it wet . Took it in for repair , got it back in SIX WEEKS . Worked for another three months . During that time I took it mountaineering -LRB- only 16K ft -RRB- , running and windsurfing . Stopped again . Took it back , gone another six weeks . Got it back , stopped again after about one month . I left it on my bureau for a while , then took it back a few days ago . Anyway , at this point the warranty is expired , so I am not hopeful . Three possibilities
 The Omega Seamaster is a great watch , but I suddenly noticed that the crown was not screwed down tight . I can not screw the crown down and it wobbles . This renders the watch useless . I called about the so called Amazon Warranty but it does not cover the crown or most other parts . You better read the not covered section of the warranty before any purchase from Amazon . Amazon says it is not covered by Omega because it was not purchased from an authorized dealer . They said to bad the watch still works and we do n't cover the crown .
 I took this pole out and got to use it for about 30 minutes before I finally caught a small fish , and the pole broke in half ! I 've been fishing for years and never had this happen , and it was n't even a big fish !
 Not so impressed with the water bottle . I feel that it is too expensive for the quality . The holder probably cost more than the actual bottle . It is also not dishwasher safe .
 This is just a large bottle that you have to unscrew a cap and drink out of a 2 '' diameter hole . The holder does not insulate as well . This was designed by an engineer , not a user .
 I like to carry water when I 'm walking , and was looking for a solution that could carry water , keep it cold and be more flexible about being carried in a hand , on a belt , etc. . I first tried using it while on my treadmill , and found that the velcro strap just does n't hold if you 've got it full of water ; it loosens a little bit with every step . It 's also * quite * heavy when full . I 'm also very nervous about hard plastic bottles with the health concerns . On the plus side , it does offer flexibility if you can keep the darn thing on , and has little zippered pockets for keeping keys , money , gels or whatever . I decided it was just money blown , but ended up giving it to my girlfriend , who does n't really use it for its intended purpose , but just carries it around with her when she 's gardening .
 I HAVE BEEN BUYING THESE FLAMINGO HEAD COVERS FOR YEARS . THEY CHANGED THE LOOK OF THEM , AND THE PICTURE DOES NOT MATCH THE ITEM ANYMORE . WAS KINDA DISSAPOINTED , LIKE THE OLD STYLE LOOK BETTER , LIKE WHAT THE PICTURE SHOWS .
 The item was great arrived on time and my wife loved it as a Christmas gift .
 The mat looks like at any minute it can break . Everytime that I used it I would get static all over my hair . The description says that it has a soft layer of comfort ... not true . The only good thing about this is that it is easy to clean
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 The knife is just horrible all around!The matrial for the handle is some kind of fiberglass/material composite I think CRAP!The blade has the little circle atop the blade that is to help with single hand opening . WRONG ! FAIL ! it 's to small to help if anything it 's a hinder ! When the blade is in the closed possition you ca n't use the little stoppers and the base of the blade to assist because they are to small . Just an all around bad design from S&W ; ! Would not recommend this blade to anyone !
 I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands . The average nightly temps were 40-50 F . The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights . The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight . On my second night of the hunt , I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag . It did n't just come off , it literally broke . There was no way to fix this in the back country . I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning . He spent big $ $ $ for his bag and of course , had zero problems with it . Oh well , for the price and free shipping , this is n't too bad of a deal , just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you .
 I bought this sleeping bag essentially for using it indoors , at someone 's place overnight , as an extra piece of bedding with guests etc. I have to say that I am not too impressed with it . It is not very comfortable to sleep in because it is very thin , and I would not recommend using it without a thick rug or a mat underneath . My own home has very thin carpeting and in addition to being very hard and uncomfortable at night , the bag also easily caught the dust off the carpet . The material is soft and nice to touch , but it is just not adequate to sleep in . It also does not fold too well back into the cover bag that it comes with . The cover bag that it comes with is a bad design , and a very narrow opening , making folding and repacking the sleeping bag a 10-15 minute exercise in the morning.Although the design looks nice in the photo on Amazon , in person when you 're inside the bag , the big red band running down the middle and splitting into two exactly at the < > spot on your body , also makes it look very ` cheap ' . I suppose that at this price , I should n't expect too much , but I would rather get a better sleeping bag than try and save money and spend it on something I would rarely use .
 I ordered medium . Way too big for mediums . Thigh length is too short . Material is not the best . Also , they charghe s/h for each item you order . Ridicculus . Maybe , might make good winter underwear . Would not order these again .
 Save your money and buy a pair of Hane 's or Fruit of the Loom underwear . It 's the same thing , just alot cheaper . What I really needed was a pair of biking shorts ... padded in the seat .
 I have recently lost 30 lbs . i was n't sure of my new size so I thought it would be safe to get something with a little give . These shorts were perfect . They move with me , they do n't bunch up , They breathe great . They are great for exercise , aerobics or strength fitness . I am totally going to buy more in different colors .
 NOt as firm as described . Feels more like underwear , not like nylong compression shorts .
 When I received this product in the mail , it was broken . Aside from that fact , it seemed flimsy . Do n't purchase .
 The helmet was always falling apart . The padding comes off , and the straps pull away from the body . The elbow and knee pads were fine , but the helmet is junk .
 http://www.thebostonchannel.com/money/3666102/detail.htmlDon't buy this helmet , it does not meet government safety standards and has been recalled .

 I have ordered countless things online and have never been compelled to write a review before . I was completely ecstatic to `` Bears '' down my sons room . Let 's keep in mind that he is 19 months old , so he takes up very little space in his twin size bed nor does he actually ever use this comforter for his blanket . We have had the set for a whopping 6 weeks and already the Bear silkscreen is cracked and peeling off . Since we do n't use it for his blanket we have n't even put it through the washer , I ca n't imagine it being able to endure that since it has n't endured six weeks of being basically a decorative throw . Disappointed does n't even begin to describe how I feel .

 Do not buy these ... they are a discontinued item . I purchased these recently and my son broke them after only 4 games of use . If you care about your child 's safety then do not purchase these !!!!!!!

 The grill was much smaller than we thought . We had the large one but they quit making it . We knew this was smaller but not that small . More for transporting for tailgating . We use it as a fire pit . Not as well made as our old one .
 I cant belive I paid $ 80 for this . I saw a simialr prodict in my local grocery store for $ 13 that would have cooked as well . The bbq does not have any air flow so it wont cook food unless you drill some holes in the bottom . Maybe the worst purchase I havce ever made on Amazon .
 Theraband is a good product . I 've used it in PT and purchased before on line . Blue was not available so I purchased medium red . Upon first use it broke but works okay with doubling . Please make blue available and I will buy .
 These do not hold up well . I was disappointed . It broke within two months . Otherwise , the product does what it is supposed to do , just not for very long .
 I have bought resisitance bands with a variety of strengths in one package in the past , and thought that MEDIUM would be like those in the previous package . This MEDIUM resistance was very flimsy and offered little resistance . Since most companies sell packages with a variety of resistances , and I found that I liked the MEDIUM , I was happy to find that this company was selling just one type in a package . I was very disppointed that I had to send it back . Now I 'm wondering if I should order the HEAVY resistance.Thera-Band 6ft Red Medium Resistance Exercise Band Latex Bands - 6 ft length - Polybag
 This bans is most definitely NOT extra heavy . It 's more like medium . Dot buy this for heavy band . Also , it 's flimsy
 Amazon ad states is a large pistol case . Is by no means large . I can not get a Ruger III with a scope in the case .
 I purchased these from my local gun shop , but when I ordered them I meant to get the Stoney Point Telescoping Explorer Bipods , but the clerk ordered the wrong ones . When they arrived I immediately noticed that they were not the one I initially wanted but figured that I would give the a try . After trying them for myself I found that they were really only useful for shooting from a standing position . They are essentially a set of tent poles that are held together with rubber sheathes at the top . IMO there was no good way to stabilize them when shooting from any other position , I tried angling them and spreading out the legs further but nothing really helped . I would recommend getting the telescoping model if you want to be able to shoot from positions other than standing and you want a pair of shooting sticks that are stable/sturdy . Pros - * lightweight * comes with belt loop carrier for easy transport.Cons - * only useful for shooting from a standing position * not the most stable shooting sticks
 I would not rate this at -20 F. I slept in 33 ' F right after I received it , and I got cold feet and cold in the sleeping bag . I did not have socks on , and I was wearing a t-shirt only ; however , I would expected to stay warmer at the temperature rating . Additionally , the stuff bag is much too small for the sleeping bag . I have tried rolling this bag as tight as I can get it , but it does n't fit in the stuff bag .
 This rubber mounts which should support the weight of the gun one would set on the sticks slips under the weight of the gun . Had to use duct tape to provide more friction / stop the rubber mounts from sliding all the way down the length of the poles . Questionable design flaw .
 I recently bought these shooting stix and found that they just are n't my style . I usually shoot off of a pack or a bipod that is attached to my rifle , but I had to use the stix during an Antelope hunt due to high scrub . I guess it takes some practice to use these properly , which is something I did n't do . So take my review with that in mind , but if you , like me , are looking for something that is an easy substitute for a pack or a bipod , you may not be happy with using shooting stix .
 Bought to fit on a pandora bracelet . Too small for that . Otherwise it is a nice charm .
 it was broken when i recieved it . i sent it back with the ups man as soon as he handed it to me and told him to ship it back . so im waiting for them to send me another one ...
 Although item lookes ok at the screen of my computer , in reality it was not what I expected
 Item is too small for my needs . A seam ripped the same day I received it and that was not due to abuse ... stitching appears to be minimal and nylon material is minimal at best . Called Allen company to discuss the extreme packing inside and was advised that it should not have been filled at all ?? There 's a zipper that should allow filling and unfilling but numerous attempts to open it failed ... again the packing material was far too tight and stressed the zipper . Would not recommend this to anyone for any purpose !
 This was smaller than expected
 Even my strong male friend could not put the legs on this cot.We could not use it for the trip we bought it for . I will try and return it . To give the company benefit of the doubt ... maybe mine was just defective ?!? If we could get it together ... it is light-weight and has the cell phone holder and drink holder and is as large as promised .
 this is a good product but was disappointed that only one dumbell arrived when I thought that they were sold in pairs
 The way the products are linked together is misleading . All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes . thought I was ordering one , got the other . Price and quality where great though . I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them . So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now .
 I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform . They are a terrible cut . They look really like old school gym shorts .
 I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl . These said they were for children . The shorts were adult size . I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them . I threw them in the garbage .
 IT WAS MY MISTAKE . I DID N'T REALIZE THAT THIS ITEM WAS &#34; JUNIOR &#34; SO OF COURSE THEY DID N'T FIT . I DID N'T HAVE A PACKING ORDER SO I COULD N'T RETURN THEM . I 'LL FIND SOME SMALL PERSON TO GIVE THEM TO .
 I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE , and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old !
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .
 These light sticks are made in china , not the U.S. ameriglo is made in the u.s. these are unbranded junk
 I wanted Cylume sticks that have an attachment hook so you can hang or zip-tie the sticks to things like a scuba tank . The sticks I got were useless because they had nothing to tie them on with . I let my son play with them now . Money wasted .
 Nice looking watch but waterproof seals failed after swimming in a pool ! Luminescent numbers barely visible in dark .
 These sheets are just a plain white fitted sheet and plain white top sheet with a vikings pillow case . I could have bought similar sheets for about $ 15 . The only thing that makes them ` Vikings ' sheets is the pillow case . A serious rip off .
 Works as advertised , except ... One of the attachment straps broke the 3rd day . No particular stress applied or anything . I 'm going to Allen to see if I can get a replacement.That was my only complaint . Otherwise , it 's fine . Then again , breaking on the 3rd use is a big complaint .

 Just A Warning!I would give them 0 stars if possible ... I ordered this item well over a month ago ... I have yet to received it or had updates by this merchent . Their communication is very poor all around . You will regret ordering this or dealing with this merchant . I e-mailed to contact them , so their goes 24 hours waiting for a reply . If you call there goes a half hour easy . I was told a week ago my order is in and will be shipped ... yesterday they stated the same thing ` We just received the item in and it will be shipped soon . ' Now they are saying it is on a truck out but no tracking number as of yet ??? This has truly been a waste of time . I do not trust this merchant or their customer care personal repeatedly lying to me and being extremely rude . Very ... Extremely Unprofessional ! The delivery date stated on amazon is incorrect ... the merchant is not following these dates if so I would have received it over 3 weeks ago . I already canceled another order through this merchant but I could n't cancel this because it 's on ` The Truck ' `` right ! `` If you plan on ordering this for Christmas ` Do n't ' You wo n't receive it by then.Well , I finally received it . This is what I think so far ; Received Wrong Product ... Covers light to 4 wheeler ! , This product is not the same as advertised here . It does n't have a opening for the light . So if you have a four wheeler with a light near the handle bars , this product will only cover the light up . And it needs to be put together following poorly illustrated directions ... a lot of guess work.This is after the long wait before I received it.Just a word to the wise . And giving you the heads up !
 the socks come with a pocket for the heat pads which get so red hot through movement that it burns . the socks without the hot packs are great and warm enough . those heat pad things are dangerous in my opinion .
 These are fine , thick , well-made socks . Yippee-skip , I could have gotten THAT anywhere for half the price . What sold me was the LIE that the stupid chemical packets would do a thing . They did NOTHING . I am not saying they were inadequately warm , I 'm saying they produced no heat at all ! I just got back from four hours of freezing my feet off at the stadium watching my team lose , and as soon as my feet flaw out , I 'd like to put one of them right up this company 's ... ! You want nice , thick socks ? Fine , buy them . Just do n't think the stupid chemical packets will help . If you want extra heat on a cold day , set fire to the socks .
 No good for skiing . To bulky to fit in boots and do not keep your toes warm -LRB- lack of oxygen ? -RRB- . Disappointing .
 These are just regular socks and when you put the hand warmer in it is difficult to walk comfortably because of the extra bulk . Works ok while sitting and you can loosen your laces .
 I will just echo much of what `` The Shepard '' said about the knife . It 's almost impossible to remove it from the sheath without playing tug of war with yourself . And to make a strange situation even more strange , the belt/boot clip that is an integral part of the sheath is so weak that it is useless for holding the knife in any location ... which is why I no longer own this knife . Rideing my motorcycle today , the knife fell away somewhere on I40 . I do n't miss it ... Lynn Stubblefield
 Smith and Wesson are killing their reputation by selling items made in China . The sheath is plastic and useless for a boot knife since the entire thing comes out when pulling . It does not keep an edge very well and it 's too heavy for its size . My suggestion is move on and get something better for a bit more money .
 It is very tought to pull this knife from the sheath . It has kind of a funny feel and balance . Not crazy about it . It does feel tough like it would stand up to abuse . Good for a boot tucker and not much else .
 I own this very same knife and have for many years . I have always liked Smith and Wesson knives and have very rarely been disappointed in any of them . The knife itself in this set is just about the best boot knife I have ever come across . Not only is the blade made of a thick strong steel , but the handle itself is by far the most comfortable and quality made one I have ever held in a boot knife . Most boot knives are designed like a dagger , with a two sided blade . This one is different in that its more like a skinner , with the handle being a thicker more conformed grip than any other I have come across . It holds a very sharp edge and stays that way through some very heavy cutting with it . Unfortunately the down side of this knife is its all important sheath . For a S&W ; model it is a downright embarrassment . Its particularly disappointing since the knife itself as noted before is a personal favorite of mine and of a heavy quality . I tried really hard to make the sheath on this baby work for I liked the knife so much . The clip on it is cheap and does n't hold on very well . And even that would n't be so bad if the sheath itself was well designed for removing the knife . But its just too hard . One has to wiggle the knife out of the sheath in such a way as to turn it right , then straight , and then right again . Not something you either want to do , or find easy to do when bending over for the whole deal to get at your boot , as is often the case . In most instances you simply give up and pull the sheath off your boot and extract the knife standing up . -LRB- Which still is n't very easy -RRB- . This may be just about the worst sheath combined with the best knife I have come across in a very long time . I wanted very much to make this knife a regular part of my hiking gear , but I just ended up finally keeping it in my shed for working around the yard with . I realize of course that all boot knives are supposed to be a little tougher to extract since they can be more easily jarred loose . But one thats near impossible , or at the very least a pain in the butt of the first order is just as bad . Unfortunately this fine knife is of such a design that I have never been able to find a better sheath that really fits it . Which is really too bad for I like the knife a lot and wish that someone at S&W ; would actually try and remove this knife themselves , for then they would probably see the light and redesign it.In conclusion I can not recommend this boot knife , even with the knife itself being a superior one . You will probably end up doing what I did and trying to make it work , and just eventually becoming fed up with it . If its a really good quality boot knife you want with a truly super sheath system , may I recommend the Columbia River Knife at the enclosed link . Its more expensive , and though the knife is excellent and a good solid carbon steel , I still personally do not like it as much as the S&W. ; But its still a very tough quality built knife that comes with a sheath that is truly everything this S&W ; one is n't . Its a velcro strap design with a sheath that holds the knife very secure , but also can be extracted with just a good snap of your wrist . Check it out . Until S&W ; decides to redesign this really cool knifes sheath , if ever , I can not recommend it ... Columbia River Knife and Tool 2020 AG Russell Sting Razor Sharp Edge Knife
 I like that it is secure in the sheath . However , when I have it on my belt and try to pull it from the sheath , the belt clip lets go of my belt and the knife is still sheathed .

 When I first looked at it I was like Alright . It looked awesome but I went to go shoot it and it did n't shoot very fast and it does n't have a hop up system so it curves down . But if you are bying it for the looks then go for it . One other thing though it is not very heavy so it does n't feel realistic . But I do not recomend this gun .
 this is bad for it says the price used to be 29999.99 or something like that and that is a lie even real pistols dont cost that much they just want to lure you into this product !

 First of all , BicycleSourceUS sent a defective item . After a long assembly it did not stand upright , and it did not extend straight out from my 4-Runner . It looked awful.Even if this particular item was not defective , the design is horrible . The carrier is VERY heavy , and really does n't need to be that heavy . One strong man can not lift this item easily . It is difficult to assemble . It took two guys to assemble it with a lot of tools . Once it is on the vehicle it really has to stay there because taking it off requires loosening a heavy bolt , and lifting it , which is very hard to do . When it is on my SUV , to open the SUV hatch , I had to use a knob to unscrew the swing arm , then move the swing arm out , which does n't slide easily . I did n't even have bikes on it yet . This is probably one of the worst designs I have seen . I actually had to laugh at how complicated this carrier is . It is hard to assemble , hard to use , difficult to remove from the vehicle , difficult to open the hatchback , and did n't look right.Apart from the design , BicycleSourceUS refused to accept the item back when I told them it arrived defective . Their policy apparently says that if you take it out of the package , it can not be returned . But obviously you have to take it out of the package to see if it is defective and all the parts are there . After a few disappointing emails with BicycleSourceUS I finally got Amazon to make them accept the return . in the end I had to pay for shipping BOTH ways , and a 15 % restocking fee . I paid over $ 140 after all was said and done . I would not buy this item , and would recommend you work with a seller that has a reasonable return policy and some guarantee that they will send a item that is n't defective .
 Once the bikes were on the rack , it did n't close easily . Also the item came rusty and got further rusted in the first rainstorm . I would n't recommend this for the difference in price the Yakima or Thule are much better .
 This hitch mount is way over complicated design and thus making this thing weights a ton . It 's very difficult to swing open also ... even without any bikes mounted .
 Overall this is a nice box , good size and a nice tote tray . The reason I hate it is my handle always falls off , sometimes you will drop the box . Therefore you must carry it by it 's side indentations . I use it to hold some welding torches and parts so nothing gets harmed when drop but everything in the tote goes all over , just a real pain in the ### . The handle design sucks , buy another box , not this one . Also , due to the top handle design there are openings in the lid so it 's not waterproof !
 I was enchanted by the description , photos and low cost of this Shooters Case . However , five minutes after unpacking , it went back in the shipping box for return . What I liked
 Really wish I paid more attention to the negative reviews . I bought three blankets in purple . These smell really awful . I expected that from the reviews , but had read that the smell was gone after washing . So I washed one according to the instructions . This stained in inside of my washing machine , and huge clumps of wool came off . Now the stupid thing still smells terrible . They are also only 70 % wool , which is not stated in description . The blankets are coarse . I am returning the remaining two , and will probably throw away the one I washed . Wish I could give this no stars .
 The blanket was thin , course and has a smell . It is ok but not what I expected or wanted . I would not recommend it .
 The yoga wool blankets smelled very strongly of `` machine oil '' that no amount of airing would remove . There was an oily residue left on my hands and one of the blankets shed so badly that if you had used it you would be covered with large purple fluff from head to toe . Also had trouble with my return until Amazon stepped in to help .
 I bought these around 5 weeks ago . I work out 6 days a week for 1-2 hours depending on the day , and I have worn these every day during my cardio-aerobic workouts -LRB- 40 minutes or so -RRB- . I sweat a lot when I work out . These wristbands were fine for the first week - fit well and did n't get in the way much . Then they began to smell , presumably from being exposed to human sweat for a week . I tried lightly wiping them down , no luck . So I tried quickly rinsing them under the sink and letting them air-dry after each workout . This worked for around 3 weeks , but during that time the seams began to show signs of rust . Not sure what 's inside these things , but something in there can rust , so there you go . Last week they started to feel loose on my wrists . I tried moving them around , sliding them into different positions , but they kept getting looser . Today Something inside one the bands started abrading my wrist as I worked out . I was distracted by my workout , so I did n't really pay attention to the sensation until it turned into a fairly sharp , scraping pain . I tugged the bands off and finished my workout . I have examined the bands and ca n't really find out exactly what was digging in to me , but it was definitely something on or in the bands . Also , during my inspection I discovered that these things REALLY smell . So I threw them away and sat down to write this review . In retrospect I suppose it was my fault for not thinking through the fact that any workout equipment has to be washable or at least wipeable to have any longevity to them . I do n't recommend them if you 're looking for something to work out seriously to , but if you want to wear them around the house , or during some other non-sweat inducing activity , they 're probably ok . What do you expect for 12 bucks ? Good luck !
 I got these as a part of a gift from a friend and they worked well with regular use for the first 3 weeks . Then they started to smell so I hand washed them and put them to sun dry , that solved that problem . Then the outer fabric started to run and get holes and rust colored marks and they became very slack on my wrist and proved to be more of a hindrance than a work-out asset .
 The weights are a little tight to get on . This poses areal problem if yu have arthritus . Also we keep most of our small exercise items in a basket . Lately we have detected an odor and we narrowed it down to the Weider weights . We removed the weights and the odor disappeared . I would definitely not purchase these again !
 The idea for this product is great . Their execution was terrible . The buttons do not work half the time , very frustrating . Save your money , buy a $ 1 clipboard and a $ 10 stopwatch instead . Trust me on this .
 I purchased this for my clubs , and upon trying it out the zipper broke . Luckily , I still had time to run to the local sports store to purchase a replacement . My money was fully refunded , but was disappointed with the product .
 The net purchased was to large to be legal in my state -LRB- net measured by radius not diameter and not noted in ad -RRB- so I requested authorization to return . Granted a return I asked my wife to make arrangements which she did . The merchant Cheap Humidors insisted upon a very costly return process which my wife trying to please me complied with . It 7 times the amount to return the net as to ship it to me and more then the value of the net . I assure you I will never do business with Cheap Humidors again .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 As other people have noted , the sheath is worthless . It does n't even seem to be made specifically for this knife . I 'll be making a more durable one from card stock , duct tape , and truck bedliner spray . As for the knife , well , it 's ok , but still only a three-star rating for it . I do n't have big ape paws , but the handle on it is still too small . In a fencing-style grip , the pommel stud digs into the heel of my palm . The design of the blade shape leaves a full inch of blade from the hilt unsharpened , so it 's effectively a 3.75 '' blade with a bit of extension , especially if you like to grip it with your thumb on top of the blade . A much better choice for only around $ 30 is theCold Steel Kobun Black Kraton Handle . You 'll get a much better knife with a more usable blade and handle , and a sheath that the knife wo n't pierce when you insert it .
 With the Smith & Wesson name attached , I somehow expected something ... more . It does have a thick heavy blade , but it has a second rate cheesy appearance . The edge looks like it was set with the coarse stone on a bench grinder . It would have taken more than a few licks on a whet stone to straighten it out . The handle was definately a non-slip grip , though short for those with bigger hands . The sheath was the best part of the deal . I resold the knife and bought one with better finish and workmanship .
 I received 5 1991 Fleer , 5 1990 Score Series 1 , 4 1990 Score Series 2 , 5 1989 Pro Set , 5 1991 Score Series 1 , 2 1990 Pro Set , 2 2009 Rookies and Stars , 2 2009 Rookie Class.I was expecting some assortment of years , not a bunch from some terrible years . I Googled the value of wax boxes of these , and most run $ 10 for 36 packs . $ 25 for 5 of each ? That 's ridiculous.I suggest going onto eBay or somewhere else for your cards . I am sure I got ripped off for at least $ 15 -LRB- 60 % of the value -RRB- . Enjoy it Mr. Seller .
 This was the worst card collection i purchased PERIOD !!! Most of the wax packs were opened , and not resealed correctly . When I got to the last packs , at least 4 Packs , The cards were stuck together . This collection is not worth $ 25.00
 these were made horribly . i doubt they are even adidas . the ones i bought at dicks sporting were more money but better quality .
 Not cotton . Very badly made . I do not think it is Adidas . From the quality , it is more like imitations you find in the black market.Size is correct . Fits .
 This game is a SAD imitation version of ICE 's Super Chexx . If you 're looking for a Super Chexx type game , do yourself a favor and save up the money for a SUPER CHEXX ! This game is poorly made and just does n't appear durable . Flimsy construction and poor gameplay.Not worth $ 100 let alone $ 900 . Sadly disappointed in the one that I checked out .
 Jimmy either does n't know what pistol model he actually has or does n't know how a holster should fit a firearm . Or perhaps he actually purchased the 8 '' version and not the 6 '' version . I purchased the 6 '' version after searching high and low for a low-cost alternative to a custom holster for my Taurus Raging Judge Magnum . I found this Bianchi model and Jimmy 's review stating that it fits `` like a glove . '' If you mean it fits like OJ 's alleged gloves did in his trial , then yes - it does . The chambers on the Raging judge are MUCH larger than those of ordinary revolvers that do n't shoot 3 '' .410 shot shells . This holster is made for a standard large frame revolver . I 'm going to keep it only because my Raging Judge Magnum does `` kind of '' fit into it -- at least well enough to offer some protection in my gun bag.Also , it should be made clear to all that it 's more of a chest rig than a cross-craw shoulder holster . It 's very uncomfortable on the neck when situated under the arm.Finally , if you 're looking for a holster for you Taurus Raging Judge Magnum , this holster is not for you . However , if you still want to give it a shot , do n't bother with the Bianchi 4100H Holster Flap ; it does n't even come close to covering the grip correctly.Still searching for the RIGHT holster for this beast ...
 This sheet set comes with two white sheets with NFL screen-printed on them . Only the pillowcase has the team logo and colors on it . Had I known that I would have just bought a pillowcase and some plain white sheets , the screen-printing took several washings before it was n't uncomfortable against my skin . Honestly , this sheet set is a ripoff . If you really want a sheet set of your favorite team there are better ones out there .
 I ordered this watch in February ' 07 , and I believe there are two misleading things in the product description . First , the watch does not feature `` Japanese quartz movement . '' It features automatic winding , which means that it does not use a battery , but rather the motion of the wearer 's wrist to keep the watch running . Second , when I received the watch , the Croton warranty was expressly disclaimed , and a one-year Amazon warranty was all that was provided.As noted by another reviewer , there are no detailed instructions , and this model was not listed on the Croton website . While I was able to obtain general instructions there , I still had to go to a jeweler to show me how to set it the first time.The biggest problem -- it does n't keep time . According to Croton , four hours of wear will keep an automatic winding watch running for 30 hours . I wear a watch at least 10 hours a day , everyday . Nonetheless , I had to set this watch constantly , and it got worse as time went on . It 's not worth $ 5 , if you are interested in a watch that can provide even a gross approximation of the correct time .
 The watch is a great looking watch but it 's brought more headaches then compliments . The time constantly falls behind . Apparently , the more you wear it the more accurate the time will be . I always wear my watch and it still shows me the wrong time and date . It 's cool that the date shows up in shorthand Spanish or English , but it does n't allow for you to set it the way you want it to , either . I also had looked up this model after purchase on the Croton website , but could not find ANY information on it . It took me a while after playing with it to figure out to change the settings on it , Amazon did not provide decent instructions for care .
 esta muy bonita pero hay que especificar mejor la talla por que yo soy '' L '' y m la enviaron '' LT '' y me queda muy grande pero es de buena calidad
 sucks , the pads are too bulky and its not the snap like it shows in the picture . it does not contour to the knee . waste of money .
 This duffle bag listed is not made from cordura nylon . It 's a Rothco cotton canvas duffle bag , measuring 22 '' by 38 '' . By no means is the actual bag substandard , it is what it is . An Indian made cotton duffle bag , sold by other competitors for approximately the same price and can be bought from Amazon with free shipping.If your 're looking for a cordura nylon duffle bag , research and contact the vendor , before you purchase .
 before i purchase this mcgard propeller lock 74039 , i called mcgard and they told me it would fit my outboard . somebody needs to get there act togeather at mcgard . it will not fit my 2011 mercury 40hp efi . do not waste your time because the description from mcgard is wrong . very disappointed .
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .
 IT WAS MY MISTAKE . I DID N'T REALIZE THAT THIS ITEM WAS &#34; JUNIOR &#34; SO OF COURSE THEY DID N'T FIT . I DID N'T HAVE A PACKING ORDER SO I COULD N'T RETURN THEM . I 'LL FIND SOME SMALL PERSON TO GIVE THEM TO .
 I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE , and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old !
 I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform . They are a terrible cut . They look really like old school gym shorts .
 I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl . These said they were for children . The shorts were adult size . I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them . I threw them in the garbage .
 The way the products are linked together is misleading . All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes . thought I was ordering one , got the other . Price and quality where great though . I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them . So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now .
 I saw these in a store , and nearly bought one . The leaf-shaped scale is a really nice improvement.But the lock spring pushes past the blade . It barely touches , and just springs right past , so the blade does not lock open.I tried 3 of them , and they were all in similar condition . One of them just barely catches the blade , but would fail with a light touch .
 The description was not helpful to us . We were looking for a much tighter fit . The shirt was loose fit .
 Waited over a month for this shirt to arrive in the mail . Most likely came from a knock off chinese factory . NOT the UA Tech shirt . Tag says it has 5 % elastane in the fabric , but it does n't , so I can only assume this is not authentic Under Armour clothing . I own several products from UA and a couple UA Tech shirts . This does not resemble any of them and feels exactly like a shirt that I have from them that is 100 % polyester . I wont be sending this shirt back , because I have already waited a month for it and wont be wasting my time . From now on i will only be purchasing my clothes from the brands website , if Amazon is going to allow knockoff companies to copyright other brands products .
 i recently ordered a Large one , but it 's bigger than large . i think it 's like XL or something like that . i just waste $ 17 . i would n't recommend this .
 -LSB- UPDATE -RSB- - Under Armour has a new updated version of the UA Tech -LRB- tm -RRB- T-Shirt that is awesome ! My review below applies to the old version ... the ones that I received when I ordered from this page before . Looking at the images I believe that they are now shipping the new version -LRB- based on appearance and colors -RRB- but , I do n't know for sure . Please consider this when reading my review . I will leave my rating at 1 star until I order one and verify that they are shipping the good version.I purchased about 6 of these shirts , 3 at Amazon and a few more at a local Sports Authority . All of these shirts had the same core problems : Poor Quality - They are irregularly cut , from one shirt to the next they fit differently . Some had tight collars , others were lose and baggy , some were a bit too long.Clingy and Itchy - These shirts cling to everything , including themselves . Performance shirts like this should be smooth and move with you . These shirts grab onto my workout shorts and running pants and then pull and stretch when I move . Also , there 's a peculiar scratchy roughness to the material that makes them slightly itchy.I 'm really surprised that UA put their name on this product . I have many other UA shirts , shorts and underwear and they all perform exceptionally well . These shirts simply have no redeeming qualities ... yeah , they 're inexpensive -LRB- aka cheap -RRB- and you get what you pay for . My advice
 I have others UA products and they are really good , but this item that i 've got it 's not.I dont recommend , the material it 's not like the others . Looks like a normal sleeve .
 This shirt definitely disappointed . All my work out shirts are cotton so I needed to upgrade especially since I am one to sweat . The reviews were overall good so I went for this one . But it did not deliver . Reviews claimed it was comfortable -LRB- reviewers even claimed to use this as lounge - and sleepwear -RRB- but it is not . At all . It is scratchy and rough and fibery . It 's cut oddly so it has a strange shape , especially at the neckline and the rim . It has strings coming out of it . And to top it off , it 's overpriced . Do not get this . Look elsewhere . I have not tried other UA products so these issues may or may not be restricted to this specific UA product but if I were looking to buy another work out shirt I would try a different brand .
 I spect something better from under armour ... the material of the shirt it 's so common , 95 % cotton and 5 % expandex and the shirt collar is tight and itching , if you want something better try this shirt : Under Armour HeatGear Compression and dont forget to buy a size up .
 This item is not the snug fitting , smooth feeling under armour heat gear I have come to love . This is a loose cut synthetic tee shirt . The material is very thin and cheap feeling . It has that itchy , plastic-like feel against the skin . The materials performance is irrelevant to me at this point since I do n't even like putting it on . The shirts cut and style give it a very different range of applications than the traditional under armour apparel . This was my mistake . A similar quality synthetic `` tech '' tee shirt can be purchased at wal mart for much less than I paid for this thing .
 WARNING IT 'S NOT ACTUALLY ARMOR , IT 'S ARMOUR PROBABLY FRENCH BECAUSE THIS THING DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINTS BULLETS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY .
 I bought the large and was very disappointed with the fit . Very baggy - wears like a regular tshirt so it is n't worth the price at all .
 I bought this tool at a bike store . Before buying , I carefully checked the fit specifications on the Park Tool web site . On two different bikes with seemingly typical six notch bottom bracket lock rings that measure within the published specification range of the tool manufacturer , this tool does not fit well enough to allow me to put sufficient force on the lock ring to turn the lock ring and it tends to damage the lock ring because it does not fit properly . The bike store salesperson was careful to warn me that once the tool is out of the package , they do not give returns .
 I bought this tool because a biking forum said is would fit the lockring on my bikes cassette . It does not . The large opening 's teeth do not line up with the grooves and the single tooth can not get a good angle and is too large to fit -LRB- without modification -RRB- . I would normally give something like this a 3 star -LRB- neutral -RRB- rating because the tool is not at fault for my inability to use it , but in working with it I noticed a few flaws that make it a less useful tool . The most significant one is that the teeth all have heavy beveling , leaving lots of slip room for grooves that are not a perfect fit . The next is that the steel is not of good quality for something that might experience a lot of torque . It may be hard enough for whatever its intended application is , but I ca n't imagine needing a specialty wrench for something that does n't need to be tight .
 Fits the locking ring on my Rans Stratus bottom bracket , but for some reason the teeth that engage the ring are tapered a bit making it hard to keep the wrench on the ring . It slipped several times because of those tapered teeth , making a nice scratch in my paint finish . Good quality overall , but design should have had blunt , squared teeth that stay engaged in the lockring . Park tools are usually flawless , this one disappointed me .
 i hate to waste money but i did with this bag / too narrow in the knee area for me and i do n't like the feel of the padded area that 's supposed to be around your shoulders / its ' hard
 This scope is MUCH LARGER than other NV scopes that I have purchased . However , when it arrived I could n't wait for it to get dark out . So as I patiently waited for nightfall I familiarized myself with the instructions . At dark , I went outside and could n't see anything when I looked through it . The focusing would n't work nor did the IR light . Now , it 's in the box and heading back for credit .
 My bad I foolishly took for granted that when a seller advertises `` as new '' that the article would work . Apparently not so , and my inquiry has gon without response , Have no choice but to take the manufacturers offer for repair . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER delivery was as advertised now it is my problem
 These shifters came on my daughters trek bike and she can not shift back down because its too difficult to turn . grip shifts should not be used on kids bikes , or any bikes for that matter . they should just stop making them and only make the trigger shifters , it would be cheaper in the long run to only make the quality ones .
 I bought this grip shifter dispite the other reviews . When it arrived I put it on my Trek 700 . It has Shimano rear and front derailers . The grip shifter for the front worked but was really fussy about shifting 3-2 . Then the grip shifter for the rear I did n't even put on . The numbers 1-7 on the grip shifter were in opposite order . If you are going to get these grip shifters I would recommend you get the front and rear derailers for them . I returned these grip shifters and went with Sram MTX comp . Hopefully those will work better .
 Came standard with my Trek . After about 150 miles of LEVEL trail riding , the rear shifter starts jumping all over the place . Had bike tuned up at Trek . After a few more rides , problem repeated . I could hear it coming on as the rear cassette would gradually get more and more noisy as I rode , finally , gears start jumping . Took it to another bike shop , he tried valiantly twice to adjust the rear derailler , but the shifter wo n't allow the adjustments to hold because the cable keeps shifting . One look at the internal construction shows why ; the plastic finger fits into a plastic slot and the whole thing is too damned cheap and soft . These shifters suck ! If you can manage to get it into a gear -LRB- forget gears on the inside or outside , you can only select the middle few -RRB- it wont hold the gear you 've selected unless you continually twist a bit to change the cable tension . Not too cool when this requires you to be very careful about your hand positioning . Which brings up another issue ; the mounting collar is so damned wide an adult males hands wont fit on the grips without making constant contact with the shifter collar . If you get these , plan on using handlebar extenders alot !!!
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 Our son wanted an Under Armour Hooded Sweatshirt for Christmas with a draw string . We found one on your site and ordered it . When we got it we found that it did not have a draw string as advertised . We contacted you and sent a photo of the item to show how it was advertised on your site and we were told they did not carry this item with a draw string . That being the case it should not have been listed on your site showing that it had a draw string .
 I have shopped on Amazon for a long time and this is the first time I have been disappointed . I ordered what I thought was a BOYS size medium hoodie , but upon arrival it is a MEN 's medium ; not what I was expecting at all based on the item title . That said , it is an amazingly well made product and feels very warm . Amazon needs to do something about the title of this item since a Men 's medium will not fit my 12 year old and now I have the hassle of returning it .
 I do n't believe this is an authentic piece . Different material . Different size . Disappointed with purchase . I should have returned for my money back .
 Company Under Armour &#34; Ua &#34; sent the wrong size . Problem is I have to pay the postage to . Return it
 I ordered this hoodie in the hopes of wearing it on my trip to colorado for christmas . There was a couple of things that disappointed me about the item
 The chair itself was alright , very short/low back makes it far less comfortable than most . My biggest complaint was the cost of shipping ... far more than the chair was worth . I would not purchase it again .
 I love the Niners , but this t shirt is of poor quality . The material is very thin . -LRB- And they run small -RRB- so if you get one , get the next size up .
 I purchased this as a Christmas present for my grandson . The packaging was pretty beat up and even had a hole n the box . It was close to Christmas so I decided to take it to North Carolina to be assembled . The assemblers say the frame is bent but they might be able to fix it . I do n't know if that is acceptable . I do not want my grandson riding an unsafe bike . I may just return it . This is the first time I have had a problem with a package from Amazon .
 I have to say that this is the first thoroughly disappointing product I bought from Amazon . I purchased this for my son 's 5th birthday . When I took it out of the box the night before his party to put it together , I found a -RRB- that the bike was white and not blue as depicted in the picture ; and b -RRB- that the package was missing a few items - including the SEAT ?!?!? I debated whether or not to order this based on other reviews and cave in given my son 's great love for spider man . My mistake.On the positive side , Amazon was quick to offer a refund -LRB- replacement is not an option as of 8/23/12 given that a number of people had issues with the bike -RRB- . As always , I 'm grateful for Amazon 's customer service .
 The instructions are very bad , still managed to put it together . But the previos person gave up , even put some of the pieces badly assembled into the box . My main complaint is that both the front and rear reflectors are missing !
 Rear wheel with a large hole from the inside and this manufacturing defect , I hope the illustration , and I want to replace the rear wheel only
 I got this for my nephew for Christmas on the insistence of a family member . I chose this bike b/c the kid is obsessed with spider man , but I was skeptical because of the lack of reviews and no mention of a brand name for the bike . It arrived in the box missing all the reflectors , with both wheels warped out of shape , some of the spider man decal speakers coming off , and a crankshaft that was incredibly rough when turned . I wanted to send the bike back , but the family member I ordered the bike for took it to a mechanic to get the crankshaft issue fixed because they were sold on the spider man thing . The bottom line is no bike should come out of the box with the defects this one had . No kids bike should be without reflectors -LRB- it 's not like they 're hard to find , but they should be included with the bike -RRB- , and it should be able to be ridden as soon as assembled . It 's more expensive than comparable bikes on here with good reviews , and it 's likely to arrive with problems and/or mishandled . Do n't bother with this one folks .
 So i bouth this bike for my 4 year old son for Christmas 2012 , when my husband started to asemble one of the metal tube was crowder and the front tire was unable to assemble to the tube ... i was so dissapointment and mad just to imagine my sons reaction for not getting what we asked santa claus . ...
 I ordered this as a Christmas gift and we are glad we attempted to assemble prior to Christmas Eve . After over an hour of trying to get the front tire assembled we gave up and it 's going back ! The fork was too narrow for the tire to even fit on . I read the reviews prior to purchasing and saw that someone else had this issue also but I figured what were the odds of that issue happening again . Apparently pretty good !! My son loves the other bike Santa brought so it worked out but disappointed in this one !
 We bought this bike 5 months ago . It came partially assembled , and we had no problem putting the rest of the bike together . It was attractive , and we were fine w/quality ... but the bike stinks really , really badly . We took our son to a parking lot that was enourmous . When the wind blew I could smell the bike -LRB- kind of a toxic smell that is worse than paint -RRB- . I thought that leaving the bike in our parking garage would solve things ... 5 months later we still ca n't transport the bike in our car because the fumes are so stong .
 I bought this bike from Toys ` R'Us in a box and had to return it because it was next to impossible to assemble and overall built quality was horrible . This is an example of a product produced evidently without any quality control whatsoever . The front wheel was about 3-4 mm wider than the front fork which it was supposed to fit into . There were only two ways to get it in - use brutal force and expand the fork at a risk of damaging it or assemble it incorrectly by removing the nuts which should go inside of the fork . Perhaps this is how toy stores have to do it - but in this case I would not want this bike anyway . The wheel bearing felt overtightened to the level that wheel would not spin freely , the handlebars would turn only with signficant friction and effort . I was amazed to see what kind of junk this bike is . Stay away by all means .
 bike had strong rancid smell most likely tires . I think they are aloud to use outlawed chemicals . seat had a stain from tire . paint had chips . all bearings needed to be repacked with fresh grease . they used some kind of grese that hardened and race was overtightened
 It is poorly constructed . They used substandard bolts for the rear wheel . Traning wheels are junk and dont come with the stabliser to keep them from going backward or foward over even the smallest curb . SAVE your money for something better .
 This `` Spider-Man Bike -LRB- 16-Inch Wheels -RRB- '' , was intended for my Grandson for his BIG Christmas present . Sadly the bike could not be used because both wheels wobbled badly after assembly . My Son-in-Law went to Walmart at 8:30 pm Christmas Eve . He found and purchased a Huffy `` Disney Cars Boys ' Bike '' and Christmas was saved . Lesson Son-in-law learned
 This unit was sold as `` new '' but when it arrived the box looked like it had been opened and taped shut . The instructions say to plug unit A into unit B and assemble by attaching unit C. My box contained only A and C , no B , so it was returned for credit -LRB- I had to pay the return postage -RRB- . I will never order from this supplier again .
 This product has done nothing to curb our pest issues in our backyard area . It does not seem to affect any above ground creature at all that I can tell . I looked out the window one evening to see a rat sitting about 2 inches away from it , completely unaffected . We still have squirrels , racoons , and mice . Though the blue jays do n't seem too fond of the noise it produces .
 I bought 3 of these for my mother 's yard because she was having major problems with mole runs . When the repellers were first installed in early summer , it seemed that they might be working because mole activity decreased a lot . However , this was also when the wet weather ended and the hot , dry period started . Shortly after we got a fair amount of rain , the mole activity resumed . I think that the moles had just gone deeper underground when it was very hot and dry . The repellers are still beeping , so they have not broken , but they are ineffective .
 Pros
 I am surrounded by a forest and have a big problem with chipmunks tunneling under the cement floor of my garage and also into the footing drains of my house . Up until now we have used water traps very effectively but are a lot of work to keep up with and keep clean . Since using this product -LRB- about a month -RRB- we have seen a drop in activity with the chipmunks but they are still around . The directions say it takes a while to work most effectively so I am waiting and watching . Will update progress again in the near future.Update
 There must be regional differences in Gopher sensativities to this device . Some people rave about the success and others , like myself , think they suck . I have one in soft ground in a garden/flower bed and another in an orchard with rock hard dirt between the trees and niether one works . I still have gophers within 3 or 4 feet of the Solar Repellers . We are in the foothills of Norther California and they do not work here .
 At least in New Mexico , these and other sound repellers do not work . Neither does granular deterrent . Traps work IF you find someone who sets them properly .
 I was very happy with this repeller . However , it only worked for 3 months , then quit . I contacted the company and they said the solar battery was probably not charging . They said if I would fax my receipt , they would send another one . I did so that very day ; that was 6 weeks ago and I have not received a new product . You can not get to the batteries to replace them yourself , I tried . Now when I call their customer service number , all I get is a busy signal . So beware!After I posted this review , I got through to the company and they informed me that the unit was on back order and finally arrived . They said I should be receiving my new unit shortly ... hope it lasts longer this time .
 I admit that between the gophers -LRB- as it turned out , moles as well -RRB- and my wife complaining about our back yard being a gopher mound romper room , I was willing to try anything , including these `` Solar Pest Repellers '' . WELL I advise you , RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT ! I repeat , DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT !! I state again , DO NOT WASTE 1 CENT OF YOUR MONEY ON PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT !!!! Like virtually everyone said , it does not work ; no way , not even close !! After trying them in different locations , depths , etc. , etc. . I finially paid a trapper to come out and try his luck -LRB- yes we still have trapper people here -RRB- . WELL , 2 gophers , 2 moles , about 8 days and $ 160.00 later I have been gopher and mole free for nearly 9 months now ... . It took wheelbarrowing and raking about 2 yards of topsoil along with several applications of grass seed and fertilizer , but we are almost back to a `` normal '' looking back yard !! I did NOT get any satisfaction from the company -LRB- Sunforce + other AKA 's -RRB- when I tried to return the 3 I purchased -LRB- too late for Amazon -RRB- . Anyone want to try 3 of these junkers , REALLY CHEAP ???
 I installed the device in our yard in the area where the Gophers were digging.They have continued to dig , as close as 18 '' from the `` Repeller ''
 I purchased two of these to try to control moles that had invaded our neighborhood . At the time they were not running rampant in my yard . I have had the the two repellers installed for around a month . Since I have started using this product the moles have been attracted to them -LRB- as stated in the product guide -RRB- . The only problem is they will not go away and keep coming back to my flower beds.Before spending money on this product , do your homework and research moles . They reportedly are more numerous when the ground is moist , which is what has happened this year . Traps and poisons can remedy the problem but they will still come back.This product did not work for me at all .
 The Sunforce 80001 operates as designed , emitting an intermittent combination of sound and vibration . Unfortunately the moles do n't care . The unit has been in operation for about a month , and there are new mole tunnels with 15 feet of it . It is advertised as covering 6000 sq ft , so the range ought to be about 43 feet in any direction.Save your money .
 I expect new items to be in original packaging but this was in a plain large box in 2 pieces with no instructions , no manufacturing info , no troubleshooting info , no nothing . How long does it need to be exposed to the sun to work ? Does it make sounds ? How deep should it be placed ? Not a clue .
 One evening when I walked down to the lower back yard to see how our watermelons , cantaloupes , honeydews , pumpkins and bird nest gourds were doing , I was shocked and a little miffed that all but the pumpkin and gourds were nothing but stems ... DARN THOSE GROUND HOGS !!! I came across this and thought that perhaps this would work ... and too , I thought that I read in the instructions provided that it would deter rabbits , ground hogs and other rodents ... well , no . I ended up purchasing a Havaheart trap and have trapped and released 3 ground hogs , 1 skunk -LRB- he was a little guy and cute ! -RRB- and 1 oppossum and now my mellon patch is thriving ... and those plants that were nibbled to just the stems ... they 've bounced back ! So this little contraption is being placed in the garden closer to house ... hopefully , it will deter what ever is eating the squash !
 I installed this in my garden after failing to repel a destructive family of moles using a variety of techniques . It has produced no results even though it does emit vibrations . I had to resort to poison to get rid of them . It is easy to use and install but apparently does not work on all moles .
 This product is completely worthless . It seems to draw more critters like the pied piper . Plus there is a buzz every few seconds that drives us all crazy .
 I do n't know if this thing is working , my gut tells me no . I 've had it in several months now and I 'm still seeing mounds and tunnels throughout my yard . Not to mention the squirrels just stand on top of these to taunt me . So no it probably is n't working at all . Would n't recommend in Florida .
 purchased 4 of these for a large back yard . left them in place plenty of time for them to take effect per the directions . 2 of them made no sound at all 2 of them made noise but had no effect whatsoever . They are made cheaply also . When I went to pull them out to return them two of them broke so they can not be returned and I 'm out about $ 100 . I read the mixed reviews but thought I 'd give it a try anyway . Do n't waste your time or money .
 These things do n't work . We have had them before and they were wonderful and did the job but these do nothing and we are out the money for 2 of them .
 I was tasked by my wife to rid her garden of the voles . Unfortunately , this is not the device for that task . Our Garden is very small at approx 150 sq ft. We purchased one of these and placed it in the center . Even though the unit appears to be operating correctly , the voles are tunneling within 4 inches of the unit . They do n't seem to be affected by this unit . Our neighborhood cats have delivered 4 voles to my driveway in the last month . Maybe i need to stick to feeding the cats.I give it two starts just for the fact the unit was received in a well packaged box with very quick shipping .
 Since I purchased this item , it seems to attract pest . I wish I could returned it . It was a waist of money .
 I had previously read the reviews and I chose to ignore them thinking that perhaps they were competitors/saboteurs etc. . I wish I had n't . Quite simply it did nothing but make another hole on the ground.I think the idea that this product would work makes sense but the technology is simply not there.Save your money .
 We are in Colorado and are plagued with pocket gophers . We have had these pest repellers in our lawn for over 2 years and I have yet to see any difference in the hungry pests digging patterns . I think they chuckle and use it as a beacon to know where in the garden are the tastier roots and bulbs.Maybe it works for some people because they have moles . I bet a lot of people do n't even know what they have in their lawn - for months , my wife and I debated whether we had pocket gophers or voles . I know we have pocket gophers because we 've captured and released over a dozen.These do n't work . What works is the wash , catch and release program . My wife takes the hose , floods all of their tunnels and air holes . Sometimes it takes hours to get one to surface and does n't always work . Once they surface , scoop them up in a bucket and take to a nearby national forest , open space or park.Also works to build garden boxes with tough wire mesh on the bottom.Good luck !
 Like another poster mentioned , the mole actually seems to have an affinity for this junk . The day after I placed the rod in the soil , the mole dug a tunnel right next to it ! I assume most of the positive posts are from people associated with this product .
 I bought two because I wanted to place them before going out of town . Both arrived on time in working order , but on my return two weeks later only one of them was still working .
 The moles taunt me as they push up the mounds next to the `` solar pest repeller '' . Sorry folks . This just does n't work .
 Save all your packaging and be prepared to return the product .1 -RRB- Here is how you can test the product -LRB- without doing any technical work -RRB- . After assembling per instructions , cover the solar top so that it gets no light . This will force the unit to run off the batteries -LRB- which come pre-charged -RRB- . You will hear the unit hum/vibrate , as it should . Leave it like that for a few days to drain the batteries . After you are sure the batteries are drained -LRB- unit no longer makes intermittent hums/vibrations -RRB- , remove the solar cover , and take it outside in the sun . Make sure the solar collector is getting direct sun . If the unit is wired correctly it will resume operation and the batteries will recharge . Congratulations , you have received operational product .2 -RRB- Here is how you can repair the product -LRB- if you do n't want to send it back for a refund -RRB- . A -RRB- Remove the little screws underneath the top of the product . B -RRB- If you have access to a volt meter , take a reading on solder points where the wires from the solar collector are soldered . If you have to switch the meter leads -LRB- black on red ; red on black -RRB- , to obtain a normal voltage reading , then the solar collector is wired backwards . I got a reading of about -8 volts -LRB- DC -RRB- . C -RRB- The wiring can be corrected by cutting the red and black wires near the middle of the collector . D -RRB- Re-splice to opposites -LRB- connect red to black ; black to red -RRB- . This will correct the problem , but the better way is to re-solder the wires on the printed circuit board in reverse locations . E -RRB- Once you have swapped the wires , and if sunlight is hitting the solar collector , it will start working . F -RRB- You should also pull the battery plug and take a voltage reading on the two little prongs . You should be getting about an 8 VDC reading there as well -LRB- meaning it will recharge the batteries -RRB- . Does the product really work ? Well I do n't know yet , just got them working , but at least the two I purchased are now operational . If I see gopher damage diminish , maybe I will come back and add a star ...
 I had hoped this product would save me from having to put out traps . No luck . One of the younger gophers actually likes to sit on the thing when he suns himself .
 In reading the reviews I guess this is just hit and miss . It seems to have worked for some people , but did n't work at all for me . I do n't like the loud beeping noise , but I would n't mind it if it was repelling the squirrels , if anything I seem to have more of them . It was a waste of money for me .
 Ok I have n't seen any difference but it 's only been a two days . I am wondering however is this thing suppose to vibrate ? I hear the buzzing but I ca n't feel anything moving inside that might annoy the moles in my yard .
 this is the 3 or 4th time things have been screwed up at amazon , got my coffee grinder , sent email about b buzzer no response
 We purchased two Sunforce Solar Pest Repellers to keep rats out of our garden and backyard . We live in an urban area and have children/pets so it seemed that this was a good investment . It would have been if it worked . Just last night , I saw a rat walk right by it without even flinching ! It may work for gophers and moles but not `` rodents '' .
 I am still having trouble with moles I just found new trails where they have woking , so I will be looking for a new solution
 This item is a TOTAL waste of money . I plugged in the solar top , secured it to the post , inserted it into the ground . It was n't quite straight so I pulled it out . As a result the tip -LRB- Which had nothing to do with anything I assembled -RRB- came off ripping the wires off , thus rendering it completely useless . I left the tip eight inches below the grass surface and threw the rest in the recycling bin . What a piece of shit !
 Does n't do what it should . Vibrates fine , I was able to put it in the ground fine , however the voles seem unaffected by the whole thing .
 in stalled in new laid sodded grass area still have gophers and way annoying with a beep every two minutes
 I have tried every known method for getting rid of moles and this was the last step . I put in two and the moles came up right next to the device ... waste of money .
 I 've had this for over a year now . I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product . It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry . That 's what happens in dry weather . The fit is comfortable and it 's otherwise conveniently designed . The fabric in white is quite see-through . Later I purchased Turfer 's `` Womens 's Light Weight Endurance Jacket '' for $ 14.95 and that 's been the perfect windbreaker . It 's now up to $ 19.95 and I 'm ordering another color .
 Well first off I am a big fan of copaq cards but this set let me down big time the black deck is warped very badly the plastic insert tab was pushed so far down it marked the cards on the edge this espn poker nights setup was a waste of money I even bought a another set from a local poker shop to test them same thing warped and dents all on the cards I still love copaq cards thou .
 Bought this for our aspiring scholastic football playing son to use as part of his training program . The goal was to have jump boxes that would cover a range from ~ 12 '' to ~ 24 '' without breaking the bank . This single , adjustable platform seemed to fit the need . The design is good and solid enough for home use , but the steel tubing is definitely too lightweight for commercial or institutional use . The platform top is sturdy plywood covered in a rubber non-skid surface . The built-in wheels make moving the 50 lb unit easy enough . The basic design is sound , with one noteworthy flaw - the bottom of the base is just the painted steel tubing . The result is it will be painted steel on whatever surface you place it on . If that 's a hard surface floor , then both the floor and the bottom of the base will get seriously scratched . It needs some rubber or similar contact pads on the bottom of the base , which can be added following a trip to your local hardware store.In use , a change in platform height requires two people . The top part weighs about 30 lbs , and changing positions requires that all four legs be unpinned , then the top portion repositioned and held in place to nearly line up all four legs simultaneously , and then re-inserting all four locking pins . Since it takes two and some coordinated effort to make changes , this is probably not a platform well suited for someone who expects to change the height frequently . Still , it has it 's utility for infrequent changes of platform height.All fastener parts shipped with the platform are thoroughly coated in a machine oil , so unless you degrease the parts first your hands will get well oiled and the assembled unit will retain that distinct machine oil smell , which may be objectionable to some , particularly in the home interior . Assembly took about 15-minutes , with little help from the rather poor and cryptic instructions . It 's fairly simple bolt or nut and bolt assembly . The instructions make no mention of using washers anywhere even though 31 were included -LRB- the unit needs 32 , so another hardware store buy -RRB- . If you have a reasonable basic knowledge of mechanical assembly and the required metric wrenches -LRB- 2 @ 17-mm -RRB- you 'll have no problem , but if you do n't it may seem rather daunting.If those were the only issues , I might give it 3 stars , but serious packaging problems led me to downgrade the rating to 2 stars . The shipped unit weighs close to 60 lb 's . The box is very low density , soft , corrugated cardboard with double banding in two directions . The inner packing is little more than some low density rigid polystyrene foam around the six outer sides . Given the hard steel nature of the parts and their weight , the foam panels inside get shredded . The result is a collection of steel parts sliding and banging into each other and punching on the outer box . When it arrived the outer box had a sizable hole in it and seriously damaged along the edges . It amazes me after the fact that made it with everything intact and only one scratch and ding on the base unit . I would , however , not expect such luck a second time - this platform is very poorly packaged , and will probably arrive missing parts , somewhat scratched and dinged , or both .
 It only took about ten minutes for us to realize this dive set was a complete waste of -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB- . The fins do n't stay positioned on the feet and the fin on the headpiece causes it to move and unseal the goggles . I strongly recommend against purchasing this product .
 This product is advertised as a pack of decals , but is in reality just a single bumper sticker . The seller claimed it was a mistake made by a second party . I would return it , but the cost to mail it back would be near to what I paid for the product itself . I would not order from this company in the future .
 Beware ! The picture looks good , but you get less than what you pay for.These knives are made from cheap PLASTIC . The blades are indeed metal and are sharp , however , the cheapest grade possible . They do n't last through a single usage.They 're about the quality you 'd expect out of a crackerjack box , except they could be very dangerous as they 're so cheap they 'll break while using them .
 These knives are cheap as mentioned in the other reviews . I used one to cut open a plastic container and the back of the knife broke when i was cutting it . It 's kind of a joke how non durable these knives are.The locking feature for most of the knives sticks , so trying to get the knives close can be a hastle.One pro is that these knives are very cheap and there is no feeling bad if you loose it or throw it away . They do have sharp blades on most of them , but i 'm not sure how quick they wear down or break . Good for dirty jobs that you do n't want to get a $ 50 knife messed up . Just make sure to bring more than one incase one breaks .
 This a very basic offering with knives of questionable quality.If you are intersting in giving away door prizes or using them as stocking stuffers , this may be a good choice.I would n't trust these knives in any outdoor or survival situation.These babies will make great gifts for the in-laws and anyone else you do n't really care about .
 The knife came out of the box plenty sharp but I did n't like the serrated edge at all . It seems to catch on everything and makes filleting and skinning very difficult . Great for cutting off heads but not much else .
 I bought these pads for Promax mechanical disc brakes ... and they did n't fit . My advice to the seller
 I was hoping this would fit from the reviews I read . But they did n't fit my Trek 3900 Disc Promax brakes . One side pad is to thick and wont fit unless all brake componets are all the way loosened and the rotor still rubs . Waste of money , not worth the time to send back .
 I 've had this for over a year now . I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product .

 I used a foam roller in my Physical Therapy . This roller was so hard it hurt my shoulder . It did not feel good at all .
 This foam roll gets the job done at first , but after frequent use the foam breaks down and the roll becomes indented in areas where repeated pressure is applied . A better choice is the EVA -LRB- extra dense -RRB- kind , which will hold up much better over time .
 I purchased this sighting compass because I lost my other one on a recent trip . This one looks identicle to my lost one , but a huge difference in working operations . I have been using a sighting compass for 40 years . The one I lost was over 25 years old . This unit looks the same but I ca n't get the same reading twice in a row . There is not lock to stop and hold the moving dial when closed . This prevents the dial from getting shaken and abused when in your pocket or pack . It is extreamly sensative to metal . This is real important . If your wearing a medal , badge name tag with metal , gunbelt vest or even a zipper - be very careful on your readings . Even my eyeglasses disrupts a correct reading while sighting . I do not believe this is worth the money or even owning . Look to a little better quality and one that has a lock for the compass dial . That is what I am going to do ...
 If you truly want a military compass , go ahead and save the necessary $ 70 and buy a good one , perhaps ordering it from Ranger Joe 's in Columbus GA. . It 's worth it , for a compass far more durable than this one .
 This compass gave wildly varying results for repetitive measurements . I expected better from Brunton even if it is inexpensive . As a child , I got a better compass out of a Crackerjack box . Read the fine print , Amazon will not take this as a return .
 I bought two and only one worked ok.I will make this short.Spend the money and buy a good one that works well.Amazon would not take it back because of what it is filled with .
 I bought this compass from a gun shop for 10 dollars as a gift . It dose not point north , the sight hair was loose at first then it fell out . If you are planning a hunting or hiking trip and need a compass you can trust with your life , this one is the wrong choice ! You will be as good as dead if you truly need to use it ! In the event you do think your life will depend on a compass try this one Cammenga Model 3H Tritium Lensatic Compass . I used it while in the army and still do . It works like it should every time , It is worth every cent .
 I bought this for my bug out bag , thinking it would work like a compass should because it had decent reviews.Well the one i got did n't work . sometimes it rotated when i turned , and sometimes it didnt ... Cheap Garbage made in china crap , do not buy !
 At first I loved this bag . It was exactly the size I thought it would be hand carried everything I needed just right . It was n't `` perfect '' , but nothing ever is . After the first and second day of use I 'd have rated it a 4.5 / 5 stars . Then the third day I noticed that all the running around with the bag had caused the dye to rub off on my shorts , temporarily staining them . I was , understandably , upset . After washing my shorts and the bag , the shorts were fine but the bag had basically run and the dye had come out of the bag in streaks . This lead to an almost ` camouflage ' look but with the wrong colors - the color of the bag , a faded version of that color , and an off white -LRB- the natural color of the fabric . The bag was washed with just soap in cold water , so that to be screams ` bad ' . I 'll be returning this item for a full refund . I 'll give it another chance with the replacement , but I 'm going to soak it in cold water overnight before using .
 I got this messenger bag about a month ago and have been using it daily . It 's roomy and comfortable , and works fine for carrying the small amount of stuff that I need for work . After using it for 6 + weeks , the stitching on one of the arms has begun to come apart . This is very dissappointing based on the excellent reviews that the bag has received and since I use it very lightly . It 's on my shoulder maybe 10 minutes per day and I 've been carrying 5-7 lbs . of stuff at most . Maybe I can try sewing it perhaps . The price is very low , so maybe sometimes you do get what you pay for . Beware of this product !
 This bag , while great at what it does , is not very durable . The straps fray at the metal brackets and something will eventually give ... my strap just broke today . The metal bracket has a joint that is unprotected and wears away at the fabric of the bag or the strap.If you 're looking for something that lasts more than a year , avoid this product .
 I had this bag for a total of 6 weeks . I never had more than my laptop and one spiral bound notebook in it , and the stitching along the bottom of the bag -LRB- that keeps everything in -RRB- came loose and made a huge hole in the bottom . I was n't overly rough with it and there was no trauma to it . I only used it to carry my laptop and notebook to class . Shortly after that , all of the stitching came out of one side where the strap was attached to the bag . I gave up trying to repair it and bought a bag from a different brand . Do not buy this item .
 I was excited about this messenger bag because A -RRB- I like messenger bags ; and B -RRB- I love the army green color . Also , sometimes I like to pretend I 'm Jack Bauer . But honestly , this bag is very poorly made . Within a few weeks of using it -LRB- and I do use it everyday -RRB- , it started shredding threads that I had to keep getting rid of . Now it 's been less than 6 months and the bag is already at the end of its life . The strap has almost completely deteriorated so now I feel less like Jack Bauer and more like Jack Kerouac after a cross country trip . Also , the return policy sucks so I am stuck with my $ 20 loss . Will make me think twice about buying online . = -LRB- Classic Messenger Bag
 Well the bag looks good and the size/pockets are perfect but the material is very rough . I remember walking around with it and getting my legs bruised . I got it washed a few times and then the thread came off . Since then I have not used the bag . Must give it one more try .
 this is one of the worse bag i ever brought . the color is so disgusting , and nasty . the bag is already ripped out.i do n't recommend anyone to buy this bag . do n't buy it and save your money . this bag is useless and crack .
 I can see how this might be a useful bag for some . For everyday use , I think it 's fairly heavy -LRB- especially with a book or two inside -RRB- , and flops around/flops open . The color was a medium to dark grey , rather than the dark green/olive in the description . There were also two snags in the fabric on the front - I 'm sure they 're inevitable , but I 'd prefer to start clean and do my own snagging.I 've returned this produc .
 I have purchased three of these bags in the past . I use one myself and have given the other two as gifts . They were a great product for the price . I recently ordered several more , and the bags that arrived were not the same . The materials were much lighter , and the overall feel of the product was shoddy and cheap . I think that the original bag -LRB- the one that got good reviews -RRB- might be offered as the Original Heavyweight Classic Messenger Bag . I can not recommend this one .
 This is a great , amazing bag and sturdy , comfy , everything . The only problem with it is that it faded pretty quickly . I do n't take it in the sun ever , not at all , but it did fade a lot . I do n't know why . Anyway , this faded look would be just fine if I were a guy and could hang with a more rugged look , but I 'm a female teacher and kind of think it looks grungy . I like the bag though and still use it sometimes .
 I received it and 3 days later the strap broke , only thing on it was my laptop . Not worth the $ 20
 Bag design seems good for my use , but stitching on inner pocket already unraveled on arrival . Careless manufacture , no inspection . For me , rates a `` 1 '' for overall satisfaction . Will try a replacement and hope for better quality .
 I bought this one long time ago.At first , I liked it . It was cheap and durable.However , I lost my iPod shuffle , a USB memory and some other stuff in it.Problem is that the side pockets are almost open and the flap is just attached to its body with very weak Velcro.So , when you take a nap in a bus and rush into its exit , it can fall down upside down and stuff inside can exit from this bag . It is very easy to lose stuff inside of this.Another problem is that the fabric is too tough . Most of my cotton trousers were worn out when I used this bag .
 Very cheap knife . Blade get 's loose all the time . Very sharp , though it get 's dull easily . Fun to flick open and closed . Not a butterfly knife . I got 5 for about 6 or 7 bucks so I thought it was worth the little money I spent on them .
 I ordered this item for a Xmas gift , however when we put the picture in with the matting it did not fit , the frame and glass were crooked so picture did not fit . However you could not see this in looking at the product only when you tried to fit the picture and matting together in the frame.Very disappointed in this item and would not order anything made by the Memory Company again . I have also contacted the Memory Company who makes this frame to see what their response will be .
 I am an expierenced airsofter . I can tell a good gun whenI shoot it and when i bought this I could tell it wasnt going to be preety . I normally only buy metal gear box guns because the plastic gearboxes break in a few weeks and then the gun sucks . If you want to buy a good gun buy the Desert camo Master sniper which I just recieved and is a bolt action 440 FPs 9with .12 grams its 500 with a 300 yard range and is probably the best gun for its money -RRB- real sniper and my real rifle scope attached to it its my favorite gun of all time . Dont spend more then 150 on a gun or else its really not worth it . For beginners this is still a bad gun . I overcharge it all the time and theres no difference . The problem is that bbs dont even shoot half the time , they roll out of the barrel and onto the ground , WASTE OF AMMO ! Also the front piece broke off within 1 war and bbs can damage its base really easy and its made of cheap flimsy plastic . So please listen to me if you want a good gun dont even bother with this go buy a good $ 80 Master sniper !
 These opinions are from the review of `` Another airsoft buyer '' `` I bought this Steyr AUG by Both Elephant airsoft rifle from another site and i must say it has given me nothing but frustration . I guess i am happy that some people enjoyed it . It only shoots .12 gram bbs at terrible accuracy from 20 feet away . It ca n't even shoot .20 gram bbs more than about ten feet . It wo n't even break a sheet of paper from 20 feet away with .12 gram bbs . When i first fired the gun , the semi-automatic feature did absolutely nothing . The bbs , instead of being launched from the barrel like i expected , simply rolled out of the barrel . The only way it actually fires is if i hold the trigger in full-automatic ; which is a waste of ammo.My clip can hold no more than 30 rounds . The spring in my clip actually jammed once , preventing bbs from being loaded into the chamber . I unjammed the clip spring with a long looped wire and have had no problems since thankfully . One of the oddest things about this airsoft rifle is that the rifle will start to dry fire -LRB- indicating an empty clip -RRB- but upon taking the magazine out i find that two bbs have n't been loaded , spilling out and even getting temporarily stuck in the gun and make an audible rattling sound . This is more than likely because the clip 's feed design does n't reach far enough to put all the bbs in the chamber !!! WHY ??? The only thing that is good about this airsoft rifle is its looks and its fire rate , which can burn through a thirty round clip VERY fast -LRB- which is totally cool for looks -RRB- but leave you empty handed in a battle . The AUG has a very pleasing design , but this airsoft rifle will give you nothing but frustration . Im not even sure if a beginner will like this rifle . I hope this reveiw helps you . `` I agree with her/him , because I buy this rifle and I have the same opinions . This rifle is only to have fun with your friends , but it does n't work if you are in a serious battle.The bad thing is that I am a buyer from another country , a foreign buyer , and I can not return the items , what a bad luck.Well , I hope that my opinions can help a little too .
 ok , got this gun for christmas , brand new out of the box right ? take it out put it together , charge it , load the mags . go outside to shoot it , bb 's go like 20 feet AT MOST and then a few just roll out at the end . the gun was definitely firing you can hear it , but the bb 's just have something against the world and refuse to come out at all . the gun sucks do n't bother .
 i was happy with this product for about 3 days then it stoped working for about a day then it worked but bb 's rolled out the barrel and would stall all the time and trust me im sure this was n't a defective product and was just a cheaply made airsoft gun also the gun shoots like 100 fps
 i got this gun today and i charged it about 4 hrs and i unplugged and it wont fire !!!! i checked everything that it was correct and it still wont fire !!! this gun will waste ur money . dont buy !!!!!!!!!!!! no matter how cool it looks !!!!!!!!!
 This gun was soooooooo bad . I wanted to play with it the first day I got it . Guess what . The clip broke . I got a new clip -LRB- for 10 bucks -RRB- and then The scope had no crosshairs and did n't magnify at all . Please do n't buy this gun . it is a colossal waste of money .
 I got this gun and I immediately charged it for the recommended charge time -LRB- 6-8 hrs -RRB- and i was super excited . As soon as I unplugged it and put the battery in the gun -LRB- fully charged -RRB- the gun shot no further than 30 ft.Having spent nearly $ 60 when you include the shipping and handling , needless to say I was upset . Now i have to send it back , which will cost me about $ 40 to ship it back and i do n't think amazon is gon na pay for it.Trust me , keep looking and find a nicer gun .
 when i got this gun iwas so happy but i charged 4 like 4-5hrs and i tested it and nothing happened . NOTHING !!!!!!!!!!! so if u are looking for a good airsoft , DONT buy this .
 When i got this gun i was so excited . But every time i try to shoot it theres a problem .1 . BB 's get jamed and then 5 come out at once and go 1 foot2 . Handle is wobbly3 . Magazine is very cheap4 . The cocker is also very cheap and does not cock bbs5 . Scope does not magnify6 . BB 's just roll out of the barrelThis is not a good starters gun and not a good gun at all . it was just a waste of money to buy this gun .
 This is the most pitiful excuse for s Styer airsoft gun i have ever seen . This gun is made from VERY cheap plastic . Every time you hold the handle it almost feels like it will fall off . The safety switch stinks , if you push it too hard it will go to far and fall of as well . In addiction , the sights on this gun are usless and inaccuarate . The BB comes out poorly and slowly.There are so many easy things that culd break on this gun .
 All the people above must be lying or i got ripped off . I get my gun load up the mag like it says put the mag in correctly pull the trigger and nothing happens . i Hold the trigger down for full auto and out of those thirty bb 's only 2 came out and they practicslly rolled out . I kept trying and trying . I took the gun apart and couldnt find any problems . The maker sent me another mag . to see if that was the problem but it wasnt . The barrel is messed up because the bb 's from the mag . dont reach highenough for the bb 's to enter the barrel . Even with no bb 's the rpm is probly like30-50 rpm . Really slow and terrible fps . what a waste of money dont buy it .
 My son bought this gun a week ago . We just got it today and my son was shooting it around for about 30 minutes . Then after that he went to soccer practice . After soccer he played with the gun some more . After about 10 minutes the gun started jamming . So he took out the magazine and dumped the BB 's out . It started firing again and then the tigger would n't shoot . The safety was off and so was the spring pull back thing . So he took the magazine feeder out and then this metal piece fell out . Then he tried to take the barrel out and another different piece fell out . Now we ca n't get it back together . We tried calling Airsplat and there was just a recording and we could n't get a hold of them . This gun SUCKS .
 This is an amazing gun for its price , but the quality is terrible . The bb 's will roll out instead of shoot out . i have had this gun for 2 wks . now and it worked only one time when i used it . it now does not work and am shipping it back for a refund.i recomend any m4 or m16 style airsoft guns .
 Used it twice and it will no longer fire , it seems to be working but just makes noise !? Gun wo n't feed bb 's and I have extra magazine so it 's not that.The barrel comes off so I know it 's not clogged . ?? I contacted AirSplat and they were more than helpful on replacing it with a different model . So much that It seems they may have had earlier complaints , but thats just my feeling . Great reseller - bad product .
 my package arrived on time even a little early , i was pretty happy about that . i opened it up and there it was every thing needed was there . I charge it up and load up the clips . i squeeze the trigger and ... nothing , it shots blanks . so i try all the other clips and nope not one shot . Maybe just a defect but my gun sucked : -LRB-
 THIS AD DEPICTS AN -LSB- ... -RSB- GUN ON AIRSPLAT , NOT THE CHEAP PLASTIC GUN THAT COMES INSTEAD .
 to start this is a great gun , but not at all durable.pros : powerfulcool lookingcons : fake scope includedregular sight broke in the first five minuteshandle was flimsy , then broke off in the first daysafety broke after i pulled the trigger oncethe clip it came with was brokenthat may sound like alot of bad , but its all minor details . when you get down to it those things dont really matter
 I purchased a Sniper Rifle AUG Styer Air Gun Powerful 300 FPS from Airsplat and had problems with it the day it was delivered . I contacted/emailed Airsplat several times requesting information on how to have it returned being it was within Airsplat 's 30day warranty period and was given the runaround . One delay after another . Ultimately , Airsplat wanted me to pay again the shipping and handling charge to return it to them ! How could a customer be held responsible to pay to ship it back if already paying to have the defective product shipped initially ! After inquiring about this with Airsplat - They just ignored my question!In any event , AMAZON was nice enough to honor their A-Z guarantee and handle the situation properly and courteously . I thank you Amazon !
 i dont no the company who gave me this gun was thinking i ordered a ... electric gun and i got a freaken spring gun it is such a FREAKEN rip off !!!!!!!!!!!!! pros -LRB- has a speed loader thats it !!!!!!!!! -RRB- -LRB- NON ! -RRB- CONS -LRB- !!! EVERY FREAKEN THING ABOUT IT EXEPT THE SPEED LOADER -RRB-
 i liked the gun at first . it was definitely worth the money for a while . if you try to take it apart though then you have a problem . i do recommend this product to anyone but you should not try to take it apart OR OVERCHARGE IT ... it messes the thing up big time . would also recommend buying AT LEAST two extra clips .
 Apparently many people have had execrable experiences with this gun , so I 'll add mine quickly . I bought the gun from two different vendors , and both guns did not work out of the box . I took the first one apart and found that the inside of the Gearbox was full of broken plastic -LRB- tappet plate I think -RRB- . On a whim , and because it was cheaper than the first one , I got another one . Did n't fire . I took it apart , GB was n't broken , I put it back together and the thing made noise and looked like it would work , but no BBs came out . I smashed them both into scrap , kept the clips , batteries and chargers , and kissed $ 100 + away . If anyone can use the clips and such , contact me . DO N'T BUY ONE unless you want an AUG shaped club .
 I bought this gun for my brother for Christmas and he was ecstatic once he opened it . We took it outside a little while later and started shooting and the first 10 BB 's shot great , but not with the accuracy they advertised . After that , I noticed some BB 's started rolling out of the barrel instead of shooting and the rest of the BB 's we shot , maybe half of them shot to full potential . I then said ok , and thought it may have been the battery , so I went to charge it for a few hours . A few hours later , I unplugged it , plugged it back into the gun , and the gun would not shoot at all . I then looked at the gun , and striped it down , but it looked like nothing was wrong . So I tried it again , and it didnt do anything . I then took another battery , that was the exact same one that came with the gun and plugged it in , but that didnt do anything either , the gun simply broke after maybe 30 shots . It is an awfully made piece of plastic and I HIGHLY advise you to not buy this because chances are it will break within its first hour.I then tried contacting customer service , VIA email and told them my story . Five days later I got a response that simply said
 Gun looks cool but mine sucked . Never worked right . Would fire a few good then the rest about 10 feet and jammed constant . Battery was fully charged and it sounded like it was working right but was n't . I returned it and after a long wait finally got my money back . If you order this your gambling on getting a good gun . Good luck
 This gun only shoots about every 5th BB , and when you first start shooting , it takes about half way down the clip to finally shoot . Sure , it shoots hard when it works , but whats the sense in that if the gun does n't even work ! Do n't get this gun , it would be a terrible investment on your part . Try the M82 , I have that one as well and it is a very solid beginning level assault rifle for airsoft .
 the gun sucks . it hardly ever shoots right . most of the bbs just roll out and i found that you only get about five real shots that actually fly through the air to hit something , but are so weak , they dont even pierce saran wrap ! yea it is terrible and no matter which way you shoot it semi or full auto the clip runs out in about 5 seconds and like i said there is only about 5 shots that go anywhere . its definitely not worth it and a little pistol spring gun like a P-90 is way better and that 's saying a lot . So do n't buy it you 'll reget it like me .
 Pros : - Cheap - Looks Good - Intimidating sound - Pretty heavy -LRB- adding realism -RRB- Cons : - Semi manual does n't work -LRB- The bullet just fell from the barrel with no power -RRB- - Automatic works , but not powerful i shot my roomate within 2 feet and he barely feel anything . - Scope does n't magnify or has crosshair - Magazine made from bad plastic - Front handle is not firmI do n't recommend to buy this gun , unless you want it just for figurine and not going to use it for battle , or outdoor activity . I would recommend you to invest more a little bit more $ $ for better gun .
 pros : it looks very realisticclip holds 57can fix very easilystrong plasticintimidatingvery powerful 9.6 v batterythe gun is the price of the batteryvery high rate of firecons :35 % of them come in the mail brokenhandle wobbles a bitscope does not magnify
 I bought this Steyr AUG by Both Elephant airsoft rifle from another site and i must say it has given me nothing but frustration . I guess i am happy that some people enjoyed it . It only shoots .12 gram bbs at terrible accuracy from 20 feet away . It ca n't even shoot .20 gram bbs more than about ten feet . It wo n't even break a sheet of paper from 20 feet away with .12 gram bbs . When i first fired the gun , the semi-automatic feature did absolutely nothing . The bbs , instead of being launched from the barrel like i expected , simply rolled out of the barrel . The only way it actually fires is if i hold the trigger in full-automatic ; which is a waste of ammo.My clip can hold no more than 30 rounds . The spring in my clip actually jammed once , preventing bbs from being loaded into the chamber . I unjammed the clip spring with a long looped wire and have had no problems since thankfully . One of the oddest things about this airsoft rifle is that the rifle will start to dry fire -LRB- indicating an empty clip -RRB- but upon taking the magazine out i find that two bbs have n't been loaded , spilling out and even getting temporarily stuck in the gun and make an audible rattling sound . This is more than likely because the clip 's feed design does n't reach far enough to put all the bbs in the chamber !!! WHY ??? The only thing that is good about this airsoft rifle is its looks and its fire rate , which can burn through a thirty round clip VERY fast -LRB- which is totally cool for looks -RRB- but leave you empty handed in a battle . The AUG has a very pleasing design , but this airsoft rifle will give you nothing but frustration . Im not even sure if a beginner will like this rifle . I hope this reveiw helps you .
 I orderd this gun to give my son for his birtday after christmas in January . He was so excited to open it . I read the directions and charged the gun fully . When I tried to test the gun , unlock the safety to shoot , the safety was broken and fell out of the gun completely and the trigger would not do anything . Needless to say my , 9 year old was very upset , because he had been patiently waiting and been wanting an airsoft gun like this for some time.The process to return the gun is concerning and I had to pay shipping again to return a non working gun at no fault of my own , now awaiting a new gun which I hope is of better quality . I was not impressed with this quality , but was not given many options on the return . I am concerned the next gun will not be very good quality and if not already broken could break easily and will be a waist of my money . Sincererly , Kelley McLeod 678-575-2601
 I was really excited when I ordered this gun . It seemed pretty cool . So it finally arrives and I open it up . I put everything into place and load it up with a charged battery and a full clip . I fire it once and nothing happens . I try charging the battery again . Still nothing . The trigger was really hard to pull so I tried taking the front off the gun and seeing what was wrong . I could n't find anything out of place . But it still was n't working . I would n't buy this gun if your looking for something good . Go with Double Eagle or UTG if your looking for something in a low price range .
 This gun is COMPLETELY falsely advertised . First of all , it is not 300 FPS , more like 80-100 FPS . After charging it overnight , I took it outside and began to shoot it . The first few shots sort of rolled out of the barrel slowly and then the rest of the 25 shot clip sprayed randomly at a rate that would n't hurt at a point blank range . The accuracy is garbage , the clip capacity is garbage , and the gun quality is garbage . The scope is nothing more than a couple pieces of plastic and a clear piece of glass.If you are into airsoft wars , do not even consider this gun as a sidearm , let alone your only gun . people would run right through your shots , and wreck you . Honestly , you would be better off throwing BBs at your opponent , this gun does no hurt . This gun takes about 5 shots oozing out of the barrel , and then it only shoots 20-30 feet before hitting the ground . It is consisted of cheap plastic , and it actually smells bad when you shoot it . DO NOT BUY THIS GUN .
 Bought this for my husband 's birthday . I was appalled to find out , by reading the warning label , that it contains lead and can cause cancer , birth defects and reproductive problems . It also says to wash your hands after handling . I returned it but had to pay the return fee myself . Not feeling too warm and fuzzy about this purchase !
 I do n't usually write reviews , and I like to stay as positive as possible . But I feel I must warn others about my experience with the store/co . that tried to do business with me through Amazon.In early Nov. . I requested a men 's size Large of the Turfer Unixex Metro Fleece and they sent me an XXL ! Somebody is either in too much of a hurry , or they do n't care , or they ca n't read , or ALL of the above . When I brought it to the company 's attention , they returned a very `` breezy , '' off-hand , reply , again reinforcing my opinion of their lack of attention to matters that count . I returned the size XXL and ordered a L . So far , I have n't heard a word from the co. that sells this item . Frankly , I 've just given up . But I NEVER want to do business with them EVER again .
 Wow ... the size was so far off you could fit 2 people in this v neck sweatshirt . . not happy ... no size chart on the site ... I want to return but they want me to pay the shipping ... do n't order unless you can get some kind of sizing information from them .
 This product was received on time and in very good condition but `` fit '' people beware ! First I should say that I 'm 6 ' 1 '' and 170 lbs . No beer belly here ... and that seems to be part of the problem with the way this product fits . -LRB- Or more accurately does n't fit -RRB- I 'm pretty sure I could curl up into a ball and fit my entire body into the torso of this `` sweater '' without stretching it out . Perhaps this was designed to fit a more `` husky '' body type . If you are short and stocky you have a better chance of being satisfied with this product .

 Listen , I 'm a Red Sox fan so I had to buy this . But it is a big disappointment . Unlike any other lava lamp in the world , it has an ugly coil of metal at the bottom , and reaching up a few inches . I suppose it 's intended to spread the heat around -LRB- funny ; no other lava lamp needs this -RRB- . In any case , you can always see the spring . It 's AWFUL . Adding to this , my first one did n't work at all and they had to send me another one . The base is cheap plastic , and the Red Sox logo was put on crooked . This is a total piece of junk . Do n't buy it .

 These breeches were NOT cotton . They were a polyester/spandex blend , so I returned them . If polyester works in your climate , they were very nice breeches , but in 110 + heat , poly is a no-no . The seller said they would fix the link to the product description , and they may have , but be aware .

 I purchased this knife about 5 days ago . Hoping to have a knife to carry around to open boxes , and basic utility stuff with . Worked well for the first day , then realized that the screw holding onto the blade kept loosening . So I used the hex screw that came in the box to tighten it , only to realize the next day it needed to be tightened again.For the past 5 days since i had it , i have to tighten the knife 4 times . Even if I keep the knife in my pocket the screw still manages to come loose . Casing the blade not to close correctly and hitting the handle.I 'm very disappointed with this knife being that it is a S&W ; a brand I have trusted for years . The seller of this knife was great , got it when it was suppose to arrive . But am returning for the reason stated above . If the knife did work I would give it a 5 out of 5 . The blade is very shape , has n't shown signs of dulling ... even though it has only been 5 days . But the mechanics of it -LRB- at least for my knife -RRB- cased the poor rating . I will not buy this knife again . Unfortunately .

 Literally , they stink ... the buckwheat hulls they used to stuff it were old or bad or something.I bought 2 , and the day they came my brother walked into the house and said `` What smells like rotten ham ? `` I hope it was just a single bad batch but I returned them promptly and shopped locally , where I could smell them first .

 mask is NOT meant for diving , as the lens are plastic , the snorkel is very poor and the purge valve does NOT clear the water out and u end up breathing in water , avoid if you mean to Scuba dive

 I thought these hoops would be better quality because of the price and description . However , they are very , very skinny and are held together with staples . They also do n't weight much , so they are harder to use . I ordered them in hopes of them lasting several years , but I have already started using my old beat up hoops again . I have such a small budget at work , so I am disappointed that I wasted so much money on these hoops .
 I bought these hoops for party favors for my daughter 's party . I first bought the skinny hoops , but they felt too flimsy . I then bought regular hula hoops , and they were perfect . The girls -LRB- ages 4-6 -RRB- loved them and had a lot of fun trying to hula hoop . I would recommend getting the Pull Bouy regular hoops NOT the skinny . These were very flimsy and could be bent or broken easily .
 Each hoop is about as thin as a pen - only about 3/8 '' thick ! The entire stack of hoops is only a few inches high , not at all as shown in the description or photo . The company , eSportsOnline.com , was very helpful when I contacted them . Check out their website for lots of cool stuff . They said the photo should be updated soon to show very thin hoops .

 This gentlemen is correct , they are CRAP ! I 've had 4 of these things on my sailboat , the `` clock '' version had problems , sent it back , service was very good , they sent another , and 6 months later that one had a problem , the `` second '' hand fell off it 's `` axel '' . I think these things are made in CHINA , not really sure , but I have a suspicion!They look cool , but ... Wo n't be buying any more of these until they improve quality !
 I have owned 5 Weems & Plath products and every one had a working problem . Do n't wast Youre money ! This one did not work at all .
 If you want to pay $ 14 for 3/4 of an ounce of 5 % sodium hypochlorite and 95 % water , be my guest . The 5 % ` active ' ingredient , sodium hypochlorite , is common bleach . I did n't know that until I used it and smelled what was obviously bleach . This stuff is an incredible rip off .
 This is the second time I placed an order this product.In both cases the product came leaking inside its plastic bag.Cap was broken on bottle.So far 3 bottles total ordered , and 2 bottles were leaking !!!
 These are nice shorts but I wouldnt call them compression.I was looking for something tight to wear under shorts to helpwith a torn quad and IT band problems . No support/compressionwith these . Nice running short perhaps but not what I was looking for.Sent them back .
 We are huge Razorback fans , so of course this was a must-have for our 12 month old son when riding in the car . Much to my disappointment , It lasted all of 5 days ! Yes , my son did grab it a few times , but def not hard enough to break it or cause it to malfunction . It was just much more cheaply made than I expected it to be . But GO HOGS !!!!
 Well tried using it for the first time and had to go back to the old piece together rod cleaning kit to even get my gun clean , the cable is flemsy as can be , the patches that come with it I can not even get to stay on the end of it and when you do they are so big they will not go down the barrel of a 308 without trimming them , I dont know how many times they come off or got stuck in the barrel and if you do fold them to get them to stay on there it will not go down the barrel of the gun it is so thick . It is nice to pack into hills but if you need to clean it you would be better of cutting off a stick from a tree and making your own rod with then trying to use the cable and patches that come in this kit .
 Each time I 've tried using this setup the swabs get stuck in the barrel . I 've tried folding the patches differently , using more/less CLP , etc. . The rifle is a brand new .308 , so size is not the issue.Don ' t just rely on my review . Talk to the folks at your local shop or range . Ask around -- I sure wish I had . The vast majority of them just laugh when I tell them I started with a pull-through cleaning system . I rely on solid rods for real cleaning and a bore snake for in the field or at the range.This kit is a terrible design , save your money .

 too big , not served to my husband , is very high and needed to buy a large for his long arms but stayed his shirt as a blanket to wrap . the size L is for their arms , if they want to buy a pidanla two sizes of the original .
 I do n't usually write reviews , and I like to stay as positive as possible . But I feel I must warn others about my experience with the store/co . that tried to do business with me through Amazon.In early Nov. . I requested a men 's size Large of the Turfer Unixex Metro Fleece and they sent me an XXL ! Somebody is either in too much of a hurry , or they do n't care , or they ca n't read , or ALL of the above . When I brought it to the company 's attention , they returned a very `` breezy , '' off-hand , reply , again reinforcing my opinion of their lack of attention to matters that count . I returned the size XXL and ordered a L . So far , I have n't heard a word from the co. that sells this item . Frankly , I 've just given up . But I NEVER want to do business with them EVER again .
 Wow ... the size was so far off you could fit 2 people in this v neck sweatshirt . . not happy ... no size chart on the site ... I want to return but they want me to pay the shipping ... do n't order unless you can get some kind of sizing information from them .
 This product was received on time and in very good condition but `` fit '' people beware ! First I should say that I 'm 6 ' 1 '' and 170 lbs . No beer belly here ... and that seems to be part of the problem with the way this product fits . -LRB- Or more accurately does n't fit -RRB- I 'm pretty sure I could curl up into a ball and fit my entire body into the torso of this `` sweater '' without stretching it out . Perhaps this was designed to fit a more `` husky '' body type . If you are short and stocky you have a better chance of being satisfied with this product .
 These are nice shorts but I wouldnt call them compression.I was looking for something tight to wear under shorts to helpwith a torn quad and IT band problems . No support/compressionwith these . Nice running short perhaps but not what I was looking for.Sent them back .
 I purchased two of these thinking I was going to get quality . WRONG . Both of these that I purchased had not only scratches all of them BUT also were chipped on the bottom of the plastics . Buyers BEWARE . If you want quality , look else where .
 These breeches were NOT cotton . They were a polyester/spandex blend , so I returned them . If polyester works in your climate , they were very nice breeches , but in 110 + heat , poly is a no-no . The seller said they would fix the link to the product description , and they may have , but be aware .

 Ordered a `` medium '' for my 15 year old son and found it to be ridiculously large . I normally purchase `` large '' shirts for myself , but this was even comically big on me .
 IN THE SAME YEAR TWO SHIRTS PEDI DIFERFENTES EQUAL SIZE AND THE LAST CAME WITH OTHER FABRIC WHICH I DO NOT LIKE

 I anticipated this software would be the answer to my dreams . Finally I would have one of the best golf instructors in my house looking at every swing and recommending the appropriate changes . Well , hold your horses if you share this dream . This software version is not there yet.The software was very easy to install and setup . Unfortunately , that is where it ends . I was able to have my first swing analyzed perfectly . But then , the software would n't recognize my subsequent swings . I kept swinging and swinging and nothing happened . I do n't think it even realized that I was swinging because the shadow itself did n't move . I had to reboot several times and then eventually it started recognizing my swings again . But that did not last more than 10 - 15 minutes before I had to start all over . Finally , I got so frustrated that I had to turn it off for good.This software needs major revision . When it recognizes my swings , I received a great deal of helpful insight . But the frustration factor was great than the satisfaction facotr . It is a great idea but the swing recognition part is just not there yet . Save your money !
 Shadow Pro 's web site clearly states there is a 30 day money back guarantee on unopened products . I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and have tried to contact shadowpro to return this item which he did not want . They do not return my e-mail requests , there is no address on the web site . If you call the phone number on his site they say we ca n't help you and we do n't have an address either . I would be truly suspect of any product with this type of service . SSwanson
 I installed the product and within 2 weeks the rope and only 10 ' of chain cut through it !! I do NOT recommend this , try and find a better manufactured roller .

 My nephew wanted a Boston Bruins waste basket for Christmas . He found the one he wanted on Amazon . The photo on the web site displayed a can with a bear design not the image of a big letter B . When I received the product , I contacted FansEdge . Their customer service representative admitted that the photo was wrong . He was supposed to send me return shipping . Instead a representative from their parent company called and harrassed me . Told me I had to send the product back at my expense or my credit card would be charged again . Needless to say , I ended up with no Christmas present because it was n't the right product , expenses incurred to return the wrong product and a whole lot of aggravation .
 The ventilation did not perform as well as headsweats . It felt like heat was being trapped . Which is not good because it felt like heat stress was setting in .

 First of all , battery died prematurely twice . Both times it was replaced by a reputable jewler . The third time the jewler told me the watch is dead because of water leakage into the housing . Indeed , there was rust inside the watch . Second of all , to replace the battery , you have to remove the pins from both straps - an incredible feat in itself , since the pins are very difficult to remove . Third , the wrist band is very stiff and uncomfortable . Fourth , the glass face is very reflective and it makes reading the display very difficult . Fifth , when you remove the watch and place it on any surface , chances are that you will depress the light switch on the side of the watch , and then if you do n't notice it , you will drain the battery very fast . Final tally
 Everything that glitters is not gold!Similarly everything that has Nike written on it is not good !! I bought this item from Amazon for a friend in early 2004 . That poor guy had used it for hardly few weeks when the display of it dimmed . So thinking that its a battery issue he replaced tha battery from an authorised shop . Then it worked for another few days , after which it died . It does not display anything at all , let alone keeping time!Since then we have been trying to get this thing repaired , but without any success !! Pure junk in the name of Nike !! Would not recommend any watch of Nike to anyone , you better get a Timex , it may not have `` just do it '' on it but it would at least keep the time !! : -RRB-
 No tackle box guide , no knot tying card . Only 4 small lures , which are worth $ 20 , BUT IF YOU ARE BUYING IT FOR THE PACKAGE , NOT WORTH IT . I bought it for the tackle box guide , since shipping was gon na make the guide @ $ 14 total , figured why not spend an extra $ 10 and get 4 lures and a knot card . Fooled me with the pic . and description .
 I got this for my 8 and 6 year-olds thinking they could get their first experience with a bow and we would n't have to spend too much money . We were so disappointed when they each only had one turn before the bow snapped . It is made of very cheap fiberglass and is dangerous when it snaps like that with string and bow flying . The arrows would only go about 30 feet so hard to hit a target . I highly recommend you keep looking for a decent inexpensive children 's bow as I am .
 Disappointing ... I purchased two of these sets at a local retailer for my 6 year old twins . We had them for a little less than a week when the string popped loose from one side of the metal crimper on BOTH BOWS ! Of course once it pops out it is impossible to put back and tighten up and it 's impossible to get the crimper off the string . I finally cut the string just below the crimper but it was too short to safely knot and put back on the bow . After looking closely , all the youth bows manufactured by Bear Archery use the same method to make the end loops of the string . I will not buy another Bear Archery product , nor would I recommend this to a friend .

 There should be grommetts in the bottom / floor of the bag , so water drains out and the way the shoulder pad is affixed to the sholder strap -LRB- backwards -RRB- makes it impossible to shorten the shoulder strap by more than half , so that you can not adjust the strap to fit snugly under your arm . Tthe best you can do is adjust it so that it hangs at or below your belt . Pretty stupid when you think about it , you are in surf fishing , so it pretty much guarantees that it will get water inside and you will have to empty the bag after each use .
 This thing rusts instantly when it touches salt water . . If your going to be in salt water , stay away ...
 I got black one to fix 4 small tears in a nylon down vest . It 's very easy to use , applies nicely , smooth , lightweight , matched vest perfectly . I wanted to give it 5 stars until now . I just noticed that the tape is coming off around the edges and on some corners from the center to end -LRB- I did round them up and left enough space between the tear and tape edges -RRB- . The vest was hanging in the closet all the time since repair , I did not wash it , and weather conditions were great , it does n't rain very often in our closet ... The tape does not hold to the surface very well . It sticks good and beautifully at first , but it looks like you will have to check and re-stick it constantly . The good thing is it 's very easy to remove without ruining the fabric , there are no glue spots or sticky stuff afterwards .

 My watch arrived and I was initially happy with it , but one day , suddenly , my watch fell and I realized that its wristband had become loose . I thought it might be a simple matter of placing a pin in its right place -LRB- as the watch had come with a puzzling addional pin of the type frequenly used in wristbands . But when I looked more carefully , it was apparent that there were no holes for the pin to go into . Therefore I am left with a perfectly working watch but no way to wear it ... To top it all , I threw away the receipt , so I do n't know where to send it , whether it has any warranty or what ...

 You have to be careful . Do n't shoot the bow and arrow when little kids are around . Do n't let little kids around !! But otherwise it is a very good bow but do n't shoot it at any kid or not even near .
 The ventilation did not perform as well as headsweats . It felt like heat was being trapped . Which is not good because it felt like heat stress was setting in .
 The ball was shipped extremely fast , ordered on a Friday and had it by Tuesday morning . That 's about where the good feelings stopped . We throw and kick it on pavement when on break at work . It lasted about 7 minutes before it started to warp and become deformed . After 3 15-minute breaks , it finally popped . Worst $ 11 I ever spent . I should have known to not buy it since it is a McGregor product . We used them in elementary school until they popped and we went to Voit or something else that actually lasted .
 I finally got these on the bike and was very disappointed.Our 3 yr . old went down the driveway once and became so frustrated , I decided to take them off and return them.The bar is too large and the wheels are way too wobbly.There is nothing EZ about this set of training wheels !
 Great concept but the wheels have too much flexibility and do n't seem to keep the bike steady enough .

 Let 's start with the title of the item `` Steiner Sports Glass Basketball Case . `` The item description goes on to say
 I purchased a Mio Shape Select from amazon once I received it I realized the light did not work . I sent the item back to amazon and they sent me a replacement . The replacement watch was used and had already been returned from someone else . I returned the second watch . I then tried one more time after they assured me the problems were corrected . The third watch 's digital screen was only 1/2 there . The numbers were 1/2 missing . I returned all watches and do not own a Mio shape . I am still awaiting refund for all watches . The first one was purchased over a month ago .
 can not replace battery on unit , no watch shop is equipped to replace batteries and if you send it back they will ship you a defective one in its place ... you get what you pay for-good luck
 I have just received my SECOND Shape Watch from amazon that DOES NOT WORK . I am guessing that Mio dumped damaged goods through this website , but I will impatiently wait for yet another . By the time I test this , it will have been close to 6 weeks from start to finish , and that is assuming my watch even works a third time .
 Heart rate monitor does not work most of the time . It 's supposed to give the BPM within 10 secs and I 've held onto it for over 1 minute and it does n't work . I went to the instruction manuel and it says to use moistened finger ... that does n't help either . If you buy , I hope your buy is better than mine . I 'd rather have my money back !
 The sole purpose of purchasing this product was to determine how many calories I have burned . I can not seem to figure out the calories burned . So this watch is useless to me .
 I bought this thinking it would be great not to have a chest strap during my spin class ... the problem is that it is impossible to keep checking my heart rate and then setting it to get an accurate heart/calorie reading . This is NOT a continuous heart rate monitor . I do n't know about anyone else but there is n't alot of opportunity to STOP in a spin class !! If you are walking or cleaning house it would work but not for any intense cardio workout . I 'm going back to the chest strap !
 I sent this watch back as soon as it came in the mail . It is way too big and bulky on your wrist . Besides it being so big , it also hurt wearing it . I ca n't image wearing this to workout in . The watch is way bigger than most people 's wrists . They need to design a slimer , sleeker watch that fits a women 's wrist .
 I purchased two of these one for my home in PB , AR and one for my home in HS , AR , as I work out in both places . This peice of Junk worked for about a year and just stopped working . Then the other one stopped working in about the same time . I sent one in and they wanted $ 85 dollars up front to look at and estimate repairs . Now the watch is selling for less than that , go figure . They not only get you on the initial purchase they make more money on your ineviable repair if you are that niave to let them get you twice.Stay away from the MIO -LRB- Made in China -RRB- There are much better watches out there that will keep on ticking.Cliff
 The ventilation did not perform as well as headsweats . It felt like heat was being trapped . Which is not good because it felt like heat stress was setting in .
 It is VERY hard to push down the heart rate button , which makes the watch useless . It takes ALOT of finger pressure just to keep the button down . SO hard to get a reading . AVOID !
 Watch goes into different modes with having any buttons pushed then refuses to go into a mode you want , such as heart-rate metering mode , when you do press the button . Works some times , but I only use when I exercise . Too flaky to use all the time .
 Do n't waste your money . In the instructions , Mio says to `` gently '' hold down the lower sensor button , supporting your index finger by pushing against the band clasp with your thumb -LRB- which is a ridiculous design , anyway -RRB- , but I had to press it extremely hard and it still had problems staying in the pulse reading mode . The metal upper sensor is not a good design , either . After getting two readings in twenty attempts , I returned this piece of junk . It was so frustrating to use that it increased my heart rate and cramped my fingers . I just ordered another Mio Breeze from Amazon.com , as my last one worked great and was very easy to use . I 'm not sure why Mio even puts their name on this dud . Spend the extra thirty bucks for the better watch -- you wo n't regret it .
 We bought this watch to avoid the chest strap found with most heart rate monitors . But ended up taking it back after trying it out for quite a while.-It would randomly switch -LRB- and get stuck -RRB- between different modes.-Getting an accurate reading even while sitting still was very difficult . So if you are working out you have to stop completely - which in effect does not give an accurate workout reading . Which is a key part of the sales pitch -LRB- `` Calculates average and highest heart rate during a workout '' -RRB- . - You have to position your fingers in an exact position , then press VERY hard . Even that does n't guarantee a reading . Which means you often have to start over.In short , I do n't recommend it at all .
 I purchased this watch specifically for monitoring my heart rate when I am working out . Well , that was a frustrating proposition . To get your rate while working out you must completely stop and then what appears to be an eternity you May get your heart rate or you have to start all over again while all the while your heart rate is dropping . As a watch its okay and if your getting your resting pulse its fine but once you get moving its so hit and miss that I am looking for a new watch .
 The first time I tired to use this watch for a workout , I gave up halfway through trying to use it . Its reading of the heart rate does not work unless your finger is in the EXACT location , and if you 're not moving.The watch looks nice . I did n't have any problems using it , although I used it very little . I became too frustrated with the ridiculous heart monitor function.To be honest , its a piece of junk .
 this watch is not as good as its description ... i think if your realy serious about training then you should go for a good watch like timex or higher . the looks are not very good . you need to press a button to get heart rate and hold it for 8 seconds ... if your hand slips of it which it does ... u hav to start all over which is annoyn . i have a timex which is way way better than this one . and this watch is also inaccurate in its readings
 This product is a real POS . You have to stop and stand still to use . It took about 20 tries to get a reading . I got so disgusted that I used a hammer to remedy the situation . I could n't return it anyway ... but I sure felt better . Why do manufacturers of any products sell junk ?? Is it because they do n't rely on repeat business or think people wo n't write or read reviews ?? I own a business and I do n't let anything go until it is 100 % . The makers of this watch tested it -LRB- or not -RRB- but just did n't care about whether it performed , only that it sold .
 I bought this and could not get to work , afer about 10 tries I got a bad reading then 3 good then 10 no readings . This was just sitting still . I had my son try it and it worked first 2 times he tried . I went for 15 min walk and got 3 good readings .
 Mio Zone Plus Heart Rate WatchI gave up using it . Most of the time it is impossible to get a reading . Beside , why would anyone sale something showing the date in a format not used in America here ? You will be disappointed like I am
 well when I tried to set the alarm its turned off and never turn on
 When i go the watch it came with a battery and I just thought it was an extra and then my watch died and when i tried to replace the battery it was really difficult and once i got it in the watch didnt work right anymore
 The strapless feature is still a plus , but compared to other mio watches I have purchased for just a slightly higher price , this is an inferior product .
 After purchasing this watch I found that it was very difficult to get it to read my heart rate . I would have to stop whatever I was doing and concentrate on pressing those face plates . Due to this I found it useless for my workouts but it still seemed to be a decent watch . Then the battery died after 3 months . Once I managed to get the back off and put in a new batter I discovered that due to the design of the watch it is nearly impossible to get back together . Apparently you 're meant to throw the watch away when the battery dies . I should have spent a little more and gotten a decent watch instead .
 Very quickly ... You have to press a button , place your fingers , and hold everything VERY still . Even then , it only works about 50 % of the time and when it actually works , I found my resting HR would change 10pts or more within the same 30 seconds.Consider this a defective HRM .
 I do n't like the watch . The heart rate monitor never worked for me , came with bad battery , buttons/navigation are not user friendly , sometime just reset everything -LRB- even the time -RRB- to zero ... I recommend not to buy this watch .
 took awhile to recieve the watch . first battery was dead and it came with another battery and that also was dead . not too happy .
 Thank goodness I bought this product on sale . All the customary sport watch functions are great . However , as a heart-rate-monitor this product sucks . It is erratic in its readings , frequently either overrating my heart rate -LRB- 235 ! -RRB- or underrating it -LRB- 64 -RRB- while walking briskly . Most often , though , I ca n't get a reading at all . During my last -LRB- and final -RRB- use of this product , I was able to get an HR reading only 5 times out of 18 attempts during an hour-and-a-half walk . Would n't use this product again even if it was gift . Too frustrating to use .
 I was disappointed in the sound of the timer since most of the time it is n't audible if you are exercising . The HRM is OK as it is hard to get a reading while exercising . The band is plastic and I am sure will get very smelly . I am returning it .
 There is very little to say . I received the watch in good condition but it would not work . I returned it with no hassle .
 This unit work by getting your pulse from your fingertips . I did not have much luck getting a reading consistently so I did return the item . I really had trouble getting a reading while I was moving , but even when still , it often took several tries to get a read .
 After several weeks of having the watch , I noticed that it is taking longer to check the pulse . I use it at my spinning class and when it is time to check you ca n't move by the slightest or it wo n't read . Maybe it could be the battery .
 I recieved the watch in working order , then things went down hill from there . I started to program the watch.Suddenly , the screen went blank , and it never worked again . I believe it was just defective , and recieved arefund . So all in all , I was satisfied with the service , just not the product .
 These breeches were NOT cotton . They were a polyester/spandex blend , so I returned them . If polyester works in your climate , they were very nice breeches , but in 110 + heat , poly is a no-no . The seller said they would fix the link to the product description , and they may have , but be aware .
 it is very small , more like a toy . It might be good to set it up in your backyard and show your son how to start a small fire .
 The tops that hold everything arent lebel and there bent at different angles and shd prolly just include a manual on folding it
 I wanted to like this product , I did . The concept of a small folding stove that uses natural fuel is awesome . Let me start by saying when I finally received mine from a long backorder , I was giddy . I love gadgets ! My first thought was , `` Wow ! This is kinda heavy ! '' Then as I tried to fold it out , I noticed that the tabs that hold the bottom grate in place were all mismatched and would not secure . Next , there is a small tab that keeps the side from extending out , kind of a stop if you will . Well , it instantly popped off from the lousy tack weld . Where the bare metal was exposed I could see rust . Wait !!! this thing is brand new ! So , now my camp cooker is as ridged as a jellyfish ! And one last negative , the tabs that support your cookware is a complete joke ! I can expect the paint to peel after it 's first use as others have stated . Now , after Armageddon , I might resort to this . I think an old fashion Sterno stove weighs much less , is far more stable AND you still can use natural fuels !
 I bought this cooker for camping and also a back-up for boiling water in the fireplace if we had a power outage.The foldable design is nifty , but the arrangement for putting a pot of water on top is not stable . I tried the cooker with several different pots I might use camping , and was not satisfied . I would have had to hold the pot with one hand while the water heated , leaving only one other hand to manage adding fuel , and anything else that might come up.If I were planning to camp out of my backpack then I think I would be willing to use this little stove - but with little kids , I camp out of a car these days and I will be bringing a larger , more stable set-up . I have returned the stove .
 I admit it . I am a sweathog . When biking on warm or humid days the sweat drips constantly from my head , into my eyes , all over my sunglasses . I bought 2 of these and had high hopes based on reviews . However , they are NOT good for me . I really hoped these would be a solution , but within 20 or 30 minutes they become saturated and begin to act as reservoirs . Soon , the dripping is worse than without them . I also agree with the one reviewer that they seem too big and come down over the tops of my ears.Last night I tried a Halo Headband II , which has a small plastic or rubber ` gasket ' that sits on the inside bottom of the headband an inch above my eyebrows . For the first 45 minutes it really felt that this was a winner but , alas , it was no solution , either . I would rate it better than the SweatVac because the top of my head is uncovered & felt cooler , but the Halo is still inadequate to the task . The gasket did keep sweat out of my eyes until the headband was soaked with sweat . At that point the sweat build up seemed to overwhelm the gasket 's abilities.This weekend I 'm trying something called the SweatGutr , a narrow headband made of all plastic , kind of like silicone . It fits securely against the skin and has an outer channel that acts like a rain gutter to feed sweat to the sides of your face . While I have hopes for it , too , I 've been sorely let down by the SweatVac product , and somewhat let down by the Halo . It 's probably better to have low expecations and be pleasantly surprised than to have high hopes and be let down .
 my boyfriend was very unhappy that it was a bledsow jersey . He is not a good player and did not want this players name on his jersey.The quality was good , and I received it in a timely manner .
 It simply does not work consistantly . It will just annoy you . The readings ; if you get one , will sometimes be 200 + . This would mean your heart is going to explode at any second . It will then throw off the averages of you workout and render readings calculated useless.It does work well when resting or lower readings , but that is not why I need it . I tried two and had the same result for both . I still use it , but it just for the basic functions -LRB- i.e stopwatch -RRB- . I contacted Mio -LRB- not where I bought it -RRB- and got advice from the Tech . that did n't work or apply .
 The watch is not accurate at all . Most of the time , when using a strap it doubles my heart rate.I called customer service twice and have sent two emails - there is no response.I do not recommend this product or company .
 The product came DOD -LRB- dead on delivery -RRB- . Looks like nobody 's checking a product before shipping . Will return it back for refund . Very unhappy :-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB-
 I was disappointed in the performance of this spotting scope . The eye relief is too short , but my main complaint was that the focus is not maintained when changing the magnification setting . That is , when observing an object after properly focusing the scope , re-focusing is always required when the magnification is changed . The more the change , the more correction is needed . This is something that should not be necessary in a good spotting scope .
 The Mio Elite Golf and heart rate watch is chock full of very useful features , among others ; a timer , a course memory function and digital watch . the watch would be quite useful if it worked .
 Very disappointed . Arrived with a dead battery . Had the battery replaced and could not get the heart rate to function . Waited 5 days for MIO to return my call and emails . However , they offered to replace it with another model . Said they were have chronic problems with this model and have discontinued it . I expect a standard replacement soon .
 I really did not get a chance to fully evaluate this product . Thefirst watch arrived with a dead battery . The replacement watchwas running , but broke within a week of using it . The base broke and was not fixable . I returned the watch and asked for my money back.I would not recommend the watch .
 I ordered this item for a Xmas gift , however when we put the picture in with the matting it did not fit , the frame and glass were crooked so picture did not fit . However you could not see this in looking at the product only when you tried to fit the picture and matting together in the frame.Very disappointed in this item and would not order anything made by the Memory Company again . I have also contacted the Memory Company who makes this frame to see what their response will be .
 My first one worked okay for awhile , and then started leaking . Thanks to Amazon , I was able to ship it back -LRB- at my expense -RRB- and get a credit to order another one . The second one -LRB- from California Innovations -RRB- was `` free '' but my shipping cost almost equalled the cost of the new cooler . It again worked for a short time and started leaking also.Don ' t buy this cooler if you plan to put ice in it . The only safe way to use it is with ice packs . That is too bad because it is a nice size cooler but I ca n't put it in the car if I use ice because it gets the carpet all wet .
 WHOOOOOOOOOWW ! This thing is really expensive . 12000 $ !!!!??? Damn !! I dont care what this thing does , with that price you could buy yourself like 3 Vsr snipers , and a Vsr shoots at the same velocity than that this gun . The only reason this gun should cost that is that the motor is made from gold and the piston head from diamond , but i doubt that . After all , it only shoots at 320 , so i dont know why this gun costs so much . I think someone who wrote the price on the sellers page of this gun fell asleep on top of the `` 0 '' button , lol !! No way this gun should cost that much .
 This gun is a ripoff . The motor is a Turbo 2000 . Im getting an ICS mp5 and it has the same motor . It costs around 250 $ .
 I bought these today at a local outdoor store because I needed some new water shoes for paddleboarding . They looked good , appeared well made , but not too fancy , and the price was right . After wearing them today while paddleboarding I think they mis-named the shoes , a more fitting name would be NRS `` water balloons '' because thats what it feels like your wearing on your feet once they get wet . The drainage is very poor due to the high wall construction around most of the shoe and to make matters worse , for some reason a thick innersole was used as you might find in a regular tennis shoe , which contributes to the waterlogged squishy feel . Not recommended

 This is a right hand glove . When we tried to exchange it for a left hand glove , the company happy stated that they would exchange without penalty -LRB- a return charges 15 % restocking fee plus your shipping -RRB- . We followed their instructions to reorder the proper glove with Amazon only to discover that this company had NO left handed gloves with Amazon . No wonder they were so `` helpful '' ...
 This product is described as 100 % cotton . In fact , it is a 58 % poly/42 % cotton blend . I ordered specific colors and received all grey . Amazon needs to correct this listing and ensure that it delivers the products as advertised . I have had good luck over the years with Amazon , but will be reluctant to order any apparel in the future .
 Other sellers are selling the exact same product for $ 2.50 on here . This may be a handy and durable product , but it would NEVER be worth $ 13 ! Do n't buy it here -- you can buy 6 elsewhere for the same amount .
 After considering ordering a custom made tent I decided to hold off and purchase this one . I was looking for a tent that would open up like a screenhouse , this was the only one that I found.-The small windows to the side of the doors close from the inside with zippers on the left and right sides . They are sewn at the bottom and are open on the top.-All the protective flaps over the doors are on the outside of the tent , which means that if you wake to an outside storm you are going to get very wet as you open the screen doors to close the flaps . Make sure you bring a weather radio . Keep in mind that if you prop up a flap like in the photo you will be left with poles and guylines laying on the ground if you need to put the flap down . These flaps do not zip at the bottom , but they do zip down the left and right sides . Also , unlike regular tent windows , you ca n't partially open the large windows if it is hot and sticky and there is a `` chance '' of rain . You have to choose all the way up , or down , and use the small windows for venting.-The screens seem very flimsy - not sure yet if they can hold off the no-see-ums . On the other hand if they had the heavy duty mesh that quality tents have it would be a lot heavier . The screens remind me of the girl scout camp tents from the 70s.-The structure , without the tent , is very flimsy . The tent is what gives it holding power . The tubes are not the heavy ones I am accustomed to with a canvas type cabin tent , these remind me of the tubes that rust out or crack on cheap arbors available at discount stores . They do provide a freestanding unit when the tent or awning is added.-The top of the rainfly is open dangerously close to the top . I would sew it shut but then moisture would condense at the top and drip back into the tent . The awning does n't seem to sag anywhere , on the contrary it all seems nice and tight except for the top vent , which seems to have way too much fabric . Enough to flap in the downbursts of a storm.-The floor is a nice addition if you use it as a screen house . Helps to ensure mosquitos , mice , spiders and snakes do n't snuggle up next to you while you are enjoying yourself.I have decided that this is a tent I would only use during fair weather camping when I can be sure it 's not going to rain but I still need protection from the mosquitos . I would send it back but to order the same setup in canvas would cost about $ 1200 . Maybe I 'll get lucky at a rummage sale ... One person can set up this tent , but it does help if you have previous tent experience . I suggest you practice setting this tent up as the rainfly can be tricky to install.I have been in many tents , through many different types of weather in many different states , but never overseas . I am not impressed by this one , but it is the only one I found of its type.I hate spending money on shipping but this tent is going back to where it came from .
 This tent lasted me less than 24 hours . It 's nice for fair-weather , but that 's what I was expecting based on the weather reports . A hail storm came , and the hail collected on top of the canopy . Because it made the top sag , water was able to collect as well . I had left the campsite and went into town because the storm was getting bad , and when I returned after it cleared up ... I discovered that the tent had collapsed . The metal tubing had buckled -LRB- at the joints -RRB- under the weight of the water/hail . I still like the tent a lot , how it assembles and such ... it 's just not hail storm proof ...
 These gloves are lightweight and effective . But after light to moderate use , the foam disintegrates where the knuckles meet the bag . I hit the bag several times per month , for about 5-10 minutes a session , and these things wore out before the year was up . I would invest in a better pair of gloves .
 I have several pair of NB shorts in size medium and they fit great . But these run extremely small . -LRB- I 'm wondering if this batch was mislabeled . -RRB- They 're also very high-waisted , sitting above my waistline . Try yours on first ! Do n't make the same mistake I did by washing them first , then trying them on thinking they would fit like all my other NB shorts !! No returns for me !
 When i first put these on they felt nice and warm but a little thin . I put them on anyways and began wearing them only to have a hole in one of the socks within 20 minutes of use . I bought two pairs and will be seeing if the other pair also has this issue but i was a little disappointing in it giving out so quickly .
 Disappointed ! The picture shows these sox as ULTIMAX . I have some older ULTIMAX sox and this is not the same . Kept the name and changed the soxs . While these soxs appear to be good soxs , when compared to my previous ULTIMAX they do n't measure up . The original ULTIMAX are thicker and the knitting is visibly denser .
 I ordered L socks . The socks were labeled L . But the socks were very SMALL , do not fit , are useless.Quality , color , fast delivery were fine . But what good is that if I ca n't wear the socks . And I ca n't think of a 10-year old that would wear those socks .
 In its bag , this chair is very small -LRB- about nine inches long and about five inches in diameter -RRB- . You can set it up in seconds . I think it is rated for 300 lbs . I can confirm that it supported 240 . The seat is shaped like a triangle -LRB- like a bicycle seat -RRB- . However , unlike a bicycle seat , this seat is concave . So , if you happen to be a male , you are going to experience some squeezing in a delicate frontal area . I tried it out on my garage floor . The chair 's feet are very small and pointy
 Do n't waste your money on this one . The tripod design hurts men . Buy a lighter Coleman 4 legged stool .
 This HRM will work once maybe twice then will quit . DO NOT BUY IT . Very expensive watch , it is not a heart rate monitor , mine is just a watch , and not very pretty at that .
 The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic . You have a regular burner , and a small grill at the same time . The execution , however , leaves a lot to be desired.Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor . Out of the box , paint was flaking , and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit . The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part.The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit.Reading other reviews I ca n't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number
 It is unfortunate to have to write such a review , but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so . The unit was received new , but the hinges were already rusted , the closure hasp broken -LRB- poorly designed and executed -RRB- , the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp . Made in China , this stove demonstrates no attention to detail , quality control or materials . I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory , much less , off the design table . Further , the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor , if not downright unacceptable -LRB- in major ways -RRB- . As this unit was new in the box , I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers . Save yourself cut hands and returns , buy another brand .
 I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months ! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day ; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience . The burner did not simmer well -LRB- the flame kept creeping back up -RRB- but the grill worked great until the stove itself died . It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly . I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be . Hmmmm . I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one . This one was immediately defective and I took it back . Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more . Camp Chef may be a better , though much more expensive , choice for a person who does a lot of camping .
 I have several pair of NB shorts in size medium and they fit great .

Do n't make the same mistake I did by washing them first , then trying them on thinking they would fit like all my other NB shorts !! No returns for me !
 this was not at all what i ordered . The letters were ironed on not stitched . . It was a gift for my husband and needless to say when he opened it , we were both very disappointed . I was able to return it , but I had to pay shipping !!!

 It took awhile to get here . It was within the range predicted , but at the very end of it . The real disappointment came when my boyfriend -LRB- who I bought this for -RRB- opened it up and put it on . There was a hole in the pocket ! Of course it 's easy to fix , but a new product should n't be flawed.It was also a different fabric than I expected . Of course , I do n't hold the company responsible for that . It 's one of the chances you take when you buy something online and there 's no close-up pic of the fabric . It was very soft fabric , but thin . I 'd say it was more appropriate for summer.If you really want this bathrobe , remember to give it it 's fully predicted shipping time to arrive and do n't be surprised if something is wrong with it .

 Pelican 2680 HeadsUp Lite Recoil LED HeadlampThis light 's battery compartment ismade for 4 AA batteries . It has 8 spring connectors inside instead of 4 springs and 4 solid metal plates -LRB- the normal battery compartment -RRB- . What this means is that normal NiCd batteries work just fine because the `` prong '' end of a NiCd battery has a metal surface all across the top of the battery . What I have found out is that every rechargable NiMH on the market today has only the metal `` prong '' sticking out from a surrounding of paper or plastic . Therefore , when you put that prong end into this light , the spring rests around the `` Prong '' and only touches the plastic or paper core = no connection . I wrote the company before I started bending and fixing , and they never responded or acknowledged receipt . So I just took some long needlenose pliars and crushed the tip of 4 of the springs . Rechargables work fine now . But shame on the company for this design , and shame on their customer support.I have to enter another review now that I have actually dived with the light . Pelican no longer considers any of their headlamp lights certified for submersion of any kind , so the 500 ' `` indestructible '' product description is no longer supported . Pelican was kind enough to swap me my flooded lights -LRB- oh yeah , they flooded totally at 60 ' -RRB- for a pair of their actual dive lights . Note to self
 The one I bought only worked 2 times . I was in the Amazon jungle -LRB- south of Venezuela -RRB- in an expedition and the second day it did not work anymore . After inspecting later at home discovered a bunch of issues
 I have owned 2 Pelican headlamps and the switch failed on both . They are heavy , awkward and cumbersome . They are also under engineered and over priced . Pelican has decent customer service and typically will stand behind their products however .
 I was not impressed at all . I took this light snorkeling at night in six feet of water and it leaked . Also , the light beam is too focused . A larger cone of light would make for a better field of view . Very expensive for an item that is made in China .

 For the price , you would expect this to last more than one round of golf !!! It ripped by the 10th hole , do not reccomend at all !
 This is a terrible golf glove . I bought 3 and 2 of them fell apart before I finished a round of golf . The coating crumbles and then the vents in the glove become holes . A glove should last longer than a round of golf !!!! Save your money on this one !!! They have a manufacturing problem !! Good news to report -- The company is a reputable company . When I contacted them about their glove , they indicated that the seller must not have stored the glove properly or the gloves were too old or seconds when I bought them . They felt this could have accounted for the problem with the glove . They replaced my defective gloves . I love the glove and would buy it again .
 This is a FAKE cheap jersey . I dont know why this user can sell this on AMAZON . This product isnt a original product .
 I have a small cook stove that will not fit . In fact nobody 's stove at the campround will fit .

 I was super excited to get this line because my research pointed to braided lines being superior . On my first cast I knew I had a different animal all together as the line went out so fast that I almost sliced my finger open . I had to use a glove to for the rest of my trip . The real problems come do to the line not holding knots . I used knots specifically for braided lines and they still slipped . Everything time it would slip a knot I lost not only my fish but an expensive leader as I was saltwater fishing . All of these I could deal with until on the last day -LRB- what was going to my last cast -RRB- I cast my bottom rig out like a I did all week and I hear `` rip '' and I whatch my $ 10 leader go flying into the ocean and look down and the line totally failed . I could understand If I have been fishing for 6 months with this stuff as saltwater is harsh on everything but this was 6 days . My mono lines never did that .
 I CAN NOT RATE THIS PRODUCT!I purchased a Century two-piece safety post that was delivered last week ; it was checked and found it was all that I expected from a Century product . At that time I also ordered the Lite ten pound propane cylinder -LRB- LC-10-30 -RRB- , but delivery was delayed and it did not come until today.Upon attempting to marry the two units , to make it into a distribution post to attach the lantern and the camp stove , I found to my dismay that there is no way for the units to mate.Evidently , the Century unit can only attach to the neck of a steel cylinder . There is absolutely no way that the distribution tree can attach to the Lite cylinder 's plastic rim . And it can not stand upon its own , even if the base was a little longer.And in all probability there is nothing that can be done with each of them but to go back to the one-pound propane bottles.But amazingly , Amazon did not alert its customers that the two products are incompatible .
 I have the one piece version . Upon second use the device leaks propane where the top outlet connects to the tube . I could feel the gas shooting out the side so fotunately I did not use it in this condition.Since I did not save the receipt the one year warranty is useless . The manufacturer wanted to charge me $ 25.00 to inspect the product plus $ 12.50 return shipping -LRB- plus my shipping to them -RRB- . Way over the price of a new one.I bought a different brand to replace it .
 this relly sucks its just a big orange garbage bag . whwn i set it up -LRB- which took an hour to get right -RRB- i had to put logs on the inside so the wind didnt blow it over you might as well eat your money because that will help you survive longer than this piece of junk will . minuets after is set it up it ripped on the bottom . i threw it out as soon as i got home DONT BUY !! BAAAAD !!

 I purchased the Lasermax Unimax laser for my Beretta PX4 Storm in 9mm . After taking it to the range , I found that after only a couple shot the laser would switch off due to the recoil of the gun . The side to side switch was n't stiff enough to withstand the recoil of the pistol . Also , dry firing at home would cause the laser to dim sometimes , only to brighten back up after a few more dry fires . I 've sent it back into to Lasermax twice now and still have the same issues.The pulsing dot and the ability to mount more rail acessories under the laser are very innovative , and I think it 'd be a fine product , but I 'm afraid it has some design flaw that makes it inherently unreliable . This is completely unacceptable for a laser that retails for upwards of 180 dollars . I would steer clear of it and go for a cheaper , more reliable model .
 I 'm on ' my 2nd Uni-Max on my Gen 4 Glock 17 . The first would not maintain zero after firing only a few rounds . I 've not shot with the new one yet . There 's two fundamental design flaws - 1 . They do n't fit tightly into the rail space . Lasermax does n't offer rail `` keys '' like Streamlight does and this can cause the unit to slip if not screwed in super tight and I 've heard of them stripping out as they 're easily over tightened . 2 . The tightness of the battery door has an affect on the resistance of the on/of switch which is problematic . IOW , if you tighten the battery door too much -LRB- as I did because it did n't seem to be tightened down enough -RRB- it 's difficult to turn on and off . I mentioned this to their customer service and they 're aware of it and do n't really seem to care . BTW , their customer service leaves much to be desired . I hear that Lasermax is phasing the Uni-Max out . For obvious reasons if you ask me . I 'll be leery of Lasermax products in the future because of my experience with the Uni-Max and their customer service .

 The arm of this chair completely broke off the 2nd time it was used . The man that used it is average size - 5 ' 8 '' and 180 lbs . I guess it was n't made for an adult male . I would never buy it again .
 I bought these scrimmage vests in 3 colors , black , orange and purple . The orange fell apart at the seems . The shoulder seems were not properly stitched and unraveled after two wearings . I contacted the seller and because I was outside the 30 day return policy , they refused to replace them . It was clearly a manufacturing defect . The purple and black did not fall apart , just the orange . Poor quality and even worse customer service .

 These breeches were NOT cotton . They were a polyester/spandex blend , so I returned them . If polyester works in your climate , they were very nice breeches , but in 110 + heat , poly is a no-no . The seller said they would fix the link to the product description , and they may have , but be aware .
 I was not pleased with my purchase . The gloves were not really a small , which I have had before , but more like a medium.They were poorly stiched at the right knuckle area and gave me a re-occuring blister/raw spot at that place.They also smelled so strongly of mothballs that I had to leave them outside in the garage for several days before I could even wear them . I ended up going to a store to try on and buy a pair of new gloves to use . I will not ever buy this product online again .
 Awful , I am very displeased with these gloves . First of all they are not completely leather . They are cheap though , that 's why I guess they do n't have to be . They do not offer enough padding to protect your hands , they are to tight to put any wraps on and then you have bleeding blisters . I do not work on the bag often but I 'm pretty aggressive and these are NOT the right gloves for that . Cheap - yes hence 2 stars instead of 1 , once again if you can help it get something better , that 's built to last because of the good quality and not because they sit in the bag because you ca n't use them .
 In terms of quality of design and construction I will give the gloves 2.5 stars - they are leather , which is a plus , but they are rather flimsy in construction -LRB- the leather is very thin -RRB- and they are sewn to a very minimal standard . The diamaeter of the fingers is too large which causes the gloves to move around and chafe . No , I did not buy them too large.These gloves are probably ok if you are going to hit a speed bag but that is about it . If you use them to hit a heavy bag you will have bloody hands in about forty minutes . My first and second knuckles on both hands were bloody on my first workout . After my hands healed I wrapped them well and tried again but the gloves simply do not provide enough protection to hit a heavy bag for any extended period . These gloves should not be sold as `` bag gloves '' . You have been told .
 I bought a new pair to replace gloves of the same type I have use for years -LRB- they were stolen -RRB- . While I loved the old ones , Century seems to have changed the lining to a rougher material almost like canvas . Now I have no skin on my knuckles . I know I could use hand wraps but the point of bag gloves is so I do n't have to use wraps.Overall construction is still very good but beware the bloody knuckles .
 I already have a pair in the XL size . I bought the bigger size so that myTITLE Platinum Hybrid Gel Fist Wrapswould fit.I use these 2-3 times a weekThere is a very strong smell . These stink very bad . I sprayed them with fabreeze and its still there.I originally gave this a 5 star review based on the ones I already had . The smell that wont go away got these downgraded . Its a horrible smell .
 I have several pair of NB shorts in size medium and they fit great . But these run extremely small . -LRB- I 'm wondering if this batch was mislabeled . -RRB- They 're also very high-waisted , sitting above my waistline . Try yours on first ! Do n't make the same mistake I did by washing them first , then trying them on thinking they would fit like all my other NB shorts !! No returns for me !
 Do n't waste your time or money ! This is by far the worst display product I have ever seen ! Terrible very very cheap product . Look somewhere else for a 1 piece tube , this is 4 cheap plastic pieces to try and hold together and the ends you put on to hold the bat does n't let the black ends to hold the whole contraption together , Ugh ! Just forget it and do n't spend your money !!!
 One word JUNK ! I have nothing more to say about this item so I am just typing to finish the amount of required words for review .
 How can I review this product when I never received it ??? Tried e-mailing Fans Edge who said they delivered it , said I would be refunded , but then had to go through Amazon to get my money back .

 I bought these scrimmage vests in 3 colors , black , orange and purple . The orange fell apart at the seems . The shoulder seems were not properly stitched and unraveled after two wearings . I contacted the seller and because I was outside the 30 day return policy , they refused to replace them . It was clearly a manufacturing defect . The purple and black did not fall apart , just the orange . Poor quality and even worse customer service .

 Shipping costs just as much as the actual item . Its very deceptive marketing when they 're obviously trying to sell a low end item for the overall same price as the top of the line bike carriers .
 These breeches were NOT cotton . They were a polyester/spandex blend , so I returned them . If polyester works in your climate , they were very nice breeches , but in 110 + heat , poly is a no-no . The seller said they would fix the link to the product description , and they may have , but be aware .

 Mine SNAPPED after a week in the middle of my back workout . Luckily I was n't hurt . It 's not even repairable . the whole tube ripped near the bottom of the handle .
 alright i love airsoft i just dont want to pay alot of money for a gun and i decided to buy this gun and i got it and it ddnt even work . the laser died instantly and the stock broke wen i had it extended and i pushed it into my shoulder the sling is big enough for a six yr old the mag wont even load the bbs
 It 's OK but when I got it it would not cock back al the way so I pushed a real gun cleaner down the barell and it was clear again . Then a few weeks later I droped the gun on the ground and the stock fell off . The bb 's get stuck in the chamber so every time you cock the gun all the bb 's come out of the clip . My last words are DO . NOT . BUY . !!!!
 Well for one thing , this thing is worth no more than 12 dollars . Why I say this is because : - The eye site is crap and actually causes your vision to get get blurred looking through it . - There are parts in it that are rusted such as a part in the laser which is very easy to take out and replace but still . Oh and the wire came undone with no effort at all -LRB- an easy fix as well -RRB- but again shabby work -LRB- mind you the light the laser emits is actually really good quality -RRB- . - the ammo clip does n't really work , you fill it up and only a few BBs actually go into the spring area at the most , pretty sad . - Have to cock it every time you want to fire a BB -LRB- with that being said I have to say getting shot by this thing actually hurts and surprisingly will break skin , but then again it was my girlfriend who shot me with it at point blank range as a joke -RRB- . - It does come with the forward handle as posted in the picture.Overall , thank god I did not get this thing to play BB gun wars with and instead am using it to mod a wiimote . Trust me , it will serve better purpose being used as a modified wiimote gun for emulators/PC FPS then what it was originally built for .
 This was the worst gun I have ever gotten . I got it out of the box and it basically fell apart in my hands . This is n't even worth the one star . The magazine comes in half and the flashlight did n't come with it . Take my advice and do n't waste your time or your money .
 DO NOT BUY THIS . Apart from the fact that it arrived with a broken stock , the cocking lever broke in under 50 shots and the battery compartment was too big for the batteries , therefore the scope did not work without adding a foil spacer . 1 sentence Email flowed from the vendor at the amazing rate of 1 per day making dialogue painfully partial and slow . The value of the item is so much less than we paid for shipping such that a refund -LRB- after sending back of course -RRB- is throwing good money after bad . My son used his hard saved funds to by this . In the end he paid for a valuable lesson ; when the shipping is more than the item , caveat emptor !
 When I bought this guns I bought it new but right off the start I knew it was n't . When I read the instructions they didnt make the least sense . Sure it looks cool but I 'll find it hard to believe u got it to work . when u put the bb 's in the mag they all fall into a chambber in the back that dosent even have a link to the gun . The whole thing has a wierd system that is completely didfferent from ordinary guns . i couldnt even get the bb 's in the actual gun , they all fall out of the mag . basically DONT BUY THIS GUN .
 I bought this gun as my second gun and its the cheapest chinese clone iv ' e ever seen . I opened the box and it was broken in half . The gun is alllll plastic . Me and my friend were just unscrewing it for the parts and one of the screws broke ! The gearbox has no metal , this sucks for u noobs out there who do n't no about airsoft . And i was trying to fix it and the cocking spring broke in half . DO NOT , I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GUN !!!!! P.S.Its like wasting money so just spend the extra 40 $ on a semi good AEG -LRB- automatic electric gun -RRB- THANKS FOR READING !!!!
 this gun is horrible do n't buy it . the light is great but the sniper is a little plastic line . no accuracy at all and once you put the stock on it is very hard to take off so you ca n't store it in its box !!!! WORST AIRSOFT GUN EVER . and its not electric
 THIS GUN IS TERIBAL THE CLOSEST THING TO SHOTING IT DOSE IS WHEN THE BB ROLLS OUT THE BARRLE STAY AWAY
 i recieved this product it was damaged i have been calling this company the line is always busy i have emailed they returned 2 emails but nothing else i am stuck with this product i paid 25 . dollars for !
 My gun did not shoot for more than a week . It was a waste of my money and I feel bad .
 this gun sucks . i bought it for 11.50 a year ago and im sure it still sucks and now they are are ripping people off for a gun that should not even be on the market and its made of a bunch of cheap sucky thin plastic and i dropped it on the grass and the stock completely broke off !!!!!! i wasted 12 bucks and you should not buy this gun it shot like ten feet when i first got it and they said it shot 370fps and now they have changed it to 200 . NOT A GOOD BUY UNLESS YOU ARE STUPID AND LIKE CRAPPY GUNS
 First of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me . 2 weeks later ... the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun . But it looks cool and its worth the price .
 I bought 2 of these guns . The first one broke almost immediately , the second one broke by the second day . Even before they broke , they did n't work very well ; the gun does not shoot very far -- maybe 5 feet average . It takes a while to load the bb 's and once you do , you have to shake it before you fire it . Honestly , unless you plan to use the guns wrapped in bubble wrap , they 're just not worth the money . Try the UZI instead . Do n't buy this gun .
 The directions are not in english . We can not find them on the web . As we can tell , parts are missing . We are VERY disappointed and will be returning it .
 Do n't waste your time on this gun i mean the plastic materials breaks very easy and not even super glue can fix it properly for some sort of made material.List of ways its Broken easly * The laser sight only has a duration of 6 hour use -LRB- high power battery will break the laser sight -RRB- * The scope on the xm8 is not even what you expected -LRB- cheap scope creation -RRB- * There 's no flashlight shown in the picture * about 12 ounce weight to make the gun feel like a rifle -LRB- not even -RRB- * easy fragile material -LRB- when used hardcore -RRB- I gave it a 2 cause the model looks realistic not when it black but I would n't waste 30 dollars on a spring bb I mean get a better eletric gun for at least 45 buck but this gun will haunt you forever if you but it . YOUR CALL
 Well i bought this gun with in a week of playing and shooting it like 100 times the muzzle fell off !!! I was also in a war i put the back of the gun to my sholder not to hard and the back broke off and kinda stabbed my sholder ... The Scope light never worked the lazer broke in 5 days . i suggest you dont buy this gun but you know its up to you
 this gun is an alright gun but when i got it i had no clue had to cock it then i had to ask around then 10 hours i found how the gun jams up the accuracy is the worst the laser breaks the first day the scope is bad it doesnt even work the the spring broke after 3 weeks
 The original rifle we bought was very poorly packaged and was broken when it arrived , The product worked alright as far as the shooting of the gun goes but the laser part never worked . The seller sent a replacement gun and it worked fine for 2 days and then it completely broke too . You get what you pay for , this is a very cheap and poorly made gun .
 This review is for the Boy XM8 Light Laser Spring Airsoft Rifle -- Looks - Overall the design is Nice but this gun is for a small child looking to get into airsoft.Material - I thought after putting this gun together which did not fit to a flush smooth look like the picture . Also I thought I was paying for the metal spring this gun is cheaply made and not worth the money . also the laser was defected where it would only work at certain times . the expandable stock was too small and extended to 4 inches it seemed . The clip that held the bullets seemed like it was ready to break even being a new airsoft gun . I suggest you save your money or look to buy another gun .
 it broke wicked fast and is extremely hard to cock . wast of money dont get it .
 DO NOT buy this gun . . it looks like a good gun but really is a peice of crap !! First impression of the way was the outside packing was in chinese and poorly written english ! the whole gun broke within a matter of 5 minutes and never shot a bb . . STAY AWAY !!!
 This gun is horrible . I bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $ $ $ . First off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light , if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter . Also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless . When we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down , so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless , even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370 . Also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber , then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun . After about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process . Granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time . Over all this gun STINKS . I bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so I thought it was going to be decent , but i was wrong . SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE !!!!!!
 it does n't work , the lazor does n't work , it is n't and actual airsoft gun , i actually BROKE IT APART to see what was in side and it was completely hallow ... It is a fake !! DO NOT BUY THIS . It says its electric , well it does n't even COME with a charger . ya I cracked it open , guess what i saw . Not a battery but a bag filled with sand .
 This gun is as crap as they get . When you first get it it is realy good but after one week it feel apart on me . It is realy acrurat but it is crap . I hate it . Not worth 10 dollars or 10 cents i dont recormented it . so just dont get it .
 i bought and was shocked its flea market cheap plastic and its scope sucks it broke rite away and its accuracy sucks it is all plastic and over awhile it wasnt even using any bbs . it doesnt even deserve any stars
 It is OK for say a beginner but i air soft with my friends and I broke in 3 seconds . I was excited because I said it came with all these attachments . the only good attachment is the flashlight and i gave it to my brother . the laser pointer goes on to none of my other guns and its like 4 feet off . also the cross hears which were inside the sight look as though they were punched out .
 one word crapbroke the first day i got itthe bb 's barely made it 30 feetworst gun ever keep your money and buy something betteror maybe get a gun between $ 50 - $ 100
 this gun is not as good . i have used the tan and black version of it and it has no power and no accuraccy what so ever . in fact i have used this gun on th socom video game and it sucks there too . i also read a reveiw of the real gun and it sucks there in iraq too . im startin to think that they purposly made this gun suckie . just dont buy plz !
 Okay first of all , this gun is bad . the stock broke after a day or two of having the gun . the the barrel with the orange tip broke on the third day . the light , when pointed at the ground , two feet away , -LRB- in the black of night -RRB- only makes a dim circle about 2 feet wide and 2 feet tall . at a distance of ten feet the laser is four feet away from the area you see through the scope.the mag does hold 100 + round , but every 10 rounds , you have to take the mag out then pull the spring down and then shake then mag . also , there are no peep sites . when the stock broke , i had to duct-tape the stock on , and it would n't work unless we took the sight off , so we had to shoot the gun with no sights at all . also the gun is louder then any airsoft i have ever heard before . and it has a lousy fps.DO NOT BUY THIS GUN !!
 Not worth the $ 6.50 - we could not get this device to fire a shot . The pellets got stuck in the barrel . Do n't waste your time .
 dont buy this . . my bro bought it and the coking thing is really annoying . also its dosent soot far at all !! the clip is messed up so it only shoots like twice!just save your money and find something else
 this gun is the worst . it says it shoots 370 fps . more like 25 fps . the gun shoots about 15 feet . it also hops up a bit . if you are looking for a good gun do not i repeat do not buy this . i say save your money and buy a better one .
 i have not recieved this item and i ordered it on march 7th 2008 . its been exactly 1 week and as i read in the track packages section it has not even been shipped
 Worst air soft gun ever . As soon as i shot this gun it jammed and the gun fell apart . Only buy this gun if you plan on giving it to a 6 year-old as a prank ...
 do not buy this gun it is a waste of time and money its nothing like the pictures !! its very small , this is the kind of gun you would buy for an 8 year old .
 This product has never worked . The loading mechanism gets clogged . I was told not to use the pellets that came with the rifle because they will clog up the trigger . Why would they put something in their package that does not make the product work efficiantly ? Now they wo n't even give me a refund .
 This bb gun was not very good the scope was broken the gun dosent shot good and i t breaks easy .
 not good . At all . Accuracy sucks , at close range or not . wears and breaks easily . Close out this page . This gun is cursed .
 dont get this gun i bought this gun about 6 months ago and when i got it there was no scope the stock broke after a while and the plastic is really cheap the only good thing about this gun is probably the fps .
 Cheap junk son drop it on the ground and barrel broke off , laser broke in house first day before even playing out side .
 i lost my money its like a toy gun . dont buy this gun it is in chinese and the mag is fake so is the light
 this gun is an extremly low quality japenese hunk of plastic the laser goes way of target -LRB- just like the shot -RRB- the cocking device feels like it will fall right off the scope isnt real the accuracy and distance are horrible the stock on mine broke after 2 weeks use the gun didnt even come with the addvertised hanle grip on the front of the gun the olny good thing about the gun is the little plastic led light on the front is pretty bright so i took it of and gave the gun to my freind.Long story short , i whouldent buy this again if some1 was selling it for 50 cents .
 Do yourself a favor and put whatever money you would use to buy this gun towards something that actually works ! THE ONLY ` good ' thing that came with this gun is the laser sight.This is also KID SIZE !!!! Horrible accuracy as well ! have to aim 1.5 ' above intended target in order to actually hit the target!Again , Save your money , buy something better !
 i paid -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it worksand after using it a few time si relized its flawsfirst its too damn smallits accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crapand doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystembuy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
 This is the most horrible product I have ever boughtin my entire life so if you want a nice gun this is not it .
 This gun is WORTHLESS ! I bought this gun a while ago , it arrived promptly , but instead of a flashlight , I got the crappiest lazer sight ever ! You could n't see it when it was 2 feet in front of you ! And the `` laser '' on the scope -LRB- which is fake -RRB- , I tried to push the switch , and it fell into the scope ! DO N'T BUT THIS GUN !!!!!!!!!
 all i have to say . . the worst gun man kind has ever made . last week the price was 20 and today the price is 5 ? whats up with that ? the gun has no accuracy ? at all . this is BS . i dont recommend it
 This product is sub standard . After spending two hours trying to decipher the directions on Christmas day my son & husband came to conclusion that it is junk . The bullets do n't load and if you manage to get some loaded it does n't shoot . Furthermore , one of the lights never worked . The vendor is AWFUL . I followed instuctions & am still waiting for a reply on returning the item . They have a re-stocking fee and said if the item is n't returned within THREE DAYS there are no refunds ... just a possible replacement with another model . To date I still have not heard from them . By the way their shipping charges are outrageous and I only ordered because it was very inexpensive and I assumed it was because they discontinued the model .
 Airsplat asked me to remove my original bad review so they could make amends . Not only did I have 2 rifles that are a piece of JUNK , I now have 4 rifles that are a piece of junk and very disappointed boys . I asked the company to check on the quality and to make sure they work before sending out the second set of rifles . NO LUCK . They said they would send the replacements before Christmas NO LUCK on that one too . They arrived 10 days late !! AND DID NOT WORK AT ALL . I have called and been put on hold for over 1 hour and emailed with no reply . They were very quick to get me to remove my bad review but not quick to have a product that works . Horrible customer service , horrible product and horrible overall experience . NEVER AGAIN >
 I have several pair of NB shorts in size medium and they fit great . But these run extremely small . -LRB- I 'm wondering if this batch was mislabeled . -RRB- They 're also very high-waisted , sitting above my waistline . Try yours on first ! Do n't make the same mistake I did by washing them first , then trying them on thinking they would fit like all my other NB shorts !! No returns for me !

 I did n't use specifically this product . I bought some heavy duty plastic ties for our tennis screens and between the wind load and the UV deterioration they broke within 2 months . I did n't see any UV note on this product , so would be wary , at least in a wind environment -LRB- ours is Northern Virginia in an open field -RRB- .

 This parachute has a hole in the center which causes the air to escape through the hole . This is ineffective because there is little or no resistance ! A waste of time and money !!!!!
 These breeches were NOT cotton . They were a polyester/spandex blend , so I returned them . If polyester works in your climate , they were very nice breeches , but in 110 + heat , poly is a no-no . The seller said they would fix the link to the product description , and they may have , but be aware .

 The backrest puts you in a horrible postition and can not be asjusted bcause it is of the same bladder as the rest of the tube . The tube is flat instead of round making it low to the water . The backrest pushes you to the front of the tube making your legs hang way over . It sits so low in the water that the cup holders flood making them useless unless you like to drink river water . Water also floods the tops of the coolers leting water seep through the zippers melting your ice and making unuseable for drinks . Great concept ... pathetic design !!!
 I bought this tube after seeing it many times on a river where I tube a lot ... I thought the coolers in the side and the storage space was really cool but I did n't like the tube at all and I 'll tell you why . First off it sits way too low in the water you might as well just be down in the water and this is not fun when your in a cold spring fed river buuuurrrr ! also , the tube lining fills up with water and if very heavy and hard to carry when you get out of the river . you have to deflate the tube in order to carry it . So that makes numerous trips down the river a big job ! The cooler also is not very well insulated-Ice melts fast . now this is just my opinion , I gave this tube to my best friend and she loves it . I think this tube is also better suited for a petite person or kid . I am 5 ' 7 -LRB- average weight & build -RRB- and am too tall to fit comfotably in this tube .
 Used this for the first time yesterday & will never use it again ! It is quite small , fills up with water & the back -LRB- no matter how much air you put in -RRB- is so stiff/hard that you end up sitting up perfectly straight ! Very , very uncomfortable !! I would definitely NOT recommend this !!
 We bought this for floating down the river and it was horrible . You 're literally sitting on the water , there is no inflation where you sit , so its just a thin layer of material between you and the water , it might as well be an innertube with no bottom . We kept passing this tube around from person to person and laughing at whoever got stuck with it cause they would be freezing and so uncomfortable . Unless you 're using this in a heated pool , skip it . Even if you are using it in a heated pool , skip it , cause it costs too much for what you get . Sorry , I usually dont give bad reviews , but I dont want others to get screwed like I did .

 I purchased these socks for myself specifically because they were advertized as 100 % cotton socks . THEY ARE NOT !!! They are 42 % coolmax -LRB- whatever that is ! -RRB- , 42 % cotton , 12 % nylon , 3 % lycra & 1 % natural latex , as copied from the packaging . This is why I have rated only 1 star . They are nice socks , one pair grey toes/heels the other pink , which is n't what was pictured , and I do n't care about the color . But I wanted/needed 100 % cotton , and this blend is a far cry from that .
 I bought this used one like new what i saw on the amazon display . -LRB- Maybe is this my mistake to buy ` used one ' ? -RRB- There are sevral image pictures in the bottom of main product . Even main mark is different!When i received it and found it something different i recognized . Inner matreal is not what i expect ! It is just mixing normal polyester and kind of cotton stuff . The rope and end of holding button which mark on name `` Teton '' . It dos n't seems cozy , and no air through.I just feel disapointed what i have done . I will buy product after deep considering about it . This time it make me unhappy .
 Just a heads up , the price has risen from $ 99 to $ 180 in a few months ! Most positive reviews give it this rating because it was at a much lower price point .
 This bag is extremely heavy and very difficult to travel with unless you have a huge vehicle and you do n't mind in unfolding over everything . Everytime I try to stuff it back into the bag I am sweating and panting by the end and have usually inserted my entire body into the bag to try to push it all down . It does not come with straps so you can not roll it either . I have tried to find some straps but no success thus far . Comfortable bag but I find myself never wanting to take it out of the bag - it 's just not worth it .
 This item is probably made for very very large radios . The velcro straps did allow for adjustment around mine , but it was still too big really . I pretty much had to rig it . -LRB- And we have one of the larger radios in law enforcement -RRB- The size is not my biggest concern however.The swivel clip on it is so loose and easily turnable , that my radio is constantly falling off of my hip . This is dangerous in my line of work . -LRB- corrections -RRB- I 've also hit my emergency response button since owning this case -LRB- 1 week -RRB- because I am constantly having to readjust it from falling or not fitting right . -LRB- Not good to hit that button . -RRB- I would say what I was most satisfied with , is the part that clips to the belt itself . It is very secure and you can tighten it enough not to move around.I 've used a swivel clip before , and not had this kind of issue . Unfortunately I will have to return it and get something more suitable .
 This sled was given to my grandchildren for Christmas . I bought it andthe winter heat sled . This one did not perform near as well as theblack sled . My son said lots of the children in the neighborhood enjoyedthe black sled . The red one just did n't go well on the ice that theywere sledding on . Maybe on deep snow it would perform better
 These breeches were NOT cotton . They were a polyester/spandex blend , so I returned them . If polyester works in your climate , they were very nice breeches , but in 110 + heat , poly is a no-no . The seller said they would fix the link to the product description , and they may have , but be aware .
 Beware of this pack . After loading it up with 35lbs and attempting to put if on my back the shoulder strap support system ripped and rendered the backpack useless . The shoulder straps are attached to a Velcro Adjustment tab which proved to not be very durable in my case .
 This bag really is n't that great . . If your equipment is 100 % super compact and ultra light , this might work . If your equipment is at all bulky or anything , do n't get this bag ; you will need more space . I am usually the leader and the one carrying the most stuff , biggest tent etc. . If this is you , stick with an external frame or sink real money into a respectable internal frame backpack .
 Before this backpack I owned a $ 75 pack from REI . It lasted me 7 years before finally breaking . I purchased this Teton pack for a Europe trip for 2 months . Within the first 2 weeks some straps broke and by the end of the trip I had a few zippers and straps that were broken . Absolutely the worst pack I have ever owned not worth $ 20 . I do n't know what is wrong with the other reviewers but they are more wrong than you could possibly imagine . Also Amazon promised a replacement on more than one of my requests and I have never received it . Here it is almost a year later and amazon has not followed through with there commitment . Although at this point I just want my money back because the backpack sucks that bad . latter
 I bought this pack for my trip to Europe . My concern is that it is very heavy with out cloths , food , shoes . ect ... it seems very durable and it is a great size for a woman . Another Dislike is that there are to many straps/buckles . the straps/buckles are not removable and really after un buckling them to fix the positioning its like a maze to put it back together . and then theres the rain cover . Really does it need its own compartment ? its possitioned at the very top of the bag and its not removable . so for the most part the bag is just ok ... . i guess its true you get what you pay for .
 It 's not a good bag , and the design has a redundant construction ! It might bring inconvenience to traveling . Since I have find the red color is not the same as the picture shows!I am not good luck to brought this one
 I research virtually every product I purchase and did so with this item also . I felt pretty good about it until my son tried to strap his tent onto it and two of the straps broke . Now , his tent is a lightweight one , made for backpacking and hiking so weight would n't have been an issue . This backpack has n't even made it outside yet . We are having the straps repaired -LRB- instead of sending it for a replacement -RRB- as his hiking trip is less than a week . If there are more issues after his trip I will be adding them to this review .
 solo coloque dos estrella por que compre dos bolsos por separados y los envio en un mismo envio y una sola factura , por ende me cobraron nacionalizaci&oacute;n .
 Received this pack in the mail and everything was in good condition checked all seams clips and straps . When I put it on I realized that the pack is meant for shorter people -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 3 '' -RRB- . It appears that 6 ' and up wo n't be able to wear this pack properly . On the other hand , I put my sleeping bag in it 's compression sack in the bottom just to gauge the size of the pack -LRB- it looks small when you first get it -RRB- and the colored so-called ripstop material tore about 8 inches just putting the compression sack in the bottom which took no force at all I 'm not sure how it ripped so easily nor will I purchase more Teton `` ripstop '' material bags .
 I 've read other reviews that criticize these pants for being too light weight and not being actual sweat pants . But that is exactly why I like them . They are light enough to wear around the house and breath well and keep you cooler while exercising in the summer heat . They have a fairly wide elastic waist . I do n't care for the draw string which tends to dig in a little -LRB- especially since the draw string knot faces inward -RRB- but for the price what can you expect . I also care less for the light and dark grey ones that are not 100 % cotton . Overall fairly durable and a good value for the money.UPDATE
 These sweatpants were thinner than I expected and they also did not fit well around my waist . They have the one looped cord in the elastic and I find that those do n't work as well as one cord split that you can tie .
 HI we rec 'd a `` Large '' which was more like an Xtra Large `` TALL '' . Returned for a full refund .
 While these are ok for lounging , they will not keep you very warm . As other reviews state , these are incredibly thing ... so much so that you can easily see light coming through them . I would n't even think about playing any kind of sport in these , unless you consider chess to be a sport . Would have been nice if they were described as `` lightweight '' .
 The first time I put on these pants and sat down , the drawstring snapped off -LRB- evidently sewn in back as I could n't get it back in -RRB- . Contacted Essential Apparel and all they did was give me the 800 number for Russell . The other two pairs I ordered are standing up well so far .
 These were thin and clingy and the size seemed to run smaller than the size charts implied . That happens a lot with the sizes on Amazon . I had to return them - could n't wear them at all . They were uncomfortable , not relaxed as I expected .
 these sweat pants are undercut
 The fabric is comfortable and light-weight but they fell apart too fast . Also the size runs big . I bought a Large and it was like wearing a mumu with pants legs .
 RA bottom pants are HUGE - size charts for these are completely inaccurate so be aware of this when purchasing !
 i ordered 3-4 pair of sweat pants that day . one pair had a rip in it.another pair , one leg was longer than the other one . i di n't send themback , but i should have . it 's such a crazy time of year , i had them forwhile before i opened the package & tried them on . i will never orderthem again , especially , Russell 's
 Got these and in less than a week , the tie string broke . Sent them back for a replacement pair . Second time wearing them , snap - broken string . Looking at the string you can tell it is cheap but this is insane .
 I ordered a size Medium and that is what the clothes tag read on the athletic pants . The pants had to have been erroneously tagged because the pants actually seemed to be Size XL or XXL . My family at least had a good laugh after I tried the pants on and walked around like a clown in the circus trying to keep his baggy pants from falling down!Amazon provided an instant refund .
 As others have commented , be sure these are what you want . These are , in no way , what I think of as traditional `` sweat pants '' . I also do not believe they fir the definition of `` jersey '' . They are very thin cotton , more like what I would think of as `` thin , cool cotton summer lounge wear '' . My stupidity for not checking further .
 too flimsy for our weather , and it did n't say in the description , how flimsy they would be.Not a good product for a cold climate .
 The pants are way , way larger than normal sizing . Had to return it . On the plus side , no hassle returning .
 I expected fleece lined old fashion sweat pants . These are very lightweight and I sent them back . Please read the description carefully before you purchase .
 These are very cheap and flimsy . Very disappointed . Have purchased Russell sweats in the past , last time a few years ago . The pants have really declined in quality . Awful . Will be returning these .
 These sweatpants are a total letdown and not even close to the quality Russell sweatpants I 've owned in the past . I have n't even worn them yet or taken the other two I ordered out of the box . To say these are lightweight would be an understatement , they are thin as cardboard maybe more so . I can tell just by the look and feel they will not last long and I plan on returning them ASAP . I will post pictures when I have the time so others can see exactly what they 're getting . If this kind of `` quality '' is what I can expect from Russell , then they 've lost me as a customer . It does n't help either the description makes no mention of how thin these pants are either , and I do n't know whether that 's on Amazon 's or Russell 's part . Buyer beware !
 Not what I expected . The material is very thin and flimsy , and the pants are cut super baggy , like clown pants . I expected the cuffs to close at the ankle , but they do n't have elastic and are open at the end . I would have returned them , but just did n't bother , with the shipping and all .
 They surely were not designed as they arrived . If they were they should be sold in a clown store . Size ` Medium ' was at least an &#34; X-Large &#34; . And they are beyond pantaloons . I could have pulled one leg up over my body until they were above my waist . In addition to all that , the material was very thin , had no body , was like something I 'd want to use to polish the last bit of wax off of my car . I have already received the e-mail from Amazon saying they have received my return . Great service from them as usual.The whole experience was laughable . Figuratively and literally when I tried the pants on . But it also makes me want to rave about manufacturing being sent to some sweat shop -LRB- pun intended -RRB- where apparently no one cares about the product . But then neither did Russell Athletics . On top of all that it 's just boggling for me to think about how they let anything like this get by them and right out into the market . Maybe some of their products are alright , but it 's a gamble I will never take again with Russell Athletics.Now , Amazon , I say this with love . Making these sweatpants was not your work , but purchasing them is . I 'd either take on more responsibility for checking the quality and consistency of their products before you add them to your site or dump Russell Athletics as a vendor . Products like this do not befit the higher standards you work to set . Fairness aside , shoppers who have experiences like this will take a bite out your reputation and maybe even forget that the product was manufactured by someone else .
 These are very sheer and lightweight , to the point of being able to almost see through them . There were strings hanging from the one pair I opened to inspect and I was extremely disappointed with the workmanship as well as fabric quality -LRB- definitely not what I would call `` jersey '' material -RRB- . I am returning them as these are really unacceptable - I should have paid more attention to the prior reviews from other purchasers . .
 I used to buy these all the time -LRB- Medium size -RRB- and never had a problem with them . They used to be well fitting and very airy feeling so you do n't sweat too much.The latest edition is very wide and stretchy ... the same medium size is way too wide of an elastic waistband . And the legs are very wide and also the pant length is longer than usual . Additionally , the pockets are about 33 % smaller than previous versions.All in all , this was a very disappointing version of an otherwise great product . I hope Russell goes back to the drawing board on this one ...
 I did not believe another reviewer who said that these sweat pants were made with really THIN fabric . I thought he must be mistaken - or just disgruntled somehow . But he was correct . The fabric these sweat pants are made from is VERY THIN - kind of like wearing dress slacks with an elastic waist . Who at Russel came up with this idea ? Not the sort of sweat pants I 've ever seen or worn before . Not comfortable . `` Russell Athletic Men 's Cotton Performance Elastic Bottom Jersey Pant '' BUYER BEWARE !!!
 While these pants seem to be of good quality , they certainly are n't as advertised . I purchased two pairs of them thinking they were made of heavyweight material , since that 's what the product description says . However , they are very lightweight and are n't good for anything other than sitting around the house . I 'll keep them just for that purpose but I am disappointed that I ca n't use them to go running in the cold weather -LRB- what I 'd originally purchased them for -RRB- . I wish I 'd have read the reviews before buying these , as others have made the exact same complaint . The product description should be updated to say that they are lightweight . Otherwise , it 's very misleading .
 Do n't buy . One size fits no-one and brother I 'm not kidding . There.s an excess of material that borderlines on insane . Poor design ... Retailers should not sell products designed this poorly .
 I purchased this item and when it came I was totally disgusted with them , they where not only irregulars but cut in the front and then resewn as if anyone would not notice.They were advertised as 1st quality , will never purchase from this Co. again
 These are standard sweatpants , nothing out of the ordinary . But they are NOT all cotton ; they are the usual 50-50 blend , hence my two star ranking .
 this sell needs to clearly state that these are made with t-shirt like material not the traditional sweat shirt material users of russel products have been acustomed to
 Russell seems to have changed its sizing since the last time I bought a pair of these workout pants . Way too big , way too baggy for the gym . Now they 're just new pajama bottoms .
 I ordered these because my husband always liked Russell Athletic clothing , however , these sweats are very thin and not like ones he has had before.I would not recommend them .
 I 've worn Russell sweatpants for years , and size medium always fit . This pair however is long enough and wide enough to fit a large big and tall . Since I 'm maybe 5 ' 3 ' these were ridiculous . The elastic at the ankles is so loose it may as well be an open leg . The material is also incredibly thin -- I 've never seen `` sweatpants '' so thin . I was very disappointed . I 'll look for another brand .
 This item arrived with a hole in one pant leg and the bottom elastic hems being different sizes . Either Amazon is selling defective product or the supplier of this item has hoodwinked Amazon into selling it without inspection . This is the first time I have been this disappointed in a purchase .
 ordered extra large after washing and trying on the legs were approxmatly 7 lnches too long the rest of the order fits .
 I thought that these sweatpants were going to be of a better quality , i saw some of the reviews say that they would use them as pajamas , who does that ? you buy sweats for nighty-nite ? these pants are cheap , very oversized , and would n't last a week on the job . buyer beware .
 I have worn these pants for 10 years for working in the yard and garden . They are light enough to wear in the hot summer months and help keep the creepy crawlies away . This particular pair was 6 inches too long . I think they must be `` seconds '' .
 These sweatpants are designed to be infinitely expandable . Basically , the designer had extremely obese people in mind . Not great for looking decent while jogging .
 Well lets start with this , I did not like the sizing of these pants nor was the thickness acceptable to me.In the past Russell has made the highest quality jogging pants on the market , these I bought was just to thin for my tastes .
 Awkward fitting pants here . They seem more like balloon pants than sweat pants . I would not buy these again . They are soft , but the fit is too big in the mid areas .
 In my opinion the pants are too bulky and hang loose enough to look and feel really baggy . The weight is just not what I expected of `` sweatpants '' that I am used to . Altogether I 'd not recommend these to anyone and I 'll probably just throw mine away and learn from the bad experience .
 Low quality all around . Thin flimsy fabric and lightweight elastic . Plus sized wrong , ordered XL , item tagged XL but was at least 2X or 3X . Amazon did do a prompt refund.Better deal is theChampion Mens Closed Bottom Jersey Pant - lower price and better quality than the Russell .
 I try to buy only 100 % cotton sweats . For that reason I ordered these in black which at the time was the only color available in 100 % cotton . The material is fine . I ordered large based on the sizing guidelines . It was too large - especially in the length . Since 100 % cotton is hard to find I decided to wash them in hopes of them shrinking . They shrunk a bit , but not much . I then ordered a pair of mediums . They are also too large , again especially in the length . After washing , the large and medium are of almost identical size . So the sizing of these pants seems very sloppy . However my primary complaint is with the elastic waist . The elastic is not strong enough to hold the pants up . It does have a built in rope , but it 's not elastic and therefore not comfortable . I give it 2 stars only because it 's 100 % cotton .
 I thought I choose thicker of several pants . I was wrong . These pants are very thin cotton . I will buy next pair from brick and mortar store .
 They were not a sweat pant that i ` m use to , I thoughtthey would be alot heavier . I have not wore them yet maybe I will change my Review then
 The sweats i got were not as they looked on the ad . They are very the almost like pj 's . Very Very disappointed
 I searched sweatpants and this came up . Even in the photo , you ca n't quite tell that these pants are thin t-shirt fabric material . Bought it , it showed up and it was definitely NOT what I expected . Who would even wear this ? Definitely will be returned .
 These pants would be nice on the hotter weather when you want a pant that 's not too bulky or insulated.The material is a typical jersey cotton so it feels more like a tee shirt than a sweat pant material.my husband did n't like them since he likes a heavier traditional sweat pants.So in all they 're not bad but more so on a light weight cheaper feeling pair than anything appropriate for winter .
 Toboggans are fun and the positive is that you can ride a whole bunch of kids at one time . Its better in packed powder and somewhat steerable - you will need to use arms or legs in the snow to get the best control . On icy hard pack conditions this can be very hard to control.My biggest negative is the build quality . The varnish/stain is cheaply done and inconsistent in application as well as did not seem to be very thick - came off after a few runs . The very thin nylon rope broke 3 times and we kept having to double knot it over and over . The chain that holds the curved part of the wood and provides tension is attached with this circle ring . The circle ring is not completely closed so the rope would slide through and we even had the chain come off . The absolute worst part is that the boards seem very thin . So thin in fact that we actually cracked two boards on some gentle riding with the family !!! As a kid I remember punishing our toboggan but never saw it break . This was a surprise and a big negative after only a few weeks of use . Looking at the bottom of the sled , nearly all of the varnish is now gone and it now needs a good wax before sledding to reduce the drag . Overall while the price is tempting I would steer towards one of the mountain boy sleds .
 I ignored other reviews of this sleigh and bought it anyway because I could n't believe it could be that bad . It arrived with one bent runner . Also poor workmanship . Split wood where screws went in . I was able to straiten the runner.We just had a snowfall so I tried out the sled today . With a baby riding -LRB- 22 lbs -RRB- the sled travels on the back tip of the runners . The cross members act as snow plows . It would be easier to drag a cement block through the snow . I was very dissipointed as one reason I bought this was the brand name . I will be returning this .
 I picked up a couple of these because I figured that they 'd be good `` cheapie '' cues to leave out on my table . Problem is , they arrive pre-warped . I do n't expect much for $ 8 , but I feel that they should at least be straight . Other than that , they 're of average weight and heft . Save your money for something else .

 Ordered a `` medium '' for my 15 year old son and found it to be ridiculously large . I normally purchase `` large '' shirts for myself , but this was even comically big on me .
 IN THE SAME YEAR TWO SHIRTS PEDI DIFERFENTES EQUAL SIZE AND THE LAST CAME WITH OTHER FABRIC WHICH I DO NOT LIKE
 too big , not served to my husband , is very high and needed to buy a large for his long arms but stayed his shirt as a blanket to wrap . the size L is for their arms , if they want to buy a pidanla two sizes of the original .
 Good friend I am of venezuela . I write to him because I did to him a purchase of two shirts Columbias it pinches long colors white and sage . You me sending a mail saying that already they were sent but it did not give to me the number of sending . I am translating since I do not speak Englishman . I wait for his prompt response porfavor .

 I ordered two of these horrible cues for my father . They are not fun to play with AT ALL . They feel too light and flimsy , and it is nearly impossible to pull off a good shot with them . I guess you get what you pay for , because the best all around description for them is CHEAP . Do yourself a favor and buy quality cues . They make the game so much more enjoyable .
 i HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT . CONTACTED TO COMPANY ABOUT THE DELIVERY , WAS TOLD THAT UPS DAMAGED IT AND RETURNED IT TO THEM . I WAS SENT AN EMAIL THAT A REPLACEMENT WAS SENT OUT , THAT WAS 3 WEEKS AGO . WHAT IS THE PROBLEM GETTING SUCH A SMALL ITEM DELIVERED . GLAD I DID NOT ORDER SOMETHING LARGER AND MORE COSTLY . THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN . IF YOU CA N'T DO SOMETHING SMALL YOU CA N'T DO SOMETHING BIG . I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE WANTING TO BUY ANY SPORTS RELATED ITEMS .
 You get what you pay for ! The very first time I used this pool cue , the tip slip in half ... not repairable . I would not buy another pool cue from this company .
 I ordered a couple of these cues for the pool table my unit acquired and refurbished while in Iraq and was instantly disappointed . I went with a lower priced cue due to where I was and the possible abuse it would endure by a bunch of soldiers . I may as well have used broom handles because they would have been better . These cues are terribly light , narrow , and went unused due to the poor quality . I recommend to anyone looking at this cue to spend a bit more money and buy something better . You can not see by the picture shown in the ad , but this cue is tiny , skinny , and extremely light . I only gave it 1 star because the system would not allow me to proceed with this review unless I gave it a star rating , but it deserves NO STAR at all !
 Just received this thing ; tipped the box to bring out the stick , and the broken end ripped into my thumb and I 'm bleeding profusely . The tip was broken off . Was not packaged carefully at all ; just in a long box , no wrapping . Received broken and useless , and I am injured . I think I have a splinter of wood stuck in my thumb . Hurts like hell .
 This stick is weird looking . That does n't mean that it 's practicality is great , it 's not . It 's short , unbalanced and a waste of money . The glossy finish on the end does not slide through your fingers well . If I were you , I 'd choose another stick .

 Metal seems flimsy and the strap is n't long enough to come down to the right place . I am only 5 ' 9 '' so not like I am crazy tall or anything . Had one of these when I was a kid and really liked it . Clearly the quality has gone way , way down . Do n't buy unless you are really short
 First the belt that comes with it thats suppose to hang off your neck is not is way to short . its like they where cutting corners and trying to save money . i had to remove that belt and put another one on . the one they give you is ok if you are 3ft tall haha . the rest of it is just poorly made . the shape of the product doesnt even feel natural . it better to spend the money on a name brand one .
 I may need to get used to it . . so far the position of my arms and the angle on my back that this cause , forced me to use about 25 % of the weight that I regulary use . So now I stopped using this device till i figure out the `` proper '' use .
 Bought this for my teenagers ... very chinsey . . falls apart about every time its touched and the ball wont even go thru the basket unless u are right beside it and slam dunk . . at which time the poles break loose ... dint buy it get a bigger better one !
 I AM STILL WAITING FOR THIS ITEM TO BE DELIVERED TO ME . I ORDERED IT ON 12/26/2009 AND I AM STILL WAITING AS OF 01/28/2010 .
 First of all , this watch is incredibly difficult to set up . The operation guide is hard to understand . Secondly , it is also very difficult to press the heart rate buttons on the right hand side while you 're working out . The manual says to hold the buttons down for 5-7 seconds , however , I find myself having to hold the buttons down for 10-15 seconds sometimes . Even worse , after 15 seconds of holding the buttons down , it wo n't even give me a heart rate reading ! So , I would suggest not wasting your money on this worthless product .
 This watch is too hard to get my heart rate while working out . It is not convenient nor user friendly . After having it less than two months , the watch `` locked up '' while trying to get my heart rate . I had to remove the battery to reset it . My opinion is , do n't waste your money as I have !
 This monitor is not good for those who want a challenging workout . The finger buttons are difficult to press when standing still and even harder when you are running or on any kind of machine . It might work for walkers or those who want a cute watch .
 Product is top heavy and flips over whenever you make a basket . It needs to be weighted on the bottom .
 I purchased this bell as a gift . Trust me , it is of inferior quality and you will not be happy with it.When I learned that return postage would cost me $ 5.05 on the item , I swallowed hard and tossed it into the trash.Live and learn !
 Bought this bell to have something on my bike to warn pedestrians of my presence . After a little over a month , the bell is broken . The lever does n't ring the bell and just makes a harsh grating noise.I guess it 's my fault for buying it b/c Schwinn is a cheap junk brand . They stole my Cannondale b/c I tried to save a couple of bucks and bought a Schwinn lock , now this bell I bought and IT 'S broken . Since it 's over a month , Amazon is no help on the return.Learn from my mistakes and do n't buy this or any Schwinn product .
 Looks nice and sounds nice , easy to install . Main grip
 It claims to fit most bikes , but is far too small to fit a drop-bar road bike handlebar . It is fragile and not very loud.At best , this is an overpriced toy .
 While attaching this bell to my bike , I dropped it . It stopped functioning and I have n't been able to repair it.I think it 's too fragile and would not recommend this bell .
 This bell was a great price , but the first time I tried to push the lever for a ring , it made a crunching noise inside and got stuck . It never worked once for a ring . I brought it to my uncle for fixing , but because the gears were all plastic inside , he was n't able to fix it . Next time I will buy a better bell .
 Its inside are plastic made and easy to fall off . With just one use from my son 's friend , it broke .
 I thought i was ordering a small bell . . this one is about 3-4 '' in diameter . My mistake , i did n't look closer ... the image gave me an impression of a smaller bell .
 looks like a wheel chock , no really , ramp its that small.grind rail looks decent . was kinda embarrassed giving it as a gift after they opened it ?
 This is very cheaply made ... the ramp and rail are too lightweight so when you use it they do n't stay in place ... do not waste your money ... if I had n't thrown away the box I would absolutely return it ... JUNK JUNK JUNK !!!
 The ramp part seems to be to steep for my boys to use . We have tried to use it with scooters and bikes with no luck .
 This seems like a great gift ... WRONG ! It is a pain to put together , there was glue all over the place , and it keeps sliding apart . The ramp and rail are two separate pieces , and you can only bolt down the ramp , so every time you go off the ramp , the rail part slides . Very annoying . I bought this for my brother for Christmas and he has yet to be able to use it . We are having to attach the entire thing to some wood , and stake that into the ground . Not a very pleasant experience , and not worth the hassle . But my brother is determined to use it , so we are keeping it .
 You would be better of making this yourself with your kids . I looked at this and did n't feel it was safe enough for them to even go on . And they go out and bang themselves up all the time so that 's not it . The material is junk , and it is really , very tiny . Even for beginner it is not what I would recommend at all , I am so sorry I wasted my money , and I was so mad that I did n't even send it back . It went in the burn pile that same week . and the kids did n't care . .
 the only good thing about this item is the rail , the ramp is extremly small and according to the instructions you need to drill this to the ground , when my son try to use the ramp he always feel to the ground because it has no grip
 As a skateboarder , i could see how this would be nice to learn on if you are willing to bolt it in your driveway , but other than that it would be impossible to learn on basically cause it slides all over the place . the kicker is out of discussion because it doesent work , but overall i was not satisfied with this rail . i had it 4 months , and its now broken and in the trash .
 I understand that the cost of this item is low but the ramp is useless . My son is 8 and he ca n't even use it . It is so flimsy and weak not worth the money .
 I was very excited to receive this at such a low price . However , I broke my arm really badly the first time I used it . The rail slides around and is way to small . The ramp moves a lot as well . You would have to bolt down both the ramp and rail to avoid any injury . Overall , not a good quality product .
 I purchased this for my son . When the rail came , it was not made properly . The grips were on the wrong side . I have tried to contact the company and they refuse to refund us or send the corrected part . We ca n't use it . This company was horrible to work with .
 My son really wanted the Razor Punk Ramp and Rail combo set , when the package arrive he was so happy . But when we opened we were like what a small thing . I am not satisfied . Sorry , I order it .
 Do not waste your money . This was bought for my son as a Christmas gift and was a total let down . Save your money ! This thing is a joke !
 This item stinks you can not do anything on it . Do not buy , it is way to small
 I could not believe the size of this ramp for the price . You ca n't even use it cause it is so small . I do not recommend it.Razor Punk Park Ramp And Rail Combo Set
 I followed the instrucions but was unable to set it . Was too complicated . Go with the Polar HR monitor . It 's easier to set up and some gym equipment is set up to read your heart rate from the Polar transmitter .
 I really wanted to like the saddle as it looks to be well-made , and for many of my friends they will ride nothing else . For me it is easily the least comfortable saddle I have ever ridden . The issue is that for someone with wide sit bones you end up riding on the little metal rails that suspend the leather and not the suspended part of the seat . If I try to sit forward on the seat my sit-bones miss it entirely . This makes the seat unrideable after about 3 miles . I gave it 2 stars because I know it works for many but for me it was a waste of $ 200 . Defiantly try before you buy .
 The promo video and testimonials on the manufacturer 's website intrigued me , and it fit the style of my Calfee bamboo bike . First rides were so comfortable I ordered one for my S-works Tarmac too . But then the leather started stretching and spreading so as to rub against my thighs . Then riding a Century in a rainstorm it really stretched -LRB- even though it had the waterproofing underneath . -RRB- Also , the tension bolt kept sliding . The first call to Tom the owner was helpful , but as the problem was n't resolved and as I kept emailing with the problem he stopped returning emails . I even tried cutting away some of the leather on the sides towards the nose so it would n't spread like a hammock and rub , but that did n't work . Both saddles ended up in the garbage can . Do n't put your money there .
 Unfortunately , Selle Anatomica seems to have suspended shipping in the wake of founder Tom 's passing , or at least the customer service aspect.Three weeks after paying for my saddle I have seen no sign of it , no shipping notice and no response to calls or email over the course of the week just past .
 The yersey has damage and i still have a problems because I returned it and he didnt return my money back I returned one month ago
 Feel I got taken with this purchase . Ordered XL . If thats what XL is what do the big guys wear . Cost a hunderd bucks worth ten maybe . According to the news story on NBC it 's a cheap knock off . I checked the details they said was tell tale to a imitation and it fits the discription . Wish I could return it and get my money back .
 The watch is n't one I 'd wear around which is a requirement since I do n't want to have to change watches all the time and I work out daily . My biggest issue was that it makes a clicking sound when your heart beats and though I 'm sure I would n't notice it after a while , I just decided to send it back . I 'll stick with my Timex Race Trainer .
 Got the N5 for a birthday present . Never could get the heart rate monitor to work . Operation Guide refences wetting two electrodes but none are visible . Ran three miles and worked up a good sweat and still no heart rate . Instead use the Chronograph like my IronMan Timex . However - NO WAY TO READ BACK YOUR SPLIT TIMES ! Whaaa ?? NewBalance website has a flaw and no way to get to the N5 description directly . Have to go to the store so no additional information is available . It would be nice to have some background on how to effectively use all of the features . The Operation Guide only shows you how to push buttons . On the positive side , nice big characters - easy to read while running . That is about all ...
 The style of the champion shorts was not quite what i wanted ... would 've liked them a lot better if they had a draw string cause elastic was somewhat gappy . Also the style was a little shorter than it used to be a couple of years ago and wish the other style was offered as well . Also was not fond of the lining and the outter mesh being separate . . in almost like a reversable style but not ... the over product was pretty disappointing since champion shorts are non existent in stores and i know what style i like .
 I can see sizing being off a little , but the person modeling these must be a really thin teenager . I always wear a medium in champions and these are small in every dimension . Forget the nicely drapped appearance . These cling to my thighs , which while not small , are n't huge either . They also seem much shorter than the picture and with the waistband turned down would sit a good ways below my navel . Since I got them mostly to work out at home , I wo n't bother to return them , but they are much too small to wear to the gym . In my opinion this is not a woman 's size but a `` juniors cut . ''
 You need to list if any of these short have side pockets big enough for tennis ball ... have not bought any cause you do not state if any of the shorts have side tennis ball pockets ...
 Maybe it 's me , but these shorts kept bunching up my inner thighs and made walking uncomfortable . I sent them to my sister . Maybe she 'll like them
 I have ordered several of the Bally Slimmer Belts with zippers . It seems to me the material is getting thinner with each order . People I have ordered for not only uses them for slimming down but as back support as well .
 First of all , this belt if HUGE . On the very last notch -LRB- tightest notch -RRB- it is so wide it is barely working for my 37 inch waist . If you are a smaller woman this will not work for you at all . I 'm not sure who this is for but you would have to be huge for this to work for you.Also quality of this belt is very bad . It is not one solid piece but 3 pieces sawed together . So it started to tears where the seams are . Very bad product do not recommend .
 I got this b/c i 'm trying to lose weight and maybe this would help lose water weight and at least slim me up some . Very wrong . This is for people who are looking to slim up and how are very much in shape . The inside however helped me sweat more and I lost a couple of pounds ; that was it . After I washed it carefully the first time , it never regained it shape . Also if you put it on too tight it just makes you look fatter . You could have just a bit of belly fat or muffin tops that are n't that serious and this thing will make you look worse . A gym membership or running on your own would fix any problems long term . This is for immedate coverage which was n't good at all .
 I bought one of these exact slimmer belts about three years ago and really enjoyed it . i got a couple of years of use out of it and it was great . then , like all slimmer belts , it wore down and started to fray and whatnot . i ordered another one from amazon only to find out when i got it that the manufacturer has clearly downgraded their production of this item since last i bought one . it is now almost half the thickness and frays within a week or so of owning it . it 's absolute garbage . just to give you an idea of how bad it is , i ordered this item less than two weeks ago and i am already on here looking for some way to find the old thicker ones ... . even if it means buying used someplace ... gross .
 Wore the belt when I would go walk and it felt comfortable and felt that it was indeed working . After 2 weeks , I noticed that it is coming apart at one of the seam areas . I handwashed it mildly . I think bally needs to improve workmanship on this product because it was not cheap .
 I bought this belt instead of the one with the velcro because I wanted more security that the belt would stay in place when I did my exercises . The very last zipper did n't provide enough restriction/tightness for me . One more zipper option would be great !!!
 I got this belt knowing that it was going to be useful for a couple of months , but it torn apart the first day I used it . Very cheap quality . I cant return it because I dont live in the USA , and its going to cost me 10 or 15 usd more , so its not worth it.Its the first time I got something with such a poor quality from AMAZON . Dont buy this belt .
 The slimming belt didnt fit my waist . I placed the zipper on the last zip slot to make it the tightest and it was way too big . im not the smallest person . i am about a size 6 on top . I had a child and wanted something to reduce the looks of my mommy pouch . I gave this to my mom and she says it works for her . She is about a size 14 . It makes her sweat a lot ! But after wearing it a while it begins to loose its elasticity . She stays between the middle zip and the last zip -LRB- the smallest sized zip -RRB- . so i guess in all if your larger than a size 10-12 ... this would be a good product to buy .
 It is not very durable . The Neoprene rips offs the fabric after one day of use .
 this crap doesnt work !!! save your damnn money . . The zipper broke after 2 uses ... cheap and useless
 I tried it one time and the zipper will not hold in a smaller adjustment , it 's not usefull at all , would like a refund if possible
 i try it but it was too big , try to add another zipper to make it fit to my waist but even then was big , it didnt last long to fall apart , waste of money , dont bother buying it , find spomething else !!
 Attractive , appears sturdy and comfy , but ... I was excited when I noticed the 3-zipper `` paneling '' . I imagined myself working my way down the panels as I `` melted '' off the post baby pounds . Imagine my dismay when I put this `` holster '' -LRB- belt -RRB- on and it did n't fit . Too big ?!?! whatduh ?? According to the picture on the box , I should have needed assistance from my two kids and hubby to get into this thing ; -LRB- did you see the `` tiny '' chick on the box ?!? -RRB- . I am a good size lady -LRB- 12 -RRB- ... So I would say sizes 14 down pass on this.BTW
 I am not skinny , but I am also not 250 pounds . The belt pulled apart at the seams the first day . It 's going back.I am disappointed that the seems and interior material are so cheap . I like the fact that this belt had zippers .
 A total waste of money . The slimmer belt does not offer any support . It stretches out of shape and came apart at the seams after one wash . Total ripoff
 I was excited by the reviews from the other users and I wanted this belt so bad , I could n't wait . I was extremely disappointed
 I barely received it today , and I barely used it today , and it already tore . I am a size 9/10 , so it did fit me fine , but once I worked out with the belt and I took it off , I notice it had torn on the side . I am really not satisfied with the product .
 I was disappointed when the first time I put the belt on it ripped ! I would think that since it carried a more popular name , like `` Bally '' it would be made of a more superior material . Hey , this is only my personal experience . I wanted this because of the zipper . I have the onlder kind with the velcro and it has n't ripped yet .
 I am average sized , so I used the belt on the tightest zipper . I wanted to keep warm when I jogged outside in the winter , so I felt this would keep my core warm while avoiding wearing a jacket . I used the belt twice on the treadmill and I noticed a red mark on my side after the second use . I looked at the belt and the neoprene had separated from the seam . I literally used the belt twice for a total of two hours . Poor quality . I sent it back for a refund . I guess it is back to wearing a jacket !
 Great quality especially like the long line feature . However it will not adjust small enough to do me any good . Need to add more zippers ! Any waist smaller than 30 '' will not work with this one .
 You may get very excited that you can close the belt at the last zipper . You may be excited that it does not feel too tight when you do so . You will , however , be very disappointed when you take it off and see that the neoprene foam has ripped away from every seam , and the foam has also torn in various other areas - after the first use no less . If you really want something that lasts , look for another product .
 I have been using the exact same belt for one year . After wearing mine out , I had to order me a new one . Well I received it and I wore it one time and it ripped in the inside . I really do n't have the time to go to the post office and send it back .
 I have between a 32 and 33 inch waist and it was still too large even tighted and zipped to the last zipper seam .
 I am very disappointed with this product . It does make you sweat , but does not offer any support . After a couple of washes the belt started to come apart at the seams .
 It fell apart after the first wash . A zipper that I was not even using tore away . Would not recommend .
 i bought this for support b/c my back gives out occasionally . this is a piece of garbage . the zippers ripped right off the belt after wearing for about 5 minutes . the zippers would be better suited on a doll than to be used on a human .
 the zip system is not too godd , it does n't fit me , although it says one size fit all , it is big on my even on the third zip , so for me it was a waste of money . otherwise it is good .
 I bought this product to help slim my waist back down during post-pregnancy workouts . It worked great until I tried tightening it once to get a better effect -LRB- the zipper closure I had it on just was n't tight enough to be effective -RRB- and the zipper tore away from the elastic material ! I was very diasppointed . I love the idea of this product and it definitely worked for awhile ... but I would steer people towards a slimming belt with velcro closure . Just do n't plan on going out in public with either of these on or wearing them under clothing for a `` slimming effect '' ... it 's not what they 're meant for !
 When I first opened the package , I thought it was a little flimsy . I thought the zippers would be nice so I could tighten as I progress . When I tried it on , it was so large , that I had to put it on the smallest adjustment possible.Now , I 'm not a small guy . I 'm 6 ' 1 '' 220 lbs . with a little belly.The next day , I put it on and wore it to work . It felt great . I could feel the heat from the belt around my belly . After a couple hours , though , it started feeling loose again . I took it off and saw that it had split at the seams.As I said previously , the material was really flimsy . The neoprene is SO thin , there 's really no support .
 The belt was everything it claimed , it fit well , it is well made , but the material on the inside -LRB- kind of rubbery -RRB- against my skin made me get a very itchy rash , really quickly and I had to take it off . I do have sensitive skin and I never considered that . I was disappointed that I could not use it .
 This product seems to be old and it is in bad conditions . I am very unhapy with this product .
 I was looking for a support for my back and after reading the other reviews , thought this would be helpful , but it was not . It was too light to give any support and will return it .
 If you are a big girl as myself do n't get it . It will not fit . I am a size 20 and it did not fit .
 I put this on and all seems great . But then I tried to tighten and it tore . I returned it . Besides the zippers will show thru clothing .
 I bought this thinking the zippers would make it fit well . I have a 33 '' waist and it is too large for me . I would n't recomment it at all !
 had it 3 dAYS AND ZIPPER POP OFF ... WASTE OF MONEY !!!! IT WORK BUT WHO WANT SOME THAT DONT STAY TOGETHER ... : -LRB-
 Almost immediately the belt started coming apart at the seams . Rubber stretched out really quick . It just did n't hold up like I thought it would . I was wearing it five to eight hours a day . I had to discard it after a month usage .
 I 'm 6 ' 1 '' , 275 lbs , somewhat fit , with a 38 '' waist ... wore this item and the neoprene ripped from the stitching in less than a half hour . The stitching is weak around the base , at least mine was . Would n't buy this brand again .
 I brought this item and looks exactly like the picture and seemed to be great quality . The only problem I had was the zipper . It kept coming down while walking or exercising .
 Too loose ... Thought it will be thigher . Make me sweat , but keeps going up while exercising . Look bulky under clothes particularly the front zipper ...
 They need to be more specific about the size , unless you have a 30 '' waist and above .
 Item did not work . It broke me out with blisters on my stomach There should be a warning on the package about breaking out with this Belt
 Product is extremely hard to zip , though once on does give good back support . No way I would exercise in this though and this product runs really small . I gave it to a girl friend and she is very small and it took two of us to zip it . She tried to use it the next moring and again had same zipper issues that I had . Love the concept but for us it just did n't work out . Sorry .
 DO NOT BUY , I wish I would have listened to the reviews , it is true this belt sucks , it shreds and it is uncomfortable . After three days it just falls apart . I did not over use it or wash it or stretch it out . It is poor quality and cheaply made . Do not waste your money
 if you want to use this to sweat dont waste your time on this product . its hard to get on and just doesnt work
 Sorry was very unsatisfied with how long or how little this belt lasted . Literally 4 months with moderate exercise . Not acceptable . It began ripping after first wash .
 The first time I put this on , the zipper broke ! It definitely does not work when you ca n't even get it to zip to close it up . What a waste of money .
 The significant reason for purchasing the Philadelphia Phillies Designated Hitter Shorts was for the Phillies logo . However , the logo was only stickered on with some sort of glue . After the second time in the dryer , it fell off ! So now , I just have `` Hitter Shorts '' . I have a preschool son that I routinely take to the park and I pitch him baseballs to hit . He is dressed up in his favorite Phillies uniform . My purchase of the logo shorts was just a fun touch to add to the comradarie of the event . This purchase did not fullfill my expectation .
 I 've owned a 55 gallon tank for over 10 years . By far , this has been the WORST filter I ever had . The constant filling and releasing of water in this filter is noisy to say the least . That is , if you can even position the cap inside the filter to get the thing working properly . It took me hours of fiddling to get this filter to work correctly.The additional heating source inside of the filter itself also turned into a nightmare . If you have frequent power shortages , or lose power from storms , or any other reason , this is not the filter for you . My heating component MELTED the plastic casing around it when our power failed , and the water stopped cycling through the tank . As no one was home at the time , we 're lucky it did n't start a fire . Then by the time anyone noticed that the filter was n't running , it have been a whole night . Not only was the tank water cloudy from going unfiltered , it was also cold.I do n't reccomend this filter at all .
 ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A DECORATION ? OR ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A SILENT DOG WHISTLE THAT FUNCTION ???? I WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION FIRST . THIS IS AN AVERAGE OK ITEM . I WOULD GO STAINLESS STEEL CONSTRUCTED WHISTLE . YOU ONLY BUY ONCE FOR A LIFE TIME ~ ~ ! ALSO LOOK INTO THE ACTUAL FIELD TRIAL TEST RATING FOR QUALITY , FORGET THE LOOKS . SOUNDS FAMILIAR ??
 Difficult to use . I could n't get anything set properly . I was very disappointed with this pedometer . I sent it back .
 It 's got all the bells and whistles , i got the one with the pulse monitor plus calorie burner etc , but when I take it off it has reset itself and I have to reprogram it again . Defeats the purpose .
 I bought this product brand new and found that there is no start/on button , so there is no way to turn on the device . I have googled this problem and found that others have complained of the same thing and have not received any answers to their question . I am suspecting that maybe a whole batch were manufactured without the start/on button and should be recalled . To be fair , I did not buy mine from Amazon but from another online website merchant . But wanted to at least share my review with others in case you are considering buying this product to pick another pedometer .
 I Received this pedometer as a gift and was excited to use it . The manual is so fine print and is a booklet only 2 '' by 1.5 '' so you can imagine how hard it is to read . The book really does not match the images of the instrument in some cases . I had to use a magnifier to read the fine print of the `` mode settings '' . Furthermore the settings and mode buttons would not work . I could not get the thing to respond according to the directions . It could need a new battery , but I do n't think so because the time etc. would blink , but not change . As an engineer I do believe this instrument to be a piece of Chinese junk that is not worth your money . There are a lot better instruments on the market . There is always the chance I received a lemon . New Balance should be ashamed to sell such a poorly engineered instrument . Consumers must choose wisely ... TedTed
 1 . The operating instructions user very poor . Had to contact the manufacturer for instructions on how to reset the unit .2 . The product description was not very accurate
 You have to be a rocket scientist to use this pedometer . It is hard to set , and does n't work properly . I could n't even get it to record steps , which is my main purpose for having a pedometer . Maybe if you want to use it for marathons , it 's OK , but it 's no good for just tracking steps on a daily basis . I 'm shipping it back tomorrow . Do n't waste your money .
 I was excited to try out the pedometer -LRB- it was on backorder and I had to wait over 1 month to get it -RRB- . Unfortunately , it has not worked since the moment I received it . I set the time , date and my step length before going on my first run , but within 3 minutes the screen was blank , and the pedometer had completely reset . The same thing has happened every time I have tried to use it -LRB- I even changed the battery with no luck -RRB- . The functionality appears to be great , although it has never worked for me . Could be a one off fault - just thought I should share .
 The description sounded perfect for my needs . Amazon delivered fast , as always . However , I an returning it . I carefully read and followed the instructions . However , none of the settings could be cleared and they would not reset properly . Even though I set my weight and stride , the pedometer repeatedly altered the settings to something ` close ' to what I had put in . It would not clear the distance and calories values either . I would have attempted to change the battery -LRB- which should n't have been necessary anyway -RRB- , but this too was more of a challenge than it should have been . This thing was pretty much useless .
 I bought one of these , and when I got it out of the box I found that two of the four buttons did n't work . It counted steps fine , but I could n't clear the count between workouts . I exchanged that unit for one that did work right out of the box and for exactly 4 days after that . Then ALL the buttons stopped working and it stopped counting steps . I was n't at all hard on it , I was just using to keep track of my workouts on mini elliptical machine . This thing is a total piece of junk , do n't waste your money .
 I was highly disappointed by this product . While it claimed at track your steps and calories burned , I found the results unreliable . Driving or sitting in a car could add on up to 200 steps while taking a zumba class only added 100 -LRB- and I danced my butt off -RRB- . I suggest getting a garmin and tracking total mileage rather than steps .
 I ca n't get the thing to work at all . I am very disappointed in this , and this is despite carefully reading the instructions , which are clear as dark mud .
 The purple in the dye leaks onto whatever you place it on . I did not want to try them in my hands , afraid I would end up with purple palms .
 This handle broke in first 15 mins of use . This this is not for use . It is only for looks . They need to fix the rail clamps as they break very very easy ...
 This is a very poorly done DVD . I have the Stamina I DVD for both Pilates & Cardio/Rebounder , which I enjoy & use often . I was looking forward to having an advanced program to follow & use . Unfortunately , the instructor tries to get too much information in during a relatively short period of time . Making following the program difficult & very uninteresting.Secondly , she does not keep `` count '' of exercise efforts during the program which also makes the program increasingly difficulty to follow . I therefore am relunctant to purchase the level 3 DVD & / or any other productions by Stamina Fitness .
 I think the Stamina Level 1 is better then Stamina Level 2 . Disapointed . The reason I bought Level 2 was because about 6 years ago I had another Performer and sold it with all the videos and the Level 2 then was much different . They changed it .
 I have a beginners set of dvd from this same company and thought I would move on from there . I got this and hated it . I found she was even more confusing with her directions than ever , but figured it would take a few tries and all would be good . Not me . In the beginning she forgets to tell you how many cords to start with , and in the middle I just could not figure out what I was supposed to be doing or when . I found I was dreading doing Pilates so after almost a month of torture , I returned it .
 This video starts out slow with the simple movements . However , when the more difficult moves are being taught it is too fast and you can watch and watch but the movements are not clear . There is no explanation of the movements and no warnings to the viewer if they are doing these movements for the first time . I have been doing level 1 for over 1 year . I keep watching this video but there are still some of the moves that are not clear to me . I am hoping that they will revise this DVD and do more explaining of the movements . I have incorporated some of the movements in Level 2 with my workout but not all due to worry of injury .
 This was a rock not able to get any thing off it to help grip . Total waste of money ... . It may have been just 40 years old and that was why but it was a waste of money for me .
 This is not from Beretta - so beware . Will it do ? Yes . Is it worth the money I spent for a Beretta knockoff ? No .
 First off it is plastic ! Secondly it arrived with only one side rail attachment as opposed to two -LRB- one for each side of the Cx4 -RRB- !
 When we ordered I was expecting Spanish dices . There is nothing like the real Spanish dices to play a game of Cubilete . We returned and found the real Cubilete dices `` Spanish '' . Amazon was very good about the whole process .
 My horses love them but they last like 20 minutes maximum . That is not effective for the bottom line . Trying to make on my own .
 Item was suppose to be a gift but when we got it in the mail , and could get a better look at it realized it is poorly made .
 The holster seems to be constructed well . The gun fits nicely into it . It states in the description that it will fit on a belt up to 2 1/4 inch wide . That is true IF you are using the metal belt clip and not the sewn in belt loop that will only accept an inch and 1/4 wide belt . Using the metal belt clip on the belt on the outside of the waist does not provide a stable attachment of the holster ; I would not use it this way . The snap on the strap that secures the back of the gun to the thumb break , broke off so now the strap in non-functioning . This snap failure happened right out of the package . I have purchased and used other Uncle Mike 's products since they were of good quality but this one is of low quality . I am returning this holster .
 This is not my first Uncle Mike 's holster so when I unpackaged it I noticed right away something was wrong . One of the retaining straps that 's adjustable `` because it has Velcro on it '' was missing said Velcro ...
 Walmart sells what appears to be an identical box 4 '' deep waterproof box for $ 8.00 I wanted another box like it 2 '' deep . I ordered a GSI 6.625 '' x 5 '' x 2 '' X-Small Transparent Waterproof Utility Box from Amazon for $ 21.73 . It arrived in an undamaged well packaged box . The latches were very loose yet to my amazement I could not open the box and eventually used a butter knife to open it breaking the seal in the process . I was left with a box that never latched properly with a broken seal and loose hinges . I tried to glue the seal and destroyed the box . The Walmart box still works perfectly , tight hinges , latches and the seal was never sticky . I highly recommend the Walmart box the GSI box is very similar but upon close inspection appears to be a cheaper model . Someone could buy better boxes for 1/3 the money at Walmart and sell them for 3 times as much on Amazon . Yeah I could have haggled with the seller shipping a overpriced item back and forth arguing about whose fault it is . I take full blame I was stupid enough to buy it online and try to fix it.Amazon to my suprize refunded the shipping cost reducing my losses 33 % a gesture that helps to restore confidence in online buying and brings customers back .
 You 'd think that the sizes of Small to Extra Large might be a good description of these cases . You know , I just may buy one if I knew how large the large one is .
 The pillow is separated in the middle like there are two pillows instead of one body pillow and not as comfortable as expected .
 the blue one I received looked like a factory defect so I sent it back . stitching was off , craftsmanship quality was not great . so I ordered a new one different in brand and style after seeing a larger size of it , and trying it on physically in a karate store ; they did n't have my size there though so hopefully I 'll be happy with the new one amazon sends me .
 Knocks 'em down for a couple of hours , but long-lasting ? I do n't think so . Better than nothing I guess , but I really do n't care for the chemical smell after use . I doubt it 's gon na do your cows and sheep much good .
 The item arrived to us the week of Christmas three weeks after we had ordered it . It arrived with several broken and several missing parts . Amazon would not send us new parts , they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first . This was to be a Christmas gift to my son , so that was not optional . Had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would I would have had time to return it .
 I am not satisfied with my k2s . The wheels disintegrated on me when skating on hot pavement . Two went out on the same skate!The other thing is , I really do n't like the cushy boot . I want my skates to be firm against my legs . My rollerblades had a ratchet system which could tighten the boots well . The K2s do n't and thus the feel is very sloppy and loose around my ankles . I will never buy K2s again .
 Be leery - The first time I used these K2 Moto skates , the red/black tongue strap pulled off ! Might be a quality control issue , but it should n't have happened . I contacted K2 customer support and it was like pulling teeth to have them replaced . Obviously , judging from the hassle , they do not have the customer in their best interest.I would be cautious with this K2 product and look into a pair of Rollerblades.Addendum - after waiting weeks for K2 to send me a new pair of Motos to replace the failed ones , I emailed K2 's CEO Dodd Grande to explain the sloppy , incompetent , and arrogant customer service ... and being left in limbo with no skates . A new pair of skates I was promised never came , so he finally cut me a check for a full refund.Bottom line - if they sell you faulty or defective equipment , demand refunds from companies like K2 . Do n't compromise with your purchase . Good luck ...
 I purchased this bench based on everyone 's positive reviews and am very disappointed . Either I 'm a little spoiled because I 've been working out in a gym for about 15 years or the people who rated this bench positively are used to exercising on crappy benches they purchased from Model 's . First , when the seat is set for a flat bench position , it feels very uncomfortable . I am not excessively tall or short - I 'm 6 feet tall . Perhaps the gap between the upper and lower seat may be too big . Second , I had to remove the leg developer because it has very limited range of motion . The small piece sticking out of the rear of the leg developer kept hitting the front leg of the bench when I tried doing leg extensions or preacher curls . So now , I have to purchase a stand so I can do preacher bench with free weights . I prefer free weights anyway , but it 's going to cost me a lot of money to get something to rest my preacher curl bar on . Third , Marcy has a bunch of morons working for them . My box was missing a few parts which were essential to completing assembly of the bench . Therefore , I could not work out until received them . I received the bench the end of October . After almost 2 months of begging and elevating the request with a supervisor , I finally received the parts on Christmas Eve 2009 . What a bunch of morons . Stay away from Marcy and find a better bench . If I had to do all over again , I would have bought a separate preacher curl bench and a better quality flat bench . At least I love my Powerline PLM180X Lat Machine which I purchased from Amazon . I use it for pulldowns as well as tricep exercises . I ca n't believe it cost less than $ 200 ! Too bad I ca n't say the same about this bench .
 Why does this thing include only 6 songs only ? Come on , Legend of Zelda , Twilight Princess has some of the best music from a videogame EVER ! And yet we ca n't find any music for it ... for shame ... other than that , other than the price , the set is good .
 This pack looked good , but I expected a more padded hip belt for dayhikes . With full hydration bladder and clothes the hip belt was of no use . The shoulder staps did not fit either . Sorry to say I had to return item .
 This bench terrified me
 If I had known this product could only support 300 lbs , I would have held out for something more expensive and sturdier . My fault for not reading the reviews , lol ! I tried to cancel it but it was too late . Anyway , I received the bench last night , put it together exactly as instructed . It is a nice bench for the price w / free shipping , and it was very easy to assemble . Use with caution , check the bolts periodically , and stay under the weight capacity . For the more experienced bench pressers , I do n't recommend this bench . ** UPDATE ** This bench sucks . THE END .
 Received parts but assembly hardware , nuts , bolts , etc. missing . Called manufacturer and they offered to send in 5-10 days . No thanks - no sense of urgency on their part so I returned the bench
 As with several other reviewers on here , one of the legs folded underneath the bench while I was using this product and the bench collapsed on one side . Please see the picture I uploaded in the Amazon gallery and the other pictures of this phenomenon from different users before purchasing this product.The design of this bench and the weld type , specifically where the legs meet the bench , does not seem to be intended for anything beyond light beginner weight use . I bought this bench used and I did not get a manual so I can not attest to the weight limit warnings this product might have . However , I did not see any low weight limitations posted on the informational tags underneath the bench.I weigh around 190 lbs and bench reps of around 225 lbs . I had used the bench for just over a month before it failed.BOTTOM LINE
 I used this bench for lying dumbbell presses , and it quickly folded where the legs meet the bench . The metal is cheap and thin , and will not take the movement of an adult with weights . If you want something for your cat to sit and watch , it 's great . Otherwise it 's garbage .
 Worked well for about 6 months . Then as I was getting up off the bench , the front leg broke from the weld and buckled under . Then I fell to the floor . Its a good thing there was no weight in my hands or I could have been seriously hurt . I do not recommend this bench unless you reinforce the legs by welding or some other method . Also if you are over 6 feet tall , you will find this bench a little short .
 I used this bench for 6 weeks . I was n't doing any heavy lifting . Basically , just doing some leg lefts while lying on my back . Into the 4th week , heard a little snap . The bench started feeling a little wobbly . Finally , on the 6th week while doing my leg lifts , the bench gave way and I slowly came down on one side . The metal bent down slowly , so I was n't hurt , just disappointed . I would not recommend it .
 Not much good for even sitting on much less benching . Legs started spreadin was unstable from the git go . Unsafe
 I purchased this item and assembled it just as the instructions recommended . However , when I lay down on the bench to grab a bar , the legs started wobbling . I weigh just under 160 lbs , and without any additional weight the legs began to buckle . This bench is irresponsibly weak and dangerous , and I strongly caution anyone from purchasing it . I am already running into trouble with my return process to boot , so I get the feeling that I am paying for the lesson here of not buying cheap weight equipment .
 As many other reviewers have pointed out , these benches are made with substandard materials . The gauge of the metal is too light for a weight bench . Purchased two of these a few weeks ago and with only light use by someone weighing around half of the recommended weight capacity , both are about to collapse . Even during assembly the legs began to buckle while tightening the hardware . Strongly recommend avoiding this bench .
 Cheap , fixed bench for basic lifting . Beware , mine did n't sit flat on the floor after assembly , and wobbles a bit . It also only supports up to 300 lb , meaning a 150 lb person could only bench 150 lb or so safely -LRB- yes , the feet carry some of the weight , but we must be cautious -RRB- . Good , inexpensive beginner 's bench though .
 The bench is usable , but not sturdy or well made at all . The legs are individual components instead of one solid piece so any movement on the bench causes it to wobble at the joint where the leg connects to the bench . It was worth the price , but do n't expect much . You truly are getting what you pay for .
 this bench is nice but i thought it would be higher and more sturdy but it is still good but i wanted it wider i guess but not bad not great as well but its purpose can be full filled but maybe i will use it for a little while only nice gift for a young person i think
 Overall the quality of the bench is fine -LRB- for $ 40 -RRB- . But as the title states , it was missing hardware when it arrived . It was missing 6 washers , 2 bolts , and 2 plastic end-caps for the supports . Luckily , I was able to supplement what was missing with my own miscellaneous hardware . Furthermore , you will need a socket set , or at the very least a crescent wrench to put this together properly , if you get all of the pieces , that is . It stands a little low to the ground for me at about 16 1/2 inches , but not too bad .
 It 's a solid bench for the price , but the bolts may have a tendency of coming loose after ~ 2 months of use . The bench comes with a hexagonal wrench , so keep that in case the bolts do get loose.edit
 Assembled bench , legs were uneven and the platform was tilted . The third time I used it a leg folded under the weld was fine the metal tore because it is thin . The platform cover is slick and the plywood backing will flex creating instability . The only thing they got right was the padding and width of the platform . This bench is junk , I posted pics in the costumer image area of the failure.UPDATE
 Had it for a little over 4 months , and one of the legs buckled while I was doin Bench Presses ... Almost smashed my face with 50 pound dumbells . . Fun ! Not !
 I 'm 180 pounds and I was using two 35 pound dumbbells . A bit of angular momentum put some torque on the corner of the leg , and it snapped on me . I 'm lucky not to have been hurt.Even if you 're smaller than me , I would recommend avoiding this bench . Get a safe , solid bench .
 This awful bench buckled while I was benching 35lb weights , the front leg tore free from the bracket , slammed forward , then the rear leg bent inward - I dropped both weights , narrowly missing my face , and they hit the ground hard enough to cut my carpet!DO NOT BUY this thing is SHODDY and the metal is FAR too thin for any real use .
 I purchased this bench to add to my home gym . After assembly I laid on the bench and it was uncomfortably slanted to the right . turns out the tabs to fasten the pad on were welded on without being leveled and slant to the right . i had to add my own shims between those tabs and the pad . I do like the bench , however , easy to assemble , stoutly built , and a thick yet firm pad . If it were not for the tabs being welded wrong I would have given this five stars for the price .
 Bench collapsed and almost killed me after a month of use . A bracket bent like a tin can and snapped off a leg . I called the company and they said they would ship a replacement part . I waited a month for the part and never came . Finally called again today , back ordered for 4 months -LRB- probably because many are breaking -RRB- . You should buy the Ironmaster bench . Best bench I have ever owned , invest now and it will save you dollars and maybe your life . Apex sucks ask my ribs .
 more junk from china . I took it to work and retapped all the holes welded all the connecting metal parts , I added two gussets to the legs and bottom frame . I cut a one inch thick board and attached it to the factory board . Now its solid as a rock . I guess I could have made this in the shop LOL
 Leg broke off after less than a year of normal use . This seems to be a trend . This product is not safe !
 The welding on this broke ! I was bench pressing , the metal around the welds bent , then snapped and it collapsed . Luckily , I was n't hurt . Maybe for people who are not lifting heavy this would work but any serious lifter should stay away .
 For the inexpensive price of the bench its not bad . I 'm using it for middle school student weight room and I do n't think they will hold up . I ordered 3 benches , one box had already been opened and resealed . The fabric had a 3 inch slice in it so I will be sending it back . Two 6th grade students sat on it and the legs bent . Luckily it was the same ripped bench that I 'm sending back but I ca n't wait to see how the others will hold up.I would be afraid to order this bench if I were a big guy . I 'm also not happy that the company obviously took the bench back as a return and then just sealed it up and sent it off to me !!
 Using moderate weight , I popped a weld on the leg of this bench . If it had failed utterly before I leaped off of it , I would have been seriously injured !
 The product arrived well-packed and on time.I assembled it on my own . The assembly instructions were not perfect , but when are thy ever ? In this case , I think I would give the instructions a grade B. I just needed a an adjustable wrench ; there were not a very large numer of smal parts to deal with . The construction design is good ; it has minimized the number of separate things to attach and affix . I did the assembly slowly and carefully . So , it took me about 45 minutes . With two people working on the assembly . it would take half that time in my estimation.After the assembly was over , I put the bench on a tiled floor . Unfortunately , the bench stands were not level ; it needs a 5/8 inch shim under one edge of the stand to stop it from rocking . On a carpeted surface , this will not be much of an issue . But , on a semi solid surface , like a hard rubber mat , it will be.The bench is very light , seems sturdy enough for bench presses with light moderate weights , and has a very attractive price . The rexine -LRB- faux leather -RRB- cover seems durable and easy to clean . I especially like the fact that it 's so light.If it did not have the level tilt problem , I can see myself giving it 4 or 5 stars .
 I have called the manufacture several times and they said they would send a new bench top . Still no replacement . Take you chances .
 Did n't get past instruction # 1 in trying to put this together . Was supposed to line up a metal plate to attach leg support to bench -- the holes in the plate did n't line up with holes in the bench . Thinking this would still work without the plate , then tried to attach leg support to bench . The screws were too big for the metal threaded holes in the bench . Called Apex who asked if I wanted replacement parts , but did n't know what to replace - nothing fit with anything else . They told me to send it back . I did .
 The legs on this bench bend and are unsafe ! Use at your own risk . A waste of money . I will now have to buy a new one from someone else .
 This weight bench looks great . The padding is reasonably thick and it feels comfortable on your back . After the first time I used the bench I noticed that the legs were bowing in slightly on one side . I disassembled it and reassembled it in the hope that this would correct the problem . After the second use I noted that one of the legs was bowed severely . The bench is unsafe and likely to collapse with further use . Unfortunately I 'll need to retire this bench and purchase another , more sturdy model . This bench would probably be appropriate for use under 150 lbs . I used it to perform bench press exercises with two 100 lb dumbbells . This weight is n't excessive , but the bench does n't seem designed well enough to accommodate this amount of weight . I did n't see any weight limit when I decided to purchase it . The price was right , it looked great , so I dove right in and bought it . Beware .
 This piece of crap broke on me in the midst of just bench pressing 140lbs ! I have never gone any higher than that since using . They need to be sued for puttinig out this defective product ! What broke was the actual mental leg at the head of the bench . Really ? This could have been fatal ! The weight almost landed on my face !
 The bench was given to me as a Christmas present . One of the legs broke just before my third set . If I was holding any weight I could have been severely injured.This bench is not safe period .
 While lying flat on the bench and doing leg raises , one of the legs buckled and sent me rolling in to the wall . I 'm not large for a guy 6Ft 200lbs , I expected a better product then this POS .
 Lots of good reviews , great price , what could go wrong?Mine could not be assembled correctly . It had a manufacturing defect where the bolt holes in the vertical leg pieces were not aligned with the corresponding holes in the horizontal foot pieces so that I could not actually insert a bolt to attach the two pieces together . Well , it is made in China , but what is n't these days , right?From what I could put together , it seems like an adequate bench for moderate weight lifting . I 'm not sure what the weight limit is , but it 's probably enough for the average home fitness user . Maybe I just received a lemon since so many other reviewers were happy with their purchase . With that said , I think I 'll pass on trying another one of the same and keep looking for a bench . Amazon has a great return policy for defective merchandise , so that should n't scare you away .
 Length :
 this bench can only support 310 pounds thus making it useless for `` real bench pressing '' . I weigh 180 pounds , Whig means I van put 120 pounds safely on a bench to lift . USELESS . I basically wasted 40 dollars buying this cheap product . do n't be fooled and do n't skimp out on buying quality next time .
 they say max weight 300lbs i didnt know this was person and dumbbells the welds on one of the legs that connect to the crossbar busted had product under a week
 Every time I try to bench press anything on this bench , I am taking my life in my hands . It violently wobbles and jerks under any significant weight .
 I was sent the wrong item . The model # is correct but the specs and pics are for JD2 .1 . Amazon sent me another and it was wrong too . I am glad I got a full refund though . I wish amazon would change their picture and description to that of the JD2 .2 and not of the JD2 .1 . Its ok if you want a JD2 .2 but if you were expecting the original version -LRB- which is more heavy duty and weighs about 9 pounds more -RRB- then this is not what you want .
 The bench did n't sit flat on the floor after assembly . So I contacted customer service and requested them to send the defective part . 2 weeks and no part yet . Also the bench capacity is only 300lb . So if you are 175 lbs , you can only lift up to 125 lbs which is not much for barbell bench press . So if you are just a beginner , then this bench might be OK , else it is of little use .
 It was not as advertised . It did not come with the lighter power cord . I am returning it because that is why I bought it . I need a back lit display so that I can see it at night . This will not stay on because it is battery powered only .
 This item is completely inaccurate . I placed it where recommended , outside the vehicle away from engine heat and wind , and it was 10-20 degrees off at all times . Do n't waste your money !!
 The road pro I was very mad about this product it do n't read the right temp inside or out . Its all ways 10 to 20 degrees off at all times . The only thing that works is the clock
 Sorry folks this product was a huge mistake . It worked as a clock but as far as a warning of freezing conditions , no . Very cheap . Waste of time and money , I returned it .
 May be an ok product but I recieved no sprayers . Contacted two entities for help but they passed the buck . Oh well , RETURN ! regretfully .
 This knife is okay . It works fine for most people but is nowhere near the quality you can get from other brands for the same price.The handle feels like plastic and the spring assist feels dangerous because of the way you have to hold the knife . The way the blade swings out makes it almost want to flip out of my hand . A flipper design is much safer . Ergos are okay , jimping is too sharp , the blade steel is not that good compared to what you would get from Spyderco or Kershaw at the same price point . It has a cheap feel in the hand although it is very light . The seatbelt cutter is a gimmick especially when this has a fighting oriented black tanto blade . The pocket clip is excellent.A better option is the Kershaw blur . Same assist deployment method but feels safer , stronger constructionm better blade steel , more traditional lock , more configuration options etc. . There are also great offerings from Spyderco like the Manix 2 which have 10 times the quality of these SOGs.In short , you should only get this knife if 1 -RRB- you love the look of it , 2 -RRB- you really need a good deep carry clip , 3 -RRB- you want a very light knife .
 I really wanted to love this knife . All the other reviews are so positive , and it seems so cool , but once it came it feels like such a dollar store knockoff.The Handle
 This is a very solid yet extremely light sharp knife . You can take it anywhere and everywhere and its light enough that you forget it is in your pocket . Its held up fine for everyday use including diving , fishing and boating in saltwater environments and is still sharp enough to handle any task . I highly recommend this knife.The above was my review before I tried to use my knife and the blade broke in half . For the price , I wish it were a little more durable . Before that happened I was very pleased with it .
 I paid $ 50 dollars for my serrated version and feel as though it was a complete ripoff . I originally bought it because the handle was big enough to be more comfortable in my hand than my Kershaw Leek . As soon as I got it out of the package , I was disappointed with it . Way too much play in all directions ; the lock-up on this blade is awful . The cheap plastic handle makes it light , but I would n't trust it to do anything even medium duty.In comparison , I have a Kershaw Leek for the same price that is made in the USA and is of far better quality all around . My wife paid $ 29 for her CRKT Ken Onion designed folder , and it is just as good as the Leek.Very disappointed with this knife .
 This was a horrible experience in gift giving . I ordered this toybox as a baby gift . First , the website did not let me send a message stating it was a gift , from whom , etc. . Amazon was absolutely no help in this arena and placed the blame on the website of the seller . Then I found out the package was delivered to my friends in Albuquerque -LRB- I live in Atlanta -RRB- with absolutely no assembly instructions . The box was void of any phone numbers or other references to figure out how to request instructions . Without my knowledge , my friends finally found a website site and tracked down the manufacturer to request assembly instructions . This was my first time buying anything from amazon.com and it will be my last .
 I purchased this Toy Chest since it was in sale and got it today and we started assembling . When we put the screws and tighten the wood cracks in several places . I do n't know how many days its going to last . I dont know why people use pressed wood for this kind of piece and sell it for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . This piece is not definetly worth the money . Please starting using solid wood or anything that does not crack . I love the look , but that deceives . My son loves to sit on it , but I am worried that it will break someday . By the way the Instructions for Assembly given with the product is should be much more clear and step by step .
 I figured for over $ 100 I would have received something of better quality . There were minor scratches on most pieces and the graphics were slightly smudged . Nothing major enough to go through the hassle of taking it apart , packing it back up , and dealing with the return process . Assembly did n't go well , the included screws broke -LRB- I broke three of them , only by using a handheld screwdriver , the heads twisted right off -RRB- . I ended up having to drill extra holes since the included screws broke off . Also , the instructions -LRB- the usual Chinese wordless instruction sheet -RRB- did n't put things together in the right order , so you ended up having to improvise . Parts of it are little more than cheap press board . I have my questions on whether or not it is going to last in my son 's room more than a year or two.All in all , just know you 're paying $ 100 for a cheaply made Chinese made novelty item , not a real piece of furniture .
 ONE STAR is generous . We 'd LIKE to like this product . But they sold us the wrong part . So we ca n't attach it to our Goalrilla backboard . So it is useless . And no one -- from the manufacturer -- GOALRILLA -- to the second party distributor -- PLUMSTRUCK -- to the third party customer service firm -- HAYNEEDLE -- is even trying to be helpful.BEWARE
 I 've been using this machine at my work Gym for the last 2 months on a regular basis . I love the workout programs and the way the machine feels . However just this week I broke the machine !! It turns out that the flywheel attachment bolt has sheared due to metal fatigue . I am not particularly stressing the machine and at 240lbs should n't be causing this kind of damage to professional gym equipment -LRB- the maximum user weight is 350lbs according to their specs -RRB- . The machine is used lightly by the staff at my company -LRB- maybe 1.5 hours use a day at best -RRB- . Maybe we had a particularly weak machine or lower quality machine where the welds were n't done properly . Other than this issue , it 's a nice machine to use . Very comfortable.Anyway , if you 're a professional gym outfit , be wary . Make sure you get a warranty !
 Product says the Pro 's love this stuff but with the little cotton fibers coming loose all the time , -LRB- remember this stuff is made from cut up underwear -RRB- and leaving tiny little cotton pieces all over the floor , inside and outside all over my guns ai n't a good thing to me.Maybe they can be used for something but I do n't recommend using as gun patches especially when used when used with cleaning fluid or oil as the fluid just makes it order to pick up all those little almost microscopic pieces of cotton .
 These are about 1/2 the price as the ones in my local outdoor store . They are also about 1/2 the quality , I end up using 2 times the amount if not more when cleaning . They are very thin and the threads come out easily . If your looking for cheap , look no further . You get what you pay for with these .
 I Purchased this product because they claim it will fix a slow leak in a co2 gun . It does not . Still leaks . May be good for lubrication , but will not fix leaks .
 I purchased this oil for a Gamo break barrel rifle . When it arrived there in bold letters was this note `` Not for use with break barrel air rifles '' . Makes me wonder why this is n't noted in the product description.The instructions that came with the rifle were minimal at best .
 I paid far too much for this item -LRB- pellgun oil -RRB- . I found it at Walmart and academy Sports and Outdoors for $ 2.98 . Fool me once shame on you , fool me twice shame on me . Do n't be fooled learn from my experience . At 5.98 for 1/4 ounce that would equate to nearly 24.00 an ounce . Get the point !
 As others have said , but I did not notice , this is not for break barrel pellet rifles . I wish I had seen that in the product description !
 As previous review states , `` this is not for spring air rifles '' . Well , i did n't read that before i bought this oil . I found out online that any oil placed in a spring air rifle can -LRB- and will -RRB- explode inside the chamber , similar to the combustion inside a diesel engine . Please add not for spring air rifles in the description Amazon .
 The tax is very hight for chinese products for import to Mexico .
 I put it together , but then the handlebar would n't come out easily for folding and puting in the trunk . Also , the shift mechanism in the rear wheel has very little clearance from the ground.Visually , the finish quality looks very good however.Not suitable for kids - the height is ok , but the reach for the handlebar is very awkward at low seat heights
 Just looking at the picture , this machine seems to have problems . How the heck do you reach if you 're a short person ? I do n't see steps ! I also do not like the strange curves on the pull up bar ; it should be straight with additional handles . No ? Like I said , I do n't have this machine , but I am looking for a pull up dip station . I do n't think I would buy this one . It looks fancy in the picture but that 's just that .
 THIS PRODUCT might be okay if I GOT IT ! COMPLAINT SENT NO REPLY X TWO ! CAN I GET SOMEONE TO LISTEN ?
 This is the worst tent I have ever owned . I am not new to camping in a tent . I was a boy scout as a kid and have spent many rainy nights in a tent . I received this tent as a wedding gift a few years ago , and it is very roomy ... I 'll give it that , but when the rain comes it leaks like crazy . Even if there is an excess amount of dew in the morning you 'll get wet . I think the problem lies in how the tent poles come together at the top center of the tent . The connector piece touches the rain fly and wicks the water in . The top of the tent without the rain fly is screen mesh . So when the water wicks in it runs down the screen , pools up , and eventually falls through . I even added a seam sealer to the rain fly , and water still came through .
 Would never buy another tent from Target . They would n't take it back . Had it in the first rain while using it a few months after purchasing , had between 2 and 4 gallons of water in it by morning . Luckily we could get inside a house . All our stuff was soaked .
 Do not order this product if you have any neoprene dumbbells . They simply will not fit .
 You would not want to repair any cue that is worth repairing with this kit.The head of the cue clamp is smaller than a cue tip and it 's angle is slightly off . When you press the cue tip against the clamp , one side of the cue tip will separate from your cue , causing a bad bonding . It comes with 12 low-quality cue tips . The chalks are okey , except that they are not even square and sizes are slightly different . I wonder how the sizes of the chalks can be made irregular . Maybe they were made by hand ... Oh , one more thing . To prevent the cue clamp from scratching your cue , the kit comes with some felt cloth . However , you have to put the felt cloth on the clamp by yourself and the glue on the back of the cue clamp is not sticky enough ... I 've decided to go back to my old repair method ; buy my own cue tips , apply glue and let it dry a little before pressing the cue tip onto the cue , drop the cue heads-down to the floor a few times to make sure a good bonding , shape the cue tip after a few hours .
 This bag was for a child who loves Martial Arts ... so I ordered the bag for her , based on the style and the stylish writing on the side . I received a disappointing black bag with blue sides , and no writing ... I thought even though for color choice it said blue , I just assumed the red parts would be blue ... I got a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BAG !!! Looks nothing like the picture !! Be aware !!!
 Rothco makes soem good gear but the real deal is a lot better . but not a bad light weight fleece .
 Hi . I recently ordered this from amazon . When it came however i was not impressed . In fact i was very disapointed . I had needed a good edc/utility knife and heard the DELICA 4 was a great option . WRONG ! For starters the blade had so much play up and down when its open i can wiggle the knife and hear and see it move . Also the lock is located twards the middle of the handle and when i grip the knife it presses down . I personaly would not trust the knife under any moderate to hard cutting . I expected much more from spyderco . I bought the 3rd generation modle for 25 bucks brand new at a trapper show and it performs way better , almost perfect . For anyone who really needs a work knife try the kershaw blur or the benchmade pika2 .
 I was so frustrated with those so called `` sticky mats '' , my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog.So I decided to give the $ 50 skidless yoga towel a try.This worked pretty well for my slipping hands , but i had a new problem . I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga . -LRB- downward facing dog , even poses like triangle and extended side angle -RRB- . I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat -LRB- those rubber mats -RRB- which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences.I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat , maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel.I realized with yoga mats that every person is different , so what does n't work for me , may work for you . I just thought I would give my 2 cents .
 This mat is essentially a thin towel with rubber rivets on the bottom for traction . I 'm a pretty big guy at 6 ' 0 '' and 230 lbs . I could not use this mat for yoga at all . The mat slips A LOT ! My feet would end up getting bunched up in the mat and it ended up being more distracting and uncomfortable than anything else . I think that I am going to try one of those thick rubber mats instead . Good luck !
 This is , by far , the worst delivery I have experienced with an on-line order . I am not able to review the actual product because I still do not have all of the parts necessary to use this basketball hoop , despite the fact that it was ordered a month ago . The original shipment did not include the rim , net or the necessary hardware to install the rim . How do you forget to include the rim assembly for a basketball hoop ? I called Amazon and they were very friendly and offered to send me an entirely new system -- pole , backboard , etc. -- because they can not just send the rim assembly . Alternatively , they said I could call Spalding directly and Amazon would reimburse me for any expenses . I called Spalding directly and they agreed to send the rim assembly and `` no doubt '' it would arrive within three days . Six days later the new rim arrived , but the bolt-pattern did not work with the backboard , so I am going to have to mail it back to Spalding . Supposedly , the correct rim has been shipped , but I remain skeptical . The people at Amazon and Spalding were very pleasant and apologetic , but this has been ridiculous . In retrospect , I seriously regret buying this through Amazon . Any money saved has been far exceeded by time spent and frustration of trying to simply get all of the parts . I have purchased through Amazon many times and this is the first problem with a delivery . This experience , however , is enough to give me considerable pause before ordering anything that is either large or that requires timely delivery .
 I bought this item with the understanding that there was a workout DVD included . Although the product is made well I would have purchased a different one that included a DVD .
 Big disappointment . The lack of quality control was evident from the moment my eyes first saw this helmet out of the box .1 . The foam was dented in places like someone had dropped it against the edge of a hard surface . Other places had excess foam covering up the outer plastic cover . Furthermore , there was just a lot of extra bits of foam all over the helmet that should have been brushed off .2 . The velcro for the pads were placed so only about 1/2 the velcro strip could be used to hold on the pads .3 . MOST IMPORTANTLY Bell did not cut off all the filling points for the foam cast . One piece stuck out under a pad about 1/3rd of an inch into my head when I put it on . It felt horrible and the helmet leaned sideways on my head because of it . What makes it worse is that whoever at bell put the velcro and pad in place over it , had to have seen it and just let it go.For a 100 + dollar helmet , this is unacceptable . My 20 dollar shwinn appears to have better quality control than this helmet . Also , this helmet should n't be named `` sweep . '' There is almost no sweep to it . It 's like most other helmets that look like you are wearing a bowl on your head.UPDATE
 This device has a mind all its own . It has difficulty resetting the pitch count and will oftentimes tabulate 2 pitches for every one push of the button . Do not recommend .
 Balls and strikes tally has been consistently less than the pitch count total . I 'm constantly glancing at the pitch count , so I know that 's accurate and verified by the opposing coach , however the balls and strikes tally never adds up to the total , so who the hell knows . Buttons are also a little too hard to push . I 'm switching back to mechanical .
 I purchased this product for this last season of baseball . This product gave me and my other coaches nothing but trouble . The buttons would stick and not record or double record a pitch . The device was not consistent about clearing the count . The only button that was consistent was the A/B button . On top of all of this , the battery low indicator came on . I went to replace the battery and found I had to remove several screws just to get the back off . Then I had to remove another screw to release the battery . Very inconvenient . After the new battery the counter last about a week before it quit altogether.Save yourself the bother and get a mechanical pitch counter .
 It is really a pain to navigate through functions -LRB- i.e. turning it in , resetting pitch counts , etc -RRB- .
 I have purchased Ray-Ban glasses for many years . Recently , I got a bad pair and I was happy that I was dealing -LRB- though I was dealing -RRB- with a high end company . Well , this is not the case with Ray-Ban . The warranty department is nearly impossible to reach and they do not honor the 1yr defect policy . Mine fell apart at the hing and they wanted about 3/4 of the price to fix them ! I 'm not going to purchase from this company any longer and I recommend that you do the same .
 The red frames are what drew me to these glasses ... but once I put them on , the frames were on the heavy side and left marks on my cheeks after only a few minutes of wearing ... so I sent them back and purchased the red framed Clubmaster 's from Ray Ban and they fit perfectly
 Ordered these thinking they were 50mm when in fact they showed up as 54mm . When you return something you have 10 days to do it and have to pay for the return as well . After 5 or so weeks and about $ 30 extra out of my pocket , I finally had the 50mm . Make sure you really look at what you are buying with these people and email them if you are uncertain .
 I bought one pair of shades from defineyoureyes and was amazing , but this second buy was horrible . The product looks like a replica . One arm crooked , the RB logo in the glasses was done by hand on the glass . The sunglasses looks cool but the product doesnt looks like i expected .
 I tried on the exact same pair that a co-worker has , and they fit great . I decide to order my own pair , paid $ 85.00 for them , and they slipped off my face every time I looked down . Not sure what the problem was , but they are currently en-route back to Amazon !!!
 this is not right i got just my case and no glasses inside so yea in this is alot of money for me not to have my glases
 Do n't be misled by the picture or by the description of these sunglasses . I wanted orange and thought these were perfect , however , when I got the product , they were anything BUT orange . If you want brown sunglasses , then these are for you , but if you wanted a cool orange -LRB- instead of the neon orange -RRB- , then these are most definitely not for you . I returned mine instantly . Very disappointing .
 The glasses were incorrectly described ... these are the new not the old style that were listed in the title.Amazon took them back as a returnSG
 I got a 2nd hand rayban with many scratches on it . I think it 's original but i thought i would have a brand new pair of glasses but they sent me a pair of 2nd hand pair of rayban .
 Apparently the 50mm do n't exist , as I tried to order them , but received the 54mm twice . When asking Amazon and the sunglasses company why the mistake kept happening , neither owned up to the issue , or could even answer me .
 Definitely do not bother . I was really excited to buy these glasses here instead of from the retailer because i would have been saving $ 30 or so , but do not bother with these , they 're an imitation . If you 're going to spend $ 70 on sunglasses , you might as well get the real ones for $ 114 from ray ban themselves , or buy the $ 5 imitation kind , because that is what these are worth . I 'm really disappointed it took me too long to realize this fact , and so now I cant get refunded . Please do not waste your money .
 Ordered the glasses and only got a case in the mail ; no glasses inside . Have n't accepted my return yet and all of my messages have been sent without a reply .
 First i got an email about my item being shipped , and they charged it on my credit card . A couple of days later , another email about a refound and it was confusing . Then i got in touch with the company and they were just like `` it was a mistake . The item is out of stock '' Even though when i added it to the cart they were plenty in stock ! . So , i still do n't know why amazon is asking me to rate a transaction that was a failure : s
 I bought a pair of Ray-Ban RB2140 902/57 . They were listed as `` Polarized '' also was indicated with the '' / 57 '' . However , once I received them I quickly realized that they were NOT polarized lenses . First off , they did n't have the `` P '' after the Ray-Ban inscription on the front of the right lens . Also they failed every test to check for light polarization -LRB- i.e. viewing a LCD screen and rotating the sunglasses should make the screen darken or disappear -RRB- . This may have been an honest mistake of someone putting non-polarized sunglasses in a box labeled polarized . Though once I started investigating the lenses themselves I realized that the lenses were n't even authentic Ray-Ban lenses . However , the frames were most definitely real . So someone at some stage of the process inserted -LRB- or replaced the real lenses -RRB- FAKE lenses into a pair of REAL frames ! And if you know anything about high-quality sunglasses -LRB- i.e. Ray-Bans -RRB- what you are really paying for are the lenses , NOT the frames . I 've contacted the seller and Amazon , but neither seems too concerned . So just keep this in mind when you receive your sunglasses . The frames may pass all of your quality control tests , but be sure you are n't being duped on the lenses !
 Ordered black on black wayfarers , what was sent was tortoise shell and gold metal , Made In China , called RayBan , and was informed that they have been out of stock for a long time on the black on black wayfarers . Also found out that rayban is now officially making lower grade ray-bans in China ... Shame Shame Shame , yet another company gone to the realm of cheap labor ... Sad ... should n't advertise something you do n't have nor will ...
 Spend this much for glasses and you expect them to last ! Lasted three months and the temple fell apart - ca n't return them anymore , and RayBan charges $ 100 to fix them , so we wasted money on there . It is better to get cheaper glasses that can be repaired . Also , the marked is so full of counterfeits , we are not even sure what we got .
 Every time you pick a size , the colors available for that size do no show up . If you pick the color you want and then pick the size , the color goes to the default color , not even indicating if the size and color combo is available.Frustrating !
 If they do n't fit , you get charged a $ 29 + restocking fee , buy them somewhere else pr you will get charged
 I ordered a pair of tortoise/G -15 XLT original wayfarers and I received black ones instead with a 22mm bridge , no big deal . The problem was when I placed the order again for the tortoise ones , received them and they were still 22mm . The way I could tell is by the model numbers inscribed on the inside of the left arm which reads RB2140-902 - -LSB- 50/22 -RSB- . In my ever so lengthy hunt for wayfarers that fit a smaller face , which are the true original ones that come with a 15mm bridge , I stumbled on this Amazon listing that advertises exactly that , a 15mm bridge . Lo and behold . But beware , Amazon is falsely advertising and does not actually have any 15mm bridge sized Wayfarer 's whatsoever which I found out after contacting the marketplace seller directly who told me that Amazon is the party responsible for the false advertising . I gave it two stars not because of the product itself but because of the lack of care to accurately depict the product .
 For MANY years I bought Wayfarers because they ARE stylish . ALL broke at the nose bridge . I still have six that broke that way . BUYERS BEWARE . . !
 the glasses came in a box that was squished in transit , let alone the smallest box to fit a pair of sun glasses in them . they came crooked and they have a scratch on the frame . thinking about returning the package . . the whole reason i bought online is so i would n't get a display pair of expensive sun glasses .
 Hmmm this is a tough one , I could n't decide if I liked the glasses or not , they fit great ! But ... . I think they look like GIRL glasses , which I think its because the size 54mm -LRB- go smaller , and they wont look like female glasses ! -RRB- I didnt notice until I started seeing pictures of myself . I 'm unpleased that I wasted money on glasses that I 'll never wear , its the one downfall to ordering items like this on the internet . So if your a man DO NOT buy these glasses in the 54mm . BUY A SMALLER SIZE!I hope this will help for someones future purchase!Thanks
 Well i received the box yesterday and when I opened the it seemed a litte bit damaged . The glasses are ok , they have no scratch or things like that , but the RB label on the left side of the glasses , keep me thinking about its originality . Two weeks ago i bought i fake pair and when I went to the optic shop , they told me that was very ` rude-made ' because you actually could feel the label like it was maded by a sharp object , this happens again with these glasses , I can feel the label ` scratch ' from behind the glass . So I 'm not pretty sure if a real one or not.I will carry them to the optic again -LRB- 2nd time , buying fake stuff -RRB- to see what happens.UPDATE : FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE THEY WERE A GOOD REPLCA BUT IN COMPARISON WITH THE ORIGINAL RAYBAN 'S THEY SEEMED BARBIE-PLASTIC ! I 'M REALLY ANGRY WITH THIS SELLER AND WITH AMAZON , SELLING FAKE STUFF , AND STEALING MONEY.I DO N'T RECOMEND YOU BUYING GLASSES FROM THIS SELLER , EVEN THE CASE , BROKE AFTER TWO OPENINGS!I LIVE IN COLOMBIA SO ITS PRETTY HARD TO REFUND THE ITEM AND IS EXPENSIVE AS WELL . IT 'S REALLY BAD , IT GIVES A BAD IMAGE TO AMAZON.SO THAT 'S IT I LOST MY MONEY .
 I ordered this because I was replacing a lost pair . The description says `` glass '' but this is not true as they sent me a pair with plastic lenes . Wayfarers come in both plastic and glass lenses . I had a pair with what Ray-Ban calls their G-15 lenses -LRB- real glass -RRB- and you know it when you look thru them .
 received the completely wrong pair of glasses after waiting forever to receive them , totally disappointed and now i have to go through the mission of returning it without a complimentary return label .
 I was shocked and disappointed when I received a pair that appeared to have been used . The ray ban box was worn , bent and torn . The glasses themselves appeared to have been worn with the plastic sleeves missing , the G-15 sticker worn and thrown back on and the cleaning cloth also entirely missing . This the first time I have ever received such a poor product from Amazon . I hope this isnt the start of a bad trend in shipping out used products as new .
 DON `` T BUY FROM DORO SPORTS . I did n't receive the marker on time . We called Doro to see why we did n't get the marker , they told us the package was returned damaged . When we did receive the marker the box had been opened . I was worried the gun was returned and would n't work . I was right the marker did n't work . We contacted Doro and they refused to take the marker back . So now we are stuck with a marker that does n't work and we have to try and repair on our own .
 rips after one use , not even squeezing hard . Piece of junk do n't buy it . I ca n't believe with all the good rubber in the world they put junk on this that tears after short use .
 You might sell more of these if they were n't the rival teams colors . Hawkeyes are Black and Gold , Go Hawks!cyclones are red and gold . No Hawkeye fan will buy this .
 Very disappointed it was made with thin material I have a clear plastic curtain behind it and u can see right through the NHL curtain I could have bought a better one at dollar general
 Bought and sent back two pairs b/c thay both arrived scratched . The abrasions inside the clamshell pack mirrors the fine scratches on the lenses . Looks like these REALLY got jarred in the distribution process . I sent both back to Amazon without a problem as they also covered the return postage and refunded my money . Oddly I also purchased the clear lense glasses at the same time from Amazon and those arrived w/o a scratch . Maybe these amber lense glasses are made in a different/further factory ? Too bad these are for my son and they fit hm great ! All the local retail shops either don not sell youth shooting glasses OR have them for $ 20 -LSB- plus -RSB- dollars which is way too much !
 Just got back from a trip to the Adirondacks / Lake Colden . I watched this product fail twice in one night -- the bears can now , evidently , routinely open these . The black ones -LRB- Garcias -RRB- still work -- at least I saw two that did -- albeit with several nice bite marks . If you are going to the Adirondacks or somewhere else with lots of bears who are smart , do n't use this product or you 'll be hiking back after your first night .
 We took the Kit on a 3 day kayak trip.One use was enough for me!The storage bag did not leak liquid or `` solids '' . I did n't check to see if it turned to a gel!But , wow , did it stink.The other boats could n't follow me , my cargo hatch still stinks , and my wet/dry bag only smells better after a bleach dunk.Use it if you have to , but be prepared to plug your nose afterward . -LSB- Sorry no video review < :| -RSB-
 The kit requires a sort of stand for it to be useable , sold separately Did n't see that mentioned in the description , though I may have missed it . I wanted something to stuff in a back pack so I thought I would just return it . Apparently it is not returnable because of the nature of the item . Did n't see that in the description either . So I am out $ 8 and some change and have a few plastic bags to show for it . Feel like Jack and the bean stalk , but at least he ended up with a hen for his mistake .
 I purchased the hammock because it could stay out in the rain . We tried it out and it felt scratchy and made us itch so I returned it immediately . Probably was the polyester that was in it . It also kept trying to tip us out of it . My other one did n't do that . It cost me another $ 16.70 to send it back . Next time I will buy it right from a local store . Very unhappy .
 I bought this watch and the second time I wore it the band came apart . One of the things I wanted most was the alarm and you can barely hear it when it goes off . It is not worth even the sale price .
 A fool for the beauty of it , I purchased this Omega just short of a year ago . Thought I would have it for life . It stopped working last month after a day of simple recreational diving -LRB- and no , I did not open the helium-release valve -RRB- . Today I heard from the Omega-listed customer service center that it would cost more than $ 1000.00 to repair . A 300 meter dive watch that did n't last 30 ? Please ... . What use is a `` warranty '' , if it will still cost more than half the original price to repair ? Is this the level of customer service you would expect at this price ? Not for most people , I would expect . This has nothing to do with the good service at Amazon . This has everything to do with Omega not standing behind their product . What a disappointment !
 I bought a Omega thinking it high quality . It stopped functioning in less than 9 months.Because I had not bought it through a `` Qualified dealer '' they would not repair it . Basically said screw you.As far a I am concerned I would never purchase anything from Omega .
 I picked this rating because although it worked great the first time i used it the second time i went to turn the nob -LRB- which breaks the valve on the C02 cartridge -RRB- , it bent out of place , so now i can not put the grip back on the gun . I spent some good money not only on the gun itself but on extra pellets and C02 cartridges , so its more than just a loss on that aspect , i would not recommend this pellet gun to anyone .
 I bought this for my son he said it was bigger than he thought but enjoyed his new gun . It is a heavy pellet pistol .
 I was slightly disappointed with this product I got this thinking it would be better than what it was this gun cant shoot though a soda can for starters I also put it in a vise to make It hold still to see if it was constant but it was not it is kind of fun but honestly I could shoot at my friends with this and still feel like there safe2-5 for this product .
 I bought 2 of these , 1 as a gift . Not only did it come out of the package broken but took me an hour to disassemble assess the problem fix it and put it back together , now it works fine but it was a complete embarrassment to give a broken pellet gun as a gift and I am thoroughly displeased with this produce and it is not as powerful as they advertise
 I know that Crosman is a great brand . i have loved them for years ! But this was one experience that really made me think about buying another Crosman gun . Luckily Amazon has a great return policy so i was able to return it . So first I took out the gun and put pellets in the magazine . I shot the first shot and BOOM JAM ! I was thinking that i just had bad luck . So I unjamed it and shot again . After using it for about 2 days I started to hear a hissing noise coming out of the gun ! The CO2 was leaking ! The CO2 finished in about 10 minutes after that . So in conclusion ... Pros : Looks NicePriceCons : Really Cheap GunCO2 leaksUnreliable
 Crosman 3576 Semi-Auto CO2 Powered Pellet Revolver with 6-Inch BarrelThis revolver is not nearly the gun I read about in the prior reviews.In my experience it 's weak and not nearly as powerful as my Beretta pellet pistol.I 'd choose the Baretta any day over the 357 . My 357 loses power at 40-50 feet.To think I paid extra to have it sent overnight.Phew !!!! Sorry folks but that 's my honest opinion and truth.Maybe I purchased a bad one , but I do n't like it at all .
 I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS GUN BECAUSE I USED TO HAVE ONE THAT I PAID 72 $ FOR AT WALMART A FEW YEARS AGO AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT-IT WAS STOLEN . SO I AM WAITING WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION AFTER ORDERING MY NEW GUN ONLY TO BE LET DOWN !!!! IT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO MY OTHER ONE EXCEPT FOR LOOKS . AS FAR AS THE POWER AND ACCURACY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT . MY HUSBAND IS NOW CALLING THE COMPANY - ... -LRB- TO BE CONT ... -RRB-
 fast shipping item was missing some parts but everything else was ok . tried to contact the seller but never replied . I had to buy parts from some other ppl
 I ordered this item based mostly upon the positive reviews ... look , this Pellet Revolver really may be the `` bee knees '' , but ... I would n't know cuz ... IT DOES N'T COME WITH CO2 CARTRIDGES !!! No where in the Product Decsription does this get mentioned ... I wanted to use this thing right away and for some reason it takes ANOTHER WHOLE WEEK to get the CO2 's delivered via Amazon ... C'mon Crosman , get your act together and ensure people know what they 're buying ! Ya , I 'm STILL waiting on the # @ & % CO2 's to be delivered , so ... I 'm not a happy camper ... -LRB- BTW ... i purchased the ammo at WalMart , but that also does NOT come with the gun ... -RRB-
 I GOT THIS GUN BECUSE IT LOOKED COOL AND IT WAS A SEMI AUTO PISTOL.I USED IT FOR ABOUT 1 MONTH AND HALF AND GOT BORED OF IT . HOWEVER IT SILL WORKS FINE .
 The Gun is nice and feels nice but the Gas leaks on this !! I can only fire like 30-50 bbs/pellets !! and the aim is terrible!Thanks God I can return it ...
 I 've purchased two of these guns over the past 2-3 years , for the sole purpose of scaring away roaming dogs . I can count on two hands the number of times I used each gun . With the first one , the barrel latch wore down to the point that the barrel would n't stay up . That was after 20 or less reloads of cartridges . I bought another one as replacement in February 2011 , and have been extra careful to avoid wear on the barrel latch . Now the problem is leaking CO2 . Once a new cartridge is put in , it 's empty in several hours just laying on a table . I 'd say I 've used this gun maybe 7-8 times in a year and a half ; fewer times than the first pellet gun . I 've never dropped it or abused it in any way ; it stays in a drawer when not in use.Having such issues with such little use , tells me these are cheaply made . I wo n't be buying another Crosman .
 Ive owned alot of guns and have worked on them for years , and i bought this to convert to airsoft . But , it 'll take alot more work due to crosmans screw ups . First let me state i had no problems with the seller and im not some idiot that doesnt no what hes talking about . The only reason i am keeping this gun is because im taking it apart anyway . First , the frame . The revolver frame had places where the paint was off . I could let that go but it gets worse . The 2 halves of the frame were both twisted and bent to some extent . if you look straight down the back of the gun it becomes sadly noticable . As a result there were some gaps where the 2 frames mated , large enough you could drop a bb through . It looks like crap . And im sure that the bent frame is doing wonders on the internal parts . By the way , the 2 bent frame halves were put together with allitle to much force -LRB- thats what happens when the parts do n't fit because they 're bent -RRB- and as a result there is a tear in the cheap pot metal or zinc frame half . Its so crappy i can bend it with my hand . And finally the grips dont lock in place just right . Either crosmans quality control department employees were ridiculously drunk , or they just dont care . if your looking for a gun that functions and will last alittle while , go for it . But if your looking for a gun thats quality , turn around and run . its sad to think that companies take all these shortcuts.For Crosman :1 . get quality control , i mean seriously2 . if your going to use metal to fool people into thinking its strong , dont use pot metal , or at least use plastic , that stuff is stronger ! 3 . maybe use a paint thats not something short of a sharpie marker , or use a better material so the paint sticks .
 Just so you know , I am not down on Crosman , I am not.I have an older C11 that still works just fine ; except for the lousy accuracy.I also have two mid 1970 's era steel breach cover/pin pull 1377 's that I cant say enough about ; they shoot both BB 's and .177 pellets with unbelievable accuracy -LRB- You just have to pump -RRB- . After little use -LRB- about 20 times within the first 6 months -RRB- and following all of the instructions including the use of Pellgunoil , this piece of junk has decided not to work anymore.All it does is make a popping noise when a new CO2 cylinder has been installed and looks like it is not being properly pierced.I made a call to Crosman since the pistol was still under warranty , and you should get a kick out of the conversation : I told them what I have already said and decided to get a couple of parts instead of doing the shipping thing as you get to pay for the shipping , so by the time you do this , you have just paid out more than you did for the gun.So , just send me the pin and the seal , what will that cost ? The gal says nothing since it is under warranty , but that this will end the warranty since I am repairing the gun myself . So I figure , OK , send me a couple more parts in that area just in case . Believe it or not , she says `` I would have to charge you for more parts , as I have already put through your order on the pin and seal '' . The pin has a new part number -LRB- I wonder why -RRB- , it is
 Did not work . Called customer service -LRB- crosman -RRB- 15 minutes after delivery , they said product from Amazon was probably old and defective . They said to throw the gun into the trash and they would send a new one ; that was Oct. 3 still waiting !
 when i revived the gun , not 20 minutes later the hammer was broken by my friend dropping out of his hand on to the floor , a three foot drop onto tile . still wanting to return
 Do not buy this gun . Waste of money . The screw that you in with the co2 cartrige in with broke off . Dont buy it just because it looks cool .
 I 've owned a number of air guns and enjoy shooting them immensely , I 'd always wanted a revolver style one but this one 's price pretty much sums up what it 's worth unfortunately.Operating it is difficult , including reloading , getting the C02 in properly is quite a chore and I ended up with more than a few bleeding cuts on my hand , not user friendly at all.The construction is unfortunately cheap as well , the trigger is sharp plastic and many of the other parts provide a very unrealistic weight to the gun which just is n't fun . After it punctured two C02 canisters that I had , I decided it was n't worth keeping , I could n't get it to operate properly .
 This dumbbell is available at Dicks for more money but is of much better quality . I would not reccommend ! Do not trust the collars , unsafe
 Dumbbell handle is ok , but I thought I was receiving two handles and not just one . I suggest you buy from somewhere else.Update - I also see they label it one dumbbell now and not leave you guessing .
 These pellets have visible seams on them and are quite inconsistent . They do n't shoot well at all in my crosman phantom -LRB- 2-4 inch groups at 20 yds -RRB- . The skirts are n't very good quality and show visible deformations . They do shoot better groups with a 600 fps gun but if you want an inexpensive pellet the destroyers are the ones to get . Iv ' e managed sub 1 inch groups with the destroyers in my crosman pumpmaster .
 When I used all my original Gamo Magnum pellets and needed more I went local and bought these because they were available . Simply put , these things just do n't perform the same as the Gamo pellets . With the Gamo , it was one shot , one kill . With the Crosman , two and even three shots to do the job . It 's wasteful and inhumane . Used both brands on woodchucks , rabbits , and squirrels . I use a Gamo Shadow 1000 if it makes any difference , but my recommendation is to take pass on the Crosman . It 's time to order again and it 's going to be Gamo .
 i was suprised when i got these pellets . i expected the high quality lead pellets i always receive from crosman , but this time i opened up the brand new tin spaghetti fell out all over my jeans and shirt , i was in shock . definitely never ordering again .
 I bought this with the intention of using it to monitor my heart rate while training for a 1/2 marathon . I used it during one workout and was only able to get a reading once during my 75 minute run . To get a reading , you have to stop and stay still for 5-10 seconds while holding down a button . By the time you get a reading , you are cooling down!I promptly returned this and will be getting a REAL HR monitor with a chest strap that continuously monitors my HR . Probably a Polar brand.Best wishes .
 The package comes with a rubber instrument you are to lick -LRB- yes , lick . They do not recommend using water to moisten -RRB- and strap to your chest in order for the equipment to work . If you are allergic to latex and rubber products , there is a very high risk of skin irritation to the area.I have been unable to use this product because I happen to have a latex allergy and do not wish to risk an outbreak .
 Over the past two years we 've had FIVE of these watches . The functionality is great , and they worked fine at first . All but one of the five have failed after two weeks to three months of use . Sometimes they go blank , sometimes they just freeze and do n't respond to the buttons . You ca n't rely on this product so I do n't recommend it .
 I purchase the watch and pressed the light button . The display went blank and never came on again . I returned it for another watch and the same thing happened . I went to another store and purchased the watch thinking perhaps the stock was old at the other store . I opened the package and the watch display was fine , until I pressed the light button . The watch display never came on again . I wrote the manufacturer and was told to send the watch to them . After a month , they sent me a new watch . The display was visible for 2 hours , and I made the mistake of pressing the light button to see how it would illuminate in the dark . Well the display went blank and never came on again . I will return this fourth watch to the store for a full refund . What a piece of garbage !!
 When first opened , this watch was already dead . I returned it for a replacement , and the first time the replacement watch was used , its battery died as well . Unless you want to buy a new battery as soon as you get this , do n't waste your money . I suspect these have been ` on the shelf ' for so long the batteries are drained by now . Try a more current model if you can find one . I am convinced this is old inventory .
 This watch works great if you 're standing still , or walking at 4.0 mph . Anything above that good luck trying to get a reading on your heart rate . So what 's the point ? I use this watch when I do my interval workout on my treadmill . I start out walking 4.0 or 4.5 mph , sprint for a minute at 8.5 mph , walk 4.5 - 4.7 mph at a 10 incline for a minute , you get the idea . What I wanted this watch for was to make sure I 'm working within my target heart rate at each interval . Unfortunately , when I 'm trying to get a reading immediately after each high-intense interval , the watch wo n't give me a reading . The instructions say to rest your arm on a surface or make sure your arm is `` quiet '' so the watch can get a reading or -LRB- my favorite -RRB- wait a couple of minutes and try again . Right . This means , then , that when I want to see what my heart rate after a 8.5 mph sprint , I ca n't unless I 'm walking at 4 mph and by this time , and by the time I actually get a reading , my heart rate has already come down . I use this watch to get my `` every now and then '' reading and to use the countdown timer on some of my intervals . Otherwise , I would n't use it at all .
 I bought this less than a month ago . Wore it a few times around the office at first to see how it worked . It worked well . Got very sick -LRB- & lazy ! -RRB- & missed my workouts for a week or so . First time I tried to use the monitor within the last week while on my elliptical , it just died on me . I do n't know if it came with bad batteries , or if something else is wrong with it . I was so disgusted I just tossed it aside and have n't had time to look at it again . I 'm not sure I can recommend this one - but perhaps I just got a lemon .
 I was very disappointed in this product . I was trying it out before going for a walk . The very first time I pressed the button to take a reading , all the displays died . I took it by the battery shop , thinking that a new battery might revive it . The shop could n't get the back off to remove the old battery . I ended up returning the watch .
 Ordered this item for my wife for Christmas . When she opened the gift it was totally dead . I submitted for a replacement with Amazon and it arrived dead as well . Needless to say we question how robust these watches really . We 've never seen one work .
 Battery or circuit bad . Replacement of battery did n't help . Not worth the effort to return .
 I bought this watch for my wife for Christmas . Out of the box , it did not work . Amazon sent a replacement -LRB- quickly -RRB- - it TOO did not work . Finally , my wife called the company who then sent an upgraded replacement that worked . Evidentally they 've had problems wth this unit . Do n't waste your time or money .
 I received this heart rate watch for Christmas . I opened the package , pressed `` mode '' and the whole thing just died . The screen went completely blank . What a piece of junk .
 When we opened the package to do the initial set-up the display remained blank , could not set any function . Turned over to see if there was a restrictor to be removed from the batttery and instead found one screw missing from the back . Opened to find the battery intact but still would not display . Upon reassemble a faint humming was heard that continued but yet still no display . Returned for full refund
 When this watch arrived it did n't work . I had to spend $ 20.00 to put in a new battery . Inside the watch was a date sticker indicating that that battery was over two years old . Apparently , whoever sent the watch to me was trying to clear out old stock . And , ... . not all of the functions work correctly .
 It actually worked better OFF my wrist than on . I had to press it several times to get a reading - it rarely worked . I ended up returning it .
 Unlike every other item in a corner flag search these guys charge you $ 45 for a single flag.Please do n't make the mistake I did by assuming -LRB- like everybody else -RRB- that it would come as a set of 4 . Honestly how these people can value a set of 4 at over $ 160 bucks is beyond me !
 This product is not what is appears to be . The quality is poor and will be ruined as soon as you use it in the rain . It does not have the mounting piece as demonstrated by the image . Do n't buy this .
 I was very disappointed with this purchase . I ordered two masks . One item can not even be used as it was missing the plastic piece on the side to hold the strap in place . The other has some substance on the inside of the mask that is smeared and will not wash off . The items are both unusable .
 I thought I 'd try this this year . Well , it did n't make any difference . I paid $ 11 for one can . I think just as many bucks would have been drawn in if I 'd put a $ 10 and $ 1 bill on a branch . Then at least I could say I saw 11 bucks.I do n't recommend buying this .
 the nosel sticks and makes all the product expel at once which is a waste of money and time for any hunter
 I bought this as a gift for my brother 's birthday . It was delivered a day before I expected it but it looked like someone got curious at UPS . The packaging tape looked like someone had torn or cut it , and all I had to do was reach in and grab the weapon . Also there is an empty spot in the packaging that looks like there should be something there ... And then ignoring that we opened it up to try it out and even following the directions exactly it does n't work . The pumping does n't build up resistance so even after pumping it 10 times the BB just kinda rolls out of the barrel . I 've been ordering off of Amazon for many years and this is the second time in 2 months I 've had to return something due to it not working . Probably going to buy a replacement in-store .
 The Crosman 760 with Starter kit , is weak and feels cheap.The BB/Pellet loading bolt is lose fitting.The accuracy is lacking.The laser sight is a plastic toy.This is not the Crosman I grew up shooting ... Save your money and buy a different BB/Pellet gun .
 I bought this bike rack because I was looking for something to use on my 2004 Honda CR-V . The photograph shows this rack mounted on a CR-V , so I thought I was in luck . It turns out , however , the design of the CR-V tailgate varies a lot from year to year and this rack would not mount on the spare tire of the 2004 version without destroying the rear wiper . Thus I returned it .
 I purchased the Spare Joe-2 for my 2009 RAV-4 back in July and I have to agree with a few of the comments made in reference to the center strap that goes behind the tire . This rack has two straps , one that goes around the tire you have to take the tire cover off -RRB- and one that goes behind the tire . I have had the rack on several times and I have not been able to get the strap to feed down through the back of the tire to secure it to the latch at the bottom of the frame . After spending a considerable amount of time trying to work this strap trough the back of the tire , I gave up.I really like the concept of this particular bike rack so I decided to take a 48 '' heavy duty bungee cord and hook it to one side of the top -LRB- back portion -RRB- of the rack and stretch it around the bottom of the tire -LRB- ensuring to push it all the way to the back of the tire -RRB- and latching it to the other side of the top rack -LRB- back portion -RRB- , this takes a little elbow grease . I also use a few smaller bungee cords and feed those through the spokes on the tire rim to latch on to the front side of the rack frame for extra security.I feel very comfortable carrying two bikes with this rack and even if I would have been able to feed the center strap all the way through , I would have still used the bungee cords because I would not have felt comfortable with just the two straps they provided.I only give this a 2 star because the concept is good but if you ca n't get the center back strap secured , you will not be able to use this device or the weight of the bike/s will cause the rack to come off of the tire .
 I bought this rack for my 2002 Rav4 and was severely disappointed . It was difficult to install , with a fussy little piece of nylon that has to thread through the spare tire and it is difficult to set the rack at the proper angle . Once we had the strap winched down so that we were satisfied that it was tight enough not to sway or vibrate on the road , it looked like it was rubbing in a way that would damage the paint on the rear door of the car -LRB- just below the window -RRB- . Even though we wrapped the rack in handlebar tape at its contact points with the car , it still damaged my car after a couple of weeks . We took the rack off and threw it away , because I could not in good conscience even give it away . The instructions were very poorly written , even compared to other Yakima bike racks.I used to work at a bike shop and so have installed dozens of bike racks on cars . Having tried it myself , I would NEVER sell this rack to one of our customers . I would recommend spending a little more money for one of the bolt-on models by Yakima or Thule .
 I returned this item to Amazon . The Velcro straps that come with the bike rack are too short to wrap around the frame of my mountain bike . Would have worked perfectly if the Velcro straps were just 2 inches longer - not sure why they would chose a short strap knowing there are all kinds of bikes and bike frames . Probably works fine for road bikes . Disappointed .
 This product did not fit my spare tire as advertised.It should have expressly stated '' will only fit 15 inch tires '' . This was just a waste of my time . By the way I drive a Rav 4 .
 A Disappointing purchase that I had to return . Although online readers ' commentaries claimed otherwise , this bike rack does NOT fit a Honda CRV 2003 . The rack rests too high against the rear window ; too high and too close to be able to get the straps behind the spare tire .
 I am not a novice fisher woman . I purchased this line for Muskie fishing . This line was the worst line I have used . I had more wind tangles than any other line . I tie a uni-knot with all lures so have not lost lures , but the tangles were frequent . This was NOT user error . I know how to spool a reel and use proper tension.I also tried the 20lb mono and had the same results . Solution ? I switched to 15lb power pro -LRB- braided -RRB- and really like the line . The spiderwire line gets an F - try power pro instead . Better results even when using plastics with no weight !
 i have been using it for about 6 months it wind knot easily , looses it color on your hand green stuff , it fray out and burst easily an i had to change my line
 The product is great ! The problem is the it takes 3-5 weeks to get the item when it lists as `` IN STOCK ''
 I have always loved this pullover and used to buy this item every few years because I would literally wear them out . Now I understand why Kohls has discontinued selling this item though , because Columbia keeps making this item cheaper and cheaper . I recently bought two to replace the ones I had . They now cost more and the material is pretty much see-through -LRB- just hold it up to the light -RRB- . I have previous versions of this item and you can definitely see how much cheaper they 're being made . The thin fabric makes the collar look terrible and the item just sort of hangs on you . As well , a few washes pretty much destroy these `` new '' versions . Columbia please make these the way you used to even if they cost a few bucks more - your reputation is at stake !!
 I have ordered countless things online and have never been compelled to write a review before . I was completely ecstatic to `` Bears '' down my sons room . Let 's keep in mind that he is 19 months old , so he takes up very little space in his twin size bed nor does he actually ever use this comforter for his blanket . We have had the set for a whopping 6 weeks and already the Bear silkscreen is cracked and peeling off . Since we do n't use it for his blanket we have n't even put it through the washer , I ca n't imagine it being able to endure that since it has n't endured six weeks of being basically a decorative throw . Disappointed does n't even begin to describe how I feel .
 I ordered this snowboard for my son for Christmas . On Christmas Eve I opened the box to wrap it and discovered a different snowboard - like this but red with stripes -LSB- -LSB- ASIN : B006C6VC9E Acrobat Fx 95 Freestyle Snowboard -RSB- -LRB- different brand , different bindings , different color , different pattern -RRB- was shipped to us . I did n't have time to return it . When I visited Amazon.com , I saw that the one I ordered -LRB- this one -RRB- was out of stock and there was no estimate on when it would be in stock . My son was very disappointed because the snowboard that was shipped to us was the one he said he DID N'T want when we were looking at them online . We were going snowboarding the day after Christmas so we went ahead and used the one that was shipped to us and he had a good time , but he still wants this one . All in all , we did n't have a great experience due to the wrong snowboard being shipped . I have always shopped with Amazon and this is the first time we have had an issue like this .
 I purchased this rifle and the mechanism that holds the BBs in place to be loaded into the chamber jammed . I swapped it out for the same model . After about 25 shots the pump would no longer pump . I never pumped it over 8 pumps and most of the shots only did 3 pumps . The manual suggests less than 10 . I tried oiling it with a few drops of oil , but it still would n't hold air . The bolt is n't smooth and feels like it 's about to break off when you pull it back to cock it . The scope is flimsy and slides out of it 's mounted position . The accuracy grouping is poor . I stabilized the rifle with sandbags and used the scope to aim . Even at 25 feet it had 3-4 inches of drift in the grouping . In summary , two out of two of this rifle has been of very poor quality . One jammed after the first shot and the other failed after about 25 shots . I finally just ended up purchasing some shotshells for my .22 rifle and returned the Airmaster 77 .
 Brand new out of the box , it wo n't pump up so I ca n't vouch for accuracy or power . The pumping arm has no resistance at all and it looks like the slide is n't actually attached to anything . I guess that explains why so many websites are selling a refurbished version of this pellet gun . The trigger has a somewhat long and stiff pull , which I imagine would loosen up after some use . Overall it feels solid despite the heavy use of plastic . The stock sights seem reasonable but the included scope is worse than the $ 11 Walmart special . If I were going to keep this I would probably upgrade the scope . Otherwise this looks like a decent starter gun .
 I should have believed other reviewers . . this product is low quality ... brand new out of sealed box and would not pump up and develop pressure to shoot . Tried many times thinking it needed a little working , but never more than a slight puff . Also found the bolt action very very stiff ... no way a child could use .
 I wanted an accurate pump gun rifle with scope in .177 . I have a raccoon sitting up in a tree who torments my dogs at night ; it needs a couple of low powered stings to get the hint and relocate , plus I want accuracy and power when needed . The gun arrived on time , intact . Looks decent for the price . But the bolt handle on it is flexible -LRB- ! -RRB- plastic crap that is not structurally sound -- it flexes and bends backwards before the bolt is all the way back ! This causes my finger to slip off unless I hold it in a particular way , basically not using the bolt handle at all but rather the little metal piece to which it is mounted . After maybe 5 test runs , with my forefinger already getting sore , I knew this piece of junk bolt handle would give me perpetual grief . Also , the scope is cheap chinese junk . Blurry , cheaply made , crap mounts , worthless . For the price I might have kept the gun anyway and tossed the scope , but for the crap bolt . I mean really , what did they save by using flexible plastic instead of metal , 30 cents ? And what idiot engineer used flexible nylon or whatever it is instead of polycarbonate or PEEK ? I 'm returning it . Lesson learned , I 'm upgrading .
 I bought this gun for my husband some time ago for Christmas , unfortunately my husband was hospitalized and he has finally had an opportunity to open all of his presents . He tries to fire the gun only to find out it will not hold the air , there is no pressure at all . Can I still return the gun ? It has never been fired .
 I purchased this for a pest problem and the stock broke after 1 WEEK ! no mistreatment unless you consider pumping it 10 times mistreatment ... you can kill a squirrel at range .
 I purchased this BB gun in September for a Christmas present for my 9 year old son . I left it in the original box until Christmas morning . Once my son opened the box he was so excited . We took the gun outside to shoot it . To my surprise and his disappointment , the gun would n't shoot . The pump lever would not build up any pressure for the BB 's to shoot . I called Amazon and requested a replacement and stated I did n't want a refund . I was emailed a shipping label so I sent the gun back via UPS . I received an email 3 days later stating I would receive a refund minus a restocking fee -LRB- $ 16 -RRB- . I tried calling Amazon to discuss this , but that a was a hopeless cause and could never actually speak to a live person . I took the refund and put more money with it and purchased a gun locally . In the end , my son was happy but had to wait over a week to get a Christmas present . I would highly recommend not making purchases too early due to the refund policy and restocking fees . The money I saved by ordering early , I lost and then some in the restocking fees .
 I guess it is completely possible that I could have just gotten a bad one , but this gun was bad enough for me that I 'm not taking a chance and trying my luck with a second one . Gun returned .
 Once I got the sights adjusted , accuracy and repeatibility of aim seem better than my ability to hold the rifle steady . Construction seems solid . However , plastic gun stock is much too light affecting the overall feel and balance . Noise of discharge is much less than what I expected given the other reviews . Scope is made of relatively cheap materials but it seems to do the job . As mentioned in other reviews , getting the pellets in right can be a bit tricky . If it does n't go in the right way , just dump it out and try again . For the price , I 've no complaints.Update - Two weeks after using this product , it jammed on a pellet and there did n't seem to be any way of freeing it . Wound up throwing the gun away rather than incur all the time and expense it would have entailed to fix it .
 Remington should be ashamed for marketing this junk . I bought one and right out of the box it would n't pump up ; the plunger had disconnected itself from the ram . I took it back got another , it work fine for about 25 shots and the same problem occurred . The only reason I gave it 1 star is so that this email site did n't think I forgot to rate it , and there is a possibility to sell this thing for parts if I find another misfortunate who was duped by the Remington name on it . Very disappointed and I refuse to buy anything labeled REMINGTON in the future because we all know how the `` screw me once , shame on you ... '' saying goes . Now figuring Remington 's questionable reputation , I realize this thing was probably crapped out of China so Remington could make tons of money screwing the Americans ; very disgusting business practice .
 Son opened this Christmas gift only to find that it would not fire . It appears to have been assembled without the pumping mechanism . Unfortunately , the item was purchased just prior to the holiday return policy date of Nov. 1st . Amazon says I am on my own with the manufacturer . I am quite disappointed in both Remington and Amazon .
 Seemed like a great deal , great price , and a good brand reputation , but when my son opened it on Christmas , the gun had been assembled minus some rather critical parts -LRB- the pump tube was visibly empty -- just a rod and nothing else -RRB- . Either they shipped me a non-functional display model or Remington/Crosman has some poor QA . Sent it back for a refund and now have to look for another present . Tends to kill the mood . At least Amazon is good on returns -LRB- and thank you to customer service -RRB- .
 Purchased for a B-day gift . When I received it packaging was in great condition . The 3-Ring binder cover was split at the seams and it had a layer of dust on it like it was pulled out of an attic . Clearly this should have been noticed before shipping out . Now I have to go find another with limited time . In my opinion , this should have been caught and prevented .
 Whenever I have bought a book of this kind it ALWAYS included the pages but this one does not have any pages , it is only a binder with a picture of a football on the cover . What a total rip-off for ten bucks !! I was very surprised that not one person who reviewed this item included this information and that the seller did not include this info either . All the description says is , `` You can add as many pages as you want '' - yea add them , or fill the book with them is a better description !
 the set-up instructions are incomplete , and worse , the `` trouble shooting '' section does n't help at all . after 5 minutes of use it started squeeking loudly and no amount of adjustment seems to help . stay away from this one
 This towable is terrible ! Everyone of our 8 friends who has tried this so far has bloody , burned elbows from the rubbing on the scratchy , rough canvas it is made out of . Some only rode for about 5 minutes and this happened ! The kids who stayed on much longer had bloody knees and elbows . Unless you enjoy having rug burns on your elbows and knees , I 'd stay way from this thing . It also is not big enough for 3 people unless they 're all under 5 feet and 100 pounds . And it drags down under the water when you first take off unless all riders hang as far off the back as possible . Worst towable we 've ever had in many years of boating and about 5 towables to compare it to .

 My very responsible 10 year old only used his controller 5 times , for about 1 hour each time , and the analog stick broke . You would be better off buying a plain factory made controller and adding stickers to it . This controller is made very cheap . Buyers beware !!!!
 This product arrived in a broken container with the contents totally spilled all over the box . I immediately called Amazon and the rep had me order from a different merchant . I love the product . I use it for my nails . They are not stronger but they have lost the ridges that one gets with age . They look way better !!!!
 I used these grip screws to replace the stock slotted screws on my American Classic Officer model , and I must say I am very disappointed . The screws did not thread easily into the bushings , the old screws came out and went in freely , but these seemed to be ` off ' somehow , almost like I needed a die to clean up the threads . When I got the screws installed , I then discovered another issue , where the magazine was hanging up , and not inserting or extracting freely . I found that the grip screws were longer that what I had replaced , and were grabbing the magazine . An issue I was able to resolve by filing down the screws . I just expected better from Hogue !
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 They did not puncture or pierce correctly inside my rifle , and leaked inside the rifle 's frame . Then , I tried the second one . The second one did not seat at all , and had a slow leak which I was able to get off two rounds before it died . Go with Crosman !
 We bought this trampoline from a local dealer . We thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread , however , the enclosure began ripping within the first year . No one has ever hung from the top of the enclousre as the manufacturer warns not to , nor have we ever exceeded the weight limit on the trampoline . We planned to replace the enclosure only to learn that there is no way to do so without getting an entire new unit because the enclosure is sewn into the mat . Magic Circle boasts a 10 year warranty on the frame with a 1 year warranty plus 4 year prorated warranty on the mat and springs . What they fail to mention is the enclosure is not covered and even if it were , you have to ship the unit prepaid to them for inspection before they will even make a decision on warranty coverage . Bottom line , we got only one year out of this product before it became a safety hazard .
 Our latest Coleman stove was only 2 years old when the regulator would n't allow the canisters to attach to it anymore . Apparently from other reviews , the part that goes into the canisters gets bent after a while and has to be replaced . Our old stoves lasted about 25-30 years apiece with no problems until they finally developed leaks in the tubing . The new regulators are a problem for everyone , but apparently other brands of camping stoves are no better unless you want to spend about $ 500 and have a heavy , bulky stove . So , we purchased two more regulators so we will have a spare when the first one fails and not have to cut short another camping trip due to a bad part . Cheap , cheap , cheap . China , China , China .
 I needed this replacement because the original propane stove pipe 's threads wore out . Coleman recommends , and I agree , that the canister should be removed when not in use , thus increasing the number of times that the threads get used . However , it seems that the pipe 's threads are not as hard as the steel propane bottle 's threads and thus the wear factor is high with continued use . I will continue to use caution and care on threading a propane cylinder into the pipe 's fitting , and , of course , making sure that I do not cross-thread the unit . Perhaps Coleman could up the quality and hardness of its pipe 's fitting to lessen the wear factor .
 I do n't know where the mix up lies but I have trouble with Coleman selling 2 types of regulators that look almost identical and not specifying which one applies to which grill model . . Not the sellers fault , they were good .
 I do n't know if it 's my fault . I assumed that it 's a universal fit , but it did n't fit my stove . Just saying make sure that you check out what stove is good with it first .
 Plane and simple ... the regulator connection to the grill dont fit ... -LRB- regu . connection is too small . This regulator is none adjustable.I entered the make and model of my table top coleman grill , amazon came up with this regulator . Its totally the wrong one . . Really ... how does that happen , how do i return it for the correct regulator ??? Colin hungry in Wisconsin ...
 This product is everything it claims to be -- except waterproof . I purchased one to use at our local waterpark , just to keep few bills , an ID and maybe a credit card on me . They fit perfectly . I was in the water for maybe 10 minutes and when I pulled it out of my pocket , it was half-full of water.Giving the product the benefit of the doubt , I tested it in a controlled environment , thinking maybe I had n't closed the seal properly the first time . I submerged it in a few inches of still water , for 30 seconds , with a single credit card in it . It filled with water . Even when empty , the seal leaks like a sieve.You 're better off with a Ziploc baggie .
 This wallet was not even slightly waterproof . I took it on a cruise and the second it went in the water it filled with water . Basically it was worthless .
 The Raging Magnum pistol will not utilize this mount . This mount is for Raging Bull 8 &#34; Barrel . I had to get it milled to mount on my gun
 The outlet plug has a small sprong in the back of the outlet to hold the electrical cord in place so it wo n't pull out.When you plug the extension cord in the outlet it breaks the sprong in the back of the outlet an can not get contact , I have to hold the back of the plug to plug in the extension cord.Now I have a one and seven eights hole in my console.I called minn kota and thet sent me another outlet and it did the same thing .
 Buyer Beware ! This product is poorly designed and incapable of withstanding `` actual '' use . Upon removing from packaging , I accidently dropped it from about three feet to the concrete , garage floor . It broke in half ! I camplained `` directly '' to the manufacturer , who actually sent me a replacement . Nevertheless , I used Quick Steel to reinforce the new one , as to assure it would n't break upon plugging into it . The Manufacturer should be ashamed of themelves for selling such a poorly designed product ...
 I had ordered a size large hat and it is obviously a childs size hat . You can get these same hats at target for 10 - 15 dollars . If you want a hat that actualy fits an average adult I would go elsewhere .
 I ordered this hat for my husband . It said one size . It did not say child size or adult size . It is too small for my husband , & too big for my 2 1/2 year grand son . I should have sent it back , but I did not .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 The picture showed a nice looking Utah helmet , but I received a faded , old looking helmet . While I do not fault the seller necessarily , Amazon has done this to me in the past . Not sure I can trust them on all items . It would be nice to have a picture of the actual item I am buying .

 Beware ! In the description above , it states shoe size 6-9 , but in the manufacturer 's description it states size 8-13 . Thus , the socks which I thought were my size ended up being MUCH larger .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account .

 This device is too loud and causes incredible vibrations throughout the house . The resistance seems fine but there is no watching t.v while this is in use . I wear ear plugs during use .
 This product displays as purple the KSU colors yet delivered was blue . I had topay return shipping for their error !

 The hat was closer to a size 8 than the 7 3/8 size that I ordered . It absolutely did not fit my head and it was obvious that the original New Era tag had be cut off and replaced with a tag from this supplier . You cheated me and I should ask for my money back but I 'd rather make people aware of this so they do n't buy anything from you and get cheated like me . Your package was also 2 days late , yet the company delivering the package stated that it had got to my place on time , which it definitely did not . This was about my 6th or 7th time ordering a New Era Cap from Amazon.com and you were by far the worst . Get your act together or you 'll get caught by the wrong person because your defiling a product that is not yours , which you know is illegal . Good riddens .
 I 'm sure this is a fake . This there is n't a New Era logo stitched on the hat ... And the quality is poorly stitched in comparison to my other New Era hats ... the hat has no form and the bill is shorter than normal ... pretty disappointed that Amazon would have this on their shelf .
 i told amazon.com that i will never order from them again because i think it 's incredibly cheap of them to only use USPS when super saver shipping has been qualified for . especially considering the amount of money i have spent with them over the years . i hope you do the same
 nice looking chair but it broke after using it one time . it 's a chair which has one function but apparently the manufacturer has n't really figured out how to construct products that actually work .
 First of all - just to correct another 's review - The UNIT DOES have an on/off switch . It 's on the side of the unit , not in the cord . Now - To the REAL problems-I had two small tumblers from other manufacturers , but I have a lot of .45 Colt brass which I must reload on a regular basis and the smaller tumblers and separate media separating step were taking too long . I bought this item to increase my brass tumbling capacity and eliminate the need to use a media separator , thus facilitating and speeding the task . The ad says that the Promag can tumble 1000 rnds of .38 , so I figured that it should handle at least 400-425 pieces of .45 , as my smaller tumblers can handle almost about 190 each.Well , I was sorely disappointed . The most I was able to place in the unit , and still get tumbling action , was 270 pieces . Additionally , just to do this , I had to add a little more media . Otherwise , at 250 pieces , the tumbling action would cease , and all that would happen was the whole load SLOWLY -LRB- and noisily ! -RRB- going round and round in a horizontal plane only . No tumbling action ! The motor just did n't have enough power to do more , and even at that , the overall tumbling action was MUCH slower than that of the 190 rounds tumbling in each of my smaller units , so the unit had to run almost a third to a half longer in order to condition each load of the brass to the same degree as the smaller capacity units . See ? Holds only about 1/3 more brass per load , but takes a 1/3 - 1/2 more time per load ... Saving me what exactly?My final hope lay in the media separator feature . So I pulled the plug out of the bottom of the unit and placed the pan there to catch the media ... Well , it drains , sort of , if it is kept running , and then , as it empties , even with the 270 pieces of .45 on board , it starts to walk , so one has to chase it around with the catch pan or the media will go everywhere . I placed some heavy items at the base to hold it steady , but was then dismayed to find out that the pan provided with the unit is too small to hold all of the media that the unit holds ; that 's even if I HAD N'T had to add extra -LRB- Which genius made THAT decision ? -RRB- . Of course , as all of this is going on , the noise level , of 270 pieces of .45 , becomes deafening . OK . I 'm prepared . I 've got ear muffs . I can handle it . Carry on . Now , after a while , let 's stop the unit and check inside ... Hmmm . Seems the brass ceases to tumble at a certain point , They just stand straight up next to each other and go ` round and ` round in a circle , so there are a bunch of cases in there sitting upright and FULL Of MEDIA . I had to reach in , and tumble them by hand to get them to empty partially . This is NOT what I signed on for!Bottom line - I had to get a bigger drain pan , the polishing process of the brass took just as long as with my smaller units , AND I STILL had to detach the larger , and more difficult to handle , tumbler bin and dump its contents into my media/case separator for each load anyway , just like with my smaller -LRB- And MUCH less expensive -RRB- units.So , basically , this item was just a huge waste of time and money . I wish that I 'd spent more , and gotten the large Dillon unit instead . Oh well . Tuition paid . Lesson learned . Hope this saves you .
 I did not like the way the media came out , it was better to just pick it up and dump it into bucket .

 This item does not fit the large Taylor made fenders . It was a few inches short . I had to return them .

 The item in the picture it not what I got.I had the same problem ordering other items from the Amazon.com site.One other problem is there is no part number listed in the packing slip -LRB- or online -RRB- to check it against .
 I bought the Red White and Blue Permanent Basketball net -LRB- 2 -RRB- for our elementary school . The janitor had an extremely difficult time installing them as they are very stiff with a stiff coated wire running through the Hoop and the net . Once installed , the net was very stiff and the kids would get the basketballs stuck in the net . I chose this net as our school is constantly getting our nets stolen or destroyed . But , I think the strength of this net mught be better suited for high school age and up .

 Years ago , I bought an adidas shirt , which I still own . I doubt that this new one will match the old one for wear resistance - after two washings , it already looks ready for replacement , and the color has faded somewhat .
 It is nice but the sizes are very wrong , I bought M and this is at least large and maybe XL . You should buy an smaller size . Unfortunately I removed the prize before noticing so I will give it someone bigger .
 Good model.Looks good.You have to buy two sizes too small.For example.Your L = S.But it is synthetic.Do not they feel.On the body pricked.There 's no cotton.In the heat can not be worn.this is not ClimaLite.I 'm sorry but it 's true.Real ClimaLite soft and gentle to the body - this shirt is not the same.Asked to write a review.I have written .
 I 'm usually between a small and medium , admittedly a slight frame - about 5 ' 11 '' 160 . I ordered the small in this shirt -LRB- two of them -RRB- and they are at least 2 sizes too large ; I 'm absolutely swimming in it . I 'm not sure who they thought they were sizing these for , but this is huge , even by standard fat-american sizing standards . I 'm returning both for something , likely by Nike , who has proper sizing on their apparel .
 I bough a white L size polo and looks like a XXL size polo !!!! now i have a really great gift to my fat uncle : -LRB-

 I ordered X Large . I expected the shirt to be very loose . This was n't a standard extra large . It 's more like a medium . I did not intend to purchase a form-fitting top . If the sizing on the shirts was accurate I would not have purchased the shirt in this size . Also , the color is a bit lighter than the picture .
 I ordered two of these with high hopes , to be utterly disappointed.First the design of the battery holders is bad . They are supposed to hold two C cell batteries . When I tried to get one in , I initially concluded that a different size must be requried , as it seemed the C size would n't fit . After much futzing around , I managed to get two C cells in without hopelessly bending the flimsy contact springs . This one now works but I doubt that I could successfully remove and replace the batteries again . The battery holder is too flimsy . On the second unit the contact wire which connects the two far ends of the batteries had fallen out of its plastic holder . After 15 minutes of trying to put it back I gave up . This unit is totally unusable . Nothing on the Pyramid package label indicates that two batteries , C cell size , are needed but not included.Second this is a fender mount light , meaning if you want to mount it to your handlebar there 's no way to do that with the hardware included . While the Pyramid box does say `` Fender Mount , '' that description was not included in the online product description . And , this light with batteries installed is fairly heavy . The lightweight plastic fender on my front bike tire would not come close to supporting this light , and I doubt that many bike fenders these days would . Why would anyone sell this as a bike headlight without including a handlebar mount ?? I 'm totally disgusted with this flimsy product , and with the vendor who sold it to me .
 Never gave size of item . Said it was for children from 3 to 8 . All the other tents and tunnels advertised you could get into . This one was for a doll and never mentioned . Gave the size of the box it was shipped in but not the size of the tent .
 this product was really dissapointing because i brought this tent for my daughter and the tent did not have the size on it . I purchase it to fit her not a doll . So i had to send it back . Please make that correction online with this product .
 This tent said for ages 3-8 . My daughter wanted this for her room , she was very upset when we opened the package it was a tent for dolls/barbies not children . It doesnot say anything about this being a toy for a doll .
 I ordered this for my grand-daughter and was dissapointed when it arrived and I saw that it was for a doll . The description made no mention of this . I purchased this for her to play IN . It listed the recommended ages and not the size of the tent . In addition to the dissapointment of seeing a doll tent , I had to pay shipping when I purhchaed the item and when I returned the item .
 I bought this toy thinking of my 2 kids , not in her doll . Never gave size of the tent , and when i received it a was surprise it is a tent for a little doll . Be aware of this when you buy this toy for your children . Amazon said it was for children from 3 to 8 . This one was for a doll and never mentioned . Gave the size of the box it was shipped in but not the size of the tent .

 Who wrote a manual for this thing . It 's impossible to comprehend . At the end you 'll figure out how to use this timing device on your own . But manual should have been written by more intelligent people .
 Nice looks , but the ringing of the bell is a hit or miss proposition.Hard for my youngster to push the lever when it is working .
 Expected multi color or at least colorful it was black and plastic . First time using your services , will probably be my last as well
 I 've used this ball for a few years now both in pick up short sided games and competitive 11 aside games . It has a good overall feel and comes off the foot very well . I play with a group of guys twice a week and we 've been using these balls since the first time we played with them . On the 11 v 11 team this ball is almost always chosen as the game ball . Sure there are better balls out there , like the Adidas World Cup/Euro ball but they cost much more . This is a great ball for pickup or amateur league games especially for around $ 40 . Update 5/4/2010
 I 'd purchased three of these balls in February , 2010 and within a six weeks period all three balls gone flat . The touch and feel of the ball was excellent but it would not hold air/pressure . I would say customer service was great , but not so much for the ball quality .

 Bought this halter because the headline said `` Yearling '' halter . NOT MINI YEARLING which is how it arrived . I 'm so angry they need to be very specific with their advertising whether these are actual HORSE size or miniature horse size .
 We have a baby -LRB- 3 year old -RRB- shire who keeps breaking out of his halters , and any replacements we find are all too small ... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin , and have no complaints . Even though the description says 1100 + pounds , it 'll fit your 1600 + Draft with no problems . : -RRB- Edit
 This bar was shaped nothing like the picture . It is practically just a straight bar , there is hardly even a bend in the bar . I was very deceived by the image of the product . I rate this bar zero out of five stars .
 Does not come with the 2 pegs as described in the list , and thats what I was hoping for since my other broke on me :-LRB- I also needed the cleaning kit as well . It 's an `` OK '' Kit , But nothing deluxe ...

 As was the case with previous reviewers , I ordered a US Yacht Ensign -LRB- fouled anchor with blue background and horizontal red and white stripes -RRB- but received instead a USPS Yacht Ensign -LRB- fouled anchor with red background and vertical blue and white stripes -RRB- . BTW , USPS stands for United States Power Squadrons , a nationwide nonprofit boating organization . I returned the flag and requested the correct replacement , but instead received yet another USPS Yacht Ensign . It is obvious that whoever fills the orders does not know the difference between the two ensigns . I have spoken with customer service and have explained this to them . We 'll see whether that rectifies the problem .
 I ordered this product . Taylor made ensigns offer an embroidered sewn ensign that is of good quality . That product is shown on this page . What I received , however , is the Twilight Zone of traditional American Yacht Ensigns . The star field is red instead of blue . The stripes are blue instead of red . The blue stripes are placed in vertical orientation instead of horizontal . Creative , but not a U.S. Yacht Ensign . Amazon customer service was very responsive an overnighted a replacement immediately . I appreciated that . But ... the replacement is the same as what was originally sent , and is not the the proper American Yacht Ensign shown on this page , and that I must fly on my documented vessel . Now I must call and return this one as well . I have no doubt that Amazon will provide good customer service once again . But I am left to wonder if perhaps every Yacht Ensign in America has switched to the nonsensical arrangement of colors and stripes while we were all peacefully sleeping in our beds ?
 SERIOUSLY ?? THE FLAG WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WEB SITE . THE STRIPES WERE BLUE VERTICAL AND NOT RED HORIZONTAL . THE TAYLOR MADE COMPANY PROBABLY HAS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WORKING THERE . EVERY RED BLOODED AMERICAN KNOWS STRIPES ON OL' GLORY RUN HORIZONTAL . VERY DISAPPOINTMENT . DO NOT BUY THIS THIS !! USMC STRONG !!
 I ORDERED A AMERICAN FLAG AND THE STRIPES WERE UP AND DOWN NOT LEFT TO RIGHT . WTF !!!!!!
 This overrated grip does n't last and is too short for any normal sized racquet . I know tourna grip sells an XL version , but why sell a grip that is only good for racquetball racquets ? Very annoying .
 This may have been an okay product 10 or 20 years ago , but I found its construction just cheap . I just does n't do as good of a job compared to other modern overgrips , and it really does n't last . Actually , I 'd say that Gamma grips that I used 10 years ago are better . My wife who is not a hard hitter also tore one up after a short amount of play and did n't like it . Overall , I am surprised at how popular this product is and can only assume it 's all the paid endorsements.My strong opinion is that this product is obsolete . There are many newer , more advanced synthetic overgrips out there . By far , my favorite -LRB- in the same `` dry '' style not `` tacky '' as the Tourna Grip -RRB- is the Gamma Pro Wrap . Usually , it is also cheaper . What really sets the Gamma Pro Wrap apart over others I 've tried is that the edges are reinforced whereas the others are just cut strips .
 I 've used many different type of grips before and I must say this is the worst of them all . I ca n't find a comfort holding position no matter what . I have no confident to swing hard due to slippage . Save your money and buy something else , anything else would be better than this . If you still insist on this grip , send me a self-addressed envelop and I will send you the other 2 grips I still have .
 The scope in the picture includes rings to mount the scope , but the actual product does not include the rings . Wrong picture , so I ordered the wrong mounting plate to go with it . This is the first time I 've ordered from Amazon . I 'm not impressed.Horton Hunter SS047 Mult-A-Range Crossbow Scope -LRB- 4X32 -RRB-
 It would n't adjust ! It might have been a bad one ! I would n't bash Reds they more than happy to make it right it !
 These were purchased for a trip , and although the fabric dried quickly as expected , we were very disappointed to find that the long length of the sleeves made it impossible to wear them with a short sleeved shirt ! This is just plain bad design .
 I purchased a couple of these t shirts for trip but had to return them . I have no doubt the material is excellent -LRB- I own some of their boxer briefs -RRB- when it comes to wicking moisture , but the fit was really weird . I 'm 6 ' with a slender build and found the sleeves to be really long while the length was way too short . There 's no way it would stay tucked in as an undershirt , so I returned them . Perhaps , a large would have been better lengthwise but the sleeves would have fit like a 3/4 sleeve baseball jersey . I like retro but not that much . . haha .
 I have a lot of Ex-Officio products - they make great travel/outdoor pants and shirts . I ordered two of these undershirts in medium and they fall short - literally and figuratively . I am a perfect medium size and 5 ' 10 '' tall . While the width around the torso is fine , the length is too short - it barely meets my belt line . I should have studied the catalog photo more closely , you can see for yourself , the proportion indicates a shorter length .
 I 'm not as pleased with these as I was pleased with the boxer briefs of the same brand . These are n't wearing as well , and they do n't seem as tough . After purchasing the underwear , I purchased more of them . I will not be purchasing more of the t-shirts .
 I love this company 's products , but the collar on this shirt frayed immediately . I do n't know if it 's because of contact with razor stubble or a beaded necklace , but it did n't hold up at all and immediately began fraying . That was a surprise given how wonderful their other products have been . Would n't purchase again .
 Great t-shirt except it balls up and has wear issues . The material is great . I could almost overlook the weird wear issues except it 's very expensive . I like plain black t-shirts and this one became my favorite for about two weeks . Then it started to look worn out around the waist area , balling up and looking generally unkempt . If it kept it 's condition I would buy about 30 of these , one for each day of the month . Maybe there is another black t that will get into ` exclusive black t ' territory .
 I wear a size large and ordered that size . I could barely get the shirt on . I wear a size 42 sport coat , so I 'm not a big person , but this was sad . It was also over priced for the quality . Seems like Ex Officio needs to start making quality gear again .
 The product description states , &#34; this tee is odor resistant &#34; . Not true . First time I wore it as an undershirt , I sweat a little bit and I could smell it through my dress shirt . It 's very comfortable though but not worth $ 31 .
 I am really disappointed in the Tee from ExOfficio . The boxers are amazing , comfortable and seem to be durable . The Tee shirt pilled around the neck after only 5 wearings . I have purchased 2 and am returning them to Amazon . For the cost , they should be better quality .
 Pros : - Absorbs sweat-Dries * kinda * fastCons : - Gets ruined easily ; backpack straps , anything velcro , they will tear at the material and ruin it REALLY quickly.-Though it absorbs sweat , that sweat SHOWS-Doesn ' t look good . Definitely not a shirt you can wear out . -LRB- IMHO -RRB- Definitely would n't buy a shirt with this material again .
 I expected to receive a better product , instead I received a product with damage which is not safe for the purpose I intended for . They should revise the goods before delivering to the customers .
 I really want a ` Canes hat , but there 's no way to specify or see what size you 're getting . And they warn of a restocking fee . No thanks .
 The item had two slices in the left front pocket.We returned it to Fogdog and requested a replacement be shipped and that we did not want a credit.when I next heard from them they said they were issuing a Credit . We sent a e-mail and again said we did not want a credit . The next thing we knew we received a e-mail saying that a credit had been issued . We are NOT HAPPY!Mary Maskill
 I bought yhis basket for the readio flyer tricycle and is a disapointment , because :1 . the flowers come off if you touch them and my 2 y.o. daugther split them into their components -LRB- the centre and back of the flower -RRB- and they scream `` chocking hazard '' .2 . the basket does n't hang straight but king forwards so is very easy to tip it and drop everything
 My first order came damaged/had cut on the fabric ; the return was somewhat easy . When the replacement came - it appears that the concept is good but with some MAJOR flaws . The material used is of very poor quality ; as I opened there is no support on the base none whatsover . On the base there is like an ` elbow lock ' which requires a push to open/close - the edges are very rough and sharp - they are not coated so as I pushed I cut two of my fingers ! Then there is a ` bar ' that need to attached on the top portion to prevent from folding , that is of major flaw also ... as I attached one end of the bar to the other , both side collapsed ! and I almost stab myself with the bar.Overall this flaws needs to be corrected before someone gets terribly hurt . I have since returned the Paha Que Petshelter . And by the way , the company 's customer service have the nerve to tell me that they will take 20 % restocking fee ! I 'm truly disappointed .

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 What a ripoff ! I give it one star just because they shipped the correct fuse and did so pretty quick . However , the picture clearly shows SIX fuses - they sent a blister pack of TWO ! Second - read the fine print - I did n't . They charge almost $ 7.50 for S&H PLUS they sent it insured !!! That 's right , insurance on a product worth $ 1.65 ! Since I was n't home when the mail came , I wasted a trip to the P.O. just to get my two fuses . Third - if you want these fuses , truck on over to Ace Hardware - you can get a FIVE pack for $ 2.69 plus tax instead of the $ 9.13 I spent for two . Grrrrr ...
 This unit was amazingly dirty for a new piece ... -LRB- not a big deal -RRB- HOWEVER ... it was shipped with only ONE LEG ... . how does that happen ????? GRRRRR . still stands up and will cost more to send back ... . very disappointed ! buy a different one . .
 I assembled most of the item , except for the bottom handle part , the screw would n't fit at allow , we tried it numerous times , but it just would n't screw on . Finally I called the company CAP Barbell , noone answers the phone ever . So , I finally sent them an email . I must say the responce time was quick , and I asked them to send a replacement screw . I am hoping they will , if not I will return the product .
 45lb plates do not fit . Cheaply made and pegs are very short . Dont waste your money on this . Instead spend a little more and get an upgraded model
 I really want a ` Canes hat , but there 's no way to specify or see what size you 're getting . And they warn of a restocking fee . No thanks .
 The belt is great . The elastic properties make it much more comfortable than the stiff canvass one that came with my water jogging belt .
 Most products are sold in pairs - this is the only one sold as an individual . It feels misleading . I purchased one by mistake - it would cost more to ship back so I kept it but I only have one . There are much better options of sets sold in pairs .
 Ordered these becuase I am having trouble with sand leaking from weights I purchased from 2 other manufacturers . In the Amazon description and at the Hausmann website they both claim weights are filled with steel pellets . Although I have n't opened the weight compartments it sure fells and sounds like sand to me . If these are steel pellets they are the size of sand crystals . Disappointed in this false advertising . I would send them back but I ordered them on 3 day delivery and have already paid more for shipping than I did for the weights . If , after some use , these DO NOT leak I will upgrade my rating of this product .
 It does not fit snugly to the area applied because the divisions are equally shaped therefore it slips when you raise the leg . It appears to be too bulky .
 these things are way too big for ankle weights.I could wrap my leg in them .
 I SEEM TO HAVE RECEIVED A GENERIC , NOT HAUSMANN . IT HAS NO NAME BRAND ON IT , AND IT IS N'T ANYTHING LIKE MY OTHER HAUSMANN WEIGHTS . I WAS CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTED . THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE , DO N'T FIT CORRECTLY .
 The product is as expected . However , when I received it , it had obviously been previously used by someone . Not only was there no tamper-proof seal -LRB- I am not sure whether the manufacturer put one on there -RRB- but someone had obviously taken some of the grease out with a comb-style object .

 For me , this mat was a failure . Sweating and staying put for me are the worst issues w / yoga mats . I could not keep my hands or feet in place from the get go with this mat . It was also very heavy and it just overall was not the mat for me . I did return it for a full refund however which is why I continue to purchase through Amazon . The peace of mind in knowing that if I am unsatisfied with a purchase they have my back is second to none .
 well , As you may have guessed by the title , this mat smells AWFUL ! it seems to be vey sturdy , and a nice , firm grippy material , but peee-eew , what an odor ! We called the company , and they said that since this mat is made from natural latex -LRB- I think -RRB- that it would have a slight odor for a week or 2 ... at Over a month later , the thing still reeks !
 I tried to use this mat on a carpet floor and it did not work well . It kept moving and getting all wrinkled up , so it may only work well if it is used on hard floors . I do n't plan on taking it to yoga class since it is too heavy to carry . I purchase it to use it at home on a carpet floor but that did not work well .

 I first liked the sheets but when I washed them before putting them on my sons bed , they shrunk quite a bit and now do n't fit his bed that great . He has a queen size bed and they are queen size sheets . I know that I can not return them now that I washed them .
 Although I could n't see clearly what exactly was on the sheets , they are called `` Packer sheets '' . Yea , there is nothing Packer on them . At all . They are just plain white NFL and a football on them , also in white . I could 've just bought plain white sheets ! My son was very disappointed , as he was looking forward to his Packer sheets . The pillowcase is nice though , but that 's all .
 I bought two of these on Amazon . One for me , one for a compatriot . We both felt very let down . The description of them is basically accurate except for the `` holding a charge '' part . Use it or not , it wo n't hold a charge for very long . We 've never gotten a 1/2 hours use out of a charge . And they run down quickly when not in use . Otherwise they 're terrific . Vendor wo n't take responsibility for their poor performance . Nuff said .
 The product looks really nice when viewing it online , but it 's alot different in person . I ordered a large for my girlfriend , but it was so small it would n't have fit an 80lb 13 year old . Also , when I read hooded jacket , I expected something warm . Instead the material is very thin with no use of keeping anyone warm . I 'll admit , it is nice looking , but the extremely small size is what turned me off to this product . If you plan on buying it , do n't be ashamed to order something larger than your actual size ... you 'll need it .
 I had purchased this sink to take on a camping trip . Everytime I put the water in it , it would collapse on one side or another and the water would come out . I tried tying the handles to keep it from collapsing but that did n't work either . The only thing I can think of to keep it upright is maybe put some heavy duty plastic tubing in the bottom in a circle to keep it standing up right.It is collapsible , but you better have a partner to hold it open while you rinse or wash anything in it .
 Not to happy with this purchase , does n't hold up to holding much water . It will hold a couple of inches , but that 's it . Ca n't wash dishes.Would not recommend this product .
 I bought this to take as a rinse sink on a recent camping trip . When filled with any amount of water suitable for rinsing/wasing dishes , it does not hold its shape . It also leaked water . The one great thing about it is that it folds up really small for camping . Sacrifice the compactibility of this and buy the Kelty Camp Sink .
 Purchased two of these sinks for use washing dishes for our family camping trips . My decision to purchase was based on the great reviews . When we used them to wash dishes we had a lot of difficulty with the sides of the sink not standing up . The sides kept falling down and the water was draining all over our campsite . We have returned them because they proved worthless to use for the intended purpose .
 WHOOPS ! -- I used this sink a second time several months later after some storage , it had lost its rigidity completely . Now it will only hold a little bit of water but wants to continually collapse . I am adjusting my rating , this sink stinks .
 First , let me say that I think the boat looks the way I thought it would -LRB- the pictures are accurate -RRB- . It 's pretty much what I expected and ca n't wait to get it in the water . Secondly , the shipping was first rate . CEVA did a fantastic job and EVERYONE I spoke with there was extremely nice.Now the BAD , BAD part . The boat arrived with 2 MSO 'S . One completely blank , and the other one with some hand written information on it , and a couple of rubber stamped things that are absolutely UNacceptable to my state for registration purposes . It is my understanding from my state that an MSO MUST be filled in by the MANUFACTURER and it MUST include the HIN -LRB- hull identification number -RRB- , manufacturer , length , model , year , maximum horsepower rating , etc , and that this is a FEDERAL REQUIREMENT . I received NONE of this . At this point , I have been in contact with Amazon -LRB- VERY nice -RRB- and they are attempting to assist me with getting this straightened out post haste . In fairness to Amazon , they have offered to accept a return on this boat and refund my money . It 's NOT Amazon 's fault , and I want to be sure this is understood . At this point , I can not express my frustration in acceptable language regarding this transaction . I will update this as soon as I have more information.As a footnote
 We got this for Uncle Leif 's funeral . We did not know it was plastic - It and the durn Green coffin kit we got were not up to the job . After we got it -LRB- the coffin -RRB- assembled -LRB- 6 hours -RRB- and uncle Leif on board , we poured in some coal oil and lit it off . -LRB- As an after thought , maybe we should have used a little kindling -RRB- All we got was a slightly singed uncle and a melted boat , not the glorious send off he had requested . He loved Viking movies . Tony Curtis was his favorite . Long story short , the boat melted down to the waterline way before we got the anticipated results . Next time its the Aluminum John Boat and a case of charcoal starter and that cardboard coffin too .
 I saw another mini microphone it got one star , the review was telling me it was horable . If i were you I would get the maga phone one the top of the list , type in maga phone in the search and you will find the list.DO NOT GET THIS !!!!!
 This is a terrible product . I agree with Whit . Condensation is unbelievable ! Even with the darn thing wide open at the head ! The Goretex is awful . Go with eVent fabric ...
 Does not come with some cushioning to support the scope , so it actually scratched by scope , a bit . I suggest get some black ribbon and glue it inside the rings , before trying them with scope .
 I have order this dvd with high hopes , i was even willing to pay extra on shipping . but i was wrong , the dvd is not as described it is not all regions .
 I have the same problem as someone else has had . My straps have all ripped and I ca n't find my receipt . The straps were not very sturdy . Do n't buy this if you have young children , find one that has better pad straps .
 We bought this trampoline and safety enclosure for our kids for Christmas , Seven months later there is a rip in the spring covering , the zip has broken and every single one of the ties of the safety enclosure has disintegrated . My children have in no way abused this product so its just made of very poor quality parts . I contacted AirZone who asked me how old it was and then made me send a copy of the invoice and photos of the problem and only after all this said their warranty is two years for the spring and only 90 days for all other parts and offered me a `` one-time '' courtesy 25 % discount off a replacement . Who would want to spend MORE money on such a poor quality product ? Its now an eyesore in our backyard as all the side of the safety enclosure are hanging down.Please do n't waste your money !
 I have been jumping on trampolines since I was a kid . I had one and my neighbors all had them too . I was excited to get this spring trampoline at a good price , but this is the least bouncy spring trampoline I have ever been on . It is put together properly and at first I thought it could be because I am an adult and weight more than I used to , but then I went to my cousins house and jumped on his trampoline and it is super bouncy and like the trampolines I remember . I am getting rid of mine and buying a good one . The Airzone one just is n't that fun .
 We loved this trampoline when we first purchased it . Compared to other models we have had it went together very easily . At 9 months the company had to replace 3 of the top rails due to corrosion and rust that made the tramp unstable and unsafe for my kids to use . Now at 13 months I need the rest of the top rails replaced and the company is giving me a big hassle regarding this . I DO NOT RECOMMEND this trampoline if you expect it to last longer than a year .
 Do not buy this product if you live in an area with wind speeds above 10 mph . I just put this together for my daughter along with the enclosure 3 weeks ago . We had a cold front come in with wind speeds 10-15 mph and it ravaged this thing . Flipped it over , twisted , cracked the frame in multiple spots . The only thing that prevented this from smashing into my home or cars were a few small trees I had in the yard . This is extremely too light to handle any kind of wind . Be sure you cement or stake this item securely or you will just waste your money . I dont know what to do with it now . Its just in pieces in my front yard now .
 Bought the 14 ' AirZone as a Christmas for my daughter . Was quite a hit and saw lots of adult-supervised use . Noticed that the spring cover started breaking down in direct sunlight and that a few straps were tearing the first few weeks , but nothing major . A few months into its use the frame starting torquing and twisting . It eventually failed and collapsed after a year of use . A few of the legs sheared from the upper ring , snapping in various places . No one was hurt but they easily could have been .
 These pants were advertised as having padding on the knees and hips , but turned out to only include hip padding . We returned them promptly and got something else that included all the elements we were looking for .
 A few years ago , I tore up the seat that shipped with my Trek 4500 mountain bike -LRB- I foolishly tried extreme mountain biking ! -RRB- . I considered the Trek stock seat to be fairly comfortable . I replaced the torn stock seat with this one . I have HATED it since!This seat LOOKS great , but FEELS AWFUL ! Even just a 30 minute ride causes my rear end to hurt into the next day . It is a narrow saddle with very stiff pads . Although I do much of my riding standing up , it still causes my rear end to hurt a lot . I feel my butt bones digging through onto the narrow saddle . I am a bit heavy -LRB- 215 lbs -RRB- and probably require a wider seat . Beware - this seat is very uncomfortable !
 Would not hold air and the ends broke with in a month , you get what you pay for . Ok for small kids but not someone with power .
 This double-end bag came with the Title `` Double-Trouble Bag Stand '' . I completed assembly of the stand and hung the bag at around 11:30 p.m. I went a few rounds with the bag and went to sleep . When I got up , there was only about 20 % of the air remaining in the bag . I do n't know about you , but if I have to fill up the bag every time I use it ... it 's no good . Buyer beware.P.S . I do see what the review above is talking about when it mentions the plastic labels and bare-handed practice . However , I wrap my hands before hitting and it solves that problem . The bag is still no good though .
 This punching bag works well when inflated however it has a slow leak and must be taken down each day before use to be reinflated . It has become a hassle and I wish I could return it however since I ordered it through Amazon from another company I do n't know how to return it .
 The silver matte does not match the Taurus 44 ... yet Taurus makes this specifically for that gun . Why would the same manufacturer produce 2 completely separate metal mattes ?!? If you know how to drill/tap ... or know a good gunsmith ... get the Weigand scope mount !
 I like these fenders although I have to agree with the other person who responded with the `` Planet Bike `` logo on the fenders . It is quite large and realy does detract from the fenders and it can not be removed without repainting over it . Also Amazon did not pack this very well and the tape holding the box shut came open that with the fact that the fenders come in a plastic bag caused me to lose one pice of hardware . PB sent me a new part right away.They install in a snap and can be adjusted to fit very nicely.I recommend them but would also give them higher rating if they did not have any crap Corp. logos on them and packed in a plastic bag .
 UPDATE
 this is a really deceiving advertisement.I ordered the PINK FENDERS ... they are 100 % plastic . . NO ALUMINUM here . . they are costly $ $ $ $ $ And a pain to now return !!!! How can you put this description up of your product that is NOT TRUE ?
 Do not buy this thinking it comes with a top punch . I was disappointed to pay a little more to get this , only to find out that the top punch was not included .
 This watch purports to be a real Wenger product . When it broke after about six months , I sent it to Wenger for repair under the one-year warranty . Wenger told me that it was NOT one of their watches . They were able to replace the movement for me -LRB- for a fee -RRB- and they also told me that they could not guarantee the water resistance it stated it was capable of , as it was not their product . I had bought the watch to use as a dive watch and now ca n't trust it for that purpose . I ended up giving it away and buying a REAL dive watch from a reputable dealer .
 There are no Pockets on these Draw String Shorts with Pockets ! While Customer Service at Andrew Christian was quick to assure me a refund would be issued . . The inconvenience is something no one else needs to go through if you need pockets in your walking shorts like I do !
 the shorts above that I ordered did not arrive , I received blk army shorts without pockets and no star , just the word army
 This bar ca n't handle 175 pounds . After 2 weeks of use it bent . That 's all I have to say .
 product is ok and price is ok , they are a bit slow to ship but the item description is not adequate . i.e. when i recieved mine i found the nozel to be too small and the sthreads to be too fine . if this info had been in the item description it would have saved me more than a few bucks .
 Ca n't talk to it 's rain resistance , but it is very spacious and stout . Only problem I had was that I was n't able to get a bug tight seal with my hitch in place.EDIT
 I used this tent one time and when Itook it down , One of the top poles broke , . One time used !!!
 The holster is functional . It does n't seem to fit any revolver exactly right . I have tried it with several Smiths , a Colt .38 , and my Ruger GP100 . As indicated by the product pic with the blue gun , the trigger and trigger guard hang out of the holster rather awkwardly . Not really a safety issue so much as a fit issue . Would be great for kid 's toy gun but not practical to actually carry a 2 + pound handgun securely .
 The actual comforter is quite nice . That 's were the good part ends . The picture includes pillow shams , but the pillow shams did not come . The five pieces are the comforter , fitted sheet , flat sheet , one pillow case , two pillow case . The pillow cases both face the same direction , so you ca n't even make the bed properly . The material of the sheets is cheap , and the sheets are a generic baseball print .
 This seemed like a great sock so I spent about 30 bucks for 8 pair . I do a ton of walking so a comfortable sock is of paramount importance to me . After regular use and repeated proper washing these socks bind your ankle . This is due to a design defect . Apparently the manufacturer folds over about 1.5 inches of the top of the sock inside the sock and then adds a stitch line . This stitch line is a source of irritation after a few hours of wearing . I called the company and basically they said tough , that 's the way we make them and others have n't complained . I pointed out that 99.9 % of the buyers probably just discard the sock packaging and do n't remember who to contact . Anyway their customer service sux too . DO N'T BUY THESE . You can do better .
 Almost a decade ago I bought a X-Static shirt . I was floored at how well it it kept odor at bay . Polyester/Nylon of course works great for wicking , activities , cleans well , and all that jazz we already know . But it has the stink factor that overrides all the benefits of polyester -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- . So the X-Static was a great addition.With the happiness of my shirt , I thought the material would make great undies , especially for travelling . I travel light and usually in hot climates , so I need something that can go a few days , clean well , dry fast , and not stink . so I 've kept an eye out for X-Static underwear for about 10 years . I happened upon these and snatched up three pair , a mixture of briefs and boxer briefs , especially since a trip to India was coming up . I could n't wait for them to arrive -LRB- strange , I know , getting excited over some underwear . -RRB- I tried them out a couple weeks before my trip , and much to my dismay , they STINK ! Sure , they 're kinda comfy , wick , are n't cheap , but they are the worst smelling underwear I 've had to date . This is all three pair , all used twice a piece , in varying conditions . But heck , even sitting in the office these failed miserably by the end of the day.So if your main goal is anti-odor underwear , I 'd list my experience from best to worst as follows : Merino wool likeIcebreaker Men 's Bodyfit150 Ultralite Boxer Brief - No , it 's not hot if you get the light weight stuff , and works like a champ . Since it is light weight , it is thin and you should hand wash it in order to not wear it out so fast . My frist pair developed a small hole after going through the wash the first time.ExOfficio Men 's Give-N-Go Boxer - It 's poleyester , but somehow it works pretty well.Cotton - Yes , even regular old cotton works better than these.X-Static / Silvermax - A life 's dream crushed , these are the worst underwear I 've ever owned in the oder department . They just plain stink .
 What you can not see in the picture is that when you have the clips on , the belt is looped over itself . It becomes so thick that you have to take off a clip and unfold one side of the belt just to put on / take off the belt . Also the inside of the belt is velcro creating friction tesulting in more difficulty sliding it throw belt hoops . Overall it works but its a bit of a pain being so thick .
 OK so I rant a bit . But I may have to depend on a rope hanging from this belt and the description when it arrived stated `` light to moderate duty . '' OK thats for who . If I am hanging from a rope , I ca n't depend on the buckle which is not well described . I would have expected more from Uncle Mike 's .
 I was excited to get this item , -LRB- the first one -RRB- but it would n't seal closed . No matter how tightly is was closed it still leaked . I returned it and ordered a second one . The second one is a little better but I would n't trust it in my backpack . When turned upside down it has a fairly recurring drip . Otherwise it pours very nicely and turns off when you put your finger over the hole on top . Too bad it has to leak .
 They fit MSR bottles OK , but are a VERY tight fit in SIGG bottles . When first installed , the caps leaked , it only got worse from there . The caps would not stop leaking not matter how tight they were screwed down . When opened and pouring , a pretty good trickle of fuel would run out around the outside of the nozzle opening and make a dangerous mess around your lantern . But , the worse part was that within a very few minutes of getting a little white gas on the two o ring seals , I noticed that the black o ring material was coming off on my hands . The rubber is NOT white gas compatible ! I removed both of these and discarded them . Trangia makes a much better bottle valve , also available on Amazon .
 After purchasing bikes , we knew we would need a lock . I figured a lock that required a key would be more secure than a combination lock . Boy was I wrong.I owned this lock , and 2 bicycles for about 3 weeks . Now I own 1 bicycle and no lock.Only prevents the laziest of theives from stealing a bicycle . Would have been great had it served its purpose .
 What a great idea , if only it worked . I bought this as a gift for an avid golfer . The main feature that attracted me was the swing analysis function , but the watch does n't register half of the swings . We spent more time trying to get the watch to read his swing than we actually spent practicing . What a waste . I am definitely returning it .
 I debated long and hard over buying this cooler for an upcoming annual trip , where we share a house at the beach with friends , and always run out of fridge and freezer space . Most of the reviews I read were decent , so I took a chance . We started off with it packed with a combination of ice , frozen foods , and previously chilled foods and beverages . By the time we reached out destination -LRB- an 8 hour drive -RRB- , we had mostly water and partially thawed foods . It was a warm day , but it was in an air conditioned car with the exception of a short ferry ride . At our vacation place , we used it as a second fridge , with similar results . How anyone gets more than a day or so out of it is beyond me ... and it certainly did n't perform as advertised ! The trade of in cooler space for additional `` Xtreme '' insulation is a bad deal , in our book . Given the givens , we 'd have just used our old cooler and added a few groceries !
 My family was going on a camping trip and figured this would be perfect as the ice would last five days and we would not have to worry . So we spent the extra money only to be disappointed . Not only did this product not live up to its word , the ice melted after only five or six hours . We hardly opened the cooler . Do n't waste you money . We tried refilling the cooler again only to have the same thing happen .
 I bought this cooler . The claim is up to five days . However , no minimum is given , so the claim means nothing . It has more insulation than a regular cooler ; however , the drain area in the bottom has less insulation , and the four cupholders , with no insulation , are a weakness . With ice in the cooler , they are cold to the touch , a definite engineering error . As another reviewer said , it will keep ice for five days , but only if you keep it full , and in my opinion , do not open the cooler . The reality is that it is good for two to three days , but even less if you start with non-cooled sodas or other items or it is opened often , such as at a picnic or at the beach . It is better than a regular cooler , which in my opinion are just containers . You best bet is to put more money into more ice . Nowadays , marketing people call their entry-level products new and improved , kingsize , or supreme as a rule . This is an example of that type of marketing .
 Performs well resting or not vigorously exercising . Does not give a heart rate reading while exercising.I returned it to Amazon and received a full refund.I then purchased a Mio Ultimate Heart Rate Monitor Watch . I am not pleased with the performance with this watch either . I 'm giving it another try . Please read my review for this watch .
 I 'm not one to usually mention the shipping process since it has nothing to do with the product ... But Some people have mentioned how the product arrived and the box looked as if it were kicked and so forth . I laughed , shrugged it off , and thought to myself `` Hey -- I wo n't be unlucky like these people '' . WRONG.The box that arrived at my house was completely destroyed . There were more holes in it than actual box material . Parts were scattered throughout my front lawn and the rest of the box literally deteriorated as I tried to move it into my house.Somehow , it would seem all the pieces arrived though . Cool , right ? Nope -- just means more stuff to ship back . It would appear ... Bowflex is pretty low quality.The backpad 's holes do NOT line up properly with the actual bench so I ca n't even screw in the pad completely . This means 3 out of 4 screws are only able to hold the pad in . The same applies to a secondary pad that is on it . Again , one screw can not even fit due to bad alignment . Was the product warped during shipment ? No , it was n't . It was terrible drilling points that caused the issue . Well-done Bowflex -- you prove that the `` made in China '' stamp was well-earned . The padding also feels low quality . I 'd guess that after a lot of use those pads will eventually wear down and develop holes -- perhaps to simulate the box it came in.Also , doing situps on this can be a tad bit annoying . The spot for your legs is relatively small so if you have slightly large legs , then forget about doing so in comfort . My legs are n't even that large since I 'm an average-sized guy , yet it still bothers me . Plus the gap between the pads that people mentioned really does bother you after awhile and even more so depending on your height.Pros
 Putting the SelectTech 5.1 together was a chore due to most of the pieces not fitting together well . The metal bars that support the seat were bent together looking like an elongated triangle instead of two parallel bars . I was able to bend them back into place and get the seat on . Mine arrived without the bar that holds the foam rollers for sit ups . I 'm still waiting on the replacement part . The bench looks nice when assembled but mine is still incomplete . Hopefully that is rectified soon and I can get to work .
 The bench has three major design flaws :1 . The bottom seat is too high when the bench is used for incline . I 'm 5 ' 9 &#34; and there is no way I can get on this bench like I would a normal bench by backing onto it from the bottom . I have to swing my leg over to get on the bench which makes it dangerous and a tripping hazard especially with weights . Also , there is no way my feel can touch the floor to provide stabilization , so the only work around I 've found is I have to put my feet up on the foam roller pad due to thie height , which is not the most optimal .2 . The gap between bottom and top pad is too big . Not good for the lower back , no way this can be confortably used for decline bench since the gap ends up digging into your low back and forget about the sit ups . Bowflex should have included an additional gap filler pad to solve this issue .3 . Wheels are too small . I have an interlocking padded floor in my basement gym and had to remove the height adjusters to allow the wheels to make contact with the floor . Granted my floor is probably a little softer than the typical harder cork flooring you see at most gyms , but the wheels could have been positioned better to allow easier movement of the bench.I also have a Bowflex Ultimate 2 and was very impressed by the design , so I had high expectations for this bench . I 've come to trust the Bowflex brand and took a gamble on this one -LRB- bought only online and never saw this in person -RRB- and I 'm very disappointed . I would steer clear of this product .
 I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised ? Does the value justify the cost ? Does it improve my life ? I put my recommendation at the top , then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONI can recommend the product since it 's functional , though I 'm disappointed in the build quality . I own the bowflew adjustable dumbbells , which are a PERFECT product , but the quality and functionality of this bench seem subpar for the brand.FUNCTIONALITYThe major drawbacks are that it 's a little rickety , and it does n't collapse down . You 'd think that would be a trade-off - more solid/less compact v more flimsy/more collapsible , but that is not the case.VALUEYou have to measure the value of this product against what you 'd be paying to do all the same lifts in a gym . In that light , the value is great . A set of adjustable dumbbells coupled with this bench , and you can kiss weight rooms goodbye . You can work out while watching netflix.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?This product helped me ditch my gym membership . I have some gripes about it 's size and lack of collapsibility , but overall I 'm glad I have it .
 This bench is a nice solid bench , but ... 1 -RRB- The plastic covers on the bottom end of the adjustment bar do n't stay on . One of mine fell off after a couple days , only then to be eaten by the dog . No big deal , I took the other one off and it works fine , but a rubber end or glue would have fixed that problem .2 -RRB- The bigger issue for me is the front feet -LRB- the bar that stablizes the front of the bench -RRB- . Maybe it 's my personal preference , but that bar sits right where my natural `` drop the dumbells '' motion ends . It 's just a personal preference of mine , after being used to gym benches without the front wide foot .3 -RRB- The bench is easily adjustable , but the one decline setting is not really much of a decline .4 -RRB- The gap between the back and butt pads seems a bit excessive . If you keep the foot bar on , your backside inconveniently sits right in the pad gap , not exactly comfortable .5 -RRB- I will add a positive , the head cushion is separate from the back cushion , so when the time comes where the cushions start cracking -LRB- usually the head starts first -RRB- , it looks like all you would have to do is replace the head cushion.Again , these are just my personal thoughts on the bench as a long time gym member , and my first go-round with setting up my home gym . Next time around I 'll pay closer attention to these things .
 One would think
 The cushions on this product were damaged . I sure hate buying something for close to $ 200 that is not in perfect condition . This was to be a Christmas present so I am not sure what to do with it now ?
 I like the product but there is no nuts and bolts ! I looked through everything and nothing ... I do n't want to send the whole thing back because of that but what else am I do to . I could go buy some from the hardware store but then I feel like I was cheated . Very frustrated !
 The thing is not sturdy and feels cheap . It wobbles over time because of the poor design ... where the various level notches are placed.I would not recommend . I only purchased this b/c I was buying the adjustable dumbbells at the same time.The customer service and warranty are also worthless . Spend your money elsewhere.I replaced with far superior bench that was half the price .
 Ordered the bench and was excited to start putting together . Was thrilled to see that the cushions were pocked with little stickers covering up the holes in the vinyl . Boxed it right back up and shipped it back . Very disappointing that Bowflex would allow such a defect to leave their factory . Will buy elsewhere .
 My bench was unfortunately defective right out of the box . -LRB- The wheels on the rear stabilizer were completely bent by about 20 deg , so they could not roll at all . -RRB- My assembly instructions were apparently also incomplete , because when I called customer service to request a repair part , they told me I should first send in the registration form from the last few pages of my instruction book , which I did not have . Finally , they just let me fax in a copy of my sales receipt , and I was supposed to receive a replacement part in 6-10 days . After 6 weeks , I still have not received a thing . I have called back and started the whole process over again , and we 'll see if it 's any different this time .
 I would hope that this is specific to the bench I received , but I would n't know as Bowflex has yet to respond to my email -LRB- over 1 week ago -RRB- telling them about it and asking for how to fix.Anyway , I assembled the bench and found it to be a total wobblefest - not in terms of the legs which I assembled , but the upper bench frame itself , which comes pre-assembled . I figured the factory must not have tightened it properly , so I tried to do it . . only to find that the screws used are a slip type that do not allow any tightening ... so they just keep spinning with no effect on stability/tightness . This thing is an injury waiting to happen - no one in their right mind would use any kind of weight on this bench or else risk ligament injury due to a sudden shift while using it.I have had many benches , all have been solid , this is by far and away the worst bench I have ever seen . I will post a video review shortly to ` show ' how bad it is if Bowflex keeps refusing to even reply to my request for a way to fix or have it replaced .
 This bench is absolutely not worth the amount it is priced at . First of all , none of the parts lock in place aside from the leg thing -LRB- not a workout buff , so sorry I do n't know the proper terms ! -RRB- You can rest the back support arm at each of the incline levels , but if you pull up on it it moves . My husband likes an ab exercise where you lie on your back and hold onto the bench and curl up your legs , but he ca n't do it on this bench because he pulls the back out of position.Second , it does n't lie flat . Period . Maybe mine is defective , but there is ALWAYS a slight incline when we have the back in the position where you 'd think it should be at a flat 180 degrees . Add to this the issue of the gap between the backrest and seat that others have mentioned and this bench is quite uncomfortable for a lot of exercises.Luckily we bought ours used and only paid $ 50 for it . I ca n't imagine how angry I would be if I bought it new for $ 200 + and I do n't understand all the glowing reviews for this piece of junk . Do n't waste your money , there have to be better options out there .
 I 've used this for about 4 weeks now , and it started out great , but no longer registers properly . I know this because I walk 2 miles on my treadmill every morning , and the pedometer is now erratic and incorrect . I 've replaced the battery and it started working okay for a couple of days , and now its back to erratica .
 This trike is not well made and there is a better alternative for less money ! I bought this one , realized that you ca n't steer it at all with the push bar , it 's actually even difficult just to go straight . I returned it and purchased the radio flyer deluxe steer and stroll trike instead and we are much happier as you can steer the front wheel with the push bar and it seems to be made better !
 I loved this chair for my dorm room , but after a month or two , the plastic things on the the metal supports broke . I know some others have said this too . Too bad . I 'd suggest a different chair .
 The seems on this are weak I have purchased two each have had problems.KwikTek T-Top PFD storage bag , holds up to 6 PFDs
 After having this on my boat for only 2 trips out the rear seam tore and almost lost my life vest . I would not recommend this to anyone due to how poorly made it is . I only wish I would have paid attention to other reviews !!!! What a waste of money !!!!!!
 I returned this product because it did not hook up properly to the hardtop on my boat . It hung down too low and got in the way so I sent it back .
 this designed for a t-top w canvas roof where there is framework at the &#34; ceiling &#34; with my fiberglass top it did not fit well
 This set was unbelievibly low quality . The ends were hot glued on , and they were in the box , not on the swords . The paint was chipped off of the sheath on 2 of them , and there is a little wooden piece glued on the sides of the sheath ... . All three were broken . I was expecting to not get the greatest quality because of the price , but I was not expecting this . It is the week before Christmas , so I am super gluing the pieces back together , but I would never recommend this product to anyone , try a different set !
 this bottom bracket set is cheaply made ' bearings grind in bearing cup 's which rip away at the chrome plating which in turn wear out the bearings ' sounds like gravel in b-b , I replaced the cup 's & bearings within a week , but you get what you pay for , could use some spacers also but for the price its worth the it for the use of the spindle & other parts .
 t is a deception not inclluye the lifeguards , In the advertisement he says that it contains the lifeguards and in the photos of the product they appear clearly.I hope that they return my money , otherwise I am going to denounce them and they them were forcing that to return many mas that it and they were eliminating his license.I wait for response .

 My first impression of this lure is it made of the same material as a Pom Pom . It also looks like one . I was impressed by the nosie maker and thought initially it would do well.After trolling the lure for roughly an hour , we pulled it in to take a look and noticed almost all of the plastic material had come off . I trolled it a little more with no hits . Sure it could have been the day , but I at least expect the lure to withstand a normal trolling session . Should be a $ 7 lure max !
 This was a nice addition to my key chain . Yes , the thermometer was about 5-10 degrees off , but I learned how to deal with that . However , the compass stopped working after about 3 months . No matter which direction you turn , the needle always points north of you , not north of the earth . Not cool .

 broke within 8 seconds of being out of the bagthis sectional staff was the most disappointing thing i have ever purchased off amazon , firstly , one dowel shattered about the second time it bumped the ground , quite possibly made out of pencil wood.the second dowel was dovetailed in the center and glued together , and it took about two tugs to open the rings enough to fall apart , this item is cheaply manufactured , and absolutely not practical for any practice application , complete waste of 26 dollars , this will be the last time i choose an item based on free shipping , luckily i was n't injured . the seller should be ashamed of themselves

 The super 9 rifle by UHC is actually a decent rifle , for 70 dollars , but also lacks the performance to be actually called a `` sniper rifle '' . Even though the box and other sources have stated that the rifle fires over 300 fps . Another feature that this rifle has is a light body . For younger users , this may come in handy when holding the rifle , whether in prone or standing position . For people like me , i perfer rifles with a heavier body , giving the weight a more realistic feel , and also a challange in holding the rifle still in prone or standing position . The accuracy on this rifle is ok , the bb does go straight , but when using the sights , it becomes to hard to adjust the adjustable sight . One feature that caught my attention , and that no other rifle currently has , is the super 9s ejecting shells . After firing one bullet , and pulling back the bolt , one shell ejects from the open eject port and when the bolt is pushed back in to the barrel , a brand new shell containg a bb in is used . This may not be the best option for you in a major skirmish because the magazine with the shell can only hold 5 rounds at once -LRB- one shells in the magazine -RRB- . Your best choice would be the stick magazine that hooks on to the side of the rifle . The stick magazine holds 25 rounds and also helps by being able to fire , because you dont have to pull out the 5 round rotary clip and stick a new one in , that just takes too much time . When mounting a scope , you have to by a mount seperatly and heavy scopes can be a problem . running around with a big heavy scope on a light bodied rifle , can cause the mount/RIS to be thrown off causing you to miss just by a inch or so . Also on must sites there is a bipod that is listed as accesories that clamps on to the barrel.this is not recomended since the rifle is light enough where if you cant hold the gun still then youve got to work on holding it straight . The bipod also scratches up the barrel causing unwanted marks to be left . I wouldnt really buy this gun unless u wanted a cheap airsoft gun to shoot at cans . I would go with the UTG M324 .
 when i bought this gun i was expecting a gun that was n't the best but better unfortenely i just got bad . on the first airsoft battle i found out a 20 dollar pump gun had better accuracy and range and at 80 feet you have to aim at there feet cause it curves the rounds like a stunt airplane strait up.now the gun its self i mad farly good plastic but you put the gun together in pieces that are held together by 3 screws that loosen often and the orange tip literally falls rite off the barrel and it just happens to be the front site nor are there mounting rails for a scope.so in the end do n't buy this GUN !!!!!!!
 This is undoubtably the worst rifle ever made . Sadly many people opt for this rifle due to its small price tag . All I can say is , `` you get what you pay for . '' This is a perfect example of it . You CAN NOT upgrade it . It is inconsistent , has no accessories , you must pracitally destory your sight assembly to fit a scope on it . The maximum range is about 15-20 yards aiming at a mansized target . Do not be fooled by most advertisements , this rifle shoots rounghly 200 FPS . Worst of all , it WILL break within a few months and become just another expensive doorstopper . My advice , save your money and buy something better .
 I do not like this gun I have had it a good little while and now 1/2 the time it does n't even shoot and another 1/4 of the time it sucks at shooting . You can probably fine much better guns for this price & shipping . So I do n't recommend it .
 WARNING READ FIRST !!! Airsplat is not the company to but from . This company is known for sending broken gun or completely the wrong gun to your address . I haved ordered from them and received a broken gun . When you try to get another one they make you pay for another and make YOU pay to return that one . AIRSPlAT is a joke DO N'T by from them !!!!!
 not very high quality material . i had had it for about 3 or 4 months and then a peice inside shattered due to cold weather . when it WORKED it was fine . the range was good and it hurt like heck , but i 'd go for a little more high quality gun . 2 stars
 i got mine on craigslist I was excited when i got this but when i tried it out it stinks it is basically all plastic exept some parts on the gun like the barrel and the trigger and trigger gard but it feels so cheep it is good to about 40 feet and then it curves get a better sniper this is not a bad gun for a beginer but if your looking for a good sniper this is not it
 If you are at all serious about Airsoft , then do n't buy this . This gun will not last very long . It is almost impossible to hit anything even when you are using high grade BB 's because of the BB curves up after about fifty feet .
 Upon the first shot from this Rifle I instantly realized I had just wasted $ 70 + . The ` Rifle ' is unbelieveably inaccurate , and you mind as well run up to your target and smack it with the butt of the Rifle if you wan na hit anything at all . After about 3 feet or so , the BB Curves away from the target , sometimes it does n't get a foot away from you before plopping on the ground . If your looking for a good shooting gun , get a Pistol -LRB- Or a high-quality Automatic Electronic Gun , an AEG , if you have the money -RRB- , the Taurus P22 is an excellent gun and does n't cost nearly as much as this ridiculus piece of garbage . There are several tactical problems with the Super 9 aswell ... the Cartridges , you have to stop , cup your hand over the reciever after every shot if you do n't wan na be looking around for a shell laying on the ground . That and the 5 shot capacity of the Magazine definatly means virtually every one of your opponents -LRB- Except those unlucky enough to have bought this gun -RRB- has an advantage over you , even if you have several extra cartridges in other magazines , it takes too long to reload . Overall , do n't waste your time or money with this , because in the end , you 'll realize where these all belong
 This gun is horrible compared to the M324 sniper on shortyUSA it shoots mabye 290 fps
 I like airsoft , but spending 100s mabey thousands of dollars on a fake gun is a little much . So shut your mouth . And ... `` hardcore '' ... airsoft is a lot more than any other sports . In other sports , you pay mabey 5 bucks on a ball . Not a 1000 dollars . In conclusion , airsoft is fun ... but `` hardcore airsofters '' -LRB- hah . . what a joke -RRB- are insane . -LRB- unless your some spoiled kid . -RRB- Anyway ... do n't buy this gun . I 'm not going to go into detail ... so i 'm just going to say overall its not worth it .
 To me it 's a good gun , it 's hefty and some what durable but it jams EASILY and the front sight actually fell off . Also , I tried to clear out the barrel after it jammed and there was a piece inside that came out fairly easily . The shells are difficult to keep track of , and the 25 shot clip broke on me . I have a couple shells but I only keep one on me so I do n't lose it and I manually load It each time which is easier for me to do then loading the magazine each time . I mainly use it for plinking , and it was accurate before the front sight fell off .
 Oftentimes I wonder if these positive comments are left by the individual seller . This seller I 'm sure is fantastic no doubt , but sadly I feel it 'd be injustice to allow prospective buyers to invest in a product horribly made . The bolt handle -LRB- The piece you pull back -RRB- snaps easily especially if the bolt is disproportionately made . I 've heard there is a 75 % rate of imperfections meaning something will be off for example your hop-up -LRB- the utility that allows your bb 's to fly straight -RRB- . If this is for your young teen in their enclosed backyard shooting at tin cans , I would say this is a fine gun due to it 's great price .

 This video is very hard to follow as far as I 'm concerned . I was n't able to keep up with it so to me is n't very useful

 I bought this pistol a couple of months ago.When I first got it it worked fine.Then after a month it stared to shoot a little worse . I was back from walking in the woods . I had shot it a couple of times.When I tried to shoot it all I heard was click so I looked at it and there is something jammed in it . so the barrel can not go all the way forward so it can not shoot at all.the only good things are that i could hit a box from 20 yards running and 30 prone . so it can punch through a cardboard box from 5 feet . the good things are It came with 2 clips which is good for a side arm . the fps is 315 the box also included a target and 40 BB 's . the pistol as iron sites and a safety . Cause when you have it on your belt you do n't want it to go off.The clips are a bit hard to load . I bought it from a sporting goods dealer by my house It honestly was a waste off money so do n't buy it .
 we bought this for our air navigator so that our 4 yr old and 2 yr old could ride together , but the seat is so small ! the seat even seems small for the 2 yr old compared to the air navigator seat . as pictured , this insert is the front seat for the person who has to pedal . so the stronger person gets a small seat . the only other issue i have is that my 4 yr old 's knees hit the handlebars because you ca n't adjust the seat back very far -LRB- he 's avg height to slightly above avg maybe -RRB- . its a nice product but keep in mind the seat is really really small .
 This seat is for the rider/peddler in front , which is the bigger kid . My 5-year-old daughter 's legs are too long to maneuver the pedals ; her knees bump against the handlebars . The seat is tiny . A child younger than 5 would n't have the strength or coordination to operate the trike with another rider in tow , which makes me question who Kettler intended to use this seat ??? Useless product , but excellent quality nonetheless . Bottom line
 After getting an Air Navigator for our toddler daughter , we figured that we 'd get this attachment so that we could add our infant son to the set up . This is a cool idea - it allows you to add another kid to your -LRB- expensive -RRB- Kettler trike . But it does n't work very well . In particular , it becomes almost impossible to maneuver and steer the trike once this insert has been added.Before getting the insert , we would push our daughter in the trike using the steering bar . To avoid complete chaos , I locked the front tire and steering bar , and used the bar to manage our direction , often tilting back and pivoting the trike if we needed to change direction -LRB- if you own one of these trikes , you know what I 'm talking about -RRB- . Once we added the insert , it was difficult to change direction at all . Not only could we not `` tilt and turn '' , as we had done before , but it was almost impossible to push the steering bar in a way that would effectively change direction . The trike with the insert was simply too heavy and awkward to change direction . -LRB- BTW , if you 're letting the kid steer herself , I do n't see how that would solve the problem , as a kid ca n't possibly manage to steer with the insert attached . -RRB- At first , I figured that it would just take some time to get used to maneuvering the trike with the insert . But in the end , we simply could n't figure out how to steer the trike when we added the insert - it was way too heavy and cumbersome . This is a real bummer because the concept is very appealing - in theory , it allows two -LRB- or more - although that would be a disaster -RRB- kids to enjoy your -LRB- expensive -RRB- Kettler trike . But in practice , it just does n't work . It 's too hard to steer , and your kids will constantly end up in the ditch as you futilely try to pull , push , and tug them back onto the sidewalk . Your kids wo n't be hurt , as it all occurs in slow motion , but they 'll progressively head off the sidewalk while you 're trying to figure out how to get them back in line.The trike is great , but the insert has been relegated to a corner of our garage . And will never be used again .
 I purchased the Kettrike Air Happy bike and in the Amazon.com website , they state that the Kettrike Tandem Insert is an accesory of this bike . It is not . Even in the Manufacture 's Information it states that it can be used with an adjustable Kettrike frame , one that separates in two . Well the Air Happy Kettrike separates in two and it does not fit . I 'm sure , having the correct bike would make this item a 5 star toy . I guess not being able to return it because my 30 days are up has soured the situation . Good luck and be sure you purchase the correct bike .
 Thanks to the reviews , I figured out how this seat was used.However , I does n't look too safe . Where is the seat belt ?
 i just realized there are so many things out there that serves the same purpose for less the price . it really serves its promise tho . this is good if you dont care about the $ $ $
 Well-reviewed , used by my teachers and more experienced fellow students , well-cushioned , generously sized , but sadly , I have returned it . It is most definitely not for someone who sweats as prodigiously as I.
 I just received my Manduka Black Mat PRO and am extremely disappointed to find that despite the excellent reviews it received , this mat is so slippery that I can not even hold downward facing dog without putting a dangerous amount of strain on my shoulders to futilely attempt my hands from sliding quickly forward.I understood before that the mat needed to be `` broken in , '' but I do n't understand how I can practice on this mat every day for two months to do so without severely injuring myself.I have washed it and scrubbed it with salt , but I am still finding the mat far to dangerous to practice on . Really bad purchase .
 I purchased the BlackMatPRO on May 9th . I have followed all the instructions per the manufacturer to ` break-in ' the mat , but I am still slipping all over the place during my yoga practice . This is not only dangerous , but interferes greatly during a yoga workout . I am very disappointed with this purchase , especially since my cheaper mats seem to work much better .
 I ca n't take it anymore ! I slip all over the place and it 's getting dangerous . I 've used the mat for 12 classes and have washed it twice . I also lay it in high traffic areas with hopes this will help break it in.When it 's sticky , it 's too sticky . I felt like my flesh on my toes was going to rip off when transitioning to up dog . When it 's slippery , I can hold nothing ! Like others have mentioned , I felt like I was practicing on an ice rink . It did teach me to be very precise and controlled with each transition because I was so afraid of hurting myself or others . So , this is a plus . It also stays in one place and NEVER wrinkles during my practice . Although , at the end of the day . I 've decided to cut my loses and move on to another brand . It 's just not worth the added stress.Sorry !
 I purchased the Manduka black pro mat a couple months ago and have practiced/taught at least 100 + hours -LRB- primarily vinyasa flow -RRB- with the mat . I have naturally clammy , sweaty , moist hands at all times and I was hoping the Manduka would be a good solution to the constant slippage . Unfortunately after breaking it in and using the Vermont organic mat wash -LRB- recommended by Manduka -RRB- my hands still slip a lot and require a towel or yogitoes at all times . Evidentally , I 'm purchasing the Jade Harmony mat as a replacement . I compared the Jade and Manduka side by side and my hands did n't slip as much on the Jade due to the spongy texture which grips better . Plus the Jade is all natural and biodegrades.Manduka Pros
 I wish I had read the reviews here , because all I did was research `` best yoga mat '' and everyone raved about Manduka . When I found it cheaper on Amazon , I just ordered it off the bat without reading further.The mat itself feels great , it is thick and very durable , and at first when I started to use it I thought it was going to be really great . Then we got into the flowy part of class and I warmed up -LRB- I do n't sweat much at all -RRB- , and suddenly my legs were sliding apart and I was almost in the splits doing triangle . Not good.I 'm really disappointed and I hope they take it back . It would be perfect if it were n't slippery . And there is no way we should have to scrub and `` break in '' a yoga mat for three months , as the manufacturer suggests . That is bizarre marketing if you ask me . How ` bout they do all that before putting it out for sale ?!
 this mat is soooo overrated . i love the thickness , but it 's super heavy and bulky to carry around . it also is extremely slippery . i get very frustrated when i have to use the ` dookie ' .
 Search online and you 'll find a lot of discussion on how this $ 85 mat is slippery . A yoga mat needs to do 2 things
 I should 've checked this out in a store before purchasing . I ended up selling it on Craigslist and buying a softer one.The mat is just too HARD for my taste . I 've been doing yoga for 30 + years -LRB- I 'm 51 -RRB- and my body needs a thick , cushy mat . I bought a slightly cheaper -LRB- thicker -RRB- Manduka mat that is working just fine .
 The length is amazing on this mat as is the thickness of it but after all that there is nothing positive i can possibly say about it !! I also bought the matching MatWare Sleeve which i had to return since i ended up sending this back as well.I tried everything i read and heard about trying to `` break in '' a mat and to make it stop being slippery but nothing worked on this mat !! Extremely disappointed i am just glad that i was able to return it and get a refund before i broke or cracked a bone or something !! I would never buy again nor would i recommend it .
 My mother is the hardest person to buy presents for . However , she started to take yoga classes last year and really likes it ! So , when Christmas came around I knew exactly what she would like - a yoga mat . I looked on Amazon and this mat seemed to have the best of everything - it 's thick , long , and had great reviews . When I gave it to my mom , she was so excited . Her mood after yoga class was completely different however . She told me that she had the worst experience with this yoga mat . She could n't hold her positions because she was slipping and sliding all over the place . We contacted the company to see why this was and they simply told us that the mat needed 6 months to be `` broken in '' . In my opinion , you should n't have to put up with slipping and sliding for on a mat even if it is a new one . This was a definite disappointment !
 Hate to give this 2 stars unfortunately , here 's why ... It 's the most slippery mat I 've ever done yoga on . As nice as it is otherwise , this makes it almost completely unusable!After quitting smoking and getting better and more regular at yoga classes , I decided to treat myself to a fancy new mat ... the old one was a little slippery -LRB- a 20 $ Tapas -RRB- ... got the black mat , boy was I disappointed ! the rubber , though very firm and comfortable for knees , smells terrible for weeks besides the slipping -LRB- if your palms sweat even slightly -RRB- . Instructions talk about some kind of invisible film you have to scrub off or give a few months to break in . I scrubbed it down 3 times without seeing any difference . Keep in mind too that after scrubbing a product , what if you realize you want to return it ?! Buy this mat only if you plan to buy a towel to put over it -LRB- to avoid slipping -RRB- and are ok with spending the $ $ on what you could have for much less . A particularly embarrassing time in yoga class , after noticing what a hard time I was having holding down dog , the instructor gave me her tattered ' $ 26 ' mat and I made it through class much better.Final thought ... if not for the slipping and scrubbing down issues ... this mat would get 5 stars for comfort and not flapping around as you jumper step . Happy shopping !
 Slippery !!! Be careful !!! I 'm a Asthanga Vidyasa Yoga practicer and I sweat a lot during every practice . I bought the `` manduka blackmat pro '' to try `` the TajMahal of yoga mats '' thinking that it would be wonderful to practice with it . Unhappily , it 's impossible to have a sweating practice because it slips a lot !! More than a regular mat . Do not buy it if you sweat ! I 'm so disappointed that I will return it .
 I have been regularly practicing vinyasa and ashtanga yoga for 10 + years . My old mat wore out , and I decided to save money and break out this mat that my husband previously bought for himself & rarely used . I 've washed it with mat cleaner several times , and tried a sea salt scrub . When I took this mat to class , I could n't even hold warrior 1 without slipping all over the place . It does grip the floor , but I actually thought about ditching the mat and practicing directly on the wood floor , because it seemed like a much better option than this slippery mat . My instructor even pointed out the problems after class , and was suprised to learn that it is a Manduka mat . In her words , `` it really is horrible , '' and I agree 100 % . It is very heavy , but I could deal with it if I was n't slipping in downdog , warrior , triangle , etc. . . I guess I 'll have to switch to the Jade Harmony mat that everyone else in class uses . I like to conserve , and hate to waste money and a mat , but I am unable to tolerate practicing on this mat .
 I feel compelled to review this yoga mat because I am really ticked off . I spent a lot of money on it and wo n't be able to use it for at least a year or maybe never . Please consider what I have to say.I bought this mat because of the raving reviews it typically gets . Granted - it is great from the standpoint of how it performs during practice , durability , etc , etc. . HOWEVER - anybody who purchased this mat must have noticed the extremely strong smell it gives out . It literally stinked up my entire room when I unfolded it . Despite a claim that it is `` non-toxic , '' I did my research and sure enough - it is made with PVC !!!!!!!!!!!!!! PVC is an extremely toxic material used in cars and vinyl shower curtains , among others . The smell that it gives out has been proven harmful to health ! PVC `` off-gassing '' can last for a year or longer , before the product stops emitting the toxic fume.Given that my hands and my face smelled of it after practice , I am done with using it after one time . Laying in childs pose and inhaling the fume just cancels out the benefits of practice , I think . I am not willing to expose myself to toxin inhalation for an hour a day . We have enough harmful materials everywhere to do this electively . WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT .
 I got this for my partner who is a professional yoga teacher . Judging by all the good reviews we though this would be great - durable , lifetime guarantee etc.There are some major problems , however - the first being that this yoga mat does n't work ! I know that sounds silly to say , but it 's true - you need a lot of grip on a yoga mat and this has very little . In fact , it 's no better than a cheapie you can borrow in a studio . You go into downward dog and just start sliding forward ... and that 's before you even start sweating . I 've read online that wiping it with vinegar helps this problem . First , it does not . Second , it makes the mat and you smell lilke vinegar , even after weeks . And third , why should someone have to start `` seasoning '' a mat which just cost 85 -LRB- that 's like $ 130 - so you Americans who got ripped off should n't feel so bad -RRB- ? Finally , the thing is seriously heavy ! Do n't underestimate that unless you plan on never carrying it . Which you may never do sinice you may not be able to use it . My partner prefers using her ancient Jade mat , even though all the jute is shredded and keeps catching her feet and hands.As for the guarantee , that 's only for defects . If you just do n't like it and find it does n't work - forget about it , you 're stuck with it . Like we are ... Verdict
 I have been experiencing LOTS of slipping on my mat ... to the point where i was ready to exchange my mat . I contacted manduka and they explained that the slipping is common during the THREE MONTH BREAK IN PERIOD !!!! They recommned I do 3 sea salt/water treatments on my mat and promised I would be happy after that . In the meantime , I am practing on another mat because I could no longer take compromising my practice . When I use the mat , I actually lay a strap on the top of the mat so i have something to grip and ground down into . i have not tried the mat since i tried the sea salt treatment ... we shall see.however , amazon quickly shipped the product to me ... i beleive i received it within 2 days !
 I bought this mat based on the myriad positive reviews here and from what I 'd heard from fellow yogis . I have been practicing for about 8 years now -LRB- 5 seriously , and became a yoga teacher in Fall 2011 -RRB- and I thought it was time for an upgrade from my ancient Gaiam mat that had gotten me this far.When I received the black mat , I was surprised at how heavy and bulky it was . I know it says the weight in the specs , but I really did n't expect it to be this unwieldy . It 's difficult to roll up -LRB- and unrolls constantly -RRB- , and it does n't fit in standard yoga mat holders -LRB- the cubes at my studio , or my yoga mat cloth carrying case -RRB- . If it had just been big , I could have dealt with it . Now for my review of its performance . First , the mat is quite thick but it 's very hard , so it did n't offer the padding I had hoped for . Second , it 's crazy slippery . After reading some more reviews , I learned that it can take up to 6 months to break in this mat ?! I think that is a ridiculous expectation of the buyer . It was essentially completely unusable for me . I tried it for about 2 weeks -LRB- daily practice -RRB- and gave up . I could n't hold any standing poses or down dog . I did try washing it but that did not decrease the slipping.A note - I sweat very minimally in my practice , so the slipping was NOT from sweating . I could n't even break a sweat when using this mat because I could n't get into the asanas . Perhaps I have sweaty palms or something , but overall I sweat hardly at all -LRB- if at all -RRB- when I practice -LRB- and I do a difficult vinyasa/ashtanga/flow class -RRB- . I will stick with my $ 5 sale mat from REI until it disintigrates . It 's far better than this thing : -LRB- One thing I do want to give 5 stars for is the customer service - it was super easy to return my mat , so thank you for that !
 This mat is a ridiculous rip off ! I can not even use it as it is way too slippery . I have tried everything suggested -LRB- scrubbing , sanding , etc. -RRB- and nothing works . Do n't waste your money .
 I recently started getting into yoga , and decided that I wanted to drop all the middle-of-the-road stuff and jump right to the high-end product . I was also very interested in getting a thicker mat for my knees.I think that for the average yoga practitioner , this product would be just fine . My hands , however , sweat a little more than the average person and doing Adho Mukha Svanasana made me slip in a way that could only be characterized as dangerous.The manufacturer recommended that I rub the mat down with sea salt , which I did many times . I also used mild detergent scrubs and even left it in the sun for several hot days to degrade the `` film '' that comes as a `` part of the manufacturing process . '' Still no dice.The last time that I called the manufacturer , they mentioned that Manduka mats use a `` closed cell '' technology which keeps water out of the mat -LRB- mitigating the need for periodic cleaning -RRB- but necessarily keeps water on the surface of mat . Translation
 I 'm 6 ' 3 '' , and I practice yoga 3x a week . Looking for a good mat , I was recommended to get this one from my instructor.My mat is horrible ... I paid $ 98 and all I do is slide all over the place ! I can not hold a pose nor do I feel comfortable holding a pose because my hands slide , my feet slide . . just horrible . I called manuduka and they said `` we get this a lot from our clients , and tell them all to wash the mat , scrub the mat , and give it time to break in '' well , folks ... I 've had my mat for SEVEN months and still , I slide all over the place!I compared my mat to my instructors mat and they are different - she has had her mat for many years , where mine is new , the manufacturing of the manduka mat has changed , and the mat that I have is HORRIBLE !!! Manduka gave me a bag and a cloth that I can use on top of my mat because of the inconvienence , but when my cloth is dirty and I do not have it in class with me , I slip and slide all over the damn thing . it 's not worth the furstration , time , or energy ! DO NOT BUY THIS MAT !!! And if you do , get ready to slip all over the place!Manduka , you once had a nice mat -LRB- my instructors old one is fabulous -RRB- but that mat I bought in 10/2009 IS HORRIBLE !!!! I 'm sick of hearing `` You have to wait for it to break in '' - screw that , it should be ready to go for $ 98 ! why should I have to wait ?? DO NOT BUY THIS MAT
 I honestly did n't like it , I followed the directions and it kept coming undone.I just ened up using a piece of rope and that worked alot better . The rope is to stiff for the knot to stay
 My father has this release and i used it and liked it so i wanted to get one for myself but when it arrived it was a junior size made for a 4 year old and was not even close to fitting me but if you can get the adult size it is a nice release and is rather in inexpensive .
 You are getting what you pay for with this item . The build quality seems adequate . I have had mine for about a year , but , I have rarely used it because I do not feel like my weapon is secure in this holster . The M7x matrix flops around too much while carrying an XD and does not conceal easily . On the plus side , a Taurus PT145 will fit and does not seem to bounce around as much .
 What a piece of crap . If I could give it 0 stars , I would . I was really excited to get it in the mail , and I fired it up immediately . Unfortunately , I could n't even get it to shuffle 1 deck of cards most of the time , let alone 2 . When it did shuffle , it was lousy , I shuffled a deck a couple of times and got the same card on the bottom twice . Stay away from this and buy a more quality shuffler .
 I bought this controller as well as a San Diego Chargers wireless controller for both my kids for Christmas 06 . All my anticipated excitement was soon squashed by the poor design of the battery compartment . It stacks the AAA batteries in a pyramid , 2 on the base with the 3rd on top . The 3rd battery constantly pops out and is very difficult to keep in . The compartment door itself does not stay closed either further aggrevating the situation . It seems those guys down at Mad Catz could design this with a rechargable battery and docking station . They say they redesigned newer controllers without the vibrating feature to save battery power . Should have spent that R&D time redesigning the battery compartment issue . Another issue is that the controller symbols do not light up , and if they did , it would be an added bonus . All and all a great idea , just needs some tweaking ...
 I bought this small 10 inch sprint ring by accident , and I am disappointed . I knew how great the 13 inch ring is , but the small ring is no better than my standard frisbee . I also find it very hard to throw , it tends to tilt over to one side and drop down . I tried to follow the instructions and bend the ring slightly , but it does n't help much.So my recommendation is
 Nowhere on your site did it give the dimensions of this disc . Consequently , the two that I ordered were too big for my dog and it isnot worth paying for shipping it back . Luckily , I ordered one of the smaller ones so we can play with my dog until she gets too many bite marks on it . My bad .
 I normally love Aerobie Sprint Rings because they 're so easy to throw perfectly and they fly a long way . This one was defective though . It is n't balanced correctly and it 's very hard to throw it without having it pull over to the left and then drop down to the ground . I have to adjust the way I throw it and compensate for the imbalance and it still does n't fly as well . This ring was less expensive than others I saw on the internet and this is probably why .
 We threw the disc for a half hour on grass . It did n't het any concrete , trees , or walls and it just tore as if it was made of paper . What a waste of money .
 It works ok , but the company is a bit flaky , they offer a rebate and then does n't accept invoices and wants you to tear up the box 's to get the UPC code because they dont provide them anywhere else.I would n't trust a company like this again , I will buy my hand loading equipment elsewhere from now on.I just found out it doesnt line up for pistol cases .
 Opened box and saw how small this breaker is . I dont think it well hold up to marine use.I might send it back
 I had purchased your battery box just before I purchased this item . First of all when purchasing that battery box , I thought I was getting a battery with it . Also I did not know that the box had a circuit breaker built in . So your tricky wording -LRB- or lack of it -RRB- worked ! You got me to bite ! . Sold me some thing I did n't need , which will cost me more to send it back than it 's worth , and leaves me with an empty battery box . Go figure!All is well though , I bought a battery , placed it into the battery box I got from you and went fishing . We vacationed at a lake in Eastern Washington , using the Minn-Kota motor I also bought from Amazon , and caught a lot of fish . Oh , but the wife caught more ! OOps!So the sting of buying the separate circuit breaker , has gone away . Probably will give it away to my son or one of my brothers. : -RRB-
 About six months ago I bought a purpleLite mat -LRB- 85 inches -RRB- and was happy until part of it came off the mat . I called the company and they stated that they would not deal with me because I purchased it from Amazon . Then Amzon told me they would not replace the mat . Now I 'm stuck with a mat that is falling apart . Buyer beware !!!
 Yet another example of expensive crap pushed by slick marketing . Brazenly advertised as `` slip resistant , even when wet from perspiration '' this mat turns into a skating rink with the first drop of sweat . Just notice how much discussion on fighting `` slippage '' is on Manduka 's own web-page -LRB- the FAQ section for instance -RRB- . Unabashed , they continue to both promote their `` non-slipping '' product and suggest that slipping is actually good for building your core . Watch out - people with no shame . Do n't waste your money !
 i coach a boys travel basketball team u13 . these pinnies were too small for them . Not for men over say 5 ' 7 &#34; .
 Stay away from this thing if you can . On a stock 10/22 rifle it shoots 8 '' high at the lowest adjustment . Truglow needs to make the front sight post a lot higher . Definately do not recommend this unit .
 After only 2 weeks on my rifle the front sight broke . That is the second one to do that . It is not very durable .
 This is the second time I purchased a set of TruGlo sights and have been disappointed.They advertize them as being CNC machine ; giving the impression they are steel.They may be CNC machined , but they are almost entirely plastic.I wo n't make that mistake again ...
 The end sight did not fit the notch on the nozzle . I am going to have to file it and sand it to get it to fit . I even took it to a gun store and they told me it just does not fit right.I recomend buying anything for a Ruger from Ruger , or its just wrong . Do n't buy this unless you want a problem.Neil
 Probably would be great if it fit my 10/22 ! Photo shows dovetail but that 's not what you get . The fine print says &#34; carbine &#34; , which is what I have but I have a see through picatinny rail and was hoping to replace my old dovetail.Now I 'm stuck with a 30 something sight I ca n't use : -RRB- Live and learn
 I drove for an hour with the cooler plugged in , and it did not get any cooler inside . It might keep frozen things from fully thawing , but a regular plastic cooler would do it too . Not worth the money .
 Received the cooler - it works fine.Couple things to watch out for - no manual in the box.That is odd - toothbrush comes with one . . AC adapter - shown on the web site - not in the box.There is word ` optional ' on the box near the picture.No phone number or any other indication on how to order it.Not the best shopping experience .
 I purchased this to use in wetbar area so I do n't have to keep mixers in the kitchen refrigerator . Unfortunately , the unit only cools to about 55 degrees , which is n't low enough for orange juice . The room is about 78 degrees , so it should cool to around 40 degrees . It does n't . I guess when it says that it cools `` up to 45 degrees cooler than the ambient air '' it means that is the maximum ... of course it might only cool 25 degrees cooler .
 This seemed to be a nice product that appeared to have been made with a good grade of quality . However , I received a defective fridge . The cord immdiately became hot and I smelled smoke . Because this fridge was a gift to my husband for his office -LRB- work -RRB- , it was too much of an electrical fire risk to keep . Amazon responded with an immediate refund .
 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!! I recently purchased this product and it 's a greatDISPLAY SWORD , but nothing else . I e-mailed the manufacturer to get them to take down the BATTLE READY claim they had , saying I tested it and came up with a bent handle . They responded with `` well if you are not happy with the product return it for a refund . '' claiming That I BROKE THE SWORD ! I even went as far as reporting them to the better business bureau and they are sticking to their claim that I broke the sword and should return the sword for a refund . For the frustration I had to go to I strongly recommend NEVER doing business with Sunny and Omi sales.AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE !!
 All 6 pairs were itchy enough to be distracting during a run.On the bright side , I did n't have any trouble with the seams.I tossed these on the top shelf of my closet and bought a 6-pack of balega running socks , which are great .
 In spite of what the description says , these socks are cosmetic seconds . They are clearly marked as such . They have defects . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !
 These are very light weight socks , but they are intended for biking . For running , the toe seam is too thick for comfort and will chafe right at the knuckle behind your toe nail . They are okay for walking , or gym work , but not for any exercise that involves foot strikes . Despite the light weight , they are no less hot after exertion , and there is no wicking effect as there is in higher quality running sock .
 These rod holders are awful . I bought four of them and within the first week of having them three of the four broke . they are made very cheap and i will never buy them again . i do not recomend this product for anyone .
 Even with the most extreme adjustments , holster will not readily release FNX40 pistol for which it was recommended . Indent for trigger housing appears to be too deep , requiring much more than acceptable effort to remove it from the holster . Highly recommend a different holster for the FNX40 .
 The holster is well made and very comfortable on your hip . The back clip is curved for good comfort and is even slightly padded . It feels great on your hip . The only problem is , the gun does not draw well -LRB- if at all at times -RRB- . The is an indent -LRB- as you can see in the photo -RRB- that hooks to the trigger guard when you holster the weapon . This is designed to help keep the gun from falling out accidently . The problem is , that due to the shape of the indent , the weapon slides in easily and hooks , but does not release without pulling like mad which then requires you putting your other hand down on the holster so that it does not pull up as well . There is an adjusting screw that is supposed to adjust the tension on the catch , but even with the screw completely removed , the same problem exists . So if you are looking for a holster to carry a weapon where you do n't have to worry about drawing it or do n't even plan on using it , this is a good holster to carry a locked down weapon . HOWEVER , If you plan on using the weapon -LRB- say at a range or something -RRB- or want a holster where you can draw in a defensive situation , keep on looking as this is not what you want .
 It seems to be a decent holster , fits comfortably , probably works fine with the PX4 for which it is explicitly designed . But there are serious issues with the FNX-9 for which it is also marketed.The FNX-9 frame extends beyond the bottom of the holster and with it the last two `` teeth '' of the accessory rail . If you apply any torque on the draw , a rail tooth will catch on the bottom of the holster . As a result either 1 -RRB- the gun does not draw or 2 -RRB- the gun is drawn with the holster still attached.If the `` sheath '' into which the frame fit was a bit longer , this holster would be a much better fit for the FNX-9 . As is , the product is difficult to recommend for FNX owners .

 I bought this tricycle for my 2 1/2 year old daughter because it was small enough for her to reach the pedals . The trike is adorable , but unfortunately it 's cheaply made , unstable , and dangerous . First , the wheels are made of cheap plastic , not rubber as advertised . After paying nearly $ 50.00 for this trike , I expected the quality of materials to be better . As soon as my daughter started pedaling , the trike tipped over and she skinned her knee . I encouraged her to try again and again , and the trike tipped over every single time . The tricycle is top heavy , the back wheels are too close together , and the seat sits too high ... all of these variables make the trike completely unstable , especially for very young children who have n't mastered the art of balancing a bike -LRB- which is the demographic this product is targeting -RRB- . After falling off the trike repeatedly , my daughter wants nothing to do with it . I 'm very disappointed and returning this item ASAP for a refund .
 This trike is designed for children not old enough to ride on it.Initially , I thought this looked like a quality toy , but upon further examination , it became obvious that the pedals are set too close together . There is not enough leverage for my 4-year old girl to turn them over.My 2-year old loves to get on it and can scoot himself by pushing on the floor . Most of the time the older pusher the younger and then the pedals become a hazard.This toy is cute , but it should n't be considered as an entry level tricycle .
 After using this I would have to agree with other reviews , look at something else . The problem with this strap is that the quick release buckles slip apart when you try to get it on tight , which I want when I 'm traveling with my car . Other than that the straps are ok , but that for it 's intended purpose makes them sub par .
 The plastic piece is cheap , mine broke when I was tightening it . Also the plastic piece does n't do a very good job of keeping it tight . The product sucks and not worth buying unless you want to throw your money away .
 I returned this because it would n't hold . No matter how I routed the strap it slipped very easily . I would n't recommend it .
 Purchased the straps to keep the tire from flopping around . I guess it will do that but I am afraid to use the strap because it is so ruff that it will scratch the paint on the frame .
 The dimentions given in the Product Description are for the outside of the case including the Base , my bobbleheads would not fit . I feel that I wasted my time .
 11-1-12Over 15 years ago I bought MrTuffy tire liners for my road and mountain bikes.They installed with ease and reinstalled into numerous subsequent tires , no problems . Last December I purchased replacement MrTuffy-road orange-and justrecently attempted to install them . I found these to be less rigid , more smoothand slippery than the originals . Because of those characteristics I was unableto effect installation of the liners ! Do n't buy this defective junk !
 My brother and I both bike to classes -LRB- about a 1 mile round trip -RRB- . We both purchased these tire liners to prevent the flats that have been happening at least every 2 weeks . Well , these did n't help at all . The thorns still get through to the inner tube and we both end up changing flat tires about every 1-2 weeks.So in this situation , it 's a worthless product .
 The plastic these tire liners are made from is too soft to keep a thorn out . Tried it with black berry and rose thorns from my yard and easily pushed them right through . I have a set of older Mr. Tuffy liners that resist these thorns but I wanted a wider one for the tires on my bike . These new ones are useless.NOT RECOMMENDED
 It would take a hammer to get a nail through these things . However , if you run them in a 2 inch wide Mtn bike tire you are wishful thinkin ' . Might as well buy a bullet proof neck tie and hope for the best.They are made for the 1.5 &#34; tire on a bike that does n't lean too far on the sidewall .
 Within 24 hours of my bike shop installing Mr. Tuffy tire liners , I got two flat tires . One flat tire occurred after riding 1/2 mile , and the other occurred after riding 1/5 mile . In each case , the hole was next to the valve on the inner tube . I figured out that the tire liners were making the inner tube shift inside the tire , and it was pulling against the valve , and holes were forming because the rubber next to the valve was being stretched . When I called up ProPatch -LRB- the manufacturer -RRB- , I got someone named Ken on the line . Ken sounded incredulous about my theory , yet there is no other explanation . There is n't anything sharp on the inside of the rims that would have caused the holes.Within two weeks I had gotten two more flats , and in each case the hole was next to the valve ; so I had the tire liners removed.The total cost of my experiment with Mr. Tuffy tire liners was about $ 85 , but my actual cost was only $ 35 because the bike shop refunded the price of the liners -LRB- but not the labor -RRB- and changed two of the flat tires for free . Ken had told me to contact him if I had any further problems , so I sent ProPatch an email . Ken apparently answers the emails as well as the phone , and he wrote back offering to send me free inner tubes and better tire liners -LRB- I did n't ask for them ; he offered -RRB- . Well , two and a half weeks passed and nothing arrived , so I emailed Ken to remind him that he had promised to send me those items . Three more weeks passed , and nothing arrived . I then called Ken on the phone , and he said that he had given instructions to his `` aide '' to mail me the stuff . He then promised again to send me the inner tubes and tire liners . After two weeks , however , nothing had arrived , so I posted this negative review . I waited one more week and then wrote to Ken , telling him about this review . I thought that it might prompt him into action . But no . Nothing ever arrived , neither a response to my note , nor the items he promised . -LRB- I gave Ken the number of my bike shop so he could verify that I actually got 4 flats , but he never called them . -RRB- Needless to say , I find this all very astonishing . First , tire liners are supposed to prevent flat tires , not CAUSE them . Second , for the company to offer to compensate me with free inner tubes , and then repeatedly renege on that promise , is just mind-blowing . I 've never known a legitimate company to behave this way.While I was at the bike shop , someone told me a similar story of someone who got multiple flats after installing tire liners , so this kind of thing has happened before . I now believe that Ken 's claim that he never heard of such a thing was just a lie -LRB- he is apparently the company 's liar-in-chief -RRB- . After 30 years or so of making tire liners , I ca n't be the first customer to have this problem , or to complain about it . But why ProPatch would promise to send me stuff , and then never send it , is something I 'll never understand.Let me add that the tire liners are soft , rubbery strips , not the hard strips that you might imagine would be needed to stop glass and thorns . Frankly , I think they do nothing more than to add a little thickness to the tires . I 'll never know if they work , however , because the tire liners themselves gave me flats . Maybe they will work better for you .
 I bought this item thinking it was similar to another massage product from Homedics -LSB- Homedics TherapistSelect Shiatsu Massaging Cushion With Moving Massage Mechanism -LRB- Model # SBM-200 -RRB- -RSB- . I should have read the packaging more closely because this item did not have any of the Shiatsu-like mechanisms.The first thing I noticed about the product was that it smelled quite funny -LRB- kind of like glue -RRB- . I noticed this was a complaint about the above mentioned item as well on other reviews . After plugging it in -LRB- with it 's too-short power cord -RRB- , I tried it out . The mat pretty much just vibrates with different intensities . The main feature is its neck massager . That pretty much just rolls around and it did not feel at all comfortable to both me and my wife.On the good side , it does look nice and feels like reasonably good material.However , for the price , I believe one can find something much better . Items like the Thera Cane would be more worth the money.We 'll be definitely returning this .
 I had read the first review , but went ahead and ordered it anyway as this was the exact model my wife asked for.first i ordered it on 12-21 with the next day air option to ensure delivery by 12-23 . fat chance ! i received it 12-27 a full week after ordering . when it didnt arrive on 12-24 i went to wally world -LRB- walmart -RRB- and picked up a $ 39 massager which had several motors for the upper back shoulders -LRB- total 9 -RRB- just to have something under the tree . upon arrival of the homedics , not only did it smell very bad , which was understated by the previous review , but was uncomfortable especially the neck part . -LRB- which was the reason for choosing this model -RRB- and was underpowered compared to the $ 39 model at walmart.we have a homedics hand massager which we love , i guess this is one time the higher priced item was NOT better.the control unit was also a better quality than that of the homedics unit.we returned the homedics and can not recommend it.look else where .
 Search high and low before buying this seemingly high quality indoor , gravity-based , no-screw-needed bike wall-rack for my limited-space condo . Made a mistake for not set it up before the return window . Now I ca n't return it for refund . The vertical construction is of thick tubing and anti-scratch surface treatment that draw me to buy it in the first place . but the bike hooks left so much to be desired . In its single-most fault , it is ONLY for horizontal beam bikes -LRB- male -RRB- . If you have the female or child bikes with slanted body beam , you 're screwed . The weight of the bike will damage and bent the horizontal hook on one placement . I adjusted different positions trying to make it work but it wo n't . It simply does not work with slanted body-frame bikes . After the discovery , I checked out other wall racks again and noticed many others feature separate left/right hooks that can adjust heights to accommodate slanted body-frame , and they cost half the price of this one by Saris . I 'm deeply disappointed . In Saris 's product photo , both bikes are horizontal beam bikes . If you have a slanted body-frame bike , this is not for you . Stay away . I hope very much that I can get this purchase refunded . If Saris is able to offer me refund -LRB- even partial -RRB- , I will remove this negative review .
 Used on S&W 17-4 , Buckmark , and Savage 22 rifle . Every attempt was different , some by 1/2 pound or more ! We know from a trigger test done last year during a 4-H competition that the Savage was pulling just under 3 pounds . This scale pulled it at 3 1/2 to 4 pounds ! Also said the S&W pulled single action , was heavier than the Buckmark ! LOL -LRB- people who know these guns realize how funny that is ! -RRB- When you need legal triggers for competition , this item can not be considered . Returned item , and looking for an accurate scale .
 I bought these skates at ShopKo today and due to their closing sales , am unable to return the item . So I will rate it instead.Price paid
 I have used a regular stick-clip before but mine was in bad shape . I decided to upgrade to the Squid Clip and bought an inexpensive painters pole to attach it . I have followed the instructions as have my climbing buddies . We can not seem to get the gate to fully open and stay that way for the clip . By the time we get the clip to the hanger , the draw falls as the gate was not open far enough.I am open to suggestions ... please .
 I bought this watch as Christmas Gift for my son . The second hand fell off the first day . Super cheaply made !!! NFL Kids ' FF-DAL Future Star Series Dallas Cowboys Black WatchSon was very disappointed . Do not buy !!!!
 Thought it was a good deal but you get what ou get for . It broke ten min after my son put it on . The pins fell out . HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
 The cart is nice and was easy to assemble , but it had a key difference from the item that was pictured . We have gone through a few racks and found that where the bars that hold the balls are screwed in , eventually gets stripped . We wanted this item because in the picture it shows the bolt going through frame so it can be replaced rather than stripping them .
 The pillow is great to just set somewhere and look at , but when it comes to actual use , it wo n't withstand but a couple months -LRB- the stuffing bunches inside the pillow and becomes limp -RRB- . Also , I think my husband and I may both be allergic to SOMETHING in the pillow . We both developed small , rash-like red bumps that would itch horribly shortly after the pillow arrived . I originally thought we had bed bugs , but after several sheet/blanket washes with no relief , we finally removed the pillow from around the bed -LRB- we wo n't even let it sit on the bed now -RRB- and within a few days , we were back to normal .
 I have had the battery replaced but the watch has stopped working again . It looks very high end and feels solid , if it worked it would be great .
 gun case was affordable , fits an AR-15 or Tactical shotgun perfectly -LCB- no scope -RCB- . Has tough exterior and smooth interior plus shoulder carry strap . I use Bore Store treated sock on weapon which also fits in case . Buy It !
 When I received the duck call in the mail , the whole packaging was open and broken apart . Was not happy about that . Atleast the duck call works .
 This DVD does n't play on a regular DVD player . Since I 've also had the problem with another of this company 's DVDs , I assume its a decision and not a defect .
 their were ok exept the Xsmall was still to big . and they shrink once you put them in the dryer .
 Be careful when buying - it has to hang on a stud so if where you want to put it does not have a stud , this item will not be useful to you . Also did not understand how this little thing would hold 2 bags and shoes . I returned the item because it would not work in the area that I wanted it for .
 This felt like heavy quality material and it really is.The stitching is low quality though.After one day of use the stitching fell apart causing the holsterhalf of this product to no longer be useable . The belt andpistol magazine holster still work but the pistol holster itself can not be worn any longer.PROS : Heavy materialSpace for 4 magazines and 1 pistolCONS : Poor stitchingFell apart after one day of use
 Not happy , nothing like I thought . No instructions , just came in a plastic bag , no markings , nothing ! Well be return to Amazon . Piece of junk !
 The build quality of this product is pretty poor but you do get what you paid for ; which was n't much . Your better off buying something else . While my M&P 40 fits relatively well inside this holster , it does n't sit well on my thigh . The weapon does n't stay close to your body and just jingles around . To much free flow and movement , my weapon never felt secure inside while I was carrying . If I had a second chance I would not of bought this product .
 Bought this set up thinking it would work with my paintball gear . After 2 games the holster broke and i wound up losing one of my 20 dollar mags . i recommend looking for something else .
 This holster is not worth the money and it wo n't even hold my Beretta 92FS 9mm . The straps are no longer working and my gun is dangling all over the place . If you are a Police Officer or member of the SWAT Team , please do n't waste your money in this holster . I have wasted my time and money with this poorly made holster . I have nothing more to say , but `` frustrated '' with this product . A total piece of J. ...
 All in all you get what you pay for ... the holster is crap . . the drop leg magazine platform is good ... I took the holster apart used an old hip holster and added what was missing on my old one with the Velcro etc. to make a great holster , out of one crappy holster to customize my good one , to an awesome holster ...
 I order this thigh holster because of the price and that it had a cool left leg magazine holster , knowing that a low price meant it would most likely be terrible quality . Sure enough , I tried it on and it fit nice , but the pistol holster did n't hold my Beretta 92FS very well , plus I put a couple mags in the cheap Velcro magazine pouches on my left leg and one of them fell completely off due to bad stitching . So I returned the item the next day , do not buy this if you want to use it for real ammo and firearms , btu I 'm thinking a lightweight airsoft gun and mags would fit fine .
 Having read all of the positive reviews and recognizing the NcStar brand name , I decided to give this holster a shot and extremely let down ! I decided to head back and check out the reviews to see what the difference is , and it 's quite simple . Everyone who I see that says this is a good product was using the holster to carry a standard barrel length 9MM pistol , and I purchased this intended for a Kingman KT Eraser paintball marker which is similar to a 40 or 45 cal long barrel pistol like an HK or Desert Eagle . I 'm sure my buddies got a great laugh when they saw me walk out with this strap attached to me and a 45 Desert Eagle ` esque pistol sticking 5 inches from the top of the holster ! Before we actually started our scenario I took off the holster and kept the pistol in the side compartment of my pack.So for anyone looking for a cheap holster for a weapon above the 9MM family , look elsewhere . If you 're just shooting 9MM or < 38 -LRB- 38 short barrel/snub nose might fit -RRB- go for it !
 it 's completely plastic and looks it , really cheap looking that is . And it does n't come with instructions in the box .
 Does n't work for me , did n't fit any of my guns even the mag pouches . very awkward and uncomfortable , does n't lay right . I would n't recommend this item to anyone . save your money sure wish I had n't ordered this thing
 I bought this with the intention of using it for tactical and survival purposes . I took it out with me into the Florida woods around Forth White for a training and survival exercise , and after a simple three days of simple patrols the stitching started coming undone . It fell apart at the most important seams
 we have now gotten 2 of these and they both have broken as soon as we took it out of the box ...
 very cheap thing in terms of material and shape . It feels like several big chunks put together . I would not be satisfied with it even with recreation purpose so I returned it back . But it 's reasonable for the price though .
 I know what you 're thinking
 When I received my item , I found it quite counterintuitive in how it worked , and it had so much Velcro that it just was tedious to make adjustments to . But that was just trying it on . When I actually wore it with my whole costume the holster busted putting it on my leg . It also would not stay in place on my leg -LRB- before the thread snapped -RRB- . I was very disappointed in this item and do not recommend it.Also , it busted my cap gun ...
 I , was pretty unhappy with the product , It came with a stain on it and looks to be used when it says it is a brand new product . It feels extremely bulky and heavy . Overall very unsatisfied
 This leg drop set up is not molle ... and the leg straps are singles ... basically this thing flaps all over the place and you are stuck with it in the configuration it comes in ... You can not swap anything out -LRB- like the 3 ammo pouches I do n't need on the left hand drop -RRB- and you can not change this up to make a left handed rig unless you want a leg mounted cross-draw -LRB- fairly useless -RRB- . I was going to return this and amazon said do n't bother and just refunded my money.If you are serious about getting a leg drop set up and already have a tac-vest , then order a higher quality unit . If you 're looking for a low-cost , solid set-up ... then get the UTG rig that comes as a molle vest with 2 molle leg drops and then you can arrange the pouches , etc however you like them.My 2 cents .
 i got this product because i wanted the mag leg strap and its perfect for the price once again . the mag pouch slipped onto my leg perfectly and because its a mag pouch its simple and easy just need to wear in . . you also get a belt which is cool but really not practical for the weight if you have three mags in and a pistol on . which leads me to the pistol holster . its small and simple fits snug . i will say if you have a tactical or bigger this probably isnt the product for you . fits maybe glock 17 or xd 4 '' youll just have to wear it in a little . all and all not bad
 This pedometer was the only one I have ever owned except for the freebee I got at McDonald 's about a year ago when they had that promotion , so my perspective is not great . What I do know is that after I programmed this one and took it for a test walk around the house at a normal pace , it was showing that I walked almost 3 times as much as I did . I counted 13 steps ; the pedometer showed 42 . This flies directly in the face of the company claims that '' ` intelligent ' mechanism can distinguish the step-count from movements not related to walking/jogging , which it does not include when caluclating distance , time and calories . '' So maybe the distance and all that is correct , but it 's still confusing to have it calculating so many extra steps . It is easy to use , and I purchased this one for my mother so she could listen -LRB- good volume , though no volume control -RRB- to her results without finding her reading glasses . No light up display for night so voice is good for that too . Bottom line is that if you really want to know your steps or have confidence in your pedometer , look for one besides this .
 FitBall Balance Disc #FBBDNo instructions included with the item . However , plenty of disclaimer information was included in the package . Phoned the company and the associate with whom I spoke was helpful but indicated there are no written instructions for inlating or using the item . I then took the item to my physical therapist who had the proper pump for inflating the item . The therapist was unable to inflate it . Unhappily , I am returning the item to The Therapy Connection at HPMS .
 Not as close to using a fitness ball as i had hoped . I bought this cause my chiropracter said it 's like sitting on a ball while i 'm at work so it will help with my core . the thing is really uncomfortable to sit on and doesnt help . I ended up buying an exercise ball to sit on at work .
 We bought this watch thinking we got a great deal . But be advised , you get what you pay for . At first , after only a month , the battery lead became detached , and we had to send it in twice for repairs . We had to wait a month to get it back and pay for shipping . Once again , the timer has now quit and now the watch is full of condensation . So much for water proof ! This watch is too expensive for the headache that comes with it FREE ! I will never buy another Movado .
 This might be fine if purchased for less than $ 10 out of a clearance rack in your local Walmart . It is certainly not worth more than that , and not useful for photographers at all . I 'm disgusted with Adorama -LRB- purchased through Amazon -RRB- for stocking this junk . I 've seen better stitchwork on seventh grade home economics projects . The zippers stick , and the larger pockets bag when anything larger than a pack of gum is placed in them . I would n't trust the pockets for carrying any camera gear , except perhaps lens paper .
 Vest got to me super fast BUT I ordered a XXL and even though the packing slip clearly stated Khaki XXL the notes said `` shipped 1 LARGE.I am a big guy , the large they sent is way too small , I look like Baby Huey and ca n't even zip it closed , Sending it back for the right size but I note the Khaki is no longer offered on the page . If they are out it 's refund time
 I ordered this vest for my photo gear , because it keeps lenses and filters and accessories close at hand better than lugging a camera bag when you 're on the move quickly . You would think it would be perfect , and it would be . Except that the one I received , -LRB- a `` Hummer '' brand with a dorky looking silhouette of a Hummvee sewn into it -RRB- was made from khaki nylon . And every seam in the vest is fraying , shedding profuse amounts of fine nylon cruft all over the place . Nylon thread that works its way into your lenses and camera body.Manufacture quality is totally unacceptable for photo work . Maybe it 's great for weekend warriors who want to imagine they drive Hummers , but basically junk for anyone who cares for their gear .
 Very poor quality ... had to send it back for a replacement ... the replacement came back and was also poor quality .
 Got two of these from a different vendor for my wife and me to use as photo vests . Lots of nice pockets , but the material frays at all the seams and fuzzes up . A major irritant for photo purposes . Also , one of the inside pocket zippers froze in the locked position after one day . Big problem as that pocket had our passports in it . Ended up splitting the zipper and expected to see that it was jammed with material/threads . It was n't , it was just frozen in the closed position . No teeth seemed to be broken or misaligned . Overall I like the design with lots of pockets , but the material makes it unsuitable for photo use in my view . I 'll write the zipper issue off as a weird failure , but the material fraying is a show stopper for me .
 The seams on large pocket frayed after first time worn . The design is good but workmanship is not .
 bought one of these vests from a different vendor on the net ; I 'm very disappointed , this piece of junk is worth about ten bucks at the most . Extremely thin , it will fall apart within very short time . Stay away from Humvee vests .
 Bought 3 of these and none of them are actually round . Made in China junk . Pay more and get a round ball .
 This is definitely not an indoor soccer ball . It bounces like a handball . Futsal or indoor soccer balls are suppose to stick to the the ground . I was very disappointed with this product . If you 're looking for a legitimate indoor -LRB- futsal -RRB- soccer ball . This is NOT the one to buy . Good thing that Amazon.com 's returning policy is very good . But I 'm still waiting for the UPS driver come and pick up the product .
 I was so excited when it arrived . BUt , it would n't hold air and I 'm still getting the run around weeks later from the shipper ATAFA about returning it .
 The description said they were 1 &#34; . What they sent was .850 size . I am sending back to get the right size .
 I checked out the Bell website for sizing instructions and I find this helmet is HUGE . Way too big . It does n't fit very well -LRB- too loose -RRB- and it 's just ridiculously large sitting on the head .
 Because I could purchase it for low price than bought it in Japan , I decided purchase it at this site.However , quality does not reach the level that I can be satisfied with.At first it was not clean molding of a shell and am rickety . -LRB- There is not a problem on practical use -RRB- In addition , a color is slightly purple blue instead of bright blue such as a photograph.What I do not return goods to is because I do not like that return charges are necessary.I am not satisfied with this article .
 I bought this watch on Amazon as a like-new condition used watch and had a really interesting experience . Please allow me to share it with you.The Movado sports automatic I ordered arrived in pretty good condition . No booklet , no papers but did n't have the see through back . `` Interesting '' , I thought . `` I wonder if it is a slightly different model ? '' I took it to an authorized dealer who opened the back and revealed a low end quartz movement with a plastic retainer -LRB- not that Movado 's quartz movements are vastly different , but I was buying an automatic -RRB- . The dealer said he had to seize and destroy the article , but after begging with promises to contact Movado , the police and Amazon along with a bit of forceful resistance I was allowed to leave with the article.I contacted Amazon at least a dozen times and got automated responses.I called Amazon and got their call center in India . Try that some time if you are really bored and want to waste some time.I contacted Movado who let me know that I should only purchase Movado articles from authorized Movado resellers and that they were not the least bit interested in preventing the sale of Movado counterfeit goods on Amazon . -LRB- Note
 The product is great ! The problem is the it takes 3-5 weeks to get the item when it lists as `` IN STOCK ''
 I am not a novice fisher woman . I purchased this line for Muskie fishing . This line was the worst line I have used . I had more wind tangles than any other line . I tie a uni-knot with all lures so have not lost lures , but the tangles were frequent . This was NOT user error . I know how to spool a reel and use proper tension.I also tried the 20lb mono and had the same results . Solution ? I switched to 15lb power pro -LRB- braided -RRB- and really like the line . The spiderwire line gets an F - try power pro instead . Better results even when using plastics with no weight !
 i have been using it for about 6 months it wind knot easily , looses it color on your hand green stuff , it fray out and burst easily an i had to change my line

FOR SOME REASON THE CABLE FLEX SYSTEM IS BEING REFERENCED WITH A DVD CALLED '' THE ISOMETRIC TOTAL BODY WORKOUT '' WHICH IS BEING SENT IN PLACE OF THE CABLE FLEX THAT IS PICTURED . IF ANYONE TRIES TO BUY THIS ITEM AND RECEIVES THE SAME THING , SAVE YOURSELF SOME TROUBLE AND JUST GET THE REFUND . YOU DO N'T WANT AN EXCHANGE JUST TO FIND OUT THAT THEY SEND YOU THE SAME THING YOU JUST MAILED BACK TO THEM .
 Not as pictured ! I expected the entire product as pictured but received a DVD only that was not even the correct DVD ! Very disappointing !
 This DVD was pretty disappointing . The moves were not that great and the instructor got on my nerves so it was hard for me to get into the various workouts . I kept thinking if he says `` HANG IN THERE '' one more time I will HANG MYSELF ! Hopefully this DVD will benefit someone else but it did absolutely nothing for me .
 Like others I received a single DVD no cable flex . Save your self the hassle of having to return the DVD . Look else where if you want a cable flex .
 All that arrived , even with ordering multiple times was a DVD , that is not what is advertised or appropiate to the price !! Amazon has to get their act together to get this worked out so that the merchandise/equipment ships as well as the DVD !!
 What I ordered was not what I was sent . What I received was a DVD for body toning and sculpting . I am deeply dissapointed with this transaction and I will never use importcds or amazon again . Since all of my efforts to resolve this issue has been unsuccessful , I will gladly send the item received back to importcds in exchange for a refund . I have one more option , which is to call you at your customer service number , in order to resolve this matter . Otherwise , I will not be ordering anything from your company or 2nd party companies .
 I was sold on the idea of a grill and stove together , however : - Coleman said its built to last but the top and sides are a little flimsy.-The lid does not stay up by itself , at least one on the side shelves has to be up to hold the lid . You will probably need both side shelves up to hold the lid otherwise the lid will fold all the way back - thus you have no shelves.-The way the shelves hold up the lid work for a while -LRB- using both shelves , now I have no shelves -RRB- but will not last , specially using one shelf to hold up the top , the shelf easily disconnects from the lid and slams down.-Connection to the tank . The picture does not clearly show it , but there is a thin tube running from the side rear of the unit to the propane tank . So you fold up the grill real nice but you got this tube that is sticking out the side like 6 '' or so - suddenly the grill is not so compact !! So you need to remove the tube every single time to prevent breakage-and I know its going to get lost between uses.-The burner - big grill area , little burner .
 I received the stove today . Upon opening and inspecting it , the `` oil pan '' area right underneath the grill is full of holes . Some of the holes look rusty . The surface supposed to be a nice and smooth finish . This was obviously a bad piece of sheet metal that should n't have been used in the manufacturing process . I 'm going to return it and have Amazon ship me a new unit . Buyer beware ! I 'm going to upload some photos so hopefully Amazon wo n't reship this unit to another customer .
 I bought this product based upon the reputation of Coleman products , having purchased many of their camping items in the past . I was very disappointed in the quality of this made in CHINA product , especially the poor design and cheap fabrication of the side wind shields and the cover . I used the product only one time and the rivets which support the hinges on the cover failed and the cover fell off . Additionally , the design of the arm which holds the propane tank raises issues about its safe use .
 I was really happy with my Coleman PerfectFow Insta Start Grill Stove for about 1.5 camping seasons.That all changed when I took the grill out a few weeks ago and needed to cook a bunch of hashbrowns . I brought out my griddle and placed the it on top of the grill and the burner and proceeded to cook the hashbrowns . About 10 minutes later , I finished cooking and took the griddle off of the stove and found that the grill had actually melted and bent down into a warped unusable -LRB- and probably toxic -RRB- piece of metal . I can only assume that the griddle reflected enough heat back down at the stove ... in the process it also melted the insta-start button and warped the controls of the stove . Unfortunately , Amazon 's return policy has expired , so gon na see what Coleman will do about it.In conclusion , it seems that this stove is only meant for cooking open air , without any pots/pans on top of the grill ... so unless you NEED a grill for burners/steaks - would recommend getting a two burner stove as they provide a little more flexibility .
 First , sorry for the length of this review , however , It contains correspondence from Coleman about the weld burn-through marks in -LRB- perhaps -RRB- ALL of this model 's stoves . I have not yet used this stove for cooking but only tested the burners so far -LRB- they worked -RRB- ... so this review is mostly concerning the weld marks.I purchased one of the Coleman PerfectFlow InstaStart Grill stoves 2-3 weeks ago . After opening it , I saw the two sets of 3 ` holes ' or spots/marks in the grill basin side of the stove . If I can , I 'll attach another picture of these marks in the customer photos section -LRB- I think there was already one there -RRB- . I contacted Amazon for an exchange . It 's the first time I 've ever done a return with Amazon . They did an excellent job of that . I received the replacement and ... well , the following email notes with Coleman Customer Service will explain the rest . --------------------- Hi Ashley -LRB- Coleman Customer Service -RRB- , -LRB- 05/02/2012 -RRB- As I mentioned on the phone , I purchased this stove from Amazon about a week and a half ago -LRB- along with 2 other Coleman products -RRB- . The stove had defects in the bottom of the grill area . I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement . I received the replacement this morning , and the replacement has the exact same defects along with minor scratches/abrasions on the same ` formed ' metal sheet.I 've attached the 3 photos you asked for . -LRB- She wanted a photo of the ` damage ' , the receipt , and the incident # written on the stove -RRB- . Thank you for your help in getting this resolved.E --------------------- *** I was sent a replacement from Coleman -LRB- very quickly -RRB- . When I received it , it had the exact same marks as the stoves from Amazon . I called Coleman , spoke with Customer Service again and passed on what I saw . She said she would check into this and I got the following response back ... --------------------- -LRB- 05/07/2012According to our product managers and my supervisors , those marks are weld marks from the support brackets , they are not actual holes in the stove base . It is safe to use.Thank you , Ashley --------------------- Hi Ashley , -LRB- 05/07/2012 -RRB- Thanks for the note back and fast response.I appreciate that the ` marks ' are perhaps cosmetic and that the stove is safe to use . However , they are unsightly and , in my opinion , indicate poor product design and lack of pride in your product -LRB- or poor Quality control ? -RRB- . I was planning on posting a review on the Amazon website -LRB- and perhaps Coleman 's website -RRB- as to the nature of the ` defects ' and my -LRB- good -RRB- experience with Amazon 's returns but I was waiting until after the issue was resolved . A few people on Amazon 's site gave reviews of this particular stove/grill and complained of the same thing and returned them.One review had this comment posted
 Very disappointed this is not a leather ball . Own several other real leather balls and there is no comparison . The ball is lopsided and Molten is already wearing off.Have not contacted seller hopefully they will refund .
 The description said it was adjustable to fit anyone . I 'm 5 ' 6 '' about 155 with a 32 '' waist and it does n't even come close to fitting me . The cinch belt says `` Large '' on it and is tightened all the way , so are the shoulder straps and it is too loose . I 'll be returning it .
 I am not a novice fisher woman . I purchased this line for Muskie fishing . This line was the worst line I have used . I had more wind tangles than any other line . I tie a uni-knot with all lures so have not lost lures , but the tangles were frequent . This was NOT user error . I know how to spool a reel and use proper tension.I also tried the 20lb mono and had the same results . Solution ? I switched to 15lb power pro -LRB- braided -RRB- and really like the line . The spiderwire line gets an F - try power pro instead . Better results even when using plastics with no weight !
 i have been using it for about 6 months it wind knot easily , looses it color on your hand green stuff , it fray out and burst easily an i had to change my line
 The product is great ! The problem is the it takes 3-5 weeks to get the item when it lists as `` IN STOCK ''
 wore this item once . Waist draw string broke . One tug on the draw string and that was it . Very cheap material .
 Rather disappointed in the quality of the item . I have purchased other windshirts and found this one to be a very low quality

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I was excited to receive this piece of equipment but once I opened the package it did n't work properly . The pincers worked but the weighing apparatus did n't move . I ended up having to dismantle the entire thing using a pipe wrench to remove the inner barrel and then scrapping off an over abundance of glue . It was everywhere . I ended up having to cut the foam handle . It now works but the handle is all jacked up and it will be uncertified now . If it was n't such a pain in the butt , I would have returned it . Do n't buy this kind of equipment from this company , although they make a great lure .
 In the picture , it shows a sword stand that sets up on a shelf . This is what I ordered . The stand that I recieved only hangs on a wall . That is not what I expected . I could have sent it back but rather chose to just find a place to hang it . Not happy with this whole process but I will deal with it .
 I wish I had never bought this stand . It is poorly constructed and you are supposed to put the bottom wooden piece on yourself . It stands without the base , but was a waste of money .

 So there is some confusion about the tire size in another negative review but these are absolutely NOT 26 '' x 1-3/4 '' , they are 26 '' x 1.75 . '' It seems like the two are equivalent but they are not.These tires -LRB- 26 '' x 1.75 '' -RRB- will fit on a modern `` 26 inch '' bike rim -LRB- modern rims are actually a tad smaller than 26 '' -RRB- but WILL NOT fit on a true 26 '' rim as found on old Schwinns and other bikes . If you have an older rim marked as 26 '' x 1 3/4 '' , these tires will NOT fit , their diameter is too small.Easy mistake to make and I 've otherwise been very happy will all my purchases from Niagara Cycle !
 Niagara cycle 's website says this about this tire : * 26 '' x 1-3/4 '' * Wire Bead * Black Wall * ISO diameter 571mm * * Note

 After reading the reviews here , I purchased this product . When I intsalled the battery and the seal , it did n't work . Well . . it worked only when I pressed down the cap with my finger . How long could I hold ? Poorly made .
 The Battery compartment does n't hold the battery properly !! At first I thought maybe this other guy just did n't remove the seal or something . I removed the seal and put the battery back in and it lit up and I thought all was well , but then everytime I tried screwing the cap back on it would n't work ! I bent the prongs that hold the batter to give it a tighter grip -LRB- since it was held very loosely -RRB- and that still did n't help , everytime I screwed the cap on it went dead again . I guess I 'll just have to put some tape over the whole where the batter is and leave the cap off , and hope the battery stays in place and does n't fall out . What a piece of cr #p !

 I chose this product over the gazillions just like it for two reasons
 I loved Bob Greene 's book and find his sensible approach to fitness and diet work well for me . But I was disapointed in this purchase . The exercise bands seemed very short and hard to use . There was not enough information included with the bands . One exercise has you step on the middle of the bands and hold an end in each hand , then raise your arms . Well , I am nearly 6 ' tall and I felt like I was going to snap the bands . I literally could not lift them high enough to do the exercise . I also could not find a number to call to ask about the problems I was having . I emailed the company that manufactures the bands , but they never responded . So , the bands remain unused and I have moved on to free weights . I feel like it was a waste of money .

 I put these in a cooler and was quite surprised that when I went to put frozen items in the cooler after shopping -LRB- only about an hour later -RRB- they were just about melted down ! I will go back to using Blue Ice blocks , they last a really long time ! To sum it all up I was really disappointed with this product .
 I was excited about this product -- I liked that they were filled with water rather than a chemical gel -- but it was n't long before the ice `` pillows '' began to rip open . They also are very wet in the cooler -- even when they do n't break -- compared to traditional `` blue blocks '' . disappointed -- will need to replace soon .
 I found these cold packs no better than any ice packs I bought at Dollar Tree Store -LRB- and they cost a lot more even with Amazon 's discount -RRB- . They do n't keep things any colder for any longer period of time than what I had been previously using .
 I purchased this product because it did get alot of good reviews , I used it twice and on the second time I found the bottom of my soft side cooler completely soaked ! several of the thawed cubes had sprung a leak and what a mess !!! Its a great idea but very poor quality !! So because it truly was an Epic failure , I couldnt give it any star ... well ... I tried not to give it a star but Amazon forces at least one ...
 I do not understand why anyone thinks these are so wonderful ... They are just squares of water encased in plastic ... Which WILL tear . One of my frozen ones caught on the bottom of a wire rack in my freezer . Ripped the section open ... The most important thing is that they just do NOT keep foods any colder for any longer than a zip lock bag of ice from the ice maker or a frozen slab of water in a zip lock bag . Yes , the plastic bag sweats but so do these things !!! I take ice bags in insulated coolers to animal rescue adoptions to keep our soft drinks cold and to cool down any dog that might get over heated.The nice thing about putting ice cubes in plastic bags is that I can put the cubes in the dog 's water bowl . Ca n't do that with these things.But the really disappointing part is that I still have frozen ice in my plastic bags long after this product has melted . You get 3 of these for a ridiculous price even if there is free shipping . It will take 2 of them for each insulated cooler ... Look at the picture of the product being used.It is nice that they are USA made but if they do n't work and are expensive what difference does it make where they are made ???? Back to the drawing board for product development ... Aug. 3 , 2010Update
 This product seemed good for two days ... What a waste of money . And to return it would cost a small fortune . Water is heavy to return ... 3 day in and these ice mats started leaking .
 I was attempting to order Techi Ice , for which I 've read great reviews . I ordered this product by mistake and am disappointed . We travel frequently and pack the cooler with grocery items , soft drinks and snacks . In a moderately filled cooler , 2 melted before the end of an 8-hour trip and left the contents lukewarm . In my opinion , they 're not as effective as in-store brands -LRB- Rubbermaid , Igloo , etc. -RRB- Never again!Icy Cools Reusable Ice Mats :
 The mats were great at keeping soda cold , but when it came to sandwiches they still got soggy .
 I am rather bemused by this lame post hoc attempt by Matt Furey to put out a low quality book at textbook prices . It should be noted , first of all , that Mr. Furey has been publicly denounced , via the internet , in a hand written letter by MMA Guru Karl Gotch . He stated the following from scientificwrestling.com
 If you go to the website of the author , you will get truly pumped up to buy this book . It is all marketing and you have just bought snake oil . He focuses on three exercises that are not new or his own -LRB- to his credit Matt did n't take credit for them -RRB- . They are hindu squats , hindu pushups , and the neck bridge . The other exercises in the book are ones you probably did in grade or high school . His tapes are not any better . His book then has all of the garbage that you should n't buy as advertisements in the back . The exercises are fine , but the book is overpriced and I would n't recommend it .
 I have had one of these knives since 2000 . It replaced a KaBar , a buck knife , and a diving knife . The knife is the perfect size for a fighting knife . Its about the same size as the Buck 119 it replaced for hunting and outdoor use.Almost immediately the nylon strap that held the handle started fraying , so I cut it off , its not needed as its in an awesome locking kydex sheath . It 's still razor sharp -LRB- although it has needed sharpening a few times it holds an edge well -RRB- It does n't rust even after 2 weeks of diving in salt water without rinsing or cleaning it . It deployed with me and performed very well in mountains and desert . Since then it has cut firewood into small pieces to start fires , field dressed and skinned several species of game , and performed the million and 1 uses for a knife in the field , all flawlessly . When a friend of mine deployed and needed a good knife I did n't hesitate to get him this knife.To my surprise they changed the sheath , when you have a good product you do n't change it . Now it has a hole in the sheath to allow you to cut rope without removing your knife this hole allows more dirt into your sheath which dulls your knife , weakens the structure of the sheath , and allows you to cut yourself or your gear on a sheathed knife . They also have some new nylon belt loop at the top of the sheath , so now it makes it difficult to use as a dive knife , or take the knife out or put it back in the sheath one handed . They also redesigned the sheath so that the knife will only fit in one way . What kind of idiot gear queer designed this thing , fighting knives and their sheaths should be designed with input from fighting men not POGs . I had to send my buddy my old sheath to put his knife in , as far as I 'm concerned SOG owes me a good sheath.In short SOG took an awesome knife and ruined it by changing the sheath to an overengineed piece of crap , meanwhile they doubled the price . I will never even consider or recommend another SOG product until they bring back the old kydex sheath for this knife and send them out for free to all the people they ripped off with their new junk sheath . Until that time this knife and SOG will get exactly what they deserve , 1 star for ripping people off with this horribly designed piece of junk sheath .

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 Huge waste of money , the lace is garbage , tools are garbage , never use oil on a glove . There is nothing in this kit worth buying . there is nice lace on Ebay and always use Pecard 's Leather care on your glove .
 The watch is excellent but the battery went dead in less than a month . Normally a battery will last well over a year . I can only assume the watch has been sitting in storage for a long time . It would have been nice to get a fresh watch .
 I ordered this to hold up my banana seat on a retro-look motorized bike I 'm building.Due to not being able to adequately being able to tighten the clamps to the bar no matter how tight I could get the clamps ... had nothing but issues with not being able to ride my bike . As long as this type of sissy bar is not being used to support any type of weight and for decoration only ... you will have no problems . Because of this ... ended up finding a less expensive 42 inch sissy made to fit a beach cruiser frame and bolt to the axle of the rear wheel . This ended the issue of the `` adjustable '' seat while being used . Plus ... was able to bend that new sissy bar to an almost 45 degree angle for an even more funky look.In addition ... you are on your own to locate the bolts and nuts to hook the clamps to the bike . Would have been nice to have included 50 cent bolts and nuts to install to your bike .
 What you see in the picture is not even close to this product . The product you get is a tarp that is green on one side and silver on the other . If you Google &#34; space blanket tarp &#34; you will see what the product really looks like . The picture is very deceiving .
 the picture they had with this looked like it had a soft lining andnot a foil look at all . And now I cant find this kind on amazon .
 I received the stopwatch in a `` Sportline 461 '' package that is a lot different than the one presented here . The design looks nicer , however I find it less user-friendly . I have the Sportline 470 , so I know that the design presented here -LRB- but not the product shipped -RRB- is better.As far as the stopwatch goes , I am not impressed . If I go from countdown timer mode to stopwatch mode , it stops and zeros out the timer.One thing that I do like about the timer is that when you go into that mode it lets you select every digit . So , for 30 minutes instead of pressing or holding down to increase minutes one by one up to 30 , it instead lets you select the 3 and leave the zero . Very efficient . I might have kept this for that reason alone , but receiving the same model number that is very different -LRB- and inferior -RRB- to the one presented here confuses me and I am just going to send it back.I have the 470 model and it is excellent . I 'm going there right now to give it a good review .
 My Dad always told me that if you ca n't say anything good about someone , do n't say anything at all . I have to guess that can also apply to product reviews , so here is my review of this pedometer :
 Received delivery on time , however , item did not work straight out of the box . Originally bought this new pedometer to replace my old one in which battery failed due to age . I could not find a replacement battery in any local store . So , I took the battery out of newly purchased pedometer and placed in old one . Voila , old one is working , new one is absolutely useless . Be warned ...
 This model used to be sold everywhere - Walmart , target , etc. . Lately though , they 've stopped carrying it and now have bigger , bulkier and more expensive models . I 'm always losing my pedometers , so I was excited to able to buy some more cheap ones that I can afford to lose.I was even more excited that it would be black ! I wear a pedometer every day . I need one that will blend in at work . I work in an office and need to dress professionally . Even when this style was sold everywhere , I would have to go through 15-20 pedometers to find a black or grey one.So , I ordered five from Amazon - knowing my history of losing them . NOT ONE I RECEIVED WAS BLACK . So damned annoying . It will cost me more in time to return them - but TOTALLY DECEPTIVE to show a black one and then send out extremely bright green and red ones to customers . Sorry , but bright green - practically glowing - green does NOT with any of my work outfits.The pedometer itself is fine . I like the clip ; you can stick it on your waistband one-handed . Sometimes if I 'm hiking in very humid conditions it will freeze up . I do n't know how accurate it is - but they are consistent . I 've worn two - juts to make sure one does n't measure more than another - it does n't . Great way to see how much I 'm moving around each day .
 Initially , the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate . It did , however , give my wife a good laugh ; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 ` steps ' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote . But after one week of use , the darn thing became so * in * sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick . Pass on this one .
 I just bought this sportline 340 pedometer today . I walked 20 steps , and it gave me a reading of 58 steps . I reset it , and tested it again . The next 50 steps I took resulted in a reading of 69 steps . I reset it , and tested it again . With my next 50 steps , it gave me a reading of 18 steps . I was very careful to use it properly ; the problem was not human error . Do n't bother with the sportline 340 .
 I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf . This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it . It has problems that need modification.The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body , making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb . That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely . Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it . Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case . Make a fabric band for your ankle . Attach the ends to each other with Velchro . Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band . I get accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle . I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted . I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring . The strut is made of thin brass . Aluminum from a soda can would work , too . I made a `` V '' in one end of the strut to hold the spring . I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side , drilled a hole in the brass , and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board . The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it . I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer . -LRB- I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely . -RRB- Several times the pedometer reset itself to `` 0 '' for no apparent reason . I know nothing pushed on the reset button . One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security . Once it reset while I was walking . Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa . I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit , but I do not know . Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers , too.This pedometer uses a counter circuit . If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter , connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts . Connect a button switch to the two wires . Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue .
 This was completely inaccurate - the first hour I wore it on a long walk , it counted a reasonable number of steps . The following day it registered 200 steps for a 2 hour walk . I 'm going to ask for a refund - but I advise readers to get an Omron , I 've had good experience with at least one of those -LRB- 2 years accurate use before it died -RRB- . I 've had 6 different pedometers so far , there is a really widespread quality problem - one of the Omrons was the only reliable one .
 I have bought 3 of these and thought the 3rd one would be the charm . I was wrong . The first one , the clip broke off . So , I bought a second one . That one broke too , but the display broke this time . The 3rd one did n't break , it just did n't work accurately . None of them really did . You put it on your belt like it says and it does n't even count all your steps . Sometimes , it even resets itself and goes back to zero . It is just so frustrating . I am not wasting any more money on these cheap pedometers . I will search for the perfect one . Do n't even waste your few bucks on this unless you do n't mind it not counting all of your steps .
 As I said I am disappointed , it was put together backwards and does not work . I also ordered another one and it did not work either . I really rate it zero but there was not a category for that
 I 've used this for more than six months now . It just does n't quite work.Here 's what I like about it :1 . The one I received is made out of semi-transparent red plastic , which is cute .2 . Just picking it up reminds me that I want to spend less time sitting at a computer and more time walking.Unfortunately , those are the only good things I can say about it.I apparently do n't walk `` right '' for this to work reliably . I 've followed all the placement directions carefully , but after years of plantar fascitis , I have developed the habit of walking very gently . Perhaps it would be more accurate to call my stride style `` gliding '' than walking . At any rate , I can take 25 steps in a straight line and have the pedometer only record three of them . It 's not uncommon for this little pedometer to record just 150 steps on a Sunday morning at church . I climb nearly that many stairs on a Sunday morning , plus quite a bit of walking around . My all-time record was when it recorded a mere 161 steps on a day when I had climbed up and down three or four flights of stairs AND walked every single aisle at the grocery store.I have decided that the slower I walk , the less likely it is to notice that I 'm walking.Furthermore , it 's just a disaster for small movements . It basically never records the two steps from the kitchen sink to the stove , no matter how many dozens of times you do that.I 've had some success with changing the location . I like to clip it to my shirt ; I may try the ankle band suggestion that another reviewer made.I think this pedometer would work well for a person who wanted to count steps while engaged in a specific `` bouncy '' task , like jogging around a track . For everyday movements , however , it is unreliable .
 Worked fine for about a month , then was n't accurate , either for steps or miles . Of course I did n't pay much for it either .
 This pedometer does n't clock every step . I walked around the city for hours and it only clocked 12k steps while my sister 's clocked 20k . It 's a nice , tiny size that does n't bulge from my belt but it does n't do the job it 's supposed to .
 Not worth the shipping cost . Completely flawed . I ordered the Oregon Scientific , which is perfect . Should be ZeroStars.Dr . Parham
 Seemed to count more steps than I actually took . Only used it twice then bought a hear trate monitor with chest strap - very effective !
 My sister wanted one for Christmas so I got this . It is really hard to calibrate . Its been a week and I do n't think she has got it right yet . I would n't buy it again . There are much more expensive ones but I thought something fairly cheap would be good for start with . You do indeed get what you pay for ...
 Put this in my purse to bring to work with me . Moved purse a few times and started counting steps . Way to sensitive . But I guess you get what you pay for .
 I 'm not really fond of this piece of equipment . Ca n't say a whole lot about it as it 's always falling coming unclipped . I think it may be a little off on steps as I take about 4 steps and it only measures 3 SO not sure about the accuracy really but hey what do you expect for $ 15 right ? I would recomment for people who do n't walk fast and for people that walk on a flat level surface otherwise get something better if you can afford it !
 I bought this for my daughter . She wanted a pedometer to count her steps every day . This one is a great price and perfect for a child . But , I would not recommend it for a serious athlete/individual looking for an accurate recording of their steps and distance.The pedometer indavertently counts steps even when she is not walking . If the pedometer shakes or jiggles -LRB- which is possible just shifting positions when you are seated -RRB- it will log a step or two .
 I have previously used the digiwalker by Yamaz . After years of service , it broke and in a fit of desperation I ran to Kmart and bought this one . The digiwalker had been a gift and , honestly , I was too cheap to purchase another one . I 've been using the Sportline for 1 week with frustrating results . When I wear jeans that sit lower on my waist -LRB- much more in style with typical men 's pants -RRB- the results are quite good . However , in more traditional women 's pants that sit at the real waist ... I walked the quarter of a mile from the parking lot and it registered 4 steps . When I went for a bout of actual exercise and walked for 1.6 miles at 4mph ... it again did well . Today , back in dress pants , I just did the 1.6 mile loop at a more typical walking pace ... 75 steps . Pointless . I need to know that my pedometer will work every time I wear it .
 We got the pedometer and we have been used over the same path several times . Based in our estimations it is about 6000 steps per turn . This pedometer reports anything between 3000 and 10000 steps in different days .
 I bought this and with in a week of owning it , it broke ! I used it only 2-3 times and the LCD panel went out on one of the numbers ! It cost more to return it then to invest in a better one ! DO N'T DO IT !!!! SPEND A FEW EXTRA BUCKS FOR A GOOD ONE !!!
 I got one of these after my old pedometer disappeared . I either lost it or misplaced it . I got this one in a hurry . I like the features . It took me a while to figure out how to make the leash work . Mine has a clip you have to lift first and then clip down . That seems a more secure grip . The first two days it seriously under counted my steps compared to my old one . I figured out how to change stride length . I set it to about my height which is n't correct to the directions . After that it seemed to count my steps more accurately , at least not under counting . Exactness to the very step number does n't matter to me , but I do like to have a good general idea to write down in my calender.But one problem remains : It resets everything to zero too easily . This includes losing my settings like my weight and stride length.It appears it is something it does on its own and not something I did to reset it . I just did a reset test to find out . I intentionally clicked the reset button once . No reset . I had to press hard and hold the reset to make it reset . It reset everything , but my weight and stride length setting remained . Those two got reset to the defaults when the pedometer reset itself . That means to me , it must have rest on its own and not by some accident I did.Anyways in the two days I tried this the timer reset at least twice on the first day and reset again on the next day . I was not able to keep track of my total or write down the total in my calender . I had to guess based on past experience with my old pedometer . Not being able to keep track of my total -LRB- because of spontaneous restarts -RRB- defeats the purpose of wearing the pedometer . I do n't like having to keep checking it as I am walking to keep track of my steps either.Update : Thinking I got a defective one , I returned it and tried to get an exchange , but unfortunately there were none left of this model in the store . I picked up another model . So far that one seems okay . Unfortunately that means I ca n't add any update to my review on this product .
 This pedometer did not work well for me . The instructions were complicated and I could n't get it to work .
 First , I bought it because the size was so small . but the clip was loose . it always fell down to the floor . then , it was n't accurate after 3-month use . i suggest to buy $ 20 one and made sure that it is made in Japan .
 Although this pedometer is cleanly designed with its buttons easy to use and a clear digital display , it is worthless because it is inaccurate . I left it on for several hours while walking around doing normal tasks , and it registered only a few steps . I had clipped in on my belt just as the instructions described.I think the problem is that this pedometer is just not sensitive enough . If you are walking normally , it does n't register the steps . If you are pounding the pavement , it does better .
 This product is useless . It does n't work at all and no one at the company answers the phone . I think they are a bogus company just sending out junk that costs them 2 cents to purchase . I purchased them to have a walking contest at my place of employment and now no one can use them and we have to re-buy elsewhere . This does n't deserve any stars .
 Waste of money , of course , as this device is very inaccurate . God knows how it passed the quality tests -LRB- if any -RRB- . Waste of time as you try to figure out how to make it work
 I purchased 2 one for a friend , and one for myself . Both of ours quit working with in the first week . . It was not worth it .
 It counts steps just fine , but the reset button is way too sensitive and resets to zero at the slightest touch . Nothing like walking all day and find you are at a step count of 135 at the end of the day .
 I have been using pedometers for terms . I did n't understand what I was doing differently so I borrowed a friends to wear on other foot . That one worked like all of my others had . This new one s a piece of junk . Off by anywhere from 8000-10000 steps . Saddened Amazon would sell such junk with the amount of money I spend on their site .
 I did not use this item right away since I have other pedometers ; started using it about 2 weeks ago and realized that it does not keep accurate track of steps ; it is approximately off by 30 % ; need an exchange or credit ... thanks
 Pedometers are easy to use right ? There 's only 3 buttons on this thing but how is it possible I ca n't figure out how to use it ?
 I have used this precise brand of pedometer before . This was a replacement for me , and this one does not work at all .
 Unfortunately , I ordered two of these having forgotten that it does n't work well . Sportline used to make a model that worked great . This one only counts steps taken with your right foot if worn on your waist band so you have to double your numbers . If you are wearing loose shorts or pants , you can carry it in your pocket and it seems to be quite accurate .
 I guess you get what you pay for.This pedometer was difficult to calibrate , and continued to miscount steps , and therefore distance , covered.It is made of plastic , and came unclipped easily.I am a big person , and have started walking to improve my health . This product does not work for me , although it might be a different story for a slim person.It has been relegated to the junk drawer , and probably will eventually be thrown away . I 'll have to find another that works better and purchase it .
 I have to say I really only have myself to blame for this . I read the reviews and there are plenty of warnings from others stating that this is not a high quality pedometer and they were right . I will say that they at the very least ship quickly but the bottom line is that this is simply not a good pedometer . It never was able to accurately count steps -LRB- and yes I am sure that I put the pedometer on correctly -RRB- and after two days the display -LRB- which did n't really work right to begin with -RRB- decided to crap out . Do n't make the same mistake I did ! Do not buy this ! It may be annoying to pay a little more for a pedometer but after this experience , it will be worth it .
 this pedometer sucks . i should 've spent a little more money and bought another one , now i am buying another one anyway . it stopped working for NO reason on the 3rd day . and i was measuring my training
 The pedometer did not work ... sometimes it did n't register steps at all , and at other times , would register far fewer steps than I actually walked .
 I ordered 45 of these for a contest at work . I needed to order 60 to replace the ones that stopped working after the first 2 weeks . But they are simple enough for everyone to use , they do not reset accidently too often and they were only 2 bucks each , so I ; m not complaining . Not to mention we call them `` generous '' They click over steps even if you laugh hard .
 This is a cheap pedometer . Its attraction is that it 's simple and may count roughly accurately . I bought several , thinking I 'd be able to keep replacing the disfunctional ones with new ones . Silly me . There 's a gremlin inside every single one that eats the last digit -LRB- the one 's digit -RRB- and renders it invisible , sometime within days of activating the pedometer . So sorry but I 'm going to have to move up to better quality .
 Do n't buy it . It does not work good . Save your money . Look for something else . Its too small . It does not give accurate readings .
 I received this pedometer in the mail two days ago , wore it all day yesterday and while I took it off that night , I was missing the `` Mode '' button . I barely touched it all day and in less than 12 hours , buttons were falling off .
 I purchased this pedometer a couple of weeks ago , I was initally very happy with it , but it stopped working after three weeks of using it .
 Ordered two of these pedometers in separate orders . First one arrived - black and works well . Second one was red , and never worked at all . Not worth replacing the battery and hoping that was the issue . Not impressed .
 While I have n't seen this video , I am wary of the advertizing . In my martial arts experience -LRB- I too am a second degree black belt -RRB- , every school , organization , master and/or instructor will have different requirements for their black belt test . While this video may well be a helpful resource to the Taekwondo practitioner , it may or may not be helpful when preparing for promotional examinations .
 wore this item once . Waist draw string broke . One tug on the draw string and that was it . Very cheap material .
 Rather disappointed in the quality of the item . I have purchased other windshirts and found this one to be a very low quality

 I bought the vector cooler warmer -LRB- 16 can version , same item -RRB- , and tried it out . The metal element inside got cold , but it could n't chill a small bottle of water after 3 hours - no way it was 40 degrees belwo my room temp of 75 degrees . No wonder this thing is always on clearance . It did a little better on metal cans of soda directly touching the element , but not by much . The manual says for best results the food should be put in cold , or with an icepack , but as soon as it 's shut off theres no insulation to keep the food cold , so the food quickly reaches room temp , according to the manual ! Besides if I have to put in pre-chilled food and icepacks Im beter off using my insulated cooler which works , and is much more space efficient ! Plus , the cooler only ostensibly brings the temp down to up to 40 degrees below ambient temp -LRB- after 3 hours -RRB- . I guess in a car where the temps go up to 130 degrees in the sun it would keep the food at 90 or so . I bought it for fifteen dol . on clearance , but returned it today . It simply was n't worth the price . I would stay clear of this product . The only exeption I can think of is for someone who needs it only for metal cans of soda or beer and can wait several hours for a cool drink , although a cooler would still be more practical and cost effective .

 Sent a replacement that broke . Service was fine as they refunded my money but the replacement which was free was no good .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .
 Updated Review
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 I orderd this for my sons bday it arived on time but when he opend the box the case on the brides sword was broke in half . The swords are awsome but the one case is broke . I have emailed the seller twice to get it replaced but they have never answerd . Do not buy
 Would love to rate this item ... if the box was n't sent to me completely empty ! Reporting this vendor . Do n't purchase .
 The pedometer works find . I was disappointed with the attachment for your belt . It was not very firm . I lost mine twice . Luckily , I realized it was gone and managed to find it within a short distance . Now , I just pin it on .

 It does n't seem to be accurate no matter what stride I set it at . So I just keep it at the default stride of 2.5 and base my number of steps on that stride . I also have a problem keeping it level on my waistline . I do n't always have a belt on so on those days I just do n't wear it . Also for -LSB- this price -RSB- I thought I would get more features than it gives . It does n't count calories , there 's no memory in it , and the auto stride adjustment does n't seem to work too well . I 'm in the process of looking for another one even if I have to pay more money . I guess you get what you pay for !
 The Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an FM radio , but it has 2 issues.The Good
 This fleece is great looking and feels great , BUT ... the big problem is the shrinkage . . WOW does it ever not only in the body and length but major shrinkage in the width of the arms . It defiantly is not a comfortable jersey to lounge around in ... CHOOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT !!!!
 It works.this is the fifth one bought though dont ne one make stuff that last any more i need a belt drive i guess

 Too complicated to use . I 'm still trying to figure out how to `` program '' it . I like simple , uncomplicated equipment .
 not happy the enurance capabilities , if you drop it acidentally , forget it . Hopefully the warranty will replace it . Othehwise I was happy with it 's performance .
 I 've owned two Sportline 350 's now . The first one lasted a month , then stopped registering steps . After trying to repair it , I threw it out.My second Sportline 350 lasted one day before falling off my belt . It , too , stopped counting steps . This time , my repairs were more successful . The spring inside had popped up against the swinging weight and jammed it . Once I pushed the spring back into the square groove , everything worked fine.I probably would n't buy another .
 The pedometer worked well for approximately the first hour I used it , however sometime during the second hour it quit working . Just a blank screen . Maybe it was a fluke , but I am not going to take my chances with another of the same product .
 The pedometer worked great for the first two weeks . Than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans , it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it . It still worked , but I had to be careful when I opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached . Last w/e it stopped working completely . Everthing is set to 0 and wo n't move . My husbands odometer seems to be working fine . However , I 'm dissapointed for the short life-span ... M. L. McDermott
 Inaccurately counts steps , useless .
 I purchased two of the same pedometer for my boyfriend and I and they both stopped working on the same day ! We only had them 10 days and when they went kaput !
 A friend gave me the sportline trainer -LRB- the trainer digital quartz sports monitor , model # unknown -RRB- as a gift . After performing all the programming steps , the unit stopped responding after 3 hours of use . I changed the battery and reprogrammed the unit and the same thing happened again after just 2 hours of use and now only the upper half of the digits will display . Do n't waste your money or time .
 I was n't looking for anything fancy in pedometers , just something that would record my steps accurately . Unfortunately the Sportline pedometer could n't even do that . It never recorded my steps accurately . It would always tell me that I did more steps than I actually did . Not only that , the thing stopped working after about a month of use . Maybe I got a bad pedometer , but I wo n't try another one .
 My first pedometer from Sportline worked only a few days -LRB- digital display completely disappeared -RRB- , so I returned it to them , and after over two months and several emails from me to them , they replaced it with this Sportline 350 . The first two days , it worked fine , although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have . The third day , in the middle of the day it said approx . 3400 steps , later that afternoon it said 1300 steps , and by nighttime the display totally disappeared , and never came back . I just sent the second one back , and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service . Their products seem to be very poorly made , and I do n't expect to purchase any more ... . after reading the reviews , I have just purchased an Omron , and am hoping it will be much more reliable .
 I had this pedometer for a few days and returned it because it was so inaccurate . I would walk like 10 steps and it would register at 20 . It was maybe too sensitive ... I do n't recommend it .
 I bought this 5/21/05 got it the first week of June . It never worked so I sent it to the manufacturer . My postal receipt says they got 6/6/05 . I finally called 6/28/5 and was told we would get a replacement in 10 business days . That would have been 7/13/05 . Called on 7/15/05 and was told yet again it would be another 10 days . Bought this for summer hiking . What a disappointment . What a piece of junk ! Buy something local so you can get help from a local store !
 I 've had my Sportline 350 for just two weeks , and , confirming the experience of a number of other reviewers of this product , mine has stopped working too . This is particularly frustrating , because until now I was very happy with the product . I 've learned my lesson -- I will be reading the reviews BEFORE I get my next pedometer . I 'm guessing it would be a good bet that that next pedometer wo n't be a Sportline .
 I ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately . One only counts about half the steps I take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that . I wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday . I could understand if one did n't work properly but I got 2 at the same time with the same problem . I would not recommend this product .
 Mine quit working after only two weeks and only registered ZERO steps.I tried to reset , and then got my computer/techno savy husband on the job.NOTHING . ZERO . ZIP . NADA.We have both e-mailed the company with NO response.that is ZERO , ZIP , NADA . I can understand we might have gotten a lemon.We tried to phone the company and were met with a voice-mail nightmare.The fact that the company has n't replied is very disappointing . *** Final update
 I bought this Sportline pedometer after my first , cheaper , Sportline pedometer decided it no longer wanted to be attached to me while out on a hike . With the new improved model clipped to my waist I was amazed at how far I was hiking , I really had no idea I could go that far . One day , less than 2 months after purchase , I checked my milage and it was zero . Thinking I must have done something wrong , I reset it , closed the cover and off I went . A little later I checked again , the thing 's still at zero . Clock worked but nothing else . Kept fiddling with it and finally after an hour gave up and put it in my pocket . THEN it decided to work . Figuring placement was the problem , the next time I went out I clipped it not at my center -LRB- where it had been working and was instructed to place it -RRB- but to the side . Went for my hike , returned to the car 2 hours later , checked and found it recorded my taking 7 steps . But the clock worked fine.Well , I did a little checking on my trail maps and discovered that all those miles I ` thought ' I was hiking and was so proud of ... well , this thing was inflating my distance by about 250-300 % ... my stride length was set correctly.What a piece of junk . I will never again by a Sportline . I read reviews for different brands of pedometers and found one with great reviews and at half the price .
 It 's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up . But what was worse was that after I owned it for two weeks , the thing stopped working ! It was never dropped or damaged in anyway , it just stopped . The display just faded away and would n't work again even with a new battery . This one was such a waste of money , I 'll definately buy a different brand next time .
 Do not buy this product !! It stopped working the first time I used it during my trial walk . I wanted to see how accurate it was -LRB- it was n't -RRB- , and when I pushed the reset button , the screen went blank . I have n't been able to `` revive '' it since then . The cover was also incredibly difficult to open . I regret ever buying this thing .
 Someone else wrote a review here that mentioned the same problem that I had . Our situations were very similar . I also bought the unit through Amazon -LRB- KarateDepot -RRB- . While I used the pedometer successfully out of the box , within a week the unit would not `` turn on '' when you pushed the mode button . It seemed to have no battery left . However , calling the manufacturer does no good and KarateDepot does not support the product . My advice is to buy a different pedometer .
 I purchased this product from Amazon , and have now had it 7 hours . I have been reading the directions for setting the time almost that long , and still the unit will not set the time of day . My brilliant husband has tried , my brilliant step-son , and brilliant me . I 've written a letter to the company . Their web site only provides the same elusive instructions as are on the package . This is not an easy gizmo to work . I have n't given up yet , but I am totally vexed and feel cheated.Signed , Vexed in Vermont
 I bought this a few years ago and never got much use out of it.The directions were somewhat confusing , but I figured it out and set it up . I thought it was pretty accurate at step counting . I enjoyed shaking it vigorously and seeing the numbers NOT change , which I found clever ... it knows when you 're shaking it and when you 're walking and only counts actual steps . You can see the little weight bouncing inside through the clear plastic casing . So as far as novelty goes , I certainly enjoyed playing with it for a while.So why did n't I get much use out of it?I wear a toolbelt at my job and was n't able to wear this thing and my toolbelt at the same time ! If I tried clipping it onto my pocket , or my toolbelt itself it fell off.Yeah , I know not EVERYONE wears a toolbelt all day , so is this a good item for such normal folk ? No ! It falls off your pocket or belt when you are getting in and out of your car!Also , it is NOT very discreet , which someone else claimed . Nothing clipped to your belt is discreet , I do n't care if it 's an ipod , a pager , a phone ... whatever . It makes you feel like Batman . And for many of us that 's not a selling point.I put this thing in a box and only rediscovered it a couple of weeks ago . And of course the battery was by then dead.AND HERE 'S THIS PRODUCT 'S WORST FEATUREYou ca n't replace the battery!I 'm serious!There are four screws which hold the plastic casing together . The screws are hidden under the plastic face which is glued in place over the display.You have to ruin the display plastic by pulling it off in order to get at the four teeny tiny screws that let you open the case and replace the battery.This type of planned obsolescence drives me insane!I bought this thing about 3 years ago at Big 5 . How long was it on the shelf before I bought it ? Why is the entire product 's life limited to the life of the battery inside ? Because they want me to buy another one ???? Forget that!I recently bought the Personal Trainer Walking for my Nintendo DS and am enjoying it far more than I ever enjoyed this piece of junk . Why ? Because I can just put the DS pedometer into my pocket ! No clipping onto clothes necessary ! Solves all my problems , plus any excuse to play with my DS ! There are fun little animations of me walking and little games and trivia unlocked by the number of steps I take each day . Plus it came with TWO pedometers ! One for me and one for my spouse ! Our little avatars walk all over the little DS screen together . Very fun ! -LRB- It does n't calculate distance , though , only number of steps . -RRB-
 The Sportline 360 Fitness Pedometer is an easy to use hip-clip pedometer with a flip-down interface . While it should be a great little unit , various flaws keep it from being useful.First , the basics . The unit is very small , about the size of a marshmallow . It clips easily at your hip . The face of the unit is protected by a plastic shell that you flip down , so you do n't have to worry about it scratching or being damaged by general activity . Then you flip it open and it tells you all the stats.It keeps track of the steps you 've walked since last reset , steps per minute , calories , and so on . However , for it to know how far you 've walked , you have to enter your stride length . While you might say this is tricky to determine , it 's something you 're going to need for any pedometer , since the only thing it can count is your steps :-RRB- So I do n't ding it for needing that information - however the method for entering it could certainly be easier.However , the real problem here seems to be with how it counts your strides . Or does n't count your strides . It goes into `` sleep mode '' if it senses no activity , to save battery power I imagine . Then it wakes up if it senses movement . It does n't seem to do these transitions very well . So if you are really hoping for accuracy , you 're not going to get it with this unit.Also , while the plastic clip works fine for me on my thin sweatpants I wear , I can easily see that this would be less fine on thick jeans or other thick fabrics . You probably want to get some sort of a loop to hook on a belt loop , and then clip this unit securely to that.But really , I bought this unit maybe in 2003 or 2004 and paid probably the current list price for it . In current times you can buy a MUCH superior pedometer for half the price . So while it might have been `` rather good '' for its time , other units have by far surpassed it now and would be a far better value.Shop around and look at the alternatives .
 Do n't buy this pedometer . It never did keep accurate count . It randomly loses power and resets your step count . It is big and bulky and noticeable under your shirt . And the clip is VERY unsecure . Mine actually popped off my pants and fell in the toilet , which is probably where it belonged anyway . Well , after that it stoped working entirely . Do n't waste your money .
 I got a Sportline 360 for Christmas of 2003 which included a two year warranty . In less than a year it failed , losing steps and recording the wrong mileage . After returning it Sportline sent a replacement in late December , 2004 , however , the replacement now had a one year warranty . After three months of use , it , too has failed in the same manner . For a top-of-the-line product this `` durability '' is unacceptable .
 I bought this pedometer three years ago . It worked properly the first time I used it -- then it shut down when I was inactive , and I could never get it to work right again . About once a month I tried to use it , but I could n't get it to work so it sat in a drawer . Then , about a year ago I took it to my health club and had the trainers try to help me , but they could n't get it to work either . Last week I bought an Omron Premium pedometer , Model HJ-112 and I love it !! It works perfectly every day , and is easy to set and use . I will write a review for the omron pedometer soon . Buy that one -- not the Sportline .
 OK I think . Very hard to set for new walking miles and time . That 's all I realy wanted for but sometimes it over lapped the walking distances . I 'm going to try a Oregon Scientific PE316CA .
 I went outside and walked 200 steps with this on . It reported 102 . Simply is not accurate . Do not buy .
 This is my second pedometer , and while better than my first one , I am not happy with it . The directions are very confusing . I have never figured out some of the features and how to adjust them . If I am doing vigerous walking it does a very good job of counting my steps . However , if I am out shopping or slowly walking , sometimes the step counter never changes . Today , I walked all over the grocery store and the number of steps never changed since I was slowly walking . I am sure there must be a more accurate , easy to use pedometer out there .
 I used this pedometer for about 3 months before the pins fell out that held it together - only to be lost forever . This pedometer is not very easy to use.I kept having to refer to the difficult-to-follow instructions to figure out how it works . It has some good features , but I lost interest in trying to learn about them , so I ended up just resetting it daily and using the step/calorie counters only . All in all , I am going to buy another pedometer as this one is useless to me without the belt clip .
 I walk pretty much the same distance daily , and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route . I could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride , etc. . But off by thousands of steps ? Hardly worth it .
 Having used this pedometer for several weeks I have found that it does not always record your activity . Like a previous reviewer , I have noticed from my first usage that it may not record your steps when you are not walking quickly . But in the past few days I have also found that it does not always record vigorous walking either . It simply stops recording entirely at times . I have another pedometer , costing less than half of what this one cost , without all the bells and whistles , but it is accurate and dependable . This product is not only not worth the price being charged for it , but given its inaccuracy , is not worth any price .
 On the good side : - Inexpensive-Lots of features -LRB- time of day , miles walked , calories burned , time walked , average speed , etc. -RRB- - Belt clip seems very secure , no problems with it falling off . The whole thing seems pretty durable and reasonably well made for the price.-I really like that is has the flip-down cover to protect the buttons from accidentally being hit or from getting mechanically damaged due to being dropped.On the bad side : - Another reviewer had a problem with this under-counting because it did n't always `` wake up '' . I have exactly the opposite problem , it drastically over-counts my steps . I 've tried walking fast , slow , taking `` heavy steps '' versus trying to be `` light on my feet '' , walking short distances , long distances , repositioning how/where I have it attached , checking and adjusting my stride length entered into the unit , everything possible . It still drastically over-counts my steps -LRB- as compared to me manually counting my actual steps -RRB- by as much as 35-45 % . Maybe it 's because I 'm severely overweight , with a lot of the fat in my stomach , so I jiggle too much or something.-Don ' t lose the instructions if you ever want to enter in different information or get to some of the less obvious functions . Even with the instructions , it 's not that easy to get to all the various functions -LRB- and I 'm an Engineer so I 'm used to using complicated test equipment and so on every day -RRB- . For certain things like double-button presses to get to some functions , the amount of time between the button presses seems both critical and not intuitive.-For some people , it may be a negative that you ca n't see the display while you are walking -LRB- the display faces inside towards wherever you have it clipped -RRB- and have to remove it from your belt to see it . But , I knew that when I bought it so I do n't consider that a bad thing from my point of view.Tip
 I have used pedometers for a few years . I was initially impressed with this pedometer BUT then I discovered the 360 I received did not always ` wake ' and keep track of steps . The 360 I received did not always count steps even when already ` awake . ' The ` sleep ' ` wake ' feature is bogus , it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser . I would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep . Heartrate Monitors , the company I bought it from was not responsive when I asked for guidance . I bought another pedometer from a different dealer , the Sportline 345 - It 's my second 345 , need I say more .
 ivew used a few different bass attractants and this one is the worst , besides mike brand crayfish which only attracts carp lol but this one sucks too save you $ $
 they keep deleting my reviews , this guns sucks dont buy it , it has missing parts and almost nothing works
 I bought this to speed test daughters fastpitch softball pitching speeds . She tested on a several juggs guns at 57 mph , the best this gun would read is 52-53 . Tried 4 other pitchers , , all pitched in high 55-60mph range on juggs , , this gun gave everyone -LRB- 4 -RRB- pitchers the same speed of 53 ?? Go figure
 I bought this gun and am not able to use it at any games . I am not able to pick up any readings , even sitting directly behind the backstop . I have tried about 15 different parks traveling with my team . This has been a horrible experiment . If your sitting more than 8-10 feet behind catcher , as at most parks , this gun is useless . Do n't make the same mistake .
 could not pick up a car heading straigh on , , , on a small plane from 200 ' or a baseball , , , sent the unit in to be fixed , , bot billed for fixing it , , , still does n't work , , , , do not buy this product . I ended up using a hotwheels radar gun for $ 20 ...
 I ordered this item from this company ... they cancelled my order and immediately relisted item at a higher price ! Shady !
 It got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it -LRB- a month or so later -RRB- it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly . A huge disappointment and waste of my money .
 This product does not have the range required to be an effective speed gun for baseball . I tried to use the gun while sitting behind home plate at a summer college game and could not get a reading . Very disappointing . The range differences between the models should be explicitly listed on the web site .
 Pros : - Works well for tennis balls.Cons : - One of two snaps on the handle used to secure the battery enclosure broke during the initial battery installation . Ours is now secured with tape.Recommendations : - Take extra care when removing the battery housing to not overstress the snaps.-Check the return policy of your vendor before your purchase ... my vendor -LRB- purchased through Amazon -RRB- had a 15 % restocking fee , would not refund shipping and would not pay for return shipping .
 I bought this to measure two things basically
 I received my first gun on Monday , could not get it to work . The dopler rader symbol above the mph would not come on so no speed could be captured . Had my neighbor look at it since he has the same radar gun . He said it was defective . Set up replace item with Amazon and received second unit on Thursday . Exact same problem . I called customer support at Bushnell and after a 20 minute hold was told the unit was discontinued because of this problem . I have set up today to return the product to Amazon for a refund . No complaints with Amazon returns , excellent and I have no issues with them selling a discontinued product but you would be wise not to order this unit.Also , have to say I will not order any Bushnell product . Their customer support was very rude to the point of being a jerk indicating it was my fault because I ordered a product they had discontinued . My advice to Bushnell is if an item is discontinued because of a problem , get the product off the market or you stand to lose what Goodwill you may have established . At least that is the case with this potential customer . I will never purchase a Bushnell product .
 This product was one that I might have been better off not buying.I bought it because my son had become obsessed with his velocity -LRB- not believing that he was throwing hard enough -RRB- . I was convinced that his velocity was no problem -LRB- not overpowering , but well above average for his age -RRB- . When this came in , we went to the field to throw . After he was warmed up thoroughly , I had him throw about 12 fastballs then an assortment of change-ups , cutters and curves to get a measure of both the velocity and the speed changes . The numbers on this gun were much slower than I was expecting and confirmed in my son 's mind that he was n't throwing hard enough.I put forward the idea that maybe he was having an `` off '' day and suggested we try again later in the week . Three days later we went back to the field to work and go through the same routine . This time , there was a coach there -LRB- had n't seen him before -RRB- with a `` Stalker '' brand radar gun . He suggested that the Bushnell was n't very accurate -LRB- phrased much less diplomatically -RRB- and offered to radar a few with his gun of my son . With us standing side by side , the Bushnell consistently registered 7 - 8 mph slower than his gun.Now that I know , I can add 7 mph to whatever the Bushnell says , but the headache that came from the low readings made me wish I had n't bought it .
 This gun if fine . Vary hard to get a good reading on the ball as it comes to the plate . I would say 4 out of 10 times it will pick up the speed of the ball . I would recommend spending $ 100 - $ 200 more if you want to not bother with taking reading after reading .
 since the product arrived I could never use because you do not check it , it stays at 20 mph , I think this is misconfigured , unfortunately I think I lost my money
 I broke out the radar gun to check out my son 's pitching speed . Out of 20 tries , I got one reading that was even close to accurate . He was recently clocked at 80 mph on a reliable Juggs gun , but the best I could get from this product was one reading of 73 mph . Now , even if he did throw it 73 , why was I getting readings anywhere from 11 to 23 mph on the other 19 ? Operator error ? Sure , but why isit so difficult to get the reading ? It was a breeze on the Juggs gun.In sum , highly inaccurate , difficult to get readings consistently -LRB- ANY kind of readings ! -RRB- , and a major disappointment .
 Like many Christmas toys , thie product worked on Christmas Day and never again . My son tried to use it with his friends at home to time their hockey shots on New Years ' Eve and after the first 5 or 6 players it started to register erroneous speeds . We changed the batteries 3 times to no avail . It appears to work properly but the speeds registered are way too low -LRB- less than 1/4 of the correct speed -RRB- on either miles per hour or kilometers per hour . Its a piece of junk . NO STARS From this rater .
 Received the Bushnell Velocity Speed gun , put in the battery and the unit turned on , but did not pick up a car heading straight on speed nor any speed at all . Also , There is no manual instruction . I am in the process of returning the product , does anyone know what is their refund/process policy/reputation lately ?
 The product description states the speed gun measures `` Auto racing range
 Not strong enough . Bent the very first day . I 've since learned you need a training wheel that is reinforced with another bar that makes a triangle and does not allow the main bar to flare out . These were a piece of junk and certainly no better than you can buy at the big box stores . Wasted my money .
 We bought this thinking our daisy and red rider BB guns would flip it but they do not . My daughter 's T200 air rifle can though . Bummer , we were hoping we could get something like this resetting target that would get the boys away from the recycling ;-RRB- I have had it with shot up cans and cardboard targets . LOL
 Works when it wants to . It 's great if you do n't mind if it does n't move . Looks great , is sturdy and feels heavy but in the wrong spots . I think if this product was revamped I would give it another shot , I do like the idea . For now , I 'll just stick to the old fashion foam targets .
 I bought this for my son to use with his new BB Gun . Unfortunately the gun is n't powerful enough to make the targets swing up . Totally uneffective . I wish that it was returnable , but after a few hits by the BB 's the item looks damaged . Live and learn !
 When I ordered this hat I also emailed the company asking questions that not only never got answered , I never received the hat but at the same time was never charged thankfully . They should include the hat 's size in its description .
 It is have a strong chemical smell . I do not fell pleased having my kids playing with it .
 The picture shows a ball with `` synthetic leather stitched '' on it , and the panels looks stitched . The ball received is different ; just one piece rubber - it not good for playing soccer , OK as a toy .
 I ordered the size 3 ball and paid around $ 7 . Well , I got what I paid for . This ball is a joke . It is basically a white rubber ball with black pentagons painted on it . The larger ones may be stitched , but the size 3 is not . Some of the black patches had black marker on it , I 'm assuming to cover scratches . I was n't even looking for a top quality ball -LRB- this is for my 3 year old -RRB- but honestly I would n't keep it if it were free . Well , maybe as a dog toy .
 Over my lifetime of playing and coaching soccer , I had some good soccer balls and some bad . This ball is in name only , a ball , but not much more beyond that.While trying to be somewhat polite about this write up , the ball is more of a plastic bubble that is extremely poor in quality , feel , texture , and even labeling . One of the best features of this ball is the continual losing of air from day one . Nothing like kicking a soft piece of rubber . I would actually speculate that MacGregor used a smaller measuring standard than the Official Size and Weight one used by other soccer brands . Compared to two other size 3 balls , this one was smaller than them , which made me investigate what the official measurements were . Needless to say , MacGregor may have made their own standards up.If you care about your child , never buy this ball .
 The Macgregor Rubber Soccer Ball , size 5 , came in the mail today and along with the ball was a warning label
 Died the second time I used it . Can not send back , as it 's been over 30 days since purchased ! This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned ! I got what I paid for , cheap crap for cheap $ $ $ . Spend a little or a lot more and get quality !
 I owned a 7 '' vector waxer/polisher for 2 years . After using it twice , it died half-way through the third usage . Tried to send it back to Vector -- they did n't even open the package . Spend a few more bucks and get a proper waxer ... most will last a lifetime . Not this one .
 I 've been looking for a scope for a while , trying to find what would be a good option , with good price x performance , and decided to give this one a try . I really regret of the choice I made.Once I got it out of the box I noticed some kind of oil that seemed to go out between the body and the front plastic part . Ok . . since a frind of mine brought it for me , I thought that might be result of atmosphere variation due to the flight.I 've installed on the tripod and the first surprise is that , when in 60X , it is TOO WAY dark . . and I really mean it . Ok , so far , acceptable and I can handle it.Then I installed the T-adapter and connected my Canon EOS on it to check how it performs with Camera . The T-adapter -LRB- Adorama T-Mount for Canon EOS -RRB- itself is very good , and the second surprise was to see that it gets WAY worse through the camera : During daylight , clear sky , and light enough to take a f/4 .0 lens in ISO 100 at 1/2500 or 1/3000 , through the scope you must use 1/30 on ISO 200 . At Celestron webpage they say the scope would be a f/6 ; it is no near that . I 'm not making calculations , but I would suspect it is about f/15 , at least.The third surprise was to see the definition of images is awful . You cant , by no means , take a quality picture through it . You definitivelly cant focus to sharp pictures.I cant recommend this , and I 'll try to sell it to someone that dont have too much expectations for it , since I 'm not in US to return it to Amazon.I 'm not sure if I 'm too used with my Canon 70-200 F/4 L IS USM and my Canon 17-55 F/2 .8 IS USM lenses -LRB- that I know are high-quality pieces -RRB- , or if this scope is really bad , but I 'll be looking for another brand ; I wont try Celestron again .
 I got the crap beat out of me recently . I bought mace . I sent them photos of me after I got attacked . They still just did not deliver the Mace . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY . The product itself seems to work just fine . Its the merchant . I have never had to use the Mace but it seemed just fine . The merchant was the problem .
 I Purchase this product in june of 2010 , and just recently test fired it . The wind blew towards me while test firing , and it smelled like an orange , and my eyes didnt burn , i was n't choking . I went up to the target that I just sprayed , and put my nose directly up to the exact spot where I sprayed , it even touched my nose , and smelled like an orange . And even that did nothing , it didnt even burn the skin on my nose . And the pepper spray doesnt expire until december of 2014 , I even tried shaking it up , and spraying it against the target again and the same thing happened . I am glad I wasnt in an emergency and that I did n't have to rely on this product to defend myself .
 Based on the low price I expected an economy paddle , but these are very poor quality for a product that so proudly labels made in the U.S.A. Not only is the varnish rough , the handles are bound to give splinters they are so poorly finished . Also , one of blades has a split between the joined wood which is bound to crack further in normal usage . About all they are good for is wall art .

 My wife & I bought one of these & it was n't too long before the bushing went bad in the upper control arm . I tried to call the company to order a new bushing , & it seems that they went out of business in November 2012 . Looks like they are just trying to get rid of their extra surplus . Do n't waist your money !
 I 've had the Gazelle for three years now . It was easy to put together . But you are very limited with what you can do . And if you want to really get a workout in , you have to concentrate the entire time on your movements otherwise you will never get tired , or break a sweat . There is NO resistance . My heart rate never climbed high enough for me to ever beleive that I got a good workout . It definitely can work your arms when you push forward down or pull back up . But my legs never felt like they were being worked out even though they were moving . I got bored with the machine after a few weeks and only still have it , because my basement is big enough to keep it in without it taking up too much space . Every once in a while I will jump on it to warm up , but even after 10min , I feel like I have n't done anything more than walk a little bit . No cardio what so ever . The computer gives you an estimate of how many calories you are burning , but it ca n't be accurate since burned calories are measured by considering your weight -LRB- you can not enter that information -RRB- , distance and time . My recommendation if you really want a workout machine is to save your money and invest it in a real elliptical machine . This is the last AS SEEN ON TV machine I buy again.-jj
 I had seen the gazelle on TV and always wanted to try it . When I got mine I was disappointed . I do n't feel like I 'm getting much of a workout and my feet slide all over the platforms , -LRB- even with my brand new sneakers -RRB- , so I have to keep stopping and moving them back into a comfortable position . Also , it 's a little difficult to get into a steady rythm . Overall , I just do n't think it 's worth the money .
 I 'm a 35 y/o male that is 5 ' 10 '' 155lb . Bought this thing a few years back and used it regularly . From my stats you can see I 'm not a big guy nor do I weigh much . I was using it one day when one of the cables holding the foot pedals together just snapped -- making the machine worthless -LRB- the basic cable you see connecting the foot pedal to the machine in the photo , the basic bread and butter of this thing -RRB- . I searched high and low for repair parts but found nothing . Given it 's cheap price I bought another one . I made it just over one year and BAM -- the same darn cable snapped again !! Having just bought the thing a little more than a year ago , again , I searched high and low for a replacement cable . Nothing . I stumbled upon the Tony Little website , looks legit , I called various numbers listed on the site to ask about a replacement cable ... none seemed to work ... they said someone would pick up `` momentarily '' but then I 'd wait 45 minutes and it would hang up on me . Then I finally got through to someone that told me that , contrary to the website -LRB- which has since been updated ! -RRB- that the company making Tony Little 's gazelle was out of business . So total total waste of $ $ $ . As someone who used this thing religiously and liked it -- it BREAKS very easily . You can not get replacement parts . And why Amazon is still selling a product that has n't been manufactured in at least 2 years is beyond me . Do NOT waste your time and $ $ on this thing . A basic cable should be an easy thing to buy given it would be a pretty easy fix . But no ... not with this thing ... . WASTE OF $ $ .
 I am one of those people that hates going to the gym so for days when I ca n't get myself out of the house , I picked this up . It 's better than nothing but be warned that it 's really not much of a workout . You can get moving on it and the speed and level of exercise is really up to how fast you move and how much you attenuate muscles while moving but since it 's a glider , there is no resistance at all . You wo n't break a sweat on this , elliptical users
 If you buy this machine , you are on your own without a warranty because the manufacturer , Fitness Quest is OUT OF BUSINESS .
 Okay , Im actually one of the people who read the reviews before purchasing . Although there were neg , there were more positive so I went on and bought it . however , I wish I could get my money back . This thing makes you feel like you are gliding on air . I didnt even sweat until like 20 minutes in and it was only a couple of beads of sweating ? UGH , I am like a moderate workout person and since having a baby 10 weeks ago , I needed something to help shed the pounds , but this is not the machine for me . I ended getting a membership at the gym for only 20 bucks a month were their are real ellipticals and Im sweating in no time and doing 45 minutes . I now have my edge trainer listed on Craiglist for sale !!!!! There is absolutely no resistance on this thing !!!
 i have had this thing for under a month now and the display thing that tells your time , calories burned , distance is already broke , Ive done nothing harmful to break it , and im sure as hell not going to take it back apart to send it back for a new one , i tried changing to batteries and that didnt work , overall i wish i wouldnt have bought it , and went for a stationary bike instead .
 I way 115 pounds and after using this thing off and on when I could n't get to the gym for 2 years -LRB- so rarely -RRB- The foot petal fell to the floor detaching from the cord that makes it hover . Luckily it happened when i was stepping off after a glide and not while I was gliding . After the first 6 months or so the little machine that told you number of glides and calories burned , time etc. . . stopped working but I did n't really care abou that . Making sure the glider you are putting your weight on does n't fall to the floor mid-workout ... that I am concerned about . I 'm going to try to contact the company to see what they say . I was able to put it back together but I had to leave a washer off ... the screws they use to attach the foot bad to the cord was sooooooo short to begin with that when you stacked all the original washers and such onto the screw there was barely anything left of the screw to actually attach it to the female end ... NO WONDER IT CAME OFF . Was it really going to cost them that much more to use longer screws . The machine does n't really get your heart rate up like a regular elliptical machine or stationary bike but I do think it improves the tone of my leg when I do it for an hour and i really get my torso involved when I swing my arms . I also see now that a man posted pictures of the same area where I had problems but instead of it falling off ... the cord that attaches the foot pad has actually worn down on his .
 Once assembled , the Gazelle does not sit flat on the floor . The back bar is not straight and I have to put a pile of papers under one corner to make it not rock from side to side . No way of knowing until assembled . Too much of a problem to send back .
 well ... its not that great . My main problem with it is that my feet slide all over the place ... I spend most of the 45 minutes a day that I use it trying to reposition my feet . So that part really stinks they should have atleast lined the foot bed with some kind of rubber ... The other part I cant stand is that the computer is not accurate , when I speed up it says I am moving slower . So I dont get it ... I do sweat alot when I use it but that may be b/c I live in Florida and have it set up on my porch-its hard not to sweat here . And lastly there is absolutely no resistance whatsoever ... . So be forewarned that its not all that its hyped up to be ... The only thing thats good about it is the price , but remember you get what you pay for .
 I have used this machine for a few months , initially it was only the feet that hurt , but as time went by , I feel the pain in my knees , they feel sore , simple physics , the elliptical makes u actually move your knees , with the gazelle , your knees are straight while just swinging your legs with pressure on your knees to accommodate the contraction and expansion of the swings ... messing up the cartilage of the knees . I would give this machine a no star ... it HURTS your knees . Do n't buy this piece of junk , $ 120 in the drain .
 Using this machine feels like trying to run with a swing under each foot . Your legs will fly back and forth randomly and it feels awkward . It does n't really feel like you 're getting a good workout . Assembly was easy enough , but the machine was kind of flimsy . I would not recommend this product .
 I bought the Gazelle Edge for those days when going to the gym was not an option . I read a number of reviews and decided that , although this does not do what the gym elliptical does , I could still get a decent workout from home . I guess that depends on what you consider a decent workout.The Gazelle Edge has zero resistance and does not replicate the motion of an actual elliptical machine . When you put your feet on and grab the handles , essentially , you are just sliding them back and forth . I consider this machine an exercie machine only in the sense that you are moving at all - but if you truly want a workout , care to work up a sweat , or in any way challenge your leg or arm muscles - I would pass.Lastly , although the Edge does fold down flat , it still takes up quite a bit of space . Because you must open and close it every time you use it , and retrieve it from wherever you are storing it - be aware it is a little bit heavy , bulky and awkward to move around . To set the Gazelle up in a permanent space will take from you an area that might be better suited to an item that will actually provide a decent workout rather than a platform for you to slide around .
 I have had my Gazelle for over a month now but I was off to a very bad start with it and the company . Assembly was easy and straightforward and of course I wanted to give it a test run after assembly , that 's when I noticed that one of the frame cable ends had been crossed threaded and the knob was no where to be found . I immediately called customer service and found out that they were already shut down for the day . So went online and found where I could email them about the problem . Waited for three business days with no response , then wrote again with no response todate . After waitng for over a week with no reply , I decided to fix the problem myself . Six dollars and a half hour later , the machine was back in working order . Used it daily for about a week and a half and started hearing creaking noises from different pivot points and decided to lubricate all pivot points with good lube -LRB- it was supposed to be prelubed -RRB- . Upon disassembly , it looked like quite a few of the pivoting points had never had any lube applied ! My recommendation is to lube everything possible during the assembly phase . On the plus side , the machine is like any other piece of exercise equipment , you get out of it what you put into it and you can get a pretty good workout from it if you want to . Word of caution , regardless of how good of shape you think you are in , start slowly and for not too long , you use a lot of muscles you 're not used to using . Also the batteries on the timer/recorder only last about a week and a half to two weeks . Because of the initial problems and the lack of product support , I ca n't rate it very high at all . Makes me think that the company figures that once it 's sold it 's someone else 's problem ...
 I love the Elliptical itself but the fitness computer that comes with it looks like it does a lot of wonderful things , but the one that came with ym machine does not work . Very dissapointed ... tried to get a new one but would have to ship the whole unit back and I ca n't even lift the box myself ... Hassle ...
 I borrowed this product from a family member and I am glad I did n't go out and buy one first . This machine would be acceptable for in between workouts of intense aerobic activity days . I worked out on it for 30 minutes -LRB- 2.25 miles -RRB- and I did n't even break a sweat and my heart rate did n't even increase . I thought it was a glorified treadmill , because it 's very easy on the joints . I did have a problem with my toes feeling a little numb after 20 minutes and I needed to adjust my feet every so often to make sure they were in the middle . I was a little disappointed I am used to getting a good aerobic workout -LRB- i.e , step aerobics , elliptical , etc -RRB- .
 its making noise after using it for a week.The display went off as the battery was drained with display on even when not using the machine the previous machine i was using didnot have these problems , Also the price went up .
 My item came shipped via UPS , box was undamaged . I open up to start assembling and found part of the foot pad was chipped and barely usable . I contact technical support and they told me to contact the Gazelle manufacturer . Well , the company went out of business 2 years ago and no company makes parts for it now . Thanks Amazon for selling something that is no loner serviceable or offers tech support .
 i bought this thing in college and granted i had a small apartment but this thing took up way too much space - especially when you are using it you have to be careful you do n't send the dog flying with one stroke . but the worst thing about it is that you do n't get a workout at all . it 's like running in place - but easier . there 's NO resistance , your heartbeat does not rise at all , even after using this thing for 2 full episodes of buffy . and i am not a fitness buff . it eventually became a coat rack and i gave it to my mom 's friend . total waste of money and materials . i would try it out somewhere first before buying it if i were you .
 I am giving this machine 2 stars because although it works -- I lost 10 pounds in a month by using it 3-4 times a week for 15-30 mins -- after 1 month of usage , the machine makes horrible noise . It is so loud , you can not bear it , and if you turn the TV on to silence it , you ca n't even hear the TV ! I used to use it late at night but now I ca n't because it wakes up my kids . I wish the part responsible for this was of better quality so that I could enjoy my machine much longer .
 First of all , you have to work on it for hours to notice anything because there are no hydraulics to give you a real workout . You have to go and go for about an hour if you 're used to an elliptical machine.I did like that I finally got some calf muscles , BUT the overall foot pain I recently had got worse after using this machine . It aggravated my plantar fasciitis and then I found out I have a minor bone spur on the ball of my right foot when I went to a podiatrist after starting to use this . If you have foot pain , do not get any glider ! I spoke to a podiatrist yesterday about the pain I 've been experiencing and found it was directly related to the glider . He explained the muscles will pull going from the underside of the foot , all across the arch , up through the ball of the foot , and all the way up towards the calf muscles . So when you build your calf muscle , you also pull that entire muscle group from the foot , building up the calf as you go . The doctor said 70 % of bone spurs do not cause pain , but since this machine pulls that entire muscle group taut , it pulls it right into my tiny bone spur , causing immense pain . He said ellipticals are much better . I have to sell this machine now , unfortunately . So I repeat , do not get this machine if you have any type of foot pain because it will make it worse . Get an elliptical machine because it does n't focus so much on this group of muscles .
 * squeeeeeak * ... * squeeeeeeeak * ... * squeeeeeeak * . And that 's within one month of owning it !!! Not a very sturdy product . The movement is fine , although it takes some getting used to . If there 's a sturdier -LSB- and probably more expensive -RSB- version , it might be worth checking out .
 One of the cables became detached . Someone could have been seriously injured ! Fortunately I discovered this while not in use .
 For me , the Gazelle just did not cut it , or make any sense really ... Not much of a workout . But I guess for some -LRB- as clearly written in other reviews -RRB- it 's a great workout . I would say it 's a lot like rolling down a hill . Sure , you 're moving , but are you doing much work ? Not really . . but I guess it 's better than not moving at all/just sitting on your bum.I 'm pretty fit already and loved the idea of having a workout machine that I could keep in my apartment for the winter season . I wanted to like the Gizelle and I 'm really disappointed :-LRB- way cheaper than a pesky gym membership . I 'm so bummed I just feel like it 's a waste of time to be on.Personally , I would say save your money and just run in place/do jumping jacks/jump rope , all are much better at raising your heart rate and making you sweat . All of which are what a workout is about ! Not glidding on a toy . It 's like standing in a swing a barely using any effort to push yourself . Physics . This is not a workout.The Gizelle has zero resistance and I feel no burn , no sweat , it 's just too easy . But like I said , I 'm not new to exercise . So I do n't know , maybe for begginers it 's great ... but I still say jogging in place is better!Other than that ... it 's easy to put together , quiet , does n't require a lot of space , and easily folds up for storage.But ... is it worth it ? lol
 I have nothing against Tony Little or his products . Someone left this machine in our garage for free . I used it for a few months to develop some serious chronic hamstring leg and knee problems . I 'm always in pain now because of it . The pain and lack of movement does n't go away . I was fine before only with a year old lower back issue . My left knee developed a serious problem and then the back of my legs are in bad shape from use of this machine . I have to invest in a chiropractor now . I 'm a woman , 48 and would like to caution older people that this product can do more harm then good .
 It would be nice if this was the super-duper product that annoying Tony Little says it is . I will say I have a tricky low back that tends to tighten up more easily than it should . The Gazelle does n't offer a natural range of motion - it seems to force you to lean forward causing low back strain . It 's also not stable enough to get to an intensity level that would be beneficial . I could only use this a couple of times before giving it away ... probably the worst piece of exercise equipment I 've ever tried/bought . A Nordic Track is a much better choice in the lower price range
 Absolutely no workout . More strenuous walking slow outside , or walking slow up stairs . Extremely disappointed and not worth any amount of money .
 Waste of money , used this for 2 weeks straight never got a workout . I have tried selling it in Craig 's List for the past year for 30 dollars and no takers . Craig 's List is full of them , luckily i bought it for 25 dollars at a garage sell . Do n't waste your money .
 There 's no resistance on this product so you will basically glide away for hours and never break a sweat or increase your heart rate . Waste of time .
 I am so anxiety to get this together and start using it . BUT I CA N'T REMOVE THE NUTS.I have even bought a nut remover to put on my electric drill to try to remove them.I am so aggravated , guess I will need to wait for a male friend to come around to try .
 I would like to start off by saying i have never done a review on a product i bought over amazon before . I just buy the product and go about my buissness and i have bought a lot and i mean a whole lot of products from here.Although when i encounter a product that is not good and i believe is being deceived to other people i have to say something.The product arrived it came broken . i couldnt set it up it had a dent that wouldnt let me finish the set up and deep scratches all over.The same day i opened it was the same day i packaged it to be returned.I really didnt get to use the product.Although the reveiews have a tremendous effect on what people buy.There are some reviews that seemed to be staged here.There is a saying thats says `` products that come cheap always turns out expensive '' . In other words you buy a cheap product thinking its a good deal but it turns out you end wasting more money fixng it.Just be careful alot of people buying this obviously works hard for their money and its looking for a good deal go to craiglist and see products in person or something.Oh and always remember when a product has more than 1 bad reveiws its bad enough .
 I would n't suggest this product.First , it is made of shotty material . The screws do n't all line up with the holes they go into and after trying to redo them twice they were stripped . Three of the four screws on the bottom are sticking out sideways , I could also just pull two of them out without even unscrewing them.Second , the electronic read out stopped working after a month . The calorie counter said I burned like 400 calories in the first 5 minutes , which is obviously not true . It also twists when you are using the gazelle . The only thing it is good for is keeping track of how long you have been on it.Third , I know I would get a better excercise if I just jumped up and down . There is no way to adjust the tension , does n't make your heart rate go up , or make you sweat . I am not in the best shape , but I could only see someone actually gettin a work out from this if they were grossly obese and were kick starting an excercise routine.I was n't expecting much from this considering the price , but it 's even worse than I was expecting . All that being said I would n't consider this a `` workout '' device , more of just something to do while watching TV and entertaining my dog . I would recomend buying a cheap used elliptical from craigslist or a jumprope instead .
 i got this after i had my first baby . i used 5 to 7 days a week . i used it an hour each time and i also used the ab lounge 5 to 7 days a week for an hour each time with it . i did not lose any weight and did not have any result after 3 months using it . the only thing that work was going for a walk and doing yoga . the ab lounge and gazelle are both junk and a waste of money .
 Do n't buy it . For obese people who have n't ran more than a yard in their lives . Abosultely nothing happens . No , leaning forward on it like a freak wo n't do much either . Do n't buy it .
 I purchased this machine a couple of years ago after seeing it on TV . It does n't have any resistance to it at all , so basically your just in the air swinging your legs back and forth . I used it for a week about 45 min every day and never once broke out in a sweat or felt like I did anything . I guess if you want to say you worked out without really doing it than this is for you . My advise to others ... pass the gazelle up and get something else !
 My review is not about the product . I have n't been able to use my product because it came broken . It was such a small part that I thought rather than go through the trouble of shipping it back to Amazon , I would just call Fitness Quest . Big Mistake !! It 's been a month and a half and they have yet to get the correct part to me . In my initial call I described in detail what was broken and they told me it would come in 7 to 10 business days . After waiting the full 10 days , I still had not received it . I called back and so began another month of yes it 's in stock , no it 's not in stock , etc. . They finally said the end of last week that they would overnight it . I received the part today and it 's the wrong one . I 'm so tired of dealing with them and my window to return the whole thing to Amazon ends this week -LRB- Amazon no longer sell them directly so I ca n't get an exchange -RRB- . My advice is if there 's anything wrong with your product , go back to the seller and do n't bother dealing with Fitness Quest !
 This machine does nothing for you , is awkward to use , and makes the bottom of your feet BURN . Unfortunately , that 's the only part of the body that feels any burn . You ca n't even break a sweat on this thing . Useless waste of money .
 Not very durable . I went through an entire can of WD-40 on this thing over the last year and it final broke on me this morning . You get what you pay for . Would not recommend this product .
 i was so disappointed ! the machine started to fall apart in less then 3 days . and after working out for an hour i did n't feel anything nor did i sweat .
 I ordered this machine after reading some reviews and doing independent research . The product got here quickly , but once I opened the packaging and attempted to put the machine together things started to become problematic . If the directions are followed exactly as they appear in the insert the machine will not come together as it is supposed to . However you will still get a decent workout hefting around the bulky pieces trying to get the machine to open properly , which becomes even more tricky as the factory lubricant smears all over the slick metal . It may be a decent work out once assembled properly , however after an hour and a half of attempting to assemble I decided to walk away .
 Well I bought this Gazelle just over a year ago . I wanted something cheap but I definitely got what I paid for . I liked the work outs . . I was really overweight -LRB- though much less than the max 250 lbs -RRB- and just beginning an exercise program and needed very low impact.Well that it is . . no resistance at all . But I liked just going and going for about 2 hours and at least getting the heart rate up.I could not wear sneakers with the pedals since they kept slipping off dangerously so I did it barefoot which really hurt my soles and made them numb . I figured it was just me and the type of shoes I was trying to wear.Then there was also an immediate and loud squeak that my neighbours used to complain about and which no amount of lube or WD 40 would fix.But I needed to lose weight so I kept on going till one day , the metal attachment for the cable just popped ... while I was gliding . Needless to say , a rather nasty fall happened and I hurt my ankle and foot . Now it is a rather expensive clothes rack just sitting there . My advice ... save up to buy a proper elliptical and give this product a miss .
 The Gazelle will provide a light workout for the average user , good for someone who 's trying to take a regular evening stroll but finds the weather not cooperating . If you 're really aggressive about it you can get your heart rate up high . However , I started experiencing joint pain after using it in this way . The shoulder pain was from my arms being short ; they jerked in their sockets at the end of each stride . I 'm not sure if the knee pain was related to my legs being short or if it would have happened anyway . In the end I was only able to use my legs and use them in short , reasonably slow strides in order to avoid injury . Even while using light weights for my arms , I was unable to get my breath coming faster , let alone break a sweat.For about the same amount , maybe even less , you can get a Stamina In-Stride mini-elliptical . It 's louder and it will ruin your carpet if you do n't keep it on a towel , but it 's very sturdy , gives a much better workout , has some tension adjustment , and will kill your quads . I recommend going with that instead .
 I have the Gazelle Edge two stars instead of one because it is at least decently made and reasonably sturdy once it is assembled . I bought this item because of the good reviews at Amazon . Unfortunately , it does not provide a good work out , and is only appropriate for people who have never exercised in their lives . It has a rather limited range of motion and is really nothing like an elliptical machine . Is it better than nothing ? Of course it is , but not much .
 I purchased this product almost a year ago . I have used it apx 20 times and it is now squeaking , has a broken piece and the calorie counter is broken . I would not purchase this product again . I failed to pay attention to the negative reviews that had similar experiences as mine . Please pay attention to all the reviews .
 I bought this piece of junk about two months ago and now it has been placed in the garage . It does work out your calves but other than that you might break a drop of sweat , ONLY -LRB- that being my case -RRB- . You really have no idea how fast I had to operate this machine so that i could feel that i was actually having a good workout . I think this machine is ok for older people who have knee problems and stuff like that , or for people who have never exercised in their life , but if you 're trying to lose weight -LRB- after changing your eating habits ... the gazelle does not complement your effort -RRB- and break a sweat consider spending more money . In addition , after 10 min my feet felt numb . After all , it was only 100 dollars , but i learned my lesson and pretty much you get for what you pay .
 The Good : I purchased the Gazelle Edge and got a great price . The shipping time was quick and I received the machine in good condition . -LRB- Shipping took about 3 days -RRB- It only took about 20 minutes to assemble and is pretty sturdy for its size . I 'm 6 ' 4 '' about 245 lbs and when I 'm on the machine , it is solid.The Bad : The problem I have with the machine is that to get a workout it takes over an hour . I can run on it for 30 minutes and still not break a sweat and I am not a runner . Now I knew from other reviews that there was no resistance with this model but I figured I do n't work out now so anything is better than nothing . Where this is true , I would recommend spending the extra money and getting a machine that you can grow with , something that has adjustable resistance settings so you can adjust those instead of extending the time you spend on this machine.I do not recommend buying the Gazelle Edge because there are many other and better excercise machines on the market that will give you a much better workout .
 This product would be ok if you were seriously obese or injured ... otherwise not enough resistence . I will use it when there is no other option of working out ... Waste of $ 100 ...
 I purchased the Gazelle Edge for my husband approx . 2 years ago . He uses it daily . The problems we have had are :1 . We ca n't seem to get rid of the loud squeeking even though we have oiled it with WD-40 .2 . The frame has cracked twice now in the handle bar area.We would like to replace it , however I would like to know if they have improved on the frame .
 I have to say that I have used several of these Gazelles , I purshaed one new and it lasted about a year before the rubber on the cables wore out and broke . I have bad knees so this low impact machine is good for that reason . But they have NO durability what so ever . I am on my 5th machine now , I do not buy new ones any longer because they are not worth the price . I can find all I want on Craiglist for $ 25 to $ 50.00 . So that is what I do , when one breaks down I just find another used one .
 This thing was embarrassing to buy , but I 'd really hoped I 'd use it in front of the TV or for a few minutes a day and it 'd make a difference . There 's no resistance and I do n't really understand how you 're &#34; working out &#34; when you use it .
 The gazell arrived on time but they sent me two right swing arms . I tried calling the company many times but they never answered and the line was always busy .
 The price is right and it does give me some exercise , but not much . It is bulkier than I wanted , even when folded up . The action is more like a ride than actual muscle exertion . I think it would be too dangerous for most elderly persons to manage getting on & off . I use mine , since it is all I have & it is too hot outside right now . But I really wish I had n't purchased it . Positives -- it is exactly what they told you it is ; it is well made & stable -LRB- does not tip or rock -RRB- ; it does fold -LRB- easily -RRB- so you can lean it against the wall & regain the floor space .
 Imagine a weight machine with no weights or an exercise bike without a chain . Do you think you could get a good workout with such equipment ? No , you ca n't . The reason is because there would n't be any resistance , you would just be going through the motions , your body would n't be pushing or pulling against anything . Well that is exactly how I would describe the Gazelle Edge.IT HAS NO RESISTANCE.I put my index fingers on the top of the handle bars and was able to easily get this going without any effort from my legs . That 's how little resistance there is . It 's like the manufacturer wanted to make operating this as easy as possible . It is totally worthless.If you are looking for a workout then save your money and get something , no ... ANYTHING else .
 I 've had this machine since it first hit the market a few years ago . Everyone in my family has tried it with little result . I used it for 1 - 3 hours EVERY DAY for a few weeks . I have great calves . It works no other area , I did n't lose a single pound with the gazelle . I hardly break a sweat even given the lengnth of time that I spend on it . Add that 's it 's absolutely dangerous to have around young children and you 'll can bet your money will be better spent to swallow your pride , join a good fitness center , and dedicate yourself to going . -- Jeannie
 This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever bought . It is a swing , not a workout machine ! Your legs just go back and forth for hours , with no actual workout . Yes , you are moving and that burns calories , but a walk would do you more good in less time . The only people who need this machine are the housebound , the snowbound and children . My five year old niece can swing on it for hours !
 I owned this untill it fell apart . I am a larger person , 250lbs . The rating of this junk is about 200lbs . Be small to get small . I could use this for 45 min to an hours 4 to 5 times a week UNTIL my arms started going to sleep . Little did I know that this was the first symptom of repetative motion problems -LRB- tennis elbow -RRB- . There are other MUCH better machines out there to use unless you are already a small light person . Notice that no LARGE people are demonstrating these machines ...
 I worked at GNC and when this came out it was on display and yes I did get on and try it ! It seems like your feet go all over the place almost as I can remember . It is not sturdy . And to be honest it just looks so ... small ! I would want something that at least looked macho ! And I 'm a girl . -LRB- acct holders wife hehe -RRB-
 Are you kidding me ? I bet most of these reviews are n't even legitimiate . This is a useless piece of junk . Do n't waste your money on this useless product . A review for it can be summed up in one word , `` ripoff ''
 We bought a Gazelle 3 1/2 years ago . I wish I could turn back the clock and erase that purchase . I used it for 6 months with no results . I decided to double my workout on the Gazelle . I 've had knee pain ever sinse . My patellas no longer track properly . I can no longer run , jump , or walk long distances . Buying the Gazelle was the worst decision I have ever made in my life .
 I am an active person and no matter how i used this model i could not drop a bead of sweat . Of course i do not own this model and tested at a relatives . It is not worth the cost no matter how cheap .
 I bought the product because it claims to be a low-impact alternative that produces results . The only result it produced was nearly throwing my husband on the floor as he struggled to keep balance and the biggest impact was to my wallet.I worked with the device for a month with no results , it raised my heart rate by only a point or two after a twenty minute `` workout '' . The device is large and unruly , you spend more time trying to keep your balance than getting an aerobic workout.Assembling and returning it proved to be more of a workout than actually using the product . Do n't waste your time with this one .
 Warning , please read the full review
 I bought this product a few months ago and honestly I should have listened to some of the reviews . This does not give you a cardio workout if you are already in shape . It does however , work the leg muscles and keeps them toned . I needed for the winter and I will probally be getting rid of it.The quaulty is poor as well . The clock that keeps track of distance etc. , never worked from day 1 . It is also ver noisy now and it has only been about 3 months.This product is more for people who just need to get moving , not for those who consider themselves inshape . I do n't think I have sweated once using it and I rev it up in attempt to make the workout worth it .
 To give you an example of the type of workout it gives you , my resting heart rate is 76 , if I walk around the house during normal activity , my heart rate is 100 . If I do the Gazelle for 30 minutes , my heart rate is 106 . So I dont reach my target aerobic workout heart rate , I do n't burn any fat , and I wasted my time and money . Cleaning the house works me out better than this . Why do you think none of the other reviewers break a sweat ? If you want to get great aerobic workout , spend $ 5 , buy a jumprope and do that for 30 mins. , that 'll get your heartrate moving , no kidding !
 Owned a Tony Little Gazelle -LRB- same as the Edge -RRB- for several years . Had NO problem with the cables as others have mentioned -LRB- probably because I did n't use it all that much -RRB- . The comments about feet sliding are all true . When I nestled my sneaker against the front edge the sneaker `` lip '' was slightly too high and hurt my toe , so I tried to move back . As a result of moving back my foot would slide all over the platform . When I worked out until I raised a sweat I found that my knees would `` lock '' and for days after I 'd be in pain . So I was left unmotivated to use it , was n't worth the pain ... wound up giving it away in perfect condition . Bought a treadmill instead and am a happy camper .
 I had one of the original Tony Little Gazelle 's in early 2000 . It was white , very sturdy and with incredible balance . This Gazelle Edge is no comparison . Very tinny and unstable with a limited motion range . Sent it back .
 This machine seems is a great buy , but on mine the computer that tracks calories burned does n't work . Otherwise I like it
 Based on the low price I expected an economy paddle , but these are very poor quality for a product that so proudly labels made in the U.S.A. Not only is the varnish rough , the handles are bound to give splinters they are so poorly finished . Also , one of blades has a split between the joined wood which is bound to crack further in normal usage . About all they are good for is wall art .
 I build a few bikes and have used SRAM components since before they were SRAM . Simply , Sachs made them better.I bought this for an 8-speed touring build and had to return it because the teeth on the cogs were n't true . I purchased the same cassette from another source and did n't realize the QC issues until it was on my All-Rounder . I do n't notice any noticeable lag in shifting , but spinning the freewheel , you can see the individual cassettes wavering side-to-side . That 's simply unacceptable for new drive train components.Now , the reality is for most people this will work perfectly fine and will replace an aging cassette or give new life to an older bike . But , for those of us that still ride 8-speeds in the rear and are particular about their parts , be advised . Two bum cassettes is enough for me to order an HG-70 even with a lesser spread . I do n't find these issues across the parts lines with the Big S , but if you have to stay with the current , modern offerings from SRAM to have have-way decent manufacturing specs , I and many others will remember and decide accordingly .
 I have had many scopes before trying this one and based on all the good reviews on Amazon and I purchased a Celestron 52250 . The Celestron has good image quality only at 20X but at the higher magnifications the image deteriorates dramatically , the eye relief is not good either.After using it for a year and 3 months the prism has gone dark and I can no longer see through the scope , it 's junk . My advice , would be to spend a little extra and go for a Kowa or Leica , you wo n't regret it .
 I bought this scope for long range shooting and although I did n't expect it to work at 600-1000 yards , I would at least have expected to be able to see a 30 cal . bullet hole in a white target at 300 yards , but the resolution at high power is absolutely atrocious . It might be great for birdwatching or spying on your neighbors , but otherwise it is junk .
 I bought the Charger Hard Hat . Looks geat in the pic ! It came as white , not blue , and the bolt is orange , not gold . Very bad . Amazon told me to go to a page that does n't seem to exist to fix this problem . Not a happy customer !
 The product picture shows the real MRE crackers and what you get is totally different . Some crappy things they would give you on an airplane . The only thing as far as I can tell , that 's similar to an MRE is the entree.Anyway , do n't make my mistake an order here if you want real MREs!Yes , I was in the Army for eight years and I know what a real MRE contains .
 Product description did not say it did not come with a way to heat them up . I guess its my fault because it did not say it did either . Who sells MREs without some way to heat them ? What am I suppose to do boil water every time or eat them cold ? I wo n't buy again . These are not true Military MREs .
 Be nice if the `` F `` ing idiots told you how many MREs you get for 70 bucks plus 23.50 shipping . I can guess how many but add the price and the shipping and they are n't worth close to that .
 I order for them a month ago . I have always got the stuff i order for within a week or so . But they still have not shipped the stuff i ordered . They will not write you back . They do n't care if you need something or not . DO NOT ORDER FOR THEM .
 The entrees average less than 300 calories per package . I think there 's about 500 calories total per package , from what I 've opened so far.The coffee is 97 % CAFFEINE FREE !!! WHY PUT IN COFFEE IF THERE IS NO CAFFEINE?Now I have to go buy coffee for every damn package so I have real coffee . This is NOT a good survival choice in my opinion , once you know what is in the packages.The packages come in individual clear plastic bags . They are not packaged in airtight bags , or at least mine were n't . I have seen no MRE heater with the meal . There is a flimsy plastic spoon , and a packet of salt like you would get at McDonald 's . I am VERY disappointed with this . Perhaps there is a small packet of black pepper , and oh joy how my spirits would be lifted.Kind of too late for me now , since I already ordered these 4 cases . You could buy all of this stuff yourself and probably spend half of what they are charging for these MREs.If you are looking for MREs , I do n't know where the better deal is , but I do n't think it 's with these guys.I feel like they took advantage of me . I will not be ordering from them again.Ask them what the hell they were thinking before you order , and you will be doing yourself a big favor.Don ' t blindly order like I did .

 Gave this to my 7.5-year-old son . There are metal rings on the underside to hold the pins that push into the ground and secure the pitcher 's plate in the ground . While using it for the second time , the rubber along the edge of one of the rings cracked almost completely around the ring . We only used it in our grass backyard for family baseball games ... not even real baseball on dirt with a team of boys .
 This speedometer was inoperable - the needle simply jumped around . something inside is stuck . I was able to use the cable and sending unit which mounts on the wheel hub with my old speedometer , whose cable had broken .
 If you need to replace a used battery you will be charged at least $ 45 plus shipping and handling!If you do not pay the $ 40 waterproof test you will lose that feature!More than that , they had broken the watch 's cronograph and their quality control -LRB- do they have one ?! -RRB- did nothing ! I do not recommend you buying this kind of Seiko watches !
 These numbers got here on time but at the finish of the race started to fall apart on some of the sweaty runners . I had the stub on a spindle as the runners came into the chute but some of the stubs fell apart at the hole.Luckily these pieces had names on them so I could place them . I will insist on pure Tyvek numbers next time .
 I ordered this based on the Franklin name and the one review it had . I was looking for a whole outdoor game set up , but this was not what I expected . The horseshoes are thin , hollow plastic -LRB- a strong wind could blow them away ! -RRB- , the frisbee is nowhere near regulation size , net poles were flimsy , etc , etc. . Everything about this set was cheesey and cheap . It got shipped back the same day as delivery . When looking at these things always remember , you get what you pay for ...
 Polar F11
 After less than 1 year , the first F11 I bought had the display freeze up . To Polar 's credit , they replaced it under warranty . The second F11 was unable to pick up the signals from the WearLink transmitter . I replaced the battery , but it still did n't work ! Had to buy a T31 coded tranmitter -LRB- another $ 50 -RRB- , which then worked.Now my second F11 's display has frozen!I have a Polar S210 for cycling that was purchased in 2000 that still works as well as the day I bought it-replaced the battery twice . Also have my first very basic Polar HRM purchased in 1993 , and it still works , I know the company puts out quality products , but in this case I fell for the marketing hype and the added features -LRB- most of which I do n't use -RRB- . In my opinion , the F11 is a lemon . Do n't buy it .
 I loved this heart rate monitor . Yes , it does have reliability issues . But I was able to overlook that . It felt like I had my own personal trainer . It was a nice gadget . I loved tracking my workout progress . Then after a month and a half of everyday use . It died . Maybe I just had a bad one . But if I 'm going to spend $ 150 and it is only going to last a month . I do n't think it is worth it .
 I have used this product for several years with good results . In the past year , the quality of the goggles has decreased to the point to which they are unreliable . The goggles leak and wo n't seal . When a person is in a mile swim part of a triathlon , she should n't have to worry about leaking goggles . The company has n't responded to any emails . I 'm looking for a new type of goggles to use .
 The extra width of the googles came down to far on my nose and caused my nose piece to fall off . Did not seal to keep out water . I hated them .
 These goggles left deep marks in my forehead and cheeks , did not quite seal around my nose -LRB- been told I have a Roman nose , and my hat size is large -RRB- , and maybe because the seal was bad they even fogged up ! MAYBE someone with a smaller head and face would have more success ... * Instead I would recommend the same company 's Aqua Sphere Vista Lady Swim MaskAqua Sphere Vista Lady Swim Maskand/or the Aqua Sphere Vista Swim MaskAqua Sphere Vista Swim Mask . They fit similar and have way more soft silicone-like plastic around the edges which seals gently but AIR TIGHT . I have a pair of each now -LRB- the ladies version does n't come with a dark lens for outside -RRB- and they never fog , never leak , leave minimal marks on my face -LRB- main reason I purchased them -RRB- , and fit both my husband and I perfectly . And the vision through them is SO CLEAR it 's unbelievable . I believe they 're made in Italy .
 Bought this product because prolonged use of standard goggles were making rings around my eyes & under eye area puffy & dark . Thought going to a larger mask-type goggle would reduce that problem . However , the fit was not very good with these goggles , over the nose area in particular . The strap had to be so tight to prevent leaking , that I 've just gone back to standard goggles .
 I am very upset with this swim mask . My prior one lasted one year before leaking . This one lasted 12 swims and now leaks immediately upon entering the water . I find the small goggles tortuous and now read that for swimmers `` of a certain age '' , they can cause permanent damage to the tender , thin undereye skin . Now what for women with narrow faces ? Of course , I want to send the mask back but it is too late . I hardly used the mask the first month or two that I had it because I was swimming indoors -LRB- it 's Florida but the heated outdoor pools are too cold for me ! -RRB- . I feel cheated ! I would give the mask no stars had I that option .
 I ordered this sword display stand , so I can display my sword collection . When I received my shipment , I noticed that I was missing 2 screws that were crucial in putting it together . The display stand had a number of nicks and scratches on it , which I found surprising since the box was shipped inside another box 10 times bigger then the actual box itself and stuff with paper to prevent movement during shipping . The samurai medallion is plastic , not metal , which I also found disappointing .
 This item looks very nice with shining aluminum frames as shown in picture . The foam inside is thick and good quality . The top lid bends very easily especially near the middle handle , probably because it is very long -LRB- 53 inches -RRB- with little frame support , and supported mainly by plastic panels only . It is a little tough to align the top and bottom latch to lock . I had to bend the lid so it will latch with the bottom half . You may unlatch by push in the plastic panel with your thumb ; it is not very strong .
 These numbers got here on time but at the finish of the race started to fall apart on some of the sweaty runners . I had the stub on a spindle as the runners came into the chute but some of the stubs fell apart at the hole.Luckily these pieces had names on them so I could place them . I will insist on pure Tyvek numbers next time .
 I purchased this for my son 's birthday 3 weeks ahead of time -LRB- mistake # 1 with a 30-day return policy -RRB- . I carefully assembled the gun correctly -LRB- on a scale of 1 to 10 , it was a 7 in difficulty -RRB- . We went out to shoot and got thru abt 25 rounds and the action lever snapped . Also , the laser site did n't work.It 's a cool looking gun ... but that 's abt it.Steer clear of this gun .
 I think it not so awesome because the sight is too small and the light that comes with it does not work so well and the back stock is also small and its not what it seems like . its good for playing but for shooting in a air soft war your doomed .
 I bought these to keep my feet warm while motorcycling during winter . The first thing I noticed was they did not stay up ! I was not even walking around , but was riding my motorbike and the socks slouched down into my boot . When I did get off of the bike , they were bunched up under my foot and around my ankle - which was not comfortable . Mind you , I am an 5 ' 3 &#34; and my calves are not large . I bought these due to the positive reviews and was greatly disappointed . I found the Wrangler boot socks work much better ! These just were not worth the money !
 I ordered these looking for some thin ski socks that are warmer than what I currently have . I was initially impressed with the quality . They seemed as warm as my other ski socks and were very comfortable . However , after wearing them skiing twice , the upper part of the socks got way too stretched out and would not retain their original shape . The calf portion was so stretched out the socks would just pool at my ankles . Washing in hot water did n't help . None of my other ski socks have had this problem . If you wear a smaller size -LRB- 8 or 9 -RRB- or have insanely skinny calves , this may not be an issue for you .
 These were supposed to go up to women 's size 9.5 . I wear 8.5 shoe and I 'm 5 ' 6 &#34; and they were too small on my feet and did not go up my calves high enough . They would be okay for a girl with small feet that is not very tall . I probably wo n't even be able to use them after I wash them .
 Purchasers should be advised that although the seller lists these as a `` set , '' what you get is one bracket and one backing plate . This should be made more explicit on the page . If you need to replace both brackets , you need to order two sets . Ordering one set will allow you to hang only one side of your pontoon ladder.Otherwise the order was fine and aside from a slow delivery it appears to be what is promised .
 The reason I spent the extra money on the F11 was because of the ability to track and store you workouts on your computer . There is no stand alone software , you need to create an account on the Polar.fi website and upload your workouts . The way you upload is via a microphone connected to your computer , as a small speaker in the watch makes a buzzing noise . The Polar website is VERY poorly designed , and often does n't work -LRB- you can not log in -RRB- . Even if you do log in , the usability is often not working . After spending an hour , and using a mic , and then trying a headset , I was unable to upload date.In short DO NOT BUY the F11 , save your money and buy a cheaper model.On the positive side , the heart rate monitor seems to work fine , and there is a slightly more comfortable chest strap .
 I am currently sending my F11 back to Amazon for a replacement . The transmitter -LRB- chest strap -RRB- stopped working after just two workouts , and I think the battery must have been bad . I think the device will be good - once I get one that works . I was impressed with the features that I had a chance to try out so far . My poor review is for the manufacturer , not the product . I tried 3 times to get in touch with Polar to have them tell me how to get a replacement directly from them - once through their website customer service and twice by direct email to their customer support department . Never did I get a reply . Even the threat of posting a negative review at Amazon generated no response . So here it is , Polar - work on your customer support if you want to keep customers happy.Update
 The Polar F11 is reputed to be one of the better heart rate monitors . If that is true , I shudder to think what the lesser models must be like.The biggest problem is the `` wrist unit '' , as Polar calls it , and the built-in receiver in particular . The signal sent by the transmitter on the chest strap is received just fine by most types of fitness equipment ; yet the F11 is having a good day if it picks the signal up a third of the time . What remains is an ugly wristwatch for $ 150 -- and not a very good watch , either.A single drop onto a sharp corner will destroy the F11 wrist unit ; Polar , probably knowing the utter absence of any sort of robustness , expressly excludes this condition from the warranty.But even if it is not broken _ and _ having a good day , the F11 is loaded with junk . The `` OwnZone '' feature purporting to determine your optimal exercise intensity ? You are better off listening to your breathing . The `` FitTest '' , claiming to produce a number comparable to your VO2max ? Laughable . Even the backlight is ridiculous
 I read reviews to find the best heart rate monitor on the market . They all said `` buy the Polar F11 '' so I did . In 18 months I replaced the battery in the watch three times and in the chest strap four times . I experienced eratic readings more than anything else - heart rates from 0 for most of a long run or 220 + when I was running easy . It would hop from low to extremely high to about right and then go to zero . When I sent it back to Polar along with a letter to tell them the problems I had with it , they sent me a bill for $ 50 and all they had done was replace the batteries ... again . I was really disappointed with my experience especially after reading the reviews .
 You ca n't simply enter what heart rate targets you want - it only gives you ones it makes up on its own . You even must enter what DAY you were born , before you can use it - preventing others from using it without loads of set-up time . If the watch strap breaks , you must BUY A NEW WATCH because the strap is unusual . Many of the features ca n't be used without additional software and trouble .
 If you want a great heart rate monitor for about 6 months then this is the one for you . Mine no longer monitors my heart , but it is still an attractive sports watch , even after new batteries . I would have given more stars for the 6 months that it worked , but I subtracted a star for every $ 40 or so that I paid for it .
 My F11 starting failing after a couple of years . It would run up to 220 BPM even though no was else was in sight . Or it would just shut down altogether and then start back up . And even if it had n't failed , it was not very intuitive at all . Terrible menu system . Hello Garmin Forerunner 305 - perfect .
 I was told by a trainer that this is a great piece of equipment . If you already know heart monitors it might be a good choice , I bought it and the list of things one has to do to use it seems to never end . When I go the the gym I hold onto a part of the exercise equipment and it says what range I am in . I am looking for the same ease of use in a heart rate monitor . I tried to contact customer service with no luck . The P-11 is useless to me . Some day I hope to find a real heart rate monitor .
 I 've had this product for a couple of years now . I bought it after one of the plastic buttons on my old Polar watch broke.The problem with this watch is that the buttons on the side are too easy to press and there is no `` lock '' feature to keep them from being pressed . Because of this , whenever my wrist is cocked at an extreme angle , the back of my hand pushes in on one of the buttons on the right side of the watch or pushes the watch in such a way as to push a button on the left side.Because of this , it is always going into some mode that I do n't want . And when I have tried to use the more advance functions , it often resets because of the way I moved my hand that causes a button to be pushed . So , I only get a full log of my workout about half the time.Based on this and the problem with my previous Polar HR watch , I wo n't be buying one of their watches in the future .
 I purchased the F6 five years ago and after 18 months started having problems with the watch displaying my heart rate as 00 . Sometimes it would display my heart rate as other inaccurate numbers . I was out of warranty but was told to send it in and pay $ 25 for Polar to check out any possible problems . They sent back the same watch and strap and said it should work . One month later ... same problem . Two years ago I purchased the F11 in hopes that paying more would alleviate the problem . The exact same problems have arisen after 18 months . Spoke to technical support once again and they said to send it in , pay another $ 25 -LRB- not to mention the shipping fees -RRB- and they would check for problems . I felt that there must be something else causing the same problem but went ahead and had the batteries in the chest strap and the watch replaced . Next day ... same problem . I now have nothing good to say about Polar . Consumer Reports just noted that the Timex Personal Trainer T5G971 for only $ 50 is their highest rated heart-rate monitor . Sorry Polar .
 The Polar F11 was my first HRM . It was a revelation to follow and track my HR . For the first time I understood where I was in my exercise sessions.The user interface on the F11 is complicated . I spent way too much time sitting with the wrist unit in one hand and the user guide written in 10 point type in the other hand . The design team at Polar need to take a lesson from the folks at Apple . Hello iPhone . Note to Polar
 These knieves look nice and are made of quality metal but are much harder to throw.If you read Rip Thorn 's book you will not his suggestion that one learns and practices with a 9 inch long blade.This is very true.Unfortunately the seller scalps you on the shipping charges so that returning the merchandise becomes too costly.So now I am stuck with these . Overall , unless you are a collector -LRB- then you would not neeed 3 units -RRB- do not by them
 not so good . Balance is off , and tip bends after a couple throws . BUY SOMETHING ELSE
 The `` booklet '' it was supposed to come with was a small pamplet , does not really explain much about it or how to use it . The dummy was cheaply made the string broke within the first few days ... better as a chew toy ...
 wore this item once . Waist draw string broke . One tug on the draw string and that was it . Very cheap material .
 Rather disappointed in the quality of the item . I have purchased other windshirts and found this one to be a very low quality
 I was disappointed in the performance of the balls on this purchase . They did not perform as well it seemed . I noticed the structure and color of the lime green High Visibility ball had changed from a bright solid color to more of a Crystal color , which no mention was made of this . I tried them and was disappointed . My last box was just ordered .

 Purchased this and found that the seat portion is set permanently on a decline which is not suitable for a flat bench workout . Even in a decline position , I found that having a bench with a seat that remains horizontal is safer . Returned this item .
 feels durable has some weight to it but tee top started to split after one practice !!! not acceptable at all for a coach and 60 dollars later . will never purchase this brand again or recommend to anyone .
 I have had this for a while now and it work better than I though it would.I wish I could change the rate that I gave the first time.I would now give it a 5 start rate.It has come in handy a few time here in the last few days.I build bicycle for people that would not be able to have a bicycle any other way.This is what makes me happy to see the smiles on little kids faces.So if any one needs a chain whip then get this little one its works great .
 This manual was not what I wanted or hoped it would be . I was looking for a manual that would provide a fair amount of detail about how to completely disassemble , clean , lubricate , and reassemble an M1 Garand . This manual is for military ordnance personnel who worked in an ordnance depot on M1 's i.e. professionals who are reworking or retrofitting or repairing M1 's . It is full of usage of very specialized gages , fixtures , reamers , etc. that the common M1 owner would not have nor likely need for routine disassembly/assembly .
 According to the description , `` This is not the smaller version that came out later '' . I was expecting the full size manual -LRB- 8 1/2 x 11 -RRB- like I 've owned in the past . I suppose it 's the same information , but it was n't what I expected . I 'll keep it for the info it contains , but I 'm still looking for the `` correct '' manual .
 In a word JUNK ! Not made well and the function is not at all &#34; quick detachable &#34; I will only use the stainless lugs and nothing else . Not worth 5 bucks .

 good fit but trigger arm was too short . Had to buy extension to make it work and that ended up making the total cost way more expensive than what this release is worth .
 The item description states it is a stained glass lamp shade . Completely false ! The lamp shade was made of cheap plastic and the design was slightly different than shown in the picture . Buyer beware ! On a side note , Amazon has been very cooperative and helpful with initiating the return process .

 very stubby neck , not long like pictured . and that 's what I was looking for was a long neck , flexible . I opened the box and its the handled funnel with about a one inch neck , why do you show a long neck and send a short stub ????
 I 've had this lantern for less than a year . The battery will no longer recharge . Since the battery can not be replaced , the lantern is now junk .
 Seems like a great idea
 At the end of hurricane season Nov. 30,09 I put my Coleman 2 bulb rechargeable and my Swiss Gear rechargeable lanterns away.At the start of hurricane season Jun 1,10 I took them out again . The Colman lit right up . I still charged over night . When I took the Swiss Gear out it would not light except for the night light . When I tried to charge it the full charge LED came on . I still charged over night . It was the same . I noticed a little darkening on end of the tubes . So I bought new ones . Same thing . So I took the bulbs out and trashed the lantern.My new Coleman Quad from Amazon.com arrived yesterday .
 After one year and three camping trips , it no longer holds a charge . New battery for $ 12 , but why waste the money ? So it will die in another year after three or four more camping trips ? I 'm thowing this piece of junk away and buying a coleman .
 Used it for a year . Worked well . Charged it up for Memorial Day Camping weekend . Worked for 5 minutes . Died . Tried charging in car . Did the same thing . Battery dead . Warranty is for 1 year and not a fixable part according to the manufacturer . Not a very good GREEN product . Not a product for someone trying to be prepared . I 'd pass on this .
 The SwissGear Lantern did not last . Ours was used three times over the last 18 months . Now , it will not take a charge .
 I loved this lantern ! It worked great for about 14 months -LRB- just out of warranty year -RRB- and the battery will no longer hold a charge . I contacted the manufacturer and was advised I can not buy a battery . I would have to buy a new lantern . As much as I like the lantern it just does n't last . I wouldn ' buy another one .
 The lantern worked great the first 5 or so times I used it . After that , the battery would no longer hold a charge and it is hard wired to the lantern so it can not be replaced . Save your money and get a lantern that allows you to replace the batteries . I would not recommend this lantern to friends .
 Battery will no longer accept a charge , lantern is junk , in the process of contacting company for exchange/refund/repair , I will let you know if we have any luck .
 Bought one of these at Wal Mart a few years ago for mom and never really had to use it . But would check it and charge when needed . Re Charged it the other day and was just checking it and saw that it was no longer working , so charged it for awhile and the lights came on very dim then faded fast . So tried to charge it and decided either the battery went bad as everyone on here has said or that the electronics have gone out . The red light was not comming to show a low charge , but showed green right away ... I did pull the battery cover off by taking the 4 screws out and see that there are just clips ... so if Radio shack -LRB- The shack -RRB- does have the battery -LRB- 3-FM-4 -RRB- for $ 12 it might be worth it . But if you had to order one and then pay the $ 15 to $ 20 many places want to ship a battey then its not worth it . I did see it was made in China - !!!! But no surprise there I guess . I was surprised that the battery is available unlike the UPC units I buy and ca n't find battery replacements for.Had mom used the lantern a few times that would be one thing ... and did n't look for the paper work to see if there was a warranty . I thought about buying one for myself a few months ago but did n't see them at Wal Mart so found a $ 15 LED lantern that has a battery that comes out for recharging , will see how long it last ... So theres my 2 cents worth ...
 The Swissgear Lantern work in a couple of storms and recharged as expected . This year when the big blizzard arrived in New England we tried to recharge it and it refused to accept a charge . It 's Chinese battery is the root of the problem . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM . -LRB- I 'm frankly surprised anyone still carries this item ! -RRB- Good old candles are more reliable ! DO N'T DEPEND ON THIS PRODUCT !
 I found a new-looking SwissGear sitting next to a dumpster at a campground and thought I might try to fix it . Sometimes people are not competent to use things properly . I have never bought a vacuum cleaner because there 's always a perfectly repairable one in the dumpster . Well , this lantern may never have worked properly . Only the LED night light works . The batter charges but the fluorescent lights do n't work . The internal circuit boards do n't pass juice to the bulbs . I ca n't fix circuit boards . I 'll stick with my wind-up Coleman lantern . The light is small but it also charges cell phones and has a radio too .
 Worked the first time it was charged but could not get it to charge the second time.This is nothing more than a piece of junk .
 Had this feature-rich lantern about 2 years , and the battery will no longer charge . Ca n't even find a place to buy replacement battery .
 I have had this lantern for about one year the battery went dead and will not charge.I have tried to find a battery but can not .
 This item has dreat features if it only worked . Mine began to malfunction in less than six months . In a little over a year , the battery quit accepting a charge . I threw the thing away and bought another brand .
 I bought it from Wal-mart . It works fine in the first year , but not rechargible any more from second year ad the lead-acid battery can not be replaced .
 This product was returned quickly , the charger did not work , the switch did not work . I purchased a Coleman rechargeable , it was more expensive but it has been a great product .
 Like almost everybody , my Swissgear rechargeable lantern stop charging in one season.I forgot for while but I kept last 4-5 years . Today , I found the battery for this unit .6 Volt 4AH Rechargeable Sealed Lead Acid SLA Battery 6 volt 4ampBrandUPGOur SKU3300650PartUB645EBALT14Good luck to everybody share the problem .
 Bought this for hurricane season ... worked great right out of the box . The next season , nothing . I bought new bulbs ... nothing . The green light stays on when charging lamp does nothing plugged in or not . Have to replace this one ! Might as well use candles ... at least they don disappoint
 They look nice but the first one lasted until the hurricane when I needed it most . Dead would not charge . I sent it back for warrenty replacement and they sent another brand new one . It last maybe a month . I would never buy another . If you have one good luck . Very fragile very iffy dont let this be your only light .
 I concur with the other reviews of this product . It 's a disgrace to the Wenger Brand . The battery life is nonexistent . Do n't waste your money ; buy a Coleman .
 I had the same problem with this lantern . Worked only one trip a few years ago . I pulled it out this year and was trying to see if I could fix it . After reading these reviews , I wo n't even bother . I hope the company is taking note of this .
 This lantern was great for one season when I used it and charged it regularly . However , next season battery would not recharge ... exact same problem as mentioned in other reviews . For $ 12 for a new battery -LRB- which is NOT easily replaceable , requires some skills with wiring to do so -RRB- , it does n't make sense to go that route - is any lantern worth putting $ 12 into it EVERY season ?? Instead I suggest trashing it -LRB- which is what I did -RRB- and getting a Coleman -LRB- which is also something I did -RRB- .
 Was hard to keep charged did not hold a charge long at all and broke very easy.would not buy again
 I bought two of these , and used them once on a camping trip . Put them away to keep for hurricane season . But , as others stated , when I took them out again , they would n't charge . The green light would come on when charging , but they would not light . Only the night light would come on for about a minute . Definately do not waste your money on these !
 Overpriced and fails whenever you need to use it . On the plus side , it is good for the first year . After that time , all goes wrong . Battery alone is about $ 12.00 to replace . We all want a good to excellent lantern , but this one is a simple piece of junk .
 The pole arrived broken . The telescoping did n't lock , and there 's no way to fix it . That 's what I get for buying cheap .
 I bought these to see if I liked using trekking poles , and I 'm glad I was only expecting a trial run . The handgrip fell off of one somewhere around mile 7 and the inner workings popped out when I then retracted it for easier carrying . Now to buy a real pair .
 After 6 hikes , the plastic thread that expands/reduces the length of the pole became loose and the pole became useless .
 I purchased a pair of these poles at a local Walmart and one of them lost the ability to lock once expanded after just one hike . I will never purchase a swiss gear pole again .
 I have bought 4 of these and believe it is a manufacturer defect . Out of the 4 poles , only 1 of these will tighten correctly . The rest collapse even without any resistance at all.I 'm not going to comment on the comfort or other features . Basic functionality is simply not there.I 'd give it 0 stars if I could . Amazon requires at least 1 though .
 i have n't had any problems with tips falling out , but the adjustable pole lock no longer works on one of the poles , no matter which way i screw the thing . very unfortunate , because otherwise this seems to be a decent product for very little money .
 First off the poles were advertised as two for one wrongSecond they are VERY hard to hold their adjustment 1Suggest you find a better value !!
 Make sure you order TWO of these as 1 -LRB- ONE -RRB- pole is what you get per order . Better yet do n't order ANY . . DAH ! Then follow the instructions , figure out the pole does not telescope out and lock into place as written , get a set of pliers , try again , now it all comes apart , reassemble this junker into place , turn until your wrists hurt , finally using a vice-grip lock the pole into a permanent length and hope to God it does n't fold the 1st time U put weight on it . You are better off buying 2 4ft dowels and much safer . Junk is what U end up with thin bendable aluminum trash . Try that with ice cold hands !!!!!!
 This is a reasonably priced trekking pole that 's lightweight and fairly sturdy . However , the first time I used it , the carbide tip fell out . I saw some of these at Wal-Mart and examined the tips . Quite a few of them had already fallen out prior to even being purchased . I even tried gluing mine into the staff , but it fell out again during the first use . I threw away the tip and made my own with a nail . So even though this is a well-made pole -LRB- except for the crappy tip -RRB- , I do n't recommend it -LRB- due to the crappy tip ! -RRB- . Instead , get a Kaito pole . I got one for Christmas and it 's awesome . Light-weight , well built , sturdy , the tip has n't fallen out yet -LRB- ! -RRB- , and it has extra features -LRB- camera screw-mount , compass , thermometer -RRB- . The Kaito 's are only a little more in price than this Swiss Gear . They are worth the extra cost .
 Bought 'em at Wal-mart for cheap . Brush guard fell off inside of 100 meters - pole lock broke and collapsed in less than 2 miles . Save yourself the hassle and invest in something more substantial - ya get what ya pay for .
 I ordered 3 hiking poles they came in separate large boxes wasting resources . Two poles were in good shape and came in damaged boxes . The third pole was in an undamaged box but pole does n't work as well as the other two . The protecting tip was missing and one of the tightening clutches spins and never locks down securely .
 I recently saw that the Swiss Gear hiking poles were sold at WalMart for a very reasonable price under $ 20 . Stopped by to see one , that was even in blue to match our mountain bikes.As I fiddled with the extension and shock absorbing feature , I put some downward pressure on the handle.You guessed it , the pole snapped off at the lower adjuster . Completely broke in half ! So , I 'm back looking at Black Diamond with their flick lock and lifetime guarantee , albeit for $ 70 - $ 90 . But , I ca n't imagine one of these Swiss Gear 's breaking while coming down a trail with too much pressure . Look out below and call the ambulance!I did report the breakdown to a WalMart clerk .
 I went to Swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others . This is the only pole they have which is n't saying much for the brand , but I found that the suggested retail is $ 4 lower to what Amazon is selling it for . Just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price . Even though Amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap . Probably too cheap to be any good .
 This product is junk and I suggest if you tie up to other boats a lot you avoid . I purcahsed these and within the first year all had broken the plastic connectors .
 We connected the straps to our boat fenders and unfortunately the radgiting strap broke on our first day on the water . The plastic construction is not strong enough to hold the weight of the fender .
 This fleece is great looking and feels great , BUT ... the big problem is the shrinkage . . WOW does it ever not only in the body and length but major shrinkage in the width of the arms . It defiantly is not a comfortable jersey to lounge around in ... CHOOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT !!!!
 wore this item once . Waist draw string broke . One tug on the draw string and that was it . Very cheap material .
 Rather disappointed in the quality of the item . I have purchased other windshirts and found this one to be a very low quality
 This is a VERY difficult monitor to understand and use for all of it 's programs . The booklet is terrible therefore you have to call the 1-800 hoping to understand how to use it . I would NOT recommend this model
 I had this unit for about four months . During that time I used it exclusively as a HRM monitor . It worked well after a good reading of the manual . However , when I tried to set up the wired bike monitor the unit would not record distance or speed . After reading around it seems like this unit has a problem recording this information reliably . I returned the Polar and went with a Suunto T3 with Bike Pod . The Suunto works beautifully and is a very well designed product . I would highly recommend it over the Polar S150 .
 I have had this monitor for about two years , and I have never gotten the bike computer part to work . It works fine as an HRM , but it 's pretty pricey for just an HRM . The menus are hard to navigate through . I also find that it is hard to get button pushes to register . I would definitely not get this monitor again . After having Polar monitors for several iterations , and being repeatedly disappointed , I am now looking to other manufacturers .
 First , the good : This thing is constructed very well . It holds 1911 or Glock mags with no problems . Adjustable or removable flaps cover the mags to protect them from the elements . Stitching is great , as is the color.Now , the bad

 This item is only 0.53 mm thick ! Two layers of cheap electrical tape will afford you better tube protection ! Save your money and your tubes and buy something else ... anything else !!!!!!!
 This product fits well but is fairly thin . To be fair though it is as thick as any that come in production bikes today . I would double this product foradditional protection .
 The virtual football that we ordered was sent w / a corroded battery compartment . I made numerous attempts to email / contact the Carolina Toy Dept. & no one has responded . This is extremely frustrating to me considering how excited my son was to play w / this toy after he opened it on Xmas morning . In addition , I paid almost $ 40 for this toy that I should have just thrown down the drain . I will never again order from Amazon or Carolina Toy Dept.
 The material ripped on me after 2 uses . I was very disappointed . No grip at all . I wo n't recommend this to anyone .

 I was really dissapointed with Madden 2005 . I am still playing the 2003 version which was one of the best . 2004 was good too , but it had major bugs which I wont get into here that made me stop playing it . Anyway 2005 has MANY issues , first off are the annoying radio station you are forced to here when you enter Francise mode . It 's fine if you like it , but there is no off button . I am forced to hear it everytime weather I like it or not . # 2 how tacky are the injuries still ? Everytime a player is injured he gets up wither limping or holding his arm , etc. it doesnt matter how serious the injury is , in every case the guy gets up and walks off . What about realism ? And these new fan created animations . How stupid looking are those ? And again , it 's fine if you like them but you are forced to see them everytime the home team scores or the opponent scores on the road . A row of 4 stupid looking fans , with the same shirts and props , and rediclous hats . It annoys me to death and you cant turn it off . Also when an apponent team scores a touchdown , the player falls straight back on his back -LRB- and this is repeated again and again -RRB- . How unrealistic again , or he throws the ball down . There are limited realistic reactions when a player scores . These same two are repeated over and over . And when your quarterback scrambles in the rush , no longer can he scrable or run out of pressure . He is sacked everytime . Also Maddens commentaries in regard to turnovers , they say again and again when you commit a turnover what a bad way to start your game with a turnover , even if it 's the 3rd or 4th quarter . And what the other reviewer said about maddens same generic comments , I go along with completley . If Madden isnt going to take the time to match his partner with fresh comments , why not just take ALL the madden comments from every Madden game and roll them all into one . Then you would have a much greater variety then saying the same ones over and over . i thought how embarrased would Madden feel if they ever played a joke on him and used his computer commentary in a real NFL game and fans heard the same comments again and again and again . That gives you the idea of how far off Madden is from realism . Not just mentioning the commentary this year , but all the other things put together . For the good points , the gameplay is still excellent . Wish i could play it without all the other bugs . The defensive play is awesome , with the bigger hits , etc. . But they did a very poor job of putting together a whole Sim with true realism . When you play a game like this , your supposed to be able to use your imagination and get lost for a while -LRB- and seem like it 's all the real thing -RRB- . For me with 2005 , thats impossible . Better luck next year ?
 The PC version of Madden 2005 has eliminated the option of using created teams in franchise mode . If you enjoyed this feature in past versions of Madden PC , you 're out of luck this time . Nice upgrade , eh ?
 What a HUGE disappointment this game has turned out to be , mainly for the absolutely INSANE decision to no longer allow players to play a custom team in franchise mode . Absolutely pathetic.What 's worse is that there was absolutely no mention of this feature being dropped anywhere . I spent HOURS creating a homemade team , coming up with logos , etc. , looking forward to playing it through many franchise years . Suddenly , I ca n't figure out how to import it into the game . After tons of searching through EA 's inept site , I find out ... surprise ... they CUT that feature this year !!! THis was by far my favorite feature . You also can no longer hurdle , a move that truly helped the running game . I have n't even bothered to play in franchise mode at this point , as I 'm so peeved that I ca n't play my own team . The new `` Hit stick '' thing is good , and there are some nice additions to defensive adjustments if you have the right controller.But the EA site , their total silence on this matter of lack of custom team in Franchise mode and the way they obviously view the PC audience as an afterthought make me ready for something else , and I do n't know if I 'll ever give EA my money again . They seem to have zero consideration for the people who 've been loyal to them and supported them in the past . As usual , it 's all about the money , nothing more.This version of Madden , overall , is a step backwards .
 EA sports where IS the game ? This was a question many die-hard Madden fans were asking from August to mid September when the game was finally released for PC.EA earned no new fans by bombarding every available form of media advertising `` Madden 2005 in store now '' when shipping problems with the PC version pushed the release date back twice . Ok , delays happen but what really annoyed fans was that there was no information saying why or how this happened from EA . According to the EA site throughout the delay Madden 2005 was `` in store now '' , just ignore the problem and no one will notice right guys?Nonetheless , the game is here now so lets give EA a rap on the knuckles for pretending they didnt have a problem and just review this damn game.Maybe I was expecting too much , but this a lot more like a Madden 2004 expansion pack then an exciting new game . EA have basically fixed their mistakes and blatant oversites from 2004 and said `` hey I guess people will fork out for the same game all over again '' . Whats new in 2005 ? Well we have one new phrase to add to Madden 's annoying commentary `` stuffed like a turkey , less then two yards isnt very good '' the rest was pasted over from your 2004 disk . They replaced the tackle button with a hit stick -LRB- so now I push the stick instead of the tackle button ? Now THAT is real innovation -RRB- . Its really not much to write home about.The `` exciting new features '' amount to a radio show where fans call up and guess who was picked first overall in the 1986 draft , a pre-recorded genereic speech from a coach and a statement that the player of the week is `` X '' who threw for 355 yards and 2 TDS . The `` storyline central '' is of more uselessness , it might sound cool to read what the local paper says about your big win but the programmers must have spent a total of 5 minutes coming up with the generic `` we won and made them look second rate '' headlines that never change or tell you somethinhg you didnt know . You get emails that are supposed to be important , like the owner asking `` what is our record now '' ??? and the craziest of all is the `` position battles '' where you get absolutely no say in who is battling or who wins . Even worse you pick up the paper and you -LRB- someone ! -RRB- has announced the rookie you played -LRB- and played well -RRB- in preseason to rest Michael Vick won the `` position battle '' and is the new starter for the team ! In turn , Vick 's morale goes down because he has recieved a mythical benching which makes him harder to re-sign . ARGH!On the bright side , NFL defences now perform with a modicum of intelligence and no longer watch Randy Moss glide past in cover 2 as we saw with the 2004 version . If you have never played 2004 you will probably think this is a great game , on the other hand if you played your 2004 franchise through the year 2019 and were looking for something genuinely new you will be discouraged to find you have a prettier version of 2004 with a stick to press instead of a button .
 I was eagerly awaiting this version . It 's always a good game , but somewhat arcady . Now the release date is pushed back into September and EA is completely silent on the issue . A big negative for me since it 's already football season -LRB- even though it 's only preseason -RRB- . If the consoles can have it why ca n't the PC ?
 Wow . . EA has done it again ! I first went to the store on August 12 , all excited to get Madden 2005 and play it that night . But then they told me it comes out September 9 , which was annoying enough . Now I look it up again on amazon , and it now says the 14th !? Will this game ever come out ? This should be filed with the FCC as deceptive advertising , since all the ads show the PC/CDROM logo , and say August 12th .
 this game is okay , but I mean instead of playing it at my friends house , I mean ca n`t I play it at mine , anyway I dont think its even close to being as good as madden 2004 . Dont get this game !
 Apparently this is the age of pooing all over loyal pc game fans . From the years its taken to develop rome total war and now to the delays with the most popular sports game of all time . This is the last time i order a game almost 2 months in advance , im sick of the entanglement between developers and marketing . Games should be released on time , anything short of piracy should be thought of before hand so they dont alienate us further . Might there be a day in the albeit distant future that we as paying customers might TAKE THE POWER BACK . One more delay after the 14 and im canceling my order .
 So , how come in Madden 2004 you can create a team and insert it into a season , but in Madden 2005 , you can not ? That was the one thing I liked about Madden 2004 . They are suppose to progress with these games , not go backwards . Maybe the later updates will have a fix . I suggest buying Madden 2004 and bypassing this loser .
 Again just like in past years , Madden does not support force feedback or rumblepads . Now of all the games EA Sports makes that have these effects , would n't you think football would be on of them?Other than that , a great game but very similar to last year .
 This game is a step back from 2004 the AI is stupid in alot of cases . The QB does n't have a quick release after a bootleg . your QB stops cold if he 's going to be sacked -LRB- before your tackled -RRB- . The game crashed to my desktop a number of times . The animation is choppy . The only part that 's go is being able to control your Defense which works just part of the time . Your corners get beat deep in and are stupid half the time . The game still decides who is going to win and allow oppnents mircale plays that just seem to get past your coverage designed against the play . OVER ALL IT SUCKS !!
 I did not receive this item due to a `` glitch '' that showed one thing in my records and another thing on their records . I got a hammer , but it was the wrong one and for a team that I ca n't stand ! I was told I would receive a return label , but I have not gotten one of those either . It was supposed to be gift , but it just sits in the box it came in . : -LRB-

 This is by far the worst reel I 've ever used . the trigger system worked an amazing three times before it stopped working . I spent more time trying to fix it rather than catching fish like everyone around was . Im never buying a quantum again .
 I recently purchased the Taylor Made package that included socket , flag pole , and flag . While all of the individual pieces seem to be good quality the flag pole sits very loosely in the socket . The instructions suggest that when mounting the flag pole in a 3/4-inch socket you need to cut off a bottom section of the flag pole . This clearly will not fix the problem as the flag pole already rests on the lip of the socket without needing to be shortened . Ultimately I went to office max and purchased a box of rubber finger protectors and was able to cut one to fit on the bottom of the flag pole and create a tight fit.Overall this is a great looking product that is very poorly designed .
 XL 13-15 Shrinks , too tight fit for me on 13 foot , cuts down blood circulation . Might be what some customers want . Ca n't imagine getting it on a 15 foot after couple of washings . I did not use dryer . Wish they made a XXL 17-20 . That might work for my desired comfort .
 Nice to find a partly wool sock in sensible sizes . I wear size 6 Women 's shoe . DH purchased a 2-pack of these as a test for me . We got the smallest pair of these available . They fit right.Pros
 My previously ordered Wigwam Comfort Hiker socks all rated five stars . I 'm disappointed with these because they seem to have a less dense weave and do not produce the same cushioning effect as I have come to expect from this brand and type of sock .
 Part of buying a sock is so that you can wear it for a long period of time . These socks shrink . Nothing worse than a sock shrinking and you have to stretch it out before you wear it or it cuts the circulation off above the ankle.Thumbs down !
 The finish on the watch and band is cheap . The latch on the band pops off every time you bend your wrist back . The watch is useless in the dark . It 's a $ 20 watch at best .
 It is either this watch does not have tritium or the tritium glow is quite weak . I got the watch and tested it in the dark , it was not brighter than my Casio watch .
 I received the watch and it didnt work , figured it was the battery so I took it for a new battery and the jeweler said the battery was fine and that it might be the coil or entire insides ... very disappointed , I hope they make guns better than they do watches
 This watch is great except the finish on the band wears off extremely fast . I have worn mone for about 2 weeks and the band shows extreme signs of wear . This is the second one of these I have had , and the problem exists with both of them .

 Nice photos and description of the product , they just never show you the back of the shirt which gives the date of the 2004 Chicago marathon , 10/10/2004 . So if you already ran the 2004 marathon and want to be nostalgic , great , otherwise do n't bother buying this shirt . I bought it as a present for people currently training for the Chicago marthon this year , 10/9/2005 , and they were too nice to say anything until I was running with them and noticed the date ! False advertising ! I used to like Road Runner but they have sunk to the bottom of the barrel trying to peddle old merchandise .
 I have body surfed with Churchill Makapuu for years and years . My fifth Makapuu 's band was getting loose since after all it is a soft rubber with a life span of some five years . I purchased Viper Surfing Fins , yellow dot not orange , 5 '' not 7 '' and after one use , returned it immediately . It is really stiff , hard and the rubber band around the ankle very heavy and stiff . It did tear off my skin and left my feet soar . When I am in the ocean , I use the fins as an extension of my body . It needs to be flexible , light and comfortable so I can swim , dive and surf without feeling anything dragging me down or stopping me from paddling and without hurting my feet , tearing my skin or forcing me to wear a wet-suit socks ... Then , I purchased and tried the Slasher Fins which were worthless and returned those as well and purchased the Churchill Makapuu Fins for the sixth time ... Although it may sound funny , you can feel how comfortable a fin is by trying it at home . If you can wear it at home without hurting your feet , you will be able to enjoy it in the ocean as well . I just wanted to try different brands since after all anything that helps me to catch those waves , is a joy but the fact was that I could not find any ...
 This product is too fragile to seriously use . The product description is misleading because most parts of the reel are plastic and the rod itself is a little too stiff . My rod BROKE IN HALF with hardly any real weight on the end of the line . This product was a disappointment .
 Great for being small and sneaking in places your not supposed to fish ... I was fishing at a golf course and I had a 1 lb Largemouth bass on and while fighting the fish the rod broke !! So I bought another one and the rod broke again on a 3 lb bass . Good rod for kids catching 2-10 inch fish . But broke on me twice while fighting a fish .
 Blue World Smallest Mini Fishing Fish Rod Pen Reel PoleThis is ok for a joke , but not for serious fishing . Save up a little more money and get a real rod & reel set up .
 I researched different slant boards and looked for one that had adjustable incline and even though this product is advertised as adjustable , it is not . That is the only reason for low rating . This was a disappointment . The only part that is adjustable is the leg support . On the positive side , it appears to be very sturdy , assembled easily , and worth the expense if you do n't mind that the incline can not be adjusted .
 The bench does NOT fold or adjust . The padding that goes under your knees is terrible , and is not elevated . I would not buy this bench .
 The bench has two problems
 I read the reviews from other people and did I get a different product ??? Not only does it not fold you can not adjust the angle ! Its one angle and thats all ! To fold you have to remove a bolt using a wrench ! The padding on the board is good however the roll pads are lacking ! For $ 50 you cant expect much but I do expect truth in advertising ! Spend the extra $ 20 and get a truly foldable agjustable slant board !
 If you are taller than 5-foot-2 , this sit-up board is not for you . If it does n't break your legs , it 'll shut off circulation to them and to your feet , and you 'll hang over the end . When I tried it , I could n't pay much attention to my abs because my lower legs were in such misery . On the plus side , it would be ideal for waterboarding midgets .
 I could n't even get it to assemble and it 's not user error for sure . The Front Stabilizer screw holes do not match the Front Incline Support . This was the first step of assembly . It must be a poor constructed equipment if you ca n't even assemble the first part !!! The 3 screws do not line up at all , I 've spent an hour trying to screw them into without any luck . I will be returning this piece of junk and spend a little extra for a better brand .
 I 've used many incline boards and this thing sucks . Did 4 sets with a plate on my chest . I got the worst upper butt chafing from this thing , I could n't even shower it hurt so bad . The upper knee rests go too high and they ca n't adjust either , you feel lower back stress when you descend to the very bottom . Hate this thing , never had any problem with other incline boards .
 Foam board screw holes did not match up to the main frame that would attach to it . All of the holes were about an inch off so it could not be attached . Returned product and will purchase a different product . Looks like they may be in the process of changing the frame to make it more stable -LRB- i.e. with wider metal bars on the main frame -RRB- but the bolt holes on the foam pad were n't cut to the same width .
 I had to run a tap though most of the treaded holes . I had to drill out the hole to put it together . If you do not have a metric tap set and drill do n't buy this item . It does not fold awayor even go together as is . So be warned . Now that I have redrilled holes and re tapped threads It will work fine , Hense the 3 stars . however , putting it together was a nightmare !
 I purchased this slant board to use only for back decompression but the top foam pads are too close to the board to hook the ankles and keep you on the board .
 Could be adjustable higher but the main problem is that the knee supports are way too narrow - two inches on either side would have made to product pennies more expensive but much much more comfortable .
 The Item was listed as a folding slant board . I tried -LRB- 2 -RRB- different one 's . I have had to return both . The item is not as advertised .
 I am currently working in Afghanistan we have a gym we made up here and the only thing that would be nice is a slant board , this will be perfect for a decline bench press that will fit perfectly under the bar on the squat rack . Also be helpful to get our abs a better work out . Thank you for all the reviews it helped my choosing .
 The product I received has a fixed incline , it is not adjustable . Assembly was n't bad , the holes did n't quite line up and required a little persuasion -LRB- hammer -RRB- to get together . It will serve the purpose , but it would have been nice if it was adjustable as pictured .
 Should have shown more detailed description for the item because the description provided was n't enough . I was looking for a board that raised way higher than this -LRB- at least a four foot incline -RRB- , this one does n't raise high enough -LRB- it a two foot incline , which is ineffective for what I was looking for -RRB- . Obviously , that is manufacture related . But the description provided on how high the board incline is insufficient and poorly detailed which becomes Amazon.com LLC problem . I find purchasing any fitness equipment from Amazon.com LLC to be inconvenient due to lack of item description .
 Slant board received has not an adjustable slant position as advertised . Still a good fitness equipment and will make use of it .
 This slant board is just ok . It arrived on time from Amazon and was , as reported , easy to assemble . But as reported , it DOES NOT adjust the angle and the photo Amazon is using in not the slant board you will get . The incline angle is simply not adjustable , only the leg holder is . As reported , the pads on the ankle and knee supports are way too thin and painful unless you add your own padding . This slant board is built well , but not designed well . If the company were n't so cheap they 'd use a better grade of foam support and more of it . As for the adjustable angle , it just does n't have that feature and Amazon should say so instead of using a photo that completely misinforms consumers .
 wore this item once . Waist draw string broke . One tug on the draw string and that was it . Very cheap material .
 Rather disappointed in the quality of the item . I have purchased other windshirts and found this one to be a very low quality

 I bought this scope this year . . so far . . the only thing I can see is the moon with the x45 eyepiece , well . . I might say its a good scope for lunar observations . When I saw it . . I was happy . . hoping to see planets . I say Venus , used my barlow lens with the x 225 eyepeice . . could n't see ANYTHING at all . Bad quality , it broke . . the mirror for the triangular thing came off . . and the silver metal thing . . got stuck inside . Just DO N'T GET IT , BEWARE !
 This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy . Here 's why :1 . The objective is too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe . I suppose it is adequate for the moon , but that is it . The planets will appear as very small disks . One will be able to see Saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small . Forget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc. 2 . The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope . The observer will find it hard to look through -LRB- very small eye opening -RRB- , and will in most cases cause blurred images . The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . The barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope .3 . The mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to `` shiver '' , which is very frustrating.Even for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws . Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.Jim `` Konedog '' Koenig , astronomy buff
 This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against.The first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x . Do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope ? Nothing but a dim blur . Note that the objective -LRB- main -RRB- lens is 60mm . All telescope optics have inherent limitations ; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x . Therefore , with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x , increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown , and that 's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good.The finder is useless , smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30 . Finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating . The low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope , depending on its design and field of view . That the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing . And do n't even think of using the 4mm -LRB- high power -RRB- eyepiece or the barlow.I do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners . Their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography , and for this they require careful setup . The equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress nave buyers with its complex `` scientific '' appearance.In a way , it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope . Their upper-tier instruments are quite good , but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this . In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models . Just make sure , gentle reader , to stay away from the toys.Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar . It is a learned skill . And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope . Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving . If you want to see the wonders of the sky , contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties . The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started . The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars -LRB- decent ones are available on Amazon -RRB- , then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm -LRB- 6-8 '' -RRB- Dobsonian ; Celestron 's own 6 '' Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $ 290 .

 First off , many of these reviews address the actual use with this telescope ... I can not even comment on how well this telecope works because the TWO that were sent to me were BROKEN!I ordered well before Christmas as a gift for my son ... but to be his big gift from Santa Claus . My husband opened the telescope up late Christmas Eve to put it together and have it ready in front of the Christmas tree and right away it was clear that this telescope was broken . The 2 mounting screws were bent , very bent . This puts you in quite a position when it needs to be up and ready for your child.After A WHOLE LOT OF EFFORT with Amazon 's customer service -LRB- from another country ! -RRB- they sent a replacement ... to the WRONG ADDRESS !! -LRB- long story that I will not bore you with . -RRB- When the 2nd telescope arrived my husband once again opens it up and guess what ? They same screws were again bent . The box on the outside was not damaged , but something is not working for them.I am so disapointed with them . This was the first time I had purchased something this big from Amazon . I have mainly done music and movies , small stuff.After this experience I will NO LONGER buy a big ticket item that would have the possibility of damage . It 's just not worth the headache and problems , not to mention DISAPOINTMENT , to my son.I would proceed with caution when ordering this item from Amazon . If you get a broken one ... you just might be receiving the 2 I have had to return !
 It served me well as I can not see much of anything other than the moon or not if I can not use .
 My one -LRB- returned -RRB- had a broken part on the mount , and was way far out of collimation . Also , of course at this very low price point , no way to adjust the collimation . Foil tabs sticking into the field of view * -LRB- the foil i think is used to aid in the separation of the two elements in of the objective lense -RRB- is ok , and common since the 1950 's in small cheap achromatic refractors . But the three screws that hold the tube onto what i assume is the lense cell , is NOT.Do not purchase this as a gift for a young person , unless of course , you want to insure they never develop and interest in astronomy . Yes , it is cheap . But it is not worth any amount , since if you get it and do not return it , it will take up space in your home , or garbage can .
 I have to agree with the other reviews of this scope . I purchased this scope as a Christmas gift . When I opened it , the equatorial mount -LRB- the basis for the ENTIRE scope -RRB- was broken . I contacted Celestron and was promised another part for it , which never arrived . I contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me . It DID N'T FIT . Finally , I was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope . The equatorial mount was in 1 piece . . yeah ! Too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and I could not assemble this one . I even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support -LRB- who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived -RRB- and all I got was a bunch of excuses.I finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one ENTIRE telescope . It 's February and I just now have a product that works . -LRB- I have n't had time to try it though ! -RRB- Celestron offered no refunds for this telescope , so buyer beware . If they are not willing to satisfy customers , your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells . Good luck !
 Pretty freakin ' hard to appreciate a product that comes missing all the parts needed for actual assembly . I contacted Amazon and was told to contact the maker . The maker took my call and promised delivery in 7 to 10 days.Sigh .
 when I tried to assemble it one of the threads had a drop of steal in from where they welded it had to drill tap buy new bolt
 I was a little disappointed in that the distance for from your knees to your feet is shorter than I would like and I am only 5 ft. 9in .
 Poorly made , some parts were cracked or broken and unit was not level . Needed my husband to drill other holes to get it to work correctly and to add things to balance unit so it would not rock .
 It was n't very expensive . It is getting the job done . But the feet that came in the kit were impossible to get on . I 'm a very handy person , but I just could n't get the feet to slide onto the ends of the legs . Tried lubricant , tried trimming the inside of the foot with a dremil tool . Eventually , with my frustration meter pegged , I just tried to beat one of them on . It broke . Since I 'm using the bench on carpet it 's not a big deal , but it would n't work on a solid surfaced floor , screw heads would get in the way .
 Because of the way the fixed leg rests are positioned , crunching on this board puts pressure on the upper thighs and not on the abdominal area . Having used similar products in the past , I am fairly sure the board 's design is flawed .
 Not adjustable and the pads for your legs keep moving in-between use . Hurts my behind because I ca n't lower it enough .
 wore this item once . Waist draw string broke . One tug on the draw string and that was it . Very cheap material .
 Rather disappointed in the quality of the item . I have purchased other windshirts and found this one to be a very low quality
 I had this trailer for a year although I struggled with it from the very beginning . The instructions had me put the arm on backwards -LRB- and the diagrams did n't help -RRB- - I would say it was me , but with my engineer husband and engineer/avid biker friend who is also a mom with a bike trailer all working on it , we had a hard time putting it together after an hour - and no - it was n't hard , just confusing & it did n't make sense.Then the rear wheel kept rubbing against the arm once we DID get it right - I changed the way I rode so I did n't do any hard turns -LRB- like from a driveway to the sidewalk or street -RRB- . I would have to get off , and angle the bike by hand to line up with the turn & get back on.And then there 's the slipping off issue . The clasp kept slipping off of the chainmount ! I would ride for 2 blocks & then feel an odd tug and see that the trailer was just holding on by the safety rope & no longer attached to my bicycle ! Today when I was riding home , I noticed that it had come undone half-way through crossing the street -LRB- I had attached it at the stoplight -RRB- and I needed to keep going so I did n't stop in the middle of the street and the arm got stuck in the spokes of my back tire & broke them - jarring us to a screeching halt . NOT SAFE!I called the company & she was n't suprised at all . She said this is very common and that there is a very narrow range of bikes that the clasp arm works for . Her recommendations were either to return it or to spend and ADDITIONAL $ 14 PLUS $ 20 shipping for a part that would permanently attach the trailer to my bike . As a customer , I 'm frustrated that it did n't work to begin with and that their only solution required me to pay more and took away the stroller feature . I 'm also frustrated that this was NOT a cheap item and that I now need to choose whether to pay more to make it functional and keep `` making do '' or to buy a new trailer altogether.This gets 1 star for it 's poor design & instructions and for the additional issue of customer service -- they were nice , but did nothing to `` make it right '' and seemed unphased by the fact that the trailer was unfunctional.I 'm looking at theInStep Quick N ' Lite Bike Trailer and Stroller Combinationor Mall Cruiser Quick N EZ Plus Trailer . I 've just had it .
 This stroller does not turn right . Their own website admits as much saying , `` it will not allow very sharp turns when going extra slow , or when the rider is off the bike and backing up the trailer and turning . '' meaning it does not turn right for urban riding -LRB- which is slower and has sharp turns -RRB- . We 've used it -LRB- in stroller mode -RRB- only a couple of dozen times , but already the fabric is frayed and torn . This trailer is a waste of money .
 There is no point in purchasing this product . I cant get a block down the subdivision sidewalk before it falls off . I was prepared to purchase a Chariot product for twice as much but when I saw Chariot designed this product I took the bait . I really wish I had n't . I thought the attachment was a really good idea but it has turned out to be the worst part of the stroller . I basically cant use it until I figure something out .
 I purchased this one year ago at costco , the price was good compared to retail bike stores . I did read the review that the clasp kept falling off the bike but ther other reviwes did not notice the problem.I ride a Trek mtn bike with thick bars and every time I go over a slight bump the trailer falls off the bike and lands in my rear wheel-very dangerous.I called the company and they sent me a new attachment that has a diffent mechanism , it did require drilling new holes through the bar but it has held on going over curbs and off road trails.I am now very pleased with the product and would buy it again .
 This umbrella closed by itself quite often due to its flawed design . Drove me crazy !!
 I was hesitant to buy this umbrella because i had heard in another review of the logo being large and obtrusive . I went ahead and ordered a black one and i 'm happy to say the logo is tiny and unobtrusive . Its on one of the velcro wraps that keep it closed.update : Wow , should have listened to the warnings about the open locking mechanism . Yep , 3rd time I used the umbrella it will no longer stay open . Talk about a POS . This is a design flaw . Oh but it has a lifetime warranty ... . yeah if i send them $ 15 bucks ! for that much i can continually buy cheap umbrellas . What a ripoff ! Learn from my mistake , DO NOT BUY .
 The latch to hold up the umbrella is made of cheap plastic , not metal as with most $ 5 sidewalk umbrellas . Kept this in the trunk of my car for emergencies ... lasted about five uses until the latch gave out . The lifetime guarantee is great , if you 're willing to fork over the shipping charges to send it to the company ... along with a $ 10.00 check to cover return postage . Nothing like a company standing behind its products .
 I bought this umbrella back in May . Because I carry a small umbrella in my bookbag , I opened it only 4 times . The canopy will not open . I can pull out the `` catch '' with oil and pliers but would have to do so every time . So it is now just expensive trash . I had been an Amazon customer since its concept but I guess they are to big now to worry about keeping a loyal customer
 I bought this umbrella for my husband , who had been wanting a large golf umbrella for many years . He was so excited to receive it on our anniversary and was saving it for a -LRB- rainy -RRB- golf outing . The first time he used it at a golf outing where it was raining heavily , he discovered the umbrella would not stay in the open position and kept collapsing on him . Thankfully , the outing was cancelled.I contacted customer service and at first they were helpful . I had the original warranty info and upc card which I was told to enclose in the original box -LRB- which I had saved -RRB- and return it to Gustbuster.I just received the umbrella today and opened it to see if it would work . It works , however , the plastic tab on the side of the umbrella that you push up to `` click '' onto the metal piece towards the top of the umbrella holding the umbrella in open position is totally unevenly broken , and felt somewhat sharp to the touch . I also noticed they never returned my upc card or guarantee card.When I contacted customer service , I was told that this plastic piece is a newer design element -LRB- or design flaw , in my opinion -RRB- . I was told that this is how they fix the umbrella when it will not stay open . I was also told that the plastic is NOT sharp . And , that I am the only customer -LRB- really ? -RRB- who has ever complained about the broken plastic piece . Their fix seems shoddy . Needless to say , I am not impressed with customer service response . I did n't want already broken pieces on the umbrella .
 I just recently open my new Gustbuster purchase and the umbrella would not latch in the open position . I will be seeking warantee replacement - I am very displeased .
 do not waste your money . I wish I could give it zero stars
 Absolute junk . I only had it a week and it started collapsing on me . The springs that they use are very cheap and do not last . DO NOT BUY THIS UBREELLA . Other than the collapsing canopy the handle has a bad oder to it . If I could give less than one star I would .
 The handle has a strong , unpleasant rubber odor that transfers to your hand . I was hoping it would go away but now the coat closet smells ! However , having returned two umbrellas to AMZN already -LRB- one arrived broken , one broke the first time I used it -RRB- I 'm too tired to return it a third time . It 's a nice , large , sturdy-looking umbrella - pity about the smell . Puzzled that nobody else commented on this . Maybe I just got a dud . . ?
 The rack had to be taken to a welder in order to drill the hole so that the receiver lock which was purchased in the same order would fit into the hitch . The factory hole was to small . The pin that held the rack from going forward was not positioned properly in the hole and would slip out allowing the rack to fall forward while going over a speed bump . The welder had to install a plate in order for this to function properly . Basically very poor quality control . Out of pocket expense was twenty five dollars .
 I purchased this bike rack in January to carry bikes on the back of my travel trailer . I had been used 4 times successfully but the 5th time was not a charm . One of the bolts that the arms pivot up and down on broke as I was driving on the highway . I heard tire chirping and got out to see what the noise was , when I came around the back I saw my bicycle , which was on the outside , hanging down to the road and the back tire had been jumping up and down on the road as I was driving . The other two bikes were ok . One bolt had sheared in half and the other held.If you have this rack or are thinking about buying it , you might think about removing these bolts and replacing them with hardened bolts -LRB- which these are not -RRB- . A bolt remover was unsuccessful . Retapping the threads does n't look like an option . The option looks like buying a new rack.Thanks for reading , I hop this helps someone .
 The rack itself appears sturdy and well made . I purchased it to fit a 2 '' receiver for my KIA Sedona Van . -LRB- The info online clearly stated specifically for SUV 's and Vans . -RRB- After putting it together I attached it to my receiver and it knocks against the bumper . You can not use the release pin because it is too tight up to the bumper . You would cause damage to the bumper . I am currently looking for an extension for the hitch , hoping it wont add alot of play to the rack when loaded . It is too much hassel to try and send it back .
 The rack overall is fine . The way it bolts into the hitch is problematic . Even if it is tightened very securely , it becomes loose after about 20 miles of driving and the rack wobbles seriously , side to side .
 The material ripped on me after 2 uses . I was very disappointed . No grip at all . I wo n't recommend this to anyone .
 I purchased two of these for my twin girls and they look cheap and fit poorly . They are also hard to adjust . My girls like wearing the helmets but they do not fit properly . I wish I could send them back as I now need to purchase something else .
 Ill keep this simple and to the point , this is very possibly the worst spotting scope for the price . At 30x -LRB- minimum magnification -RRB- the image is not very clear and at 90x -LRB- maximum zoom -RRB- its pathetic and nearly unusable . I have a pair of Celestron 10-30x zoom 50mm binoculars that puts this spotter scope to complete shame in terms of clarity . I just purchased a 20-60x zoom spotter scope made by RedHead -LRB- name brand built by Bass Pro Shops -RRB- that makes the Mini-Mak look like a sick joke in terms of optics quality for an even cheaper price . The Mini-Mak is also virtualy worthless for night viewing and in comparison I have 2 other spotter scopes that I can even see the rings of Saturn and Jupiter with at night . I would strongly recommend finding a Maksutov-Cassegrain or straight type spotter scope of decent quality . Tasco , LOMO , Bushnell , RedHead , Barska , etc. . all make some very good designs for similiar prices or just slight higher . Bottom line , the Mini-Mak is a complete waste of money and should not even be considered . There are far better designs out there at very reasonable prices and some even include changeable 1.25 '' standard eye pieces . I hope this helps with the decision as to whether or not to buy this unit .
 Very briefly Im into Astrophotography and I have a C11 XLT Goto scope with 2 '' optics kit . I just wanted to purchase this C65 to use as a small guide scope so the requirement for performance was only basic . To put it bluntly , the day or night images are extremely dim , making all but the brightest stars impossible to view , even those clearly visible to the naked eye ! The focus control seems very loose and sloppy , however the internal mechanism is stiff making focus a real chore . Optics seem fuzzy and poorly illuminated , even on terrestrial targets at 100 mtrs . The image is noticeably dimmer than looking through one side of a budget price 10x50 binocular set I have . I have seen toy telescopes that perform better than this . I am really surprised at Celestron as I have several other items manufactured by them which are much better quality . I do not have a good word to say about this scope . Do n't buy ! Not even second hand . !
 Celestron does make good optical devices but the Celestron C65 is n't one of them . It is severely deficient in both optical quality and quality of materials , construction and mechanical operation . Image quality at 30x is passable , at 60x poor , and at 90x so dim and fuzzy as to be useless . The first one I bought arrived with a broken horizontal movement mechanism . The zoom mechanism on the replacement broke after less than 2 hours of use . Even when working , the zoom and focus controls did not operate smoothly . They tended to stick and release making adjustment difficult . The light weight and tiny tripod also mean that the image is very shaky.I bought this spotting scope because it was very lightweight and portable , but it seems to me that quality was sacrificed to achieve a very low price and weight.It has a `` Lifetime Warranty '' but if Celestron decides that it was not defective in workmanship or materials , -LRB- i.e. , you broke it -RRB- it will cost you $ 35 to invoke the `` no fault '' Lifetime Warranty . Given the fragility of this scope , it 's almost certain to get broken sooner rather than later , and good luck with not paying the $ 35 .
 Seldom have I been as unimpressed as I have with this scope . Though I bought it for shooting , just last night , comparing it against a Celestron 15X70 pair of binoculars , they left this scope in the dirt.If you can find a little more money , do not buy this scope !
 Be careful , do n't buy this product , I have bought it for some monthsThe images are not clear -LRB- not crisp -RRB- , not even in the minimum power 30X , I requested support to Celestron and they told me that it is normal and it is not a defect.You better spend your money in another thing
 My husband and his father are both very handy . Together , it took them about 5 hours to assemble this toy . The directions are incorrect , the drawings depicting how to assemble this thing are backwards.I 'm giving this toy a low rating because it cost us about -LRB- ... -RRB- and for that price it should have come preassembled.The other thing we did n't like about it was the shape , my children were much happier jumping on a plain round trampoline . We returned this `` fancy '' one to the store , and got the plain round one , for about half the price . My children like it much more , and my husband did n't have to spend half a Sunday putting it together .
 Tried to follow the poorly illustrated directions -LRB- in French , by the way -RRB- . It was impossible to assemble either alone or with a second adult . The bungie type cable must be manually stretched and hooked with an absurd little metal ring , while applying upwards of 100-150 lbs of tension . Will return for refund .
 When I first saw this i knew this would be the perfect excercise toy for my 3 yr old . so i purchased it at the discounted rate of $ 39.99 . WHen it arrive i was was impressed . But my beef is not with the assembling of the toy . It took my husband and i 2 hours to assemble-but keep in mind there were no children home at the time . After less than 2 months of my 3 yr old playing with it , one day we heard a loud `` POP '' . we checked under the toy and saw that the bungee was almost split in half-just being held on by a few pieces of elastic . Plus the mesh was worn at each of the eyeholes and also the bungee at each lacing point . After calling the company one person told me to go to the store and buy another bungee that the item has been discontinued for over a year-i just purchased this dec o5-and it broke mid feb 06 ! I was very dissappointed and feel the item should have been recalled-not discontinued ! be careful ! our item was not abused in any way , it was jumped on - which is how it was meant to be used . I do plan to pursue this and i will never purchase anything from spinmaster again !
 Ordered this item October 26 , 2005 , have not received it as of December 27 , 2005 . Will never order anything through Amazon/Toys R Us again and will disuade everyone I know from doing business with them . It might cost a little bit more to go through E Toys & etc. , but I 've never had a problem getting something delivered via Standard Shipping within a couple weeks , not the two months and counting of Amazon/Toys R Us . Fully disapointed with my `` puchase '' .
 When I first saw this I thought it was awesome . A way to combine exercise and learning . Only problem is , it takes forever to set up , plus it is more helpful if you have another person helping you with the cord . The sensor/string attached it to fell off and rendered it educationally useless . We had to take it apart when we moved and both my husband and I are dreading putting it back together ... not worth the money .
 If your wire gets tangled you untangle it . If the tangle is too messy you cut the wire . If it gets sucked into the gears and bearings inside the spool you can sometimes get it out by cutting the wire , but sometimes you have to open up the spool and clean out the wire from the moving parts inside . However , if this is not possible it goes in the trash.After two minutes using this reel -LRB- and rod -RRB- the wire got tangled , sucked into to the spool and it was not possible to open and fix . I have been fishing with my 8-year old daughter many times , however , this time all she got out of the experience was that she learned a few new words -LRB- but she got no fish -RRB- . If you like wasting time , money , and enjoy aggravation , buy this product ; If not , do n't .
 I ABSOLUTLY disagree !!!! OMG this bag pissed me off and I am easy to please . This thing holds Nooooothing . My fins barely fit into it . There is no way to get a snorkel or mask into it also.DO NOT BUY . I am trying to figure out how to send it bad . So ticked .
 I bought this scope to compare against the Barska BlackBlackhawk 18-36x50 Waterproof Angled Spotting Scope -LRB- see my review -RRB- for its usefulness in 10 meter air rifle target shooting . This scope was comparable in price and was recommended by a retailer that specializes in target air rifles.Like the Barska , this scope is also made in China . Construction is similarly lightweight but this scope lacks a thick protective rubber coating . A hard plastic cover screws onto the eyepiece end of the scope for protection while a soft plastic cover protects the objective lens.The Celestron is very compact , making it easy to carry . Like the Barska , this scope offers a usable view at the lower power settings and an almost unusable one at the higher settings , especially if shooting indoors . For 10 meter target shooting , the lower magnification settings are fine but I find the eye relief and field of view to be inferior to the Barska . Oddly , this scope will focus down to about 3 meters -LRB- 10 feet -RRB- . The first one I ordered had to be returned because the eyepiece cover would not screw on as the threads on the body of the scope were damaged severely . This appeared to be a manufacturing problem as threads were smashed -LRB- i.e. not cross threaded . -RRB- The second one I received was better , but the cover would not screw down all the way as the threading on the scope was also slightly damaged . The case and tripod included with the scope offer minimal usefulness.Overall , I was disappointed with the design and quality of this scope . I would judge it as marginally acceptable.Update 2-24-09 : Well , it 's been two seasons and time for an update . I ended up keeping the Celestron scope and used it alongside the Barska 's that were also purchased for 10 meter air rifle use . Within the first two months , the eyepiece came unscrewed while trying to remove the cover . Any benefit of nitrogen purging was immediately lost . To their credit , Amazon replaced the second scope promptly . I have n't had any problems with the third -LRB- ! -RRB- scope , so far.I 've actually found a use for the ability of this scope to focus down to such a short distance . We conduct shooting safety classes , using BB guns , every summer for the Cub Scout Pack that is with my son 's Boy Scout troop . The range we shoot at is only 5 meters long and this scope will focus down to clearly see the targets at this short range . I do n't know of any other scope that can do that . A spotter uses it to let the instructor know how the scouts are doing.As of this update , Amazon no longer carries this scope . The only listing is for a third party retailer . I have no experience with their return policies . All of my experience has been with Amazon and I have always been satisfied with their customer service in dealing with product problems .
 I got it for a diving trip , seemed to have good selection of features . The digital time worked , but the hands kept stopping each time I reset them . I tried to figure out how to contact the seller , and could not , so I returned it for refund .
 We purchased this spotting scope a few years ago . The viewing field is surprisingly dim and lacks the vibrance you 'd like to see from a product like this . In particular , you see its shortcomings when you compare it to a more expensive pair of binoculars or even a decent handheld scope.We also have an issue with the eyepiece falling out because of the wimpy threads that hold on the locking ring . Getting service has also been difficult , as the local dealer told us we 'd have to contact the manufacturer directly , after the manufacturer referred us to the dealer.If this is all you can afford , I 'd save your money for another year and buy something better .
 A real bust . Not what was described at all . I completely wasted my money on this purchase . It was too cheap to justify the postage necessary to return it . Live and learn . I wo n't buy a belt like this online again . I needed the color we saw in the description , like the photo above , but received brown .
 No problems with the seller . The package arrived quickly and the price could not be beat.Unfortunately , the Cardinal Red belts I ordered , which should have been a bright vivid red , and which appear on the website as such , are hardly that color at all . The belts are dark , cranberry sauce red , which , unfortunately , does n't come any where near matching our true Cardinal Red uniforms . Oh well . They will be relegated to practice belts and I will keep searching .
 If you were expecting Gold to be yellow , as in uniform yellow , the base color axiomatic regular old sunflower safety tape yellow - look elsewhere . The belt is orange . I do n't know how they sell an orange color that could look more orange than this.Also , if you have dark pants , this belt 's inside lining shreds like toilet paper and it will get all over your pants each time you put it on.The buckle is exactly what you 'd expect for this price.But , tt holds up my pants and the elastic works just fine . It was cheap and functional . Two stars for that .
 The only complaint I have is that the belt that shipped was the wrong color . It was a dark royal blue and I had ordered the Columbia blue . It was labeled Columbia blue but that 's not what was in the package .
 The material ripped on me after 2 uses . I was very disappointed . No grip at all . I wo n't recommend this to anyone .

 All reels now seem to be made in China , and for the price , this one was n't smooth at all . I would look for another reel .
 See my other review of this company 's products . I ca n't recommend them . When applied as directed and using their own preparation , I could n't get this to &#34; stick &#34; to furniture leather . It was difficult to apply evenly , and then despite curing it a 2-3 days , it was quickly apparent that the dye was not fast to the furniture , but rubbed off on everything .
 I bought this to help hide scratches in my leather couch . Despite it being `` dark brown dye '' and my couch being Dark brown/chocolate colored ... it BLEACHED the leather of my couch , turning it a very light tan.I did read and follow all directions on the bottle . I shook the bottle to make sure it was well mixed . Unfortunately before I could do the patch test on a hidden area I opened it and spilled two drops on the couch . . leaving me with two horrific drip spots . Please see the provided image in the dye 's image gallery .
 I have a dark brown leather recliner and my dog scratched up the seat of it making his nest.I tried the leather dye and it began to remove the color of the leather . I stopped , but the damage was done . Now I have to try something else to fix the colorless spot .
 I bought this tire for a restoration project on a 1975 Schwinn Bantam for my son . It arrived quickly , but ... This tire is sold with Sunlite tag and Kenda markings on the tire , -LRB- meaning cheng-shin ? -RRB- and while it is nominally the right size for a schwinn S-7 20 x 1 3/4 tire , it refuses to seat correctly on the rim . I once owned a bicycle shop and have restored over 1000 vintage bikes . Meaning , 1
 Prepping for the assault on Mount Robson in Robson River Campground , we opted to give Alpine Aire 's Mashed Potatoes and Country Gravy with Turkey a try . Oops -- we do n't pack a pot large enough for the required 3.25 cups of boiled H2O . We found an O2 absorber and a country gravy packet inside . The directions did n't address the gravy packet . So we boiled 2 cups and mixed 'em with gravy and then into the main package while boiling another 1.25 cups . The water mixed poorly . We waited 8 minutes after each addition of hot water and still the moderately chunky turkey was n't fully rehydrated , although the bits had a turkey flavor . The overall result was poor quality instant potatoes that were too runny and flavorless even with added salt and pepper . We threw half away and ate crackers instead .
 I brought these on a camping trip and was sorely disappointed with them , especially with all the positive review here on Amazon . I tried several of them and I just could not eat them ; they all tasted like salty cardboard and sand . I 'll be bringing my own rice , pasta , dried potatoes , and flour on my next camping trip .
 I went on a three day backpacking trip with some friends recently . They brought Mountain House brand and I brought AlpineAire ; the comparison was stark.First , a little positive . In general the AlpineAir beat Mountain House in terms of nutrition . Lower sodium , cholesterol , etc. . For a fairly short trip , I do n't really care . I just want something that will taste good and fuel my body.The Beef Stroganoff was bland and tasteless , and the highlight . The Mountain Chili was pretty much dog food . Appearance , taste , smell , texture ... dog food . My friends took pictures of my meals and laughed at me . They tried the chili for comparison and spit it out laughing hysterically . There food was excellent and I gladly ate their leftovers.Big warning
 I like their products but this is their worst ever . They either need to design the product better with an extra bag to cook the gravy or take the product off the shelf . Could n't get all of the mash to mix and if you do n't have an air tight container to cook the gravey in it does not fully cook . Do n't buy it unless they make changes !
 The material ripped on me after 2 uses . I was very disappointed . No grip at all . I wo n't recommend this to anyone .
 I will say that I do like this product and it works very well.The issue I have here is with amazon is that with this listing and multiple other Berkley dough bait listings they show two jars in the visual and the purchaser likely is thinking they will receive two jars at the listed price . You will in fact only receive 1 jar at this price which is n't a real deal by any means . If it was 2 jars for 6.99 then that 's a good deal . 1 jar at this price , well you can find that anywhere and likely for a less than this listed price . If you buy it through bass pro or cabelas you get the berkley rebate which means it even cheaper . We thought that we were gon na get a good deal with this product . If it is n't too much of a pain we will probably return it and get it elsewhere .
 This is n't a poncho it 's a bedsheet with black spot 's and holes , but what do you expect it was made in taiwan . The only thing this is good for is being a ghost on holloween .
 This is the OEM starter pedals that come with road bikes to `` get you by '' until you purchase cycling shoes . However , there is an alloy core model of this available that does work quite well.This particular plastic/resin core model has the steel cages screwed on , and since the screws go into plastic , and you 're stepping on this , you can just imagine how that goes.The purpose of this particular product is for selling bikes , test drives and other temporary use .
 The pedals felt great and had excellent grip on the road , but the interior structure is made of plastic and broke under heavy -LRB- daily -RRB- use over a three month period . If you off road , ride trails , or are heavy user of your bicycle a complete metal or alloy pedal would hold up better . A great pedal with strap and clips , but not for extreme biking .
 Though the watch runs , the seconds hand does not move . I gave the watch as a birthday gift to my nephew , thinking he can read the instructions and figure out a way to move the seconds hand . But , that did not work . It was a bad idea to buy something like this online .
 I do n't like these because both the color and the overall quality . Some appear to be flat - and do n't &#34; reshape &#34; very easily . Plus the white ball gets dirty very easy and is not easy to keep clean . Might try the black - but also might search for other alternatives .
 These were a great idea - they are highly adjustable and could be used in many places on the boat - through a cleat , over a rail , over a wakeboard tower , etc. . So , it was with great excitement that I purchased these ... Unfortunately , even with as much velcro as there is length-wise , it 's not strong enough . After a few tugs on the fender , the velcro came loose . These could not be used when tied up to another boat or dock as they would n't last more than a few minutes.These might work much better if they were wider and had more gripping power ...
 I picked up a Marksman 3060 that came with one attached and a spare ... I shot a few dozen .30 and .375 caliber ammo and returned the slingshot with the bands . If you like to feel the ammo in the pouch you probably wo n't like these bands . I did n't find them to be very powerful either . I 'll stick with TruMark bands for my slingshots.As far as the 3060 - Nice lightweight adjustable slingshot . With different bands I think it would shoot real well .
 I am disappointed with this puchase . Owerall quality is very low , band was made recklessly and rude . Tubes have different size . Velocity decreased about 30 % comparing with Trumatk standard pull . It is very unpleasant to recieve such low quality product
 I never recieved my order , after communication from the seller I contacted the USPS with a tracking number -LRB- per their instruction -RRB- . They said it was delivered ... I order from Amazon all the time , this is the only product I have paid for and never recieved . Neither the Post Office or the seller are taking any responsibility for my missing order ... Order at you own risk ! The seller has changed from the military trail gear shop from whom I ordered to cheap humididors .
 THE FIRST FLAGPOLE RAIL MOUNT I ORDERED , THE HANDLE TO TIGHTEN THE FLAGPOLE BROKE OFF . I TRIED TO DRILL THE SCREW OUT , BUT WENT THROUGH MORE DRILL BITS THAN IT WAS WORTH . I ORDERED A SECOND ONE , IT HAS BEEN OK SO FAR . THE FIRST ONE WAS A PIECE OF JUNK ! BY THE TIME I ORDERED A SECOND ONE THE PRICE HAD GONE UP . I ALMOST DECIDED NOT TO FLY THE FLAG !
 I can not comment about the watch because the watch I recd . looked as if someone used it for a good period of time and then returned to Amazon . The box it was sitting in was also not like fresh looking , my heart broke to see the condition of the watch and the box and even though I had liked the picture and features of the watch but I could not keep it in the way I recd . it , hence I returned the watch by next post . So it 's not about the watch folks .
 I have had one of these watches for many years and like another poster would probably buy another if mine failed . I have had 3 or 4 crystals replaced , as they seem to scratch easily but I like the look and feel of the band . It keeps good time , though the date window is a bit small.But I think that paying $ 200 + for one of these is nuts . Citizen turns out watches just like these that sell all over the planet for 1/4 that price . I think that I bought mine for around $ 150 . It 's a great watch but a lousy price . Check with your local Seiko retailer -LRB- like a jewelry store -RRB- . They are dead these days and would love to sell you a watch for a few bucks over cost .
 Hate to be a downer here , but I ordered the large size -LRB- 9-11 -RRB- and my feet are a normal width size 10 . I have tried 5-6 times now to put these fins on my bare feet . First impression is that these fins are hard molded plastic , not rubber , since the material is so inflexible and so heavy . After struggling to get them on , the hard rubbber digs hard at my ankles and especially the skin on the sides and top of my foot -LRB- even with the soft padding on top of the foot pocket -RRB- . Ouch . The problem is the opening into the footwell is so narrow and tight that getting your feet through is a painful chore . My size 10 foot does barely fit down into the foot pocket , but the area around the ankle is being dug into by the strap and rim of the foot pocket . It 's like these fins are designed for a size 8.5 foot down in the pocket and a size 6 going in . It would be bad enough if the fin material was softer rubber , but this is the firmest fin material I have ever touched . Not a change of wearing a bootie or even a dive sock.I brought these fins into the office and had my partner -LRB- size 10 also -RRB- try these on his bare feet . He fought like hell to get them on his feet and could n't wait to get them off . Not going to bother to take these in the surf to see if saltwater loosens the fit . Sorry , I had high expectations here . Just curious why the hell this hardest of all rubbers was chosen to manufacture these fins . Again , sorry .
 Great if you do n't actually need a sleeping bag . I thought , `` It 's cheap and light , probably great for beaching camping in southern Baja , Mex . '' I froze even with two blankets .
 I bought the Wald # 215 Rear Mount Bicycle Rack to fit onto my 2nd Ladies 26 '' Schwinn Ranger . As soon as I opened the box I knew I was in for some hurting . There was no diagram or set of instructions and the bag that was supposed to contain hardware had been torn open and was missing nuts and bolts . After informing Niagara of the missing hardware , I was sent them immediately hoping the missing hardware was n't a fluke . Well , it was and it was n't . Yes , this set is supposed to come with a set of small screws to connect the rack to the bracket and the eyelets . But it does n't come with the much needed larger bolt to complete the assembly.This does n't sound like much of a big deal , but if you 're a good distance away from from a decent hardware store or bike shop , it 's an unbelievable hassle . It 's also irritating in principle -- why make customers search hill and dale for a measly little bolt and nut when it could 've just included it as part of the set and charged an extra 50 cents to cover the cost ? What customer would n't gladly pay that much to avoid the trouble?At any rate , after a day or so , I found a nut and bolt . But when I tried assembling the bike it turned out that the search had been for nought . The rack does n't fit because of the angle of the bracket . To get it to `` work '' I would 've had to install the rack at a steep angle or use brute force to attach the bracket to the rack . Frankly , I did n't want to take the chance -LRB- I could just see the strain causing damage to the frame or the tiny screws popping loose -RRB- . So I gave up on the rack entirely and am looking into something else.Now you 'll notice that some people have posted rave reviews of this rack . You may have success with it , but then again you may not . This is because it seems to be a classic `` hit or miss '' product ; you just wo n't know how it 'll work out until you get it . If it works out for you , great ; if it does n't , you 'll wind up eating the costs since it 'll be too much trouble returning . Because of that I would n't recommend taking the chance .
 I did n't really look at the reviews for this before I bought it , because I figured back racks are all the same . Well , I should have , because apparently I was wrong . The rack was a total pain to install , and did n't come with either instructions OR enough hardware to complete the job . After so much time spent trying to put it on my bike , and several trips to the hardware store to get enough parts to get it to actually fit on my bike , I looked at it today and realized that the flimsy extender piece will probably not even allow the rack to carry that much weight safely . Grrrrr ! Unless you have a lot of time on your hands to waste or do n't get frustrated easily , then I 'd look for a different rack . This one 's a really terrible piece of work .
 I 've been commuting all winter using this steel rack , and steel Wald baskets too , and I finally switched back to an old aluminum rack . The Wald steel rack is fine in itself , but it mounts in front with a very flimsy bracket that is held to the rack with one small screw and bolt . This is entirely insufficient , and leads to a wobbly rack system.A bike rack is generally useless unless it can be firmly mounted to the seat stays of the frame . My commuter bike does n't have eyelets for mounting a rack , but many racks are sold with little adapter fittings that can attach to the seat stays . The Wald rack would be greatly improved if it could be mounted this way . But even if it could , the rack is made of very soft steel , and the rack itself is still quite flexible.Buy a cheap aluminum rack instead , you 'll have far fewer problems !
 1 . NO INSTRUCTIONS .2 . SCREWS TOO SHORT to go through both rack stay and bike frame member.Can ' t be used to mount the rack ! Unbeleivable pain in the A __ ! 3 . THIS DOES NOT FIT ADULT-SIZE BIKES WITH TYPICAL MT. BIKE STYLE FRAME!The bracket provided is not long enough to reach the seat post area forattachment , unless you tilt the rack forward so much that it 's angledlike 30 degrees from the horizontal !! You 'll have to go to Home Depotfor new screws and brackets if you really want the hassle of installingthis sucker `` creatively '' . My advice
 Do not try to save a few dollars buying this rack . Shipping will cost you anyway and the rack is not worth the few dollars it cost . It would not mount on my bike due to not having the proper hardware included . My wife 's bike has the single center hole this rack MUST have to be mounted , but the metal piece that connects the rack to the hole on the bike is not long enough so the rack can not be mounted level . The short attachment piece means it is tipped quite a bit forward of level . Tipped a few degrees forward might be good , but this is tipped WAY forward and is as far back as the piece allows.Also , the rack comes with 4 bolts and two nuts . You might think one bolt and nut to connect the bar to the bike , one bolt and nut to connect the front of the rack to the bar , and two bolts to thread into the holes right above where the rear tire connects . If they fit , that might work . The two bolt without nuts were too small to thread into the bike frame . The bolt and nut was too short to reach through the hole to connect the `` bar '' to the bike frame below the seat ... Out of 4 bolts , only 1 could possibly be used so when thinking about the price of this rack add in the cost of a trip to the hardware or bike store to get bolts that actually work . What a waste of time . You get what you pay for with this rack . A CHEAP piece of junk .
 I bought this for a Schwinn Cruiser . The rack itself looks ok . As the other reviewers said , the hardware is a joke . After reading some of the other reviews I was under the false impression that the mounting bracket was not included so I ordered one.WRONG ! It is included so I wasted some money there.I don , t know if I should take the time and expense of returning this rack . The main problem is the struts are not placed wide enough to clear the wide cruiser fenders . I would have to cut out the sides of the fenders or use pliers to bend them in . Forget it.The customer submitted picture on the rack on a Schwinn cruiser says it fits , `` really snug '' . That is an understatement.It just does not fit and you have to muscle it and risk damage to your fender.This is not a one size fits all rack . Do not buy unless you are sure it will fit your particular bike .
 This rack did n't fit my bike . I got it to hold the Wald Grocery Baskets , but had to send it back .
 had bike racks before took it to bike repair guy he also this is to flexible and not the right sixe for 26 in bikes or 24 inch bikes this company customer service is useless dont buy anything from them hope amazon removes them from vendor BRUCE HABER NEVER HAD PROBLEMS FROM AMAZON BEFORE TO SEND IT BACK COSTS MORE THAN ITEM THEY JUST DONT GIVE YOU RIGHT INSTRUCTIONS BRUCE HABER WARD 215 REAR MOUNT BIKE RACK NIAGRA CYCLE
 THIS THING COMES WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS WHATSOVER - YOU HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF . COME ON , HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO PUT A SLIP OF PAPER WITH DIRECTIONS . DO NOT BUY IT - IMPOSSIBE TO FIGURE IT OUT .
 Looked great but the back of my bike is too wide and the unit could not be installed . I sent it back and was charged shipping
 I have to admit that this item looks lovely , but unfortunately it only fits certain bikes ! First off , there 's no instructions as to how to put on the rear bike rack on . Second , the screws provided were too short and was n't able to fit in the holes properly , and third the mount did n't even reach the frame of the bike . I have a brand new old style commuter road bike -LRB- not a mountain bike -RRB- , and bought this item hoping to make it look even better by installing the rear bike rack on , but I had lots of issues with it . I had to come up with many different creative ways in order to make this particular rear bike rack work , and even then I had to get new screws and a new mount from Home Depot , or at Orchard Supply . There should be some type of disclaimer on the item sold here stating that it only fits certain bikes , rather than the information stated on the reviews . It still works for my bike , but like I mentioned before I had to go through a lot of trouble since I put money into buying this item already . I 'm sad to give this a bad review , but unfortunately it was a lot more trouble than its worth.If you have a bike frame that would fit this rear bike rack , then by all means go for it . Just make sure that its the proper rear bike rack for your bike frame , since the mount might be too short .
 First of all , the product description on this site does n't really specify what type of bike is preferable for this rack . My husband has a 26 inch , mountain bike , and the rack does n't fit on his bike.Second of all , the product arrives without a single word of instructions . I searched on-line to find the most ambiguous , confusing , and useless instructions ever written on the manufacturer 's web-site . Needless to say , I returned this product.The only positive thing I can say about this product is that it is much stronger than the bike rack my husband ended up buying -LRB- which I 'm expecting will snap in two any day now -RRB- .
 I got this rack for my daughter 's Schwinn Roxie Cruiser . All hardware came with the bike but there were no instructions . I did n't need the instructions but like the other reviewers said , the main anchor bracket is too short to be used at all on this bike . The very small holes on the legs of the rack were too small to be used with the existing screws on the bike . I should have read the reviews before I bought this , I would n't have bought this one .
 This product does not apply to most normal mountain bikes , if any . It 's too short . But this is not mentioned at all on its spec . The seller is also very bad on returning policy . They wo n't cover full refund including shipping fee . That 's one of my worst shopping experience . When I asked them to put that helpful info on their Amazon product page , they said they could not . Try to avoid this seller .
 I have the same problems as others have listed on here . The screws and extra piece are both too short to mount to my road bike . Also , no instructions , so I wasted a half hour trying to install it on my bike only to realize that it was n't going to happen .
 I bought the set of GAIAM bands and ALL three of the bands broke under tension after 1 year . Since reasonable exercise tension is what these things are supposed to be used for , and they easily snapped under that tension , I have to say they are completely junk . Do n't buy them , it 's a waste of money , they do n't hold up over time .
 I got this kit and the bands were not my Idea of heavy at all . Maybe they would be ok for someone who dose n't workout much but for me MMA and heavy weights they were n't enough . I was hopeing for a new tool to add some variety to my routine but this is n't it .
 I always use Woody wax in my boat and im very happy with it but this presentation is not comfortable . the spounge is very thin ant to little product in it
 I bought this tent to start some family camping . Nice set up . We really liked it until it rained . This tent is useless in the rain . You would need to do a lot of extra work to get this tent to be useful in the rain . It also tears easily . One kid tripped over a fly guy and the fly ripped about three feet . Junk . It is in the trash now . I probably used it 3 time over a 2 month time . I spend the big bucks on a North Face trail head and have been very very happy . That thing would stand up to a hurricane !
 I purchased these chaps and wore them only 10-12 times in the woods . They could not withstand green briers ! In that amount of times that they were worn , they got three small tears in them . When I sent them back to Turtleskin , I thought that for this amount of money plus the fact that I had only worn them less than a month , that they would have replaced them with a new pair with no questions asked . However , all I received in return was a patch ! I am very dissappointed in this product as well as the customer service and I will not be a customer any longer ! I came with in two steps of a rattlesnake , and thankfully it did n't strike ! If it had , I am afraid that these chaps could have withstood it . Do n't waste your money on these expensive chaps ... it 's not worth it . I would recommend the rattler 's brand . You can buy 3 pair of them for the price of one of these . I know people who have owned the rattler brand snake chaps for years and have not had the trouble that I had in one month . Very , very dissatisfied .
 advertised as pyrethrins and canola oil , arrived as pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide , which is not a ` safe ' ingredient , and is in fact a suspected Carcinogen , Gastrointestinal or Liver Toxicant , Neurotoxicant and Reproductive Toxicantso i basically did not get what i ordered .
 I purchased this pricey product because on the label it states that it `` Kills On Contact '' . I drenched three indoor plants with 12oz and unless you heard the insects into a pool and drown them with it you may not see any results . To me if the label states it will kill on contact , then short of clobbering them with a bat I would expect them to at least keel over and cough . Hair spray worked better . I did not even rate this one star.Alan A.
 I bought this for my houseplants/patio plants . After a few minutes the bugs were dead -LRB- not exactly `` on contact '' -RRB- . The worse part , though , is that it damaged my plants !! My dracaena and peace lily now has black leaves after using this product !! Only time will tell if my plants will actually live ... but I guess that means I wo n't have to worry about bugs if I do n't have the plant either . : -LRB-
 Used this on some fungus gnats . Drenching them with the spray does n't work . Soaking the potted plants I have with it does n't kill the fungus . I have some wood bits in my potting soil that have fungus on them . I 'm not seeing it suffer after spraying them with this spray . I 've had it about a week now and I 've almost used it all . What a waste of money . Personally , I would get some Daconil fungicide . That stuff actually works ! This stuff suxor !
 This product is NOT a Champion product . If it was n't for my son needing it this weekend , I would send it back immediately . It 's cheap quality , cheap looking , comes in a plastic bag with a `` Made in China '' tag attached . EXTREMELY disappointed . The buckle does n't even look the same as the picture . Hopefully it will last this one game , but from the feel of it , I doubt it .
 Nothing to say but very cheaply made . You can see 2 seams in random spots of belt where it was put together . Very thin too . But does the trick . On `` replacement watch '' at the moment for in game bust .
 I was shocked to discover the label on this China made belt . It says `` Warning
 The dosage climbing collection is definitely one of the best out there , but I have to say Volume II was a big disappointment . The footage of Sharma and Loskot deepwater soloing in Mallorca was awesome but other than that it was pretty sub-par . I think what really killed it for me was Ivan Greene . I hate seeing this lifestyle and sport being represented by someone like that . It was painful to watch the whole segment on him . Great climber , but when I think of BigUp I picture Sharma or Graham dominating a crazy V14 , not some ego-maniac misrepresenting the sport of rock climbing . I 've come to expect a lot out of Josh Lowell after seeing some of his amazing work , so maybe this was just a minor bump in his career .
 Watch the lumbar bulge on the bench . Marcy calls it `` lumbar support '' , but as a long time lifter , I found it very annoying . There is a good chance it will bug you . Try before you buy .
 The hitch pin does n't work with the Thule bike rack that I bought it for . It 's too thick , and I have doubts that it would fit other racks . I may drill out the rack so that it can fit though as it seems like a reasonably well made pin for the price.In retrospect I would have probably just gotten the Thule pin though it 's more money
 This cover is about as nice as could be expected for what it cost I guess . It kept the leaves and dust out of my boat for one off-season . Then apparently the U.V. got to it and it would tear easily when trying to pull it snug and at any pressure points like seat backs or downrigger mounts.If you just want a temporary cover to last until you can save for something more expensive this cover is for you .
 I purchased two packs of Hi-Seas Grand slam several months ago . 8 and 17lb mono . I spooled a Shimano sedona 2500 with the 8lb . Went on nice but seemed a little thick . Took it out fishing for trout . When casting light lures the hi-seas line would n't spin off the reel easily . After several casts I looked at the reel to see if I had any problems and found nothing . I continued casting 1/8th ,1 / 4th and 1/2 ounce jigs . casts were all very short and again it came off the reel like a 20lb . Seems this line will only work with heavier weights like are used in bait casting . The 17lb may work out but the 8lb does n't with small spinners . Never again !
 I purchased the 5 lb-spool of 250 lb test . Compared to a 100 lb test , this 250 lb was half its diameter . Returned product for refund .
 I put this stuff on two of my conventional reels and did a fishing trip last week . This line delaminated when it rubbed against anything . I had a fish on the hook that went under the boat and where the line came in contact with the boat the line had shavings attached to it . When I pulled on the shavings they eventually peeled off the line . Usually in this situation I can feel a rough surface where the line rubs against something but I have never seen this delamination/peeling . I may have just received a bad batch but I wo n't be using any of it to fish with . I have not contacted the seller yet .
 I have used this line before and was happy with it . The last roll I purchased as 30 # , but seemed small diameter so I tested it several times on a scale and found that it broke at 15 # . I have had it long enough now that I can not return it .
 I WAS using 10 lb test on spin cast and underspin reels and the line is too stiff for those type reels , it MAY be ok for bait casting reels but I am so displeased with it , I did n't even try . The spool went to trash can .
 The ball had a ripped seam and thus was flat within a week 's wear . My 9 year old son used it daily at recess with his friends . Probably got kicked against a brick wall . Surely expected it to last better than this . Surely expected more from a `` size 5 professional '' ball . Had kicked an addidas around until it was almost fuzzy it was so scuffed ; it did n't rip or go flat . This Franklin was cheap
 If you 're a large man and get excited when you see `` extra large '' , just settle down . XL for whom ? They went back . And , as always with Amazon , we paid the return freight . But from this vendor , we also had to pay incoming freight , so two freight charges + no gloves = $ 14.58 . FOR NOTHING !
 ... DO N'T BUY THIS ! Man . Why ca n't some people leave well enough alone ? 2003 had better overall graphics and programming than 2004 , and 2004 had better play mechanics . This one has graphics that ABSOLUTEY SUCK ! The guys look like they are wrapped in plastic . There moves look like one of those half programmed conry games - they do not look realsitic like last years ' game.I bought NHL 2005 and this . I like watching basketball on TV waaay more than hockey , but the Hockey game is waaaay better than this . Graphic wise and play wise . It boggles the mind why people would seemingly make an inferior product . What did they think - they were making a better game?Ok , they have all-star weekend . It does not do much good when the graphics suck . They are so bad it is hard to for me to even want to play it . These are supposed to be VIDEO games , not just games . VIDEO meaning they had better look good ... I swear , the only reason I bought this is because Sega does not make it 's ESPN for PC . If they did , I would never even bother with EA . At least with the last two , we got decent games . Although last year was virtually unplayable online . I asked them to give me one fro free and they refused . I did not want to buy a console because I know a new one is on the way . This time , I will get one just to play my sports games online , where I am the undisputed master -LRB- SuperbadCT -RRB- . What a shame . It 's the good thing hockey is almost as much fun.How can they make NHL 2005 look so good , but make this look like crap ... ?
 I was getting all excited for this game to be released ! I thought that this would be the love of my life ! It turns out that u need a gamepad to do the freestlye mode ! When i tried doing all star weekend i was shocked ! I performed a 360 ! but i still lost to JR , and he only did a simple tomahawk ! So that wasnt going to spoil the game for me . I tried doing the dynasty mode insted ! Whoops ! That was a waste of my whole stinken time ! In the first year as the pistons , i lost hamilton to the nuggets and i lost big ben because of a stubid injury ! I tried being another team , but then i found out that it sucked too ! There was too many unrealalistic plays ! Wow can Chirs Webber really toss an ally oop from Half Court ! I do n't think so ! If u want this game , try the demo ! but the demo might be like maddden , and not let u play a single minute of the game ! Get the demo and try it out ! I guarentee it will not be a masterpiece ! Peace out ! I am sick of Ea sports and their stubid non sense games !
 Do Not buy this game . This game sucks . It is a waste of time.It will be really easy to win if you play as a starter but If you go one level up to All-star , then you will be whooped big time . Player does not dunk good . Just look at NBA Live 2003 , it 's the best version I have played from EA Sports , I hope they make some big chanes in NBA Live 2006
 First off I have to say that I went away from my policy of buying series sports games more than once every couple of years , since there is n't very much different from one year to the next , because this game seemed to be very promising and I loved 2004 . This game was a huge disappointment . First off the big selling point , the all-star weekend with the 10,000 different dunk possibilities is useless unless you have a game pad with an analog stick , which I do n't have and one of the reasons I do n't have a console system . So you can only do about 8 or 9 different dunks -LRB- or at least I could -RRB- which gets old quickly . Second , they seemed to take a lot of the fun out of the dynasty and regular game play modes making them far too difficult for the average or sparatic player . In the dynasty mode you no longer can just sign a free agent you have to come up with far too specific and technical contract terms and wait a couple of days for the player to accept or not . I also could n't trade anyone because of cap space even when the players had the same salaries , so I was basically stuck with the same horrible team -LRB- Clippers -RRB- that I get to suffer over watching on television . They also took away one of the good parts of 2004 the power step , which they called a cheat , and now you either get called for a charge or get stripped . This is not realistic because NBA players do this all day long when going to the hoop . Another one of the big selling points was the return of the midrange jumper but they made it even harder to make easy shots . Players like Peja and Ray Lewis consistently miss open 3 's . Finally 2005 is basically the same game as 2004 with all of the good parts , mentioned above , taken out . They even have some of the same horrible commentary from 2004 . Some stuff , like how Lebron James `` has demonstrated why he could make the jump from high school to the pro 's so easily '' is taken directly from 2004 . If you have n't played NBA Live before or have n't played it for a couple of years then this is the game for you but if you like 2004 then keep playing that and wait for EA to come up with a version in a couple of years that is more original .
 I 've played the PS2 version of this , which has glitches in it that make the gameplay unbearable , but the PC version is even worse . The gameplay is choppy , and it makes you feel like your eyes are going to pop out of your head because it hurts to watch the screen . I 've never played a game I 've been so disappointed in . It 's a great game , if they could only make it run smoothly . So do n't buy this game , it 's a waste of time and money .
 This is the most sickening game ever . Ok , it has nice features like `` All star weekend '' added to entice costumers . But the most basic thing in a game - The Gameplay is awful . Cmon , what 's with the passing in this game . How difficult is it to design a game with proper passing ? if i press a combination of direction arrows , the ball should go to the nearest player in that direction . in this game it will go to every player but that one . It really gets on to your nerves . I played a whole season , every match , so that I will get used to the passing . But no , i conclude it is the game developers ' mistake , not mine . Why do n't EASPORTS just `` fire '' the programmers who developed the passing feature and try for a better game next year . I urge everyone to not to buy this game .
 This game sucks . However , if you like cheating opponents it is the game for you . It is impossible to win . The shooting and passing is defective . Do yourself a favour and do not buy this game . You will most likely buy a game controller to go a long whith it and then it will be an even bigger waste of money .
 It all ocured to me that the game nba live 2005 was going to be one of the greatest ea games ever created , right behind madden 1990 ! As u all know , the game does n't get released untill late fall ! That for one thing is an outrage ! Why ! Why is it that every fricken year the ea sports peeps release the major game systems copies earlier , but leave the computer copies to rust ! That was the first flaw in their little plan they created ! Another thing was the demo ! I just want to see what the game is like , so i try the demo . One thing i did not enjoy about downloading the game was that it took so long to download ! Just to make things worse , the demo -LRB- not the game -RRB- takes up more memory than madden 1998 and madden 1999 combined ! Now thats a piece of crap ! Now after i downloaded the demo , installed the game demo , and opened it up , what do i find ?! A simple little viedo of the game ! Ahhhh ! I was not inpressed with that at all . I am going to wait for the game to come out so i can burn another -LRB- ... -RRB- on this game . I have one thing to say for the ea crew ! Release ur games earlier ! U make me sick !
 Yes , I know it is old , but I forgot how much I hated it > . < It is the only PC basketball game that I know of , unless I have missed when ESPN 2k made the hop . Lets start from the top
 My first , and major grievance , is that the `` sliders '' have little to no effect on the gameplay . I found rebounding to be a chore , even on the lowest difficulty . The main issue is that the PC is tracking the ball , while you need to depend on a visual method , which is often inaccurate.I tested the sliders by pushing the CPU rebounding to 0 , and the user rebounding to 99 . I then upped my center 's rebounding to 99 as well , and I squeaked out a few more rebounds than the PC.However , when the difficulty is at its lowest , you can have players reach triple figures in scoring while still only getting 20-25 team rebounds per game . As for blocked shots - there are just certain centers that you do n't want to face.Yao Ming , for example , will easily rack up about 10-15 blocked shots . Most of these are , as another review stated , in ridiculous situations.The foul calls are horrendous . I was averaging a 6/1 ratio for foul calls -LRB- against me -RRB- . So after 30 fouls had been called , 24 went to the PC , 6 went to me . I have yet to see a PC run player even break the top 30 for Free Throw Attempts.The only real thing I noticed about moving the difficulty sliders was how often they 'd steal a pass . At the lower difficulties , you can pass right through traffic , where at the higher difficulties , you better make sure you have a clear passing lane.This is the kind of game you install , bang your head against the desk , then put away .
 Sigh . EA Sports has done it again ... created a basketball game that gets some things right but totally blows it on others . I guess I 'll break this thing up into catagories ... GRAPHICS
 We purchased this a while ago and slept on it maybe a total of 10 times . We had it packed away safely in storage for a while.When we took it out again to use , it deflated in the middle of night . Wish these were made better .
 I do n't know if we got a bum deal or what , but this twin mattress by Greatland is flat by morning . Who wants to wake up on an air mattress that 's 70 % deflated ? Not me . Good if you want to hint to your houseguest that it 's time to go .
 If this was a more expensive product I 'd give it 1-star . However , it did last us two years before it became un-useable . Probably used a total of 60 times during that period . If you 're looking for something cheap that wo n't be used very much , then this might work . Otherwise do n't bother .
 I do n't know if it 's the materials used or glues , but this piece of junk started leaking air on the first time I layed down on it . I want my money back . Very disappointed .
 In preparation for my trip to my brother 's place , I ordered 2 of these Airbeds for me and my son . Ok so , we arrive at his place , unpacked , then went out and had dinner . My boy and I were exhausted from the trip , so when we got back to my brother 's , we watched a little TV , then decided to roll-out our new Airbeds and go right to sleep . But guess what ? The pump that comes with the Airbed needs to be charged for 12 hours ! So here I am blowing up the Airbed by mouth and I guess I 'm not in shape enough to accomplish this task and I fainted half way through . My brother was concerned so he called 911 and the paramedics came rushing in . By that time I was feeling ok , so they emergency crew left . Well , just about 5 minutes after they left , I started to have heart problems and they were called back in and drove me to the local hospital . I spent the night there being tested and the report was `` I over exhausted myself '' by trying to blow up the Airbed . So anyway , remember , it needs charging !!!!!!
 If you 're a large man and get excited when you see `` extra large '' , just settle down . XL for whom ? They went back . And , as always with Amazon , we paid the return freight . But from this vendor , we also had to pay incoming freight , so two freight charges + no gloves = $ 14.58 . FOR NOTHING !
 This book is written for those with very little knowledge about yoga . It seems as if there is a disclaimer to contact your physician every other page.I 'd highly recommend reading `` Yoga as Medicine '' by Timothy McCall M.D. Much better .
 I wo n't be purchasing this book due to the photo on the cover ! I 'd say most yoga teachers know that you do n't work tree pose by placing your foot on the knee joint -LRB- it goes below or above , but not directly on -RRB- because they do n't bend in sideways directions . I do n't think what I am saying is controversial . I 'll pass on this one .
 I expected more of this scope for paying 300 bucks . I have had two replacements already . First , it looses its zero every time I adjust the zoom , first and second scope . Second , there is a string/hair inside the optics tube that is directly in the line of the cross hairs . I would not recommend an AIM scope to anyone who wants to be able to hit what they are aiming at . Spend a couple extra bucks and buy a bushnell or something worth while that has a good reputation .
 This product is NOT a Champion product . If it was n't for my son needing it this weekend , I would send it back immediately . It 's cheap quality , cheap looking , comes in a plastic bag with a `` Made in China '' tag attached . EXTREMELY disappointed . The buckle does n't even look the same as the picture . Hopefully it will last this one game , but from the feel of it , I doubt it .
 Nothing to say but very cheaply made . You can see 2 seams in random spots of belt where it was put together . Very thin too . But does the trick . On `` replacement watch '' at the moment for in game bust .
 I was shocked to discover the label on this China made belt . It says `` Warning
 I ordered this tactical pants because I had previously owned 5.11 products and because there are n't a lot of other brands that make as durable pants as this company does . Comfort and appearance though , what a mess ! First of all , I am deployed out in a war zone and out here you want to have the best ... something that does not hinder your job and that can take a beating . Second , you want to look presentable and professional since you represent someone who is paying your bills . Well , the 5.11 # 74251 Tactical Pants and its whole family , have an extremely wide and baggy inseam and , for what reason ??? I do n't know , but it sure chafes down on your inner thighs and gives you what we call , `` monkey butt '' A day of high activity in these pants and your inner thighs will be done ... and do not get wet ! You would be in serious trouble and if you do , YOU WILL find out why we call it , `` monkey butt '' As far as appearance goes , unless you can find someone you can hire to `` redo '' your pants , you are going to look like the latest kid on the block in your super baggy/baby diaper-like pants . Like I said earlier , there are n't a lot of company 's out there that make gear as durable as 5.11 and you will appreciate that when you find yourself rolling in the dirt , but as far as comfort and looks , it definitely needs some work . I hope they re-think this design .
 Many of my law enforcement friends have depts that use 5.11 but I 've found they 're more marketing than superior quality . You can get the same items cheaper from places like Propper or Charles River . Frankly , agencies that use 5.11 are wasting tax payer money on items they could get at much better prices .
 I have the same pair of pants that are the exact same number but are different . These pants are made of that terrible material that collects every little hair/lint/anything on to it and looks terrible . While the other pair that I had before and bought at the store and not through this seller are the exact same number and description but do not collect everything in sight on them . I of course returned them , and will just go to the store to buy the pair I want .
 i 'm a 29 '' waist but i noticed that as the waist sizes go down , other dimensions stay the same . so if you 're a skinny guy do n't even consider getting there because you will look like a hood rat in baggy pants , which is in no way presentable in a professional setting and outright uncomfortable which can get in the way of any active operations.on the contrary , the materials and workmanship are superior , so if you 're a waist size 38 and above go ahead and get these .
 I have to return this item because itis the wrong size , wrong color , wrong style . Will be sending it back .
 Extremely loose in seat and legs . There 's twice as much material as necessary making them feel heavy . The legs are so big you could get them on over ski boots .
 The tent has a very nice enclosure space for up to three people and possibly a cot . The ventilation is very up to date with large vents on all sides . -- But when I put the Rain Shield on it did not cover the ventsor windows enough and would permit rain to drip/run into the tents inner area , which makes this tent unsuitable for all weather conditions .
 I purchased two packs of Hi-Seas Grand slam several months ago . 8 and 17lb mono . I spooled a Shimano sedona 2500 with the 8lb . Went on nice but seemed a little thick . Took it out fishing for trout . When casting light lures the hi-seas line would n't spin off the reel easily . After several casts I looked at the reel to see if I had any problems and found nothing . I continued casting 1/8th ,1 / 4th and 1/2 ounce jigs . casts were all very short and again it came off the reel like a 20lb . Seems this line will only work with heavier weights like are used in bait casting . The 17lb may work out but the 8lb does n't with small spinners . Never again !
 I purchased the 5 lb-spool of 250 lb test . Compared to a 100 lb test , this 250 lb was half its diameter . Returned product for refund .
 I put this stuff on two of my conventional reels and did a fishing trip last week . This line delaminated when it rubbed against anything . I had a fish on the hook that went under the boat and where the line came in contact with the boat the line had shavings attached to it . When I pulled on the shavings they eventually peeled off the line . Usually in this situation I can feel a rough surface where the line rubs against something but I have never seen this delamination/peeling . I may have just received a bad batch but I wo n't be using any of it to fish with . I have not contacted the seller yet .
 I have used this line before and was happy with it . The last roll I purchased as 30 # , but seemed small diameter so I tested it several times on a scale and found that it broke at 15 # . I have had it long enough now that I can not return it .
 I WAS using 10 lb test on spin cast and underspin reels and the line is too stiff for those type reels , it MAY be ok for bait casting reels but I am so displeased with it , I did n't even try . The spool went to trash can .
 I have used this before . THIS time , I would swear it was nothing but a bottle of water . ABSOLUTELY no aroma . I will not chance using this again when I KNOW there are more reliable products on the market . Sorry Tink 's .
 I bought this because I thought it comes in a pack of 6 . I only received 1 . $ 3 plus $ 7 shipping is not worth it !
 I was willing to pay the high price for this bar under the assumption I would be getting a high quality bar . Unfortunately for me , this did n't turn out to be the case . The ad specifies `` Rotating sleeves for unrestricted movement '' and on the Hampton web site it states they use a `` bronze bushing system that guarantees the smoothest rotation possible '' . One of the sleeves does rotate smoothly but the other does n't . The problem sleeve rotates smoothly for about 80 % of the rotation then it encounters resistance which stops it . Yes , if you apply some force it will rotate over this part - but it is n't in any sense of the word smooth . It may be that with use this will eventually change and loosen up . But for the money you pay for this bar you would think Hampton would have better quality control to ensure the bar works as advertised from day one . I do n't recommend this bar .
 I 've giving it a single star for being unreliable.I got this thing and tried it out a couple times and it seemed to work . Then I took it on a weeklong backpack trip and it failed from day one because it ran the rechargeable batteries down after less than 5 uses . I should have brought Iodine tabs as a backup.Also , the LED lights used to indicate readiness are very difficult to see in sunlight , and the message system needlessly confusing . A sound-based system would be much better . Finally , the info about lights out to be printed on the case so that losing the instructions does n't render the unit totally useless .
 I ordered this as a custom designed holster for my Taurus PT145 . It does not fit right , my gun does not slide far enough into holster for closure to snap . Basically wasted 50 bucks .
 I took this filter on my Appalachian Trail hike in 2005 , and it broke within the first 100 miles . I followed all instructions , kept it in its special pouch , etc. . I even sang to it . It worked great for a few days , worked intermittently for a few more days , and then quit on me . I took it back for a refund.It works , but it is too delicate for long distance backpacking . I 'd recommend a filter , or better yet , a chemical purifier -LRB- e.g. , iodine , Aqua Mira -RRB- .
 Broke after about six months . Maybe used 10 times in those six months . I was always carefull and kept pen in its case , also ensuring limited shock and vibration to the device . One day it started to flicker and just stopped working . I would n't rely on it as a primary means of purification in any case . Junk .
 The unit I received does not work as advertised with rechargeable batteries . Tried 4 sets of strong NiMH batteries with the same result
 I bought this product for an upcoming trip to Peru , hoping to prevent buying bottled water . I purchased an 8 pack of brand new Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for it . Slipped in the batteries and the unit was completely dead straight out of the package . Nadda . Tried a second set of batteries . Same thing . Even tried flipping the batteries around just in case the Chinese workers misprinted the polarity labels . Zilch . The LED light on the unit would n't even light up . I would not recommend this product . We will be returning to our trusty Katadyn . It may be bulky , but it 's reliable and that 's the most important thing when you 're backpacking .
 Took this item to Thailand . Batteries went dead after using it twice . Completely drains batteries , and will no longer produce light . Carried it around because it was so expensive , but had to buy bottled water during the whole trip . Do n't waste your money .
 My `` used '' Cap Barbell Xodus VKR Chin-Dip stand came without instructions and without the chin-up bar . BUYER BEWARE of used items from this vendor . I sent an email two weeks ago asking them to send instruction and the chin-up bar with no response . They must be busy laughing at all the folks who buy used equipment from them . NEVER AGAIN . These guys suck .
 My experience with this band seems to be different than other reviewers . The orginal band on my Seiko Aquamatic lasted only a few months . Great watch , lousy band . It was polyurethane and my experience is that polyurethane bands will crack and break . This was advertised as a rubber watch band . Real rubber will last for years though I have n't seen real rubber watch bands lately . I ordered this as a replacement and in a year or so it also cracked and broke . I replaced with with one I made myself from nylon webbing . The Seiko watch on the other hand is a great self winding watch . The one I have is my second one . The first lasted many years of diving and hard wear .
 Do not buy this product ! This is not a seiko watch band . It is an extremely poor quality fake made in China . The original is rubber - this is more like a hard plastic . The original is designed to expand and contract with a wet suit . This product has some pathetic attempt to make it look like it expands . The part that really ticks me off is there is an oceanic stamp on the strap - not a Seiko Trademark , but has been synomomous with every authentic Seiko dive watch I have ever owned . I do n't know if the seller is aware of what they are selling , and how much of a fraudulent copy it is .
 I 'm very disappointed that there was warranty for this item . I also sent an email to customer service about warranty but still no reply .
 A CHEAP Chinese knockoff . Truly worth only $ 5 . I paid $ 21.95 for total garbage . The only thing that I can say is Caveat Emptor .
 if you want the real thing you are going to have to spend more than double this price , if fake does not bother you , go ahead and get this one . I returned it .
 Slightly chincy rubber ... . seems more plastic ... . but the big problem is that there are supposed to have the spring pins included and IT DOES N'T . not good .
 This strap is made in China and it 's longer than the original . I bought my Seiko diver 's watch back in 1982 and it is a super watch that has never needed service although this is the second replacement strap . The quality is markedly worse than the previous replacement . The material is not rubber , the strap is longer and does not have the flexibility of the earlier version . Also the clasp is a cheap chrome plated material that does not match the body of the watch like the one on the original strap . How much more would this cost to make it in Japan ?
 This rubber band is a rather cheap copy of the original and did not even fit my Seiko Divers model . I do not reccomend it .
 This is 100 % fake seiko wist band that I 've recevied . It a China make cheap rubber band not even worth $ 5 doller so disappoint !!!
 My watch band is not like my original Seiko orange monster dive watch band . This one I ordered looks slightly cheaper . This is disappointing because I really wanted the exact same type of band to show up.So , did Seiko change the style , and I DID receive an accurate replacement ? I am unsure.I do know my Seiko is legit because I bought it at one of the official Seiko stores in Leas Vegas -LRB- premium outlets . -RRB- Luckily , all I needed was the part of the band that holds the excess down .
 Got one for my Sea Doo HX , the cap pops off all the time . Will not stay on . I ended up having to put a hose clamp on it to get it to stay on .
 I bought two of these for a pair of 95 Seadoo XPs , they use the cap style pop offs . The old keys were falling off so we wanted to buy some new ones . The wirst strap and lanyard look to be made of good material . The cap section that is the ` key ' keep falling off . I 'm not sure what is wrong . It 's like the rubber is too crappy to keep it 's shape . I 'm going to try to hit them with a lighter to stiffen them up or shrink them.The seller shipped the item fast , and packed them well .
 Are n't most jet-skis now weighing over 600 pounds ? I know that my 2010 Waverunners are close to 850 pounds . Well , the first thing I did after opening the box of my new PWC tow line is read that this product is not meant for anything over 600 pounds . Really ? Why was n't that mentioned anywhere in the description of the product ? That 's a BIG deal.I have n't used the line yet -- not sure if I should -- and I do n't want to spend time returning it , so I 'll try to make it work with something else . I simply ca n't understand why the 600-pound limit was not mentioned anywhere in the description on Amazon . By the way , the ticket inside the package says this
 Do not buy one.The Steripen is dead weight on a backpacking trip . I used it successfully for 3 days , and the lamp stopped working . I returned it , which was supposed to take 2-3 days , and it was gone for 2 weeks . When I received it , it worked at home , but on the first day of my next trip , it only purified 3 quarts , with brand new lithium batteries , -LRB- which they recommend -RRB- , before failing . I tried 5 or 6 times to get it to work , following the manual , with no luck . I then replaced the batteries with fully charged NiMH batteries . It purified one quart , and failed again . I tried with brand new duracells , with no luck.Luckily I carry iodine tablets as a backup . Without them I would have been out of luck.I spend 25-30 days a year backpacking . My old filter is a far more reliable and quicker way to purify water in the back country .
 I ordered this as a present for my Dad but when it arrived I was disappointed in the quality and the design of the product was not well thought out . The handle itself is lacking in the quality to last over time when pulled -LRB- EMPTY -RRB- you can hear the fiber / installation cracking and the bracket that connected the handle was not on correct / would not work in conjunction with the handle .
 This is a big cooler and it keeps food cold for 2 days only . I have taken this cooler on Cub Scout outings . The handle and the wheels make using it very convenient.Just a couple complaints - one thing , the handles are stress cracking -LRB- turning white -RRB- . The other thing is that the lid wrapped on me after two uses . The corners are bowed up and do not close correctly now . The only reason I got this cooler is because it ranked high on the internet in reviews .
 i recd the item and the box was torn at one end . i opened and the handle had been torn from the end . the exterior material was very thin and actually seemed incapable of holding anything securely attached , like a handle . i returned the item.however , since i needed a cooler for a planned camping trip with family , i purchased another similarly large coleman from wal-mart . it was out of the box and seemed fine . i filled it with ice and went camping . i noticed that the cooler would leak onto the floor of our cabin . i suspected the drain plug , but it was dry on the exterior . a closer exam of the exterior revealed a pin hole sized puncture on the bottom near the drain , possibly caused by pulling and sitting on gravel or sand . i wondered how water could enter the space between the linings . i found that when the interior drain mechanism was installed , a small tear had occurred on the inner liner -LRB- similarly thin -RRB- under the drain 's seal . water was getting between the liners then coming out of the small hole in the bottom . when i returned home , i took some bathroom caulk and sealed over the tear.i 'm disappointed in the quality of this coleman and wont buy another .
 The drain opening has a flange on either side and about an inch distance wider than the thickness of the side of the cooler so the plug assembly slides in/out about an inch with subsequent leaks . Will not hold water . Leaks onto anything under it all the time ruining upholstery in car . What 's more the drain plug is about two inches above the drain channel!!@!! Wow , how dumb is that ? In effect , it makes the drain trough completely useless . Quality control is null and void over at Coleman , apparently . It is n't cheap to send/return a 100 qt cooler anywhere through the UPS people . I can not understand why Coleman does n't hire someone to take a look at these prior to shipping out of their plant . It has to be cheaper than transportation back after it is condemned by the customer !!! Or is it just me ?!! I read only one other review had leaks so based on that and the fact that it did hold ice for 7 days , I opted for a replacement . I 'll see how it goes and update when the replacement arrives . The first place I 'll go is the drain to see if it 's located properly and is sealed onto the cooler . Would I recommend ? I will tell you later when I get the replacement .
 this cooler is way over priced ... we bought the cooler to hold bottled water for sale in a food stand , it did not even keep ice for 2 days in 85 - 90 degree days . The size of the cooler is nice and big however
 Order this cooler from Amazon.com which showed In Stock on June 14th 2010 but learned it will not even ship until June 21st . What 's up with that Amazon.com ?
 The hinges on this broke with the first use , so I contacted Amazon , and return was arranged quickly . Happy with Amazon . Not Coleman .
 Bought one of these out of desperation and wish I saved the money . It does not line up properly on the chain . When it is tightened , the tool misses the pin and ends up hitting half of the link and half of the pin . The pin never comes out and the link is ruined . The reason this happens is because when you start to screw the tool , the pin moves about 1mm in each direction as it gets screwed into the chain.Spend a little extra and get one that actually works .
 Do not buy this tool ! If I could I would have rated this zero stars . The pin in the tool broke immediately . I can not even see how this product made it to production . Is it possible that Bell just needed a cheap product to increase the bottom line .
 Bought this to break a chain for a old Schwinn I was overhauling for my wife . Used it on one new chain , and it did the job -LRB- barely -RRB- , but the chain guides are now bent , and the threads on the driver are stripped in certain places . So yeah , there are definitely better values out there .
 It may have been the fact my chain was rusted all to hell or the fact my upper body strength was a little lacking , but this tool did n't work for me . I ended up having to take the bike to a shop and have them replace the chain for me . I do n't expect to have to replace it my chain again time soon but I will hold on to this tool just in cause it 'll be useful someday . We 'll see .
 I have bought this product from several stores and at least two had to be brought back as they defective products -LRB- double threadings -RRB- . Four others that i have bought ca n't even push the pin out of a chain without breaking or the threading getting stripped bare . DO N'T BUY UNLESS UNLESS TRYING TO THROW MONEY IN THE TRASH !
 Broke the first day I had it . You get what you pay for , so buy a Park , Pedro 's , or any other reputable tool .
 I bent several links due to the tool 's inherent misalignment . Every tool on the shelf that day was improperly aligned . -LRB- In an attempt to find a properly aligned tool , I opened all of the packages to find they were all like that . I bought it anyway because I needed to fix a chain and had no tool available . -RRB- I continued to use this tool on a few more chains . The driving threads quickly stripped and both plates that brace the chain bent . This was due to the metal being too soft for the intended application , exacerbated by the improper alignment of the driving mechanism . -LRB- Probably put undue force on the plates , but whatever who cares - just know it does not work . -RRB- This tool is junk . Do n't buy it unless your only intent is to pull one chain off that will itself , be discarded ... along with the tool after that first use .
 In addition to not lining up properly , as mentioned before me , it 's made of VERY soft metal . So , even if you do line it up carefully , it will still brake eventually -LRB- and quite soon -RRB- . I already went through 2 of these .
 Agree with the others . Bought this for my son to work on his BMX and was frustrated that the first tool was so off center I thought it was a fluke and bought a second . Second was just as bad .
 I broke this in half by trying to extract a rivet . It did n't line up 100 % with the rivet and the thing snapped in half . It 's made of cheap plastic . I barley fixed my chain because it broke .
 I bought this to hold back my pant leg to keep it from getting caught in my gears as I ride my bike , but it is very small . It is probably OK if it is just going around your ankle when you are wearing thin socks , but it is not long enough to go around pants . I had it fall off soon after I began using it . Though I found it in the road a day later , I ca n't trust it to do what I need for it to do . I have replaced it with an adjustable strap that clips on -LRB- instead of just relying on velcro to keep it closed -RRB- and which emits a light instead of just reflecting it .
 This looks neat in the pucture but the real life story is that you have to be going really fast AT NIGHT to see any of the cool patterns . It just barely fit on my kids bike and I do n't know about you but I do n't let my kid ride at night.I 'd have done better to line my kids spokes with string lights and that 's probably what I will do .
 I decided to try this workout after reading the previously posted positive reviews , but I was so disappointed that this one will probably be going to half-price books . I would n't even pass it along to a friend . The voice-over is way too loud over the music , and the voice is not at all the calming type one would expect for yoga . I ended up turning it way down and playing classical music over it . The cueing was equally frustrating as I had to keep craning my neck to look at the screen and understand what was being described . The workouts were not challenging in either the areas of strength or flexibility , nor did tery flow well from beginning to end . Skip this one ; try Rodney Yee instead .
 All the pants were ordered size large . What I recieved were three different sizes with lables indicating large . two of the pants were so small I had to give them away . Do n't order this item you will get the shaft .
 I purchased these so my grandchildren would have something to use on my bristle hair dart board . I tried throwing them and they wo n't even stick into the dart board-they bounce off it .
 I have an old cork board and unless I take a pitchers wind up these darts are n't sharp enough and do n't have enough mass to stick in the board . Also they do n't fly very straight . Great if you need a gimmick dart though .
 Do n't stick in my dartboard at an exceedingly high rate . I have another set of -LRB- admittedly nicer -RRB- darts that do n't have the problem at all . I 'd recommend spending the extra couple bucks for a better set .
 If you are buying these for a child 's party that involves popping balloons , then I think they are great . If you are trying to find a cheap dart set for your dart board , then do n't waste your money . These will bounce off your dart board more than they will stick and they fly anywhere they want to go . Spend a little more for a dart that will hit its mark and not cause damage to everything surrounding your target .
 They are cheap and so lightweight that they do n't stick in the dartboard . These darts suck ! Do n't waste your money .
 I expected that these would be a little smaller , but I ca n't really even see my kids learning to throw with these . I 'm sure they would be useless for an adult hand . I just ordered some different ones ... for just a bit more $ $ you can order a decent full size set of 3 darts .
 Very light wieght and cheaply made ... But this not a complaint and do not feel cheated . It is what I paid for and highly reccomend this product for starters . .
 In the product description it says `` These darts are slightly smaller than regulation size '' . This is a considerable understatement as the darts are quite small , not just smaller . My regular darts are six inches long and these darts are four and a quarter inches long . They were too small to use and I tossed them out .
 At 8 grams they weigh less than half of other products . Due to being underweight they do not fly on a stable path and do not have enough momentum to stick in the board . Their plastic fins are easily bent because they bounce off the board causing them not to fly straight as well . They are also not the typical length so it is awkward to grip them . I urge you not to waste the time and money . Upgrade for $ 2.50 and by two sets similar to the Halex Competition Darts 18 gram -LRB- 66200 -RRB- .
 Platsic darts with no real quality . The plastic end has no weight and is not worth the super low proce . Only buy if you want to waste money . Spend the few extra $ and get a heavier product .
 These darts are so light a flimsy they can not be thrown with any accuratacy . If you are asking yourself are these a toy , absolutely not ! The pionts on the darts are as sharp as a needle , they are sharper than professional darts that cost over $ 100 . I can go to Kmart and for the same money buy a better set of darts . Amazon should take this item off their site , there is no good use for this item .
 Actually i dont like them.They were good at first when i firstbought them , but with time they bended a little and did not become ableto aim accuratly . . cause the do not fly in a straght line . .
 These darts are like they are made for little people . Would n't recommend them if you are looking for anything close to regulation size/type . The tails are attached ; each dart is just one piece . They are really light and I had to throw them with all my might to get them to stick in my board . I will keep them so that my drunk friends do n't break my good set of darts .
 I had trouble with this dart set . It was so lightweight that I had a hard time getting the darts to stick in the dart board .
 We returned these skates because the toe area is VERY narrow . My kids have average width feet and the skates hurt . If you order 2 sizes larger then you need ; they may work . We replaced the with other skates that fit just fine in the original size ordered .
 The seller describes this skate boot as soft Nubuck , but this skate is not in the least bit soft ! It 's very stiff , narrow , and has very little cushion in the insole . I 'm sorry I purchased this skate !
 my son was skating for christmas and the skate had torn from the boot part of the skate it havent been a 1 week and its already torn
 Nothing wrong with the product or seller . They appear they will prevent prevent damage to your pontoon boats corners if you hit a dock . They are so ugly and ungainly , I can not bring my self to attach them to my new boat . Plan on returning them to Overtons .
 I ordered a digi camo pod holder + 2 pods . What i got was a green camo with no pods.DONT GET THIS PRODUCT IF WANT PODS AND DIGI CAMO WITH IT !!!!!!!!
 I had similar issues to the other reviewer . The product came with NO PODS and in green-camo . I mean seriously , sell what you say you are going to sell , or why are we even here ? Get off of Amazon . This is the ONLY negative review I have ever given . I even contacted the seller after receiving the product inquiring in a friendly manner about the pods and received no response , until two days later the seller did not address my question and asked me to leave positive feedback ! Worst seller I have EVER encountered on Amazon by FAR . Only buy if you do n't want what is in the picture , because you are not going to get it .
 I had the same problem as the other buyer . They product they sent me was woodland camo -LRB- not digital as described -RRB- , and they did not send me the pods that go with it . They also sent me a paintball mask that was half the value of the one I ordered . I want to return the items , but they have n't responded back to me .
 The harness is good but it says Digi camo it came in woodland camoflauge and it says + 2 pods mine didnt come with any.DO NOT BUY THESE FROM HERE !!!!
 I ordered this DVD and when I tried to play it , it told me I needed to change the region -LRB- although it was already on USA/Canada , which is where I am located -RRB- . I told it to change to USA/Canada , althought that 's where it already was . It also told me you can only change the region 5 times . If it asks this everytime I load the DVD , then what happens after the 5th time ?? When I tried to play the DVD , it played a 37 second intro over and over and would n't go past that . I called customer service and after waiting on the phone for 10 + minutes , I tried the online chat option . The gentleman asked me the same questions over and over -LRB- billing address , shipping address , email , phone ... -RRB- . After about 20 minutes chatting , he told me that he was going to have the Admin team assist me further in 1-2 business days . Meanwhile , I had my husband try and play the DVD on his laptop and he got a similar run around with the region , but could n't get it to play the 37 second bit . It seems to me that it would be a better use of everyone 's time if they just sent me another DVD , as they have spent more of my time and will spend more of their time than the $ 22.90 DVD .
 I 've done Insanity . Loved it . Just tried F&F . No comparison . Looks like a much inferior test video Shaun did to prepare for Insanity . You 'll get a better workout just doing one of the warmup sessions on any of the Month 2 videos .
 This DVD arrived with a sticker on it that said free ! What a joke this is , I think this came as a free gift with the Insanity DVD set , and I think this seller is keeping the free gift and selling it to innocent people like me ! This is bad business in my opinion , dont give these people any money !
 This video was ok . Not one of the people in the video could actually keep up - So it seemed like a waste . You basically just jump up and down for 20 min . I can do that on my own .
 Ladies and Gents when Shawn T made this video he did not consider the population of at least 200lbs and over . There are oversized people that like to stay fit too or stay at a steady weight . I m that population , now as I get older I want to be more defined and get rid of belly fat , I cant do it with these kind of videos if your not showing my population how to get firm especially in the speed that your producing . Make something to help me or at least show someone in your video at a low impact rate . Otherwise I would have kept the video . If your Obese this is not the video for you . Chelle Chelle
 No workout on the DVD . It 's hundreds of Chapters -LRB- inaccessible -RRB- and a 37 second video -LRB- Picture of Shawn T. and music -RRB- . It 's the same pic from the cover . The video music plays over and over . I tried it on TV and computer . It 's just a scam . Billy Blank has some scam videos also .
 Insanity F&F ; , and all other Insanity & Beachbody programs are great programs . Unfortunately , they are not supposed to be sold anywhere other than from Beachbody . When you purchase from Beachbody , you are ensured that you are not getting a pirated copy -LRB- see other comments -RRB- , you receive a meal plan , the program guide , all of the DVDs and a coach who will give you 24/7 support . There are message boards , support groups , Challenge Groups , ways to save money & earn money with the company.Fast & Furious was never meant to be done all alone-its to complement the full program . You are n't supposed to do 20 minutes forever , its for those days when you do n't have a full 45 minutes but you want that crazy intense workout.By purchasing from Beachbody , you can enter the Beachbody Challenge -LRB- win $ 100,000 annually or $ 1000 quarter -RRB- . You can not enter if you purchase from Amazon or ebay , or anywhere else . The price might be cheaper here , but you get what you pay for!I 'd be happy to help anyone who wants to purchase from the actual company so you can know you are getting the quality product that it is :[ ... -RSB-
 Total waste of money.Commercials for his products play throughout the video ... even in between the workouts . Runs like a ` informercial ' on tv so it should be FREE .
 I was expecting a better DVD in a better package . Not what I expected . It looks like a throw a way or free DVD .
 Do n't get me wrong ... I LOVE the Insanity series . Shaun T is the man . However , I am pretty sure he shot this video in his bedroom and made the workout up as he went along . His backup guy , although ripped , seems incredibly out of shape and can barely make it through the 20 minutes . If you buy this , keep your eyes on the female assistant . She actually seems to be trying . If you go all out , it 's a good little workout ... but do n't expect Insanity quality ! : -RRB-
 Save your money . There is only one workout and a bunch of advertisements on the DVD . I subsequently bought the Insanity full workout because the 20 minute workout was not really useful other then as a demo . Just spend the money for the full workout which is very good . Another note , it helps to have completed p90x before any of the Insanity workouts .
 To my understanding , this workout is basically supposed to be a quick 20 minute substitute for days that you ca n't do a full hour of the normal Insanity workouts . I was under the impression that I would be working out for a full 20 minutes -LRB- yes , I understand that a warm up is necessary - I thought it was a 20 minute workout PLUS a brief warm up and stretch -RRB- . Not the case . It has the same format as the normal Insanity DVDs . It starts with a 10 minute long warm up and stretch -LRB- I expected a more intense warm up - again , not the case -RRB- . You then work out for 8 minutes , followed by another stretch . An 8 minute workout ??? I barely broke a sweat and did n't even need to take a sip of water . What a disappointment . I was really looking forward to this too ! -LRB- Edit - I wanted to point out that I am a 31 year old female who is relatively in shape and I tried this workout after completing and restarting the normal Insanity program . -RRB- Sidenote
 I should have read the reviews it 's just a bunch of advertisements . It looks like they pieced together this video with edit room scraps . It shows like 30 secs then advertisements and it repeats this cycle . I have little to no budget but I need to lose weight I sacrificed the money and I am highly disappointed of the value I got for my dollar .
 Having worked out with P90X for the last 9 months , I was looking to try something new , so I got this CD . I did n't expect much , but I got even less.I guess I expected a couple of 20 minute workouts , but you only get one . It starts with ads and ends with ads . The sound quality is very low . It 's not a bad workout , but this is something you 'll try once or twice , and then decide if you want to go full workout or not.If Insanity has a money-back offer , then it 'd actually be cheaper to get the whole thing , and try it out , as the return shipping is cheaper than this $ 22 disk!Basically , this should be a free sample on-line , but you pay for it instead . I 'm going to try it , and it looks like a good workout , but it does n't show me anything more than what I can get on Youtube , in terms of just getting a mild understanding of the approach , and I would recommend trying the complete set , if it has a return policy . This disk really does n't show you anything at all . -LRB- I 'm wondering if the positive reviews are more for the entire set , rather than just this little DVD -RRB- .
 I should have noticed it is only 20 Minutes long . With the talking it 's cut in length . It 's kind of funny the host seems to take a lot more breaks than the others in the video .
 I was never able to use this DVD as it did not work in my DVD player and I was not able to return it , a waste of money .
 I purchased this because I liked the other Shaun T workout DVDS and I thought that this 20 minute workout would be great . It starts out with a few warm up exercises and then there are really only about 13 minutes of actual `` workout '' cardio . Yes , they are extremely cardio and not easy as you can see that the people in the video have a hard time keeping up . I just thought it was a waste of money and I wish that I could return it . I recommend that you spend more and get the full workout .
 I am upset because the dvd does n't play on my dvd player and I do n't know how to return it or get my money back .
 This DVD is not for a typical person . Even though some of the reviews say its easy it most definitely is n't !
 This is the second Beachbody product I have bought in which I received DVDs that skipped . Cleaning does not help.I liked the P90X workouts and from what I could complete this one seems good too . However for the price paid I expect a higher quality product .
 I bought this video because I hate cardio but figured I can do anything for 20 minutes.It 's exactly what it says in the title
 Based on other reviews , I thought this was going to be a quality video ... boy was I wrong ! It looks like it was taped spur-of-the-moment in someone 's office ... `` Hey , I have a great idea ... let 's make a 20 minute Insanity video ! '' `` OK , go over there and I 'll grab the next two people I see to be your background dummies and we 'll shoot it ! '' The sound is horrible and the whole thing is just bad . Not to mention , one of the two background people ca n't even keep up ... he just sits there and watches about half the time ! This is definitely a big FAIL , in my opinion .
 Sorry to say as Im sure this is for some people but not for me . It is intense and alot of jumping , I did some parts and for the most part I modified it as I went along . I do really enjoy the good ol fashion Billy Blanks Tai Bo , walking , and biking . Sorry not for me it is great for someone who has built themselves up to this level def . not for first timers you will be discouraged . I am 40 years old and have been working out since I am 16 .
 Just music on it , no video , no exercise , is this a joke ? Terrible product that I wanted to test before buying the whole series .
 Seriously ??? Was this guy on crack when he did this video ? this is the most random disorganized video i have ever seen . they transitions are terrible , there is no flow . do n't waste your money ...
 I recently completed the P90x and Brazil Butt Lift programs and was looking for something with a little more cardio . Since I have knee issues I decided to try this first instead of purchase the complete program . I 'm so glad I did because I was really disappointed . The workout I think would be amazing if it were just a little slower or he went over the moves slowly once before picking up the pace . I had such a difficult time keeping up which made me frustrated and feeling like I was n't getting the full benefits of the workout . After about ten minutes I stopped the DVD and put in something else .
 I have tried for about 2 hours and could not get the DVD to work . The DVD contained two folders with files AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS . The Audio TS folder empty , and the video TS folder with VOB files . I am accustom to that file format . However I could not get the DVD to play .
 Put the disc in and it just hangs at the intro . Tried multiple devices and it did not work . The disc came from Beach Body . Trying to decide if I want to roll the dice and get another one . Need a work out for rainy days and extreme heat .
 I bought Insanity for p90x , and I just got it today . I put it into my DVD player , and it did n't even play ! The disc is way to small for my DVD player , and same with the computer disc player ! It does n't even work ! I hope for a refund ...
 Out of 20 Min , they take about 5 min to warm up , during the 15 min , all they do is moving extremely fast with the workout routines that you are already familar with.They do it so fast that they ca n't even keep up .15 Min workout for $ 22 ? really ?
 Item received was not as described on Amazon . Amazon listing said `` Lures - 1/12 oz - 3/4 oz . '' The picture showed about 8 Lures with a cost of $ 47.00 , which had been reduced to $ 2.95 . I placed the order and a 5 days later received only 1 single Lure . This Lure I could have bought at Walmart for about $ 2.00 . I called the company and they blamed Amazon for making a mistake on the listing , but they have done nothing to correct it . I am unhappy and very disappointed with this company .
 Just got mine.Very scuffed.Despite the description stating it is a two piece case -LRB- and it certainly appears like there should be a piece for the bottom -RRB- , I only received the top dome.Not worth the plastic it is made of .
 It does n't fit a typical baseball hat . Seems like it is made for a baseball helmet because the hate will bend out of shape if you try to squeeze it in there . Just shipped it back for return .
 I bought this to store and display an autographed hat . The quality of the plastic is less than ideal . When I opened the box , I was surprised to see the plastic somewhat cloudy and scratched . It was so cloudy that I thought there was one of those stick on protective covers over the plastic ... unfortunately , that was n't the case . This will work fine for storing the hat and keeping it in great shape , but if I want to display the hat i 'm going to need to get something more presentable . The case just is n't presentation quality because you can see the scratches and scuffs .
 My husband did not like this hat . The color is bottomland which he really liked but the logo is so big in the front he does not want to wear it . Will try to return .
 I was sent green life vests and they were suppose to be BLACK with a design on it . This was not the vest in the picture nor was in in the Large Main Title describing the vest . Green was in the very small print decription below all the main info . Be careful to read ALL the small print !
 not very good in terms of how it feels , a good back up at most , worth what i paid , it can save a life for cheap
 Thin , small , straps work poorly . I would have just gotten a 5.99 $ orange monster instead to keep on the boat .
 I bought a Michigan stand golf bag and these headcovers , both made by Datrek , but the headcovers were the wrong color blue . They were more of a royal blue instead of the dark blue that is the real Michigan blue . I kept them but not real happy they did n't match the bag .

 I keep one of these on our boat for storage of rust prone or delicate items -LRB- cell phones , boat knife -RRB- . It has leaked since day one.The box sits under a hatch that 's not quite watertight but certainly offers substantial protection from the elements . Yet , somehow or another the box leaks . I have replaced the seal , greased the seal with divers grease to no avail .
 I love all the different sizes of Otterboxes . Generally they are very well made and very sturdy . I 've bought I think every size and just about every color made . Like I said they are 99 % great . My only bad experience was with this particular model or the seller that sold me them -LRB- Gizmo 's for Life -RRB- . All Otterboxes are supposed to be water-proof and even though I 've never actually tested them it would seem that they are . But this model is a problem . I ordered 5 of these and 3 out of 5 I know are not even close to being water-proof . There is a rubber-like strip -LRB- similar to a thick elastic band that is in a `` track '' going around the whole otterbox . When the top lid is closed it makes a seal with the bottom via the rubber-like material . In the case of this model , the boxes I received arrived with the rubber material over-sized or stretched and was n't on the track . I tried to fix them myself but could n't because the rubber was too long.Either the manufacturer had problems with the rubber material or the seller left these out in very hot or cold weather in order for this material to stretch as it has.I noticed another person had the same problem so perhaps it 's a manufacturer problem . In any case I 'm very surprised to find this happen to a product that has always performed 100 % for me .
 This product is shown as having the `` Pick-N-Pluck '' material , but It DOES NOT include it , nor does it specifically mention that it does n't come with it . Amazon , you really need to correct this!Other than this , the case seems to be really nice . I ordered this case specifically for the foam inserts though , so I can not give it any more than 1 star .
 Product does not fold back properly on itself . There are hook & loop straps to hold product when folded for carrying , but there is a lot of stress on the straps and product still stays open by 6-8 '' when folded . Perhaps is a mfg defect , but appears more to be a design flaw and product does not work as indicated . Called Crazy Creek directly about this well within their listed office hours . No one answered their customer service line , but did leave a recorded message with my name and phone number . No one from Crazy Creek called me back , so I am returning the unit .

 I thought this would be the ideal light weight chair for reading at the beach but I was wrong . You have to keep the straps pretty short in order to sit up but then you find you kind of are folded up in this thing leaning back at an odd angle . It sort of looks like your a child whose fallen into a potty . Loosen the straps though and you find you really are n't sitting up . The whole thing also wraps around you because there 's no bracing so it digs into your thighs and back . This is not ideal for sitting and reading at the beach . I 'm really disappointed . This is not a good chair for reading at the beach .

 I orded these headcovers on August 8 2012 when I received them they did not look like the picture plus the description did not specify that they were for 460cc clubs . I thought they were used for the woods since the had a 1,3 , X marked on them . They are too big for the woods . Probably would not buy these again .

 I was quite shocked to look down at my foot and see that the stitching on the slipper was coming undone . Pretty soon the entire rubber sole will be detached from the rest of the slipper , effectively making them useless . That I purchased these less than one month ago -LRB- and using a gift card given me on my birthday -RRB- makes it worse . I 'll try and get a refund for them but alas , I am moving to the Dominican Republic soon and the receipt is gone . I do n't know if I 'll get any satisfaction other than warning others about this product . Perhaps most surprising is that this is a Reebok product and I certainly expected better . Caveat emptor , and all that .

 i ordered on 12-10-11 and i still have not recieved the itemThis is the first time ordering thru Amazon and and it does not look goodI do not know what to do ????
 I am a gadget guy and was given this watch as a gift . I was very happy with it for the first year , but ran into major repair issues after 13 months . I also have heard from other owners that this is not uncommon . The repair for my watch is $ 240 and not covered under warranty because it does not have signature from an authorized dealer on it -LRB- even though I do have a warranty card -RRB- . There are other reviews on Amazon -LRB- under other T-Touch models -RRB- that list similar problems/experiences . Because of the problems and expected reliability , I am not even going to have this watch repaired ... it 's just not worth it.To add insult to injury , the repairs can not be completed by the authorized repair shops . None of them work on the T-Touch and thus everything has to be factory repaired , which takes 6-8 weeks.The problem is that all of the cool technology in the watch comes at a price - reliability . The T-Touch is not as sturdy as its more conventional peers.I would not recommend buying this watch or any T-Touch model ... buy with caution .
 Its a nice watch to look at , it feels good and the functions are pretty neat . But the reliability is awful . I bought it for my husband and he has had it nearly five years and in that time it has had two major failures . On both occaisions at least 3 functions completely packed up and the sync between digital and analogue became distorted . The first time it was supposedly under international warranty but I ended up paying for a replacement -LRB- at cost -RRB- of the internal unit . The second time I 've been billed GBP 142.00 with a statement that the warranty was n't valid . It was bought an an approved outlet and repaired the first time at one so I 'm a bit miffed . Even if I could have made my case more convincingly to Tissot on the warranty -LRB- too busy to bother -RRB- I 'm disappointed overall with the product . To fail once might be considered unluckly but to fail twice suggests a poor product .
 Please consider the following before purchasing . I purchased this watch from Watchgrabber on Amazon , and after 4 months the watch began having significant problems . For example , the digital display stopped working , the hands no longer responded to the touch function , and after a few days stopped altogether . Now perhaps I should have realized , but there is NO Warranty if you purchase this online -LRB- usually -RRB- . Therefore , there is a definite possibility that you 'll have an issue with your watch and not have it covered . I have been quoted at 210.00 $ for repair ... Awesome . Hopefully , my watch was just a lemon and the product is normally high quality . Nevertheless , I recommend getting some sort of warranty on this , before buying . Good luck .
 Mine lasted all of 30 months . Was repaired in the first 12 months under the warranty and then died again after 30 months . Quote $ 212 for repairs - obscene . A quality product should last a lot longer . STAY AWAY FROM TISSOT T TOUCH
 Great concept but utterly unreliable . After various malfunctions was advised by a reputable repairer not to bother wasting more money on this . NB I look after my things , did not submerge watch or anything like that . Spend your money on something else .
 I need to exchange this Detroit Tigers cap for a larger-sized one . Please let me know how I can do it . Thanks .
 Nice looking watch , but had problems from the beginning with my wrist turning black -LRB- would n't expect from a $ 1500 watch -RRB- . After a year and a half the battery went dead , or so I thought . $ 475 later the internals were rebuilt and 1 year 7 months later the pins started falling out of the band . Tag customer service was far less than helpful , way less than friendly even . They started making excuses - `` Do you wear the watch in the shower ? Because the steam will damage it and void the warranty . '' etc , etc.The watch sits in my drawer , ca n't find any one who can get new pins for the band and last time I sent it out -LRB- well , see above -RRB- ... Makes a nice paperweight , but in the meantime my backup pulsar is still working after 5 years , on the same battery !
 First time I wore these socks , I got blisters on the achilles of my both feet , because the back part of these socks is way too short . Had to finish my training with my shoes off and send the socks right to trash bin after that first use
 they 're not the usual good adidas product , they 're a `` whatever '' socks with the adidas brand printed on them , better buy another type with these money . In Marshall I got the wonderful clima-cool sport for 6 $ two pairs
 I do n't understand the purpose of these socks , they are ankle high so you wo n't use them in the winter but they are very thick so you ca n't use them in the summer as your feet will feel on fire .
 Do n't waste your money , these socks are too thick and do n't breathe at all . I use them for rags now .
 A little while ago I spotted these markers on here for $ 7.97 a pair . Thought for that price , I might just as well try them ... Well turns out , they were n't even worth that much.I ordered two pairs and out of the four markers , one was completely dead , one would just very faintly stay on and not blink , and the other two -LRB- which I assume were working correctly -RRB- would blink so slowly than if you were to rely on them to see where your driveway ends , you would have to stop and wait for them to light back on . And should I even mention that you have to take them off the PVC pipe that acts as a pole to turn them on , the switch being in the hollow base ? I do n't know if Amazon sold them at such a low price at that time because they were getting rid of a batch of sub-par units , but I would n't even begin to think of chancing it for the price they are selling for now . And not only are they cheaply made , but they look even cheaper . Spend a little more money and buy serious markers ...
 The compass does not work . Very disappointed . I would not recommend this product to anyone . Do not buy ! Do not buy !
 I bought the SAME unit at Walmart for $ 3.00 , and still feel ripped of . The biner is ok as a key holder , but the compass is useless . It does not work .
 If you really need a compass spend a little more and get one that works . This one is flimsy and the needle was frozen in place .
 I bought this product to inflate an airbed . The first converter received had a broken piece rattling around inside the case . Amazon sent a replacement that did n't work . I wo n't try again ! Not a quality product . Thanks Amazon for great service !
 As Amazon 's suggested pairing , I ordered this adapter to power a Master Flow MF-1040 Cyclone High Volume Portable Air Compressor . It did n't have enough power to turn over the compressor . I exchanged the it and tried again , same result . This is an adequate product for lighter use , but not for what I needed . Amazon , as always , was great about the return and refund .
 When this item arrived and I could n't get it to work with my compressed air generator , I assumed I had misread the requirements . after reading other reviews , I think that maybe it 's just a bad product . Unfortunately , after I bought this item , it sat in the garage for a while before I used it , so I was unable to return it .
 I pluged it in and it did not work.And i do not know where to send it back to.Plus if i did i would have to pay shipping.My Return label got lost also . -LCB- whitch -RCB- is my fault.B R K.
 I purchased this product and let it sits in my garage for a couple of months . I went to use it this morning and it does n't work . Do n't purchase it . It is a piece of junk .
 About the only thing this power converter is good for is powering a low watt light ! Not even close to the product description !
 I purchased this item to run a small air compressor so that I could air up floats on vacation . I tested the item as soon as I received it and my compressor would not turn on . I was able to get the flashlight on the compressor to come on sometimes . I promptly returned the item for a refund .
 I read some of the bad reviews , but I was convinced the good reviews overturned the bad . I was wrong . I received this unit yesterday and it never worked from the gitgo . I will not make this mistake again . I am now contacting Amazon about returning the unit .
 Cheaply made . I got it , plugged it in , and it burned out . Opened and found a transistor not even screwed in . Save your money . It was n't worth the aggravation of returning it . I used it in my RV . I hard wired a wall socket instead . Works much better , and half the price .
 When we received this item it didn `` t work at all . Had to return to Amazon and ordered a different brand , which worked great .
 THIS THING DID NOT WORK FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR ... . I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE . BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK
 I purchased this to run a small 3amp -LRB- half the rated capacity -RRB- pump . The pump runs for short time and then stops . I have unplug this unit from the wall and then plug it back in to get it working again . It then works for a short time and then quits again . I would not recommend that any one purchase this item .
 I purchased this unit to power theKoolatron Compact Kooler , which uses 4.5 amps . I figured since this adapter is rated at 5.8 amps there should be no problem . Well there was a problem . I got no juice from the adapter at all . At first I thought it was an issue with the cooler , but I quickly ruled that out when I was able to get the cooler running while plugged into a 12V outlet in my car.I then thought that maybe the amp rating of 5.8 was exaggerated , so I tried plugging in a standard car phone charger , which also did not work with the adapter . My conclusion ... the adapter is a dud . It seems like after reading some other reviews here , the amp rating of 5.8 may indeed be exaggerated , so I decided to go with another product -LRB- 5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapter -RRB- . *** UPDATE *** The5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapterworked great right out of the box . My first impression was that it was definitely much heavier than the Sunforce 55520 and it seemed to cool the fridge effortlessly . If you need an AC/DC Power Converter that will power a device upto 5 amps , skip the Sunforce and go with the5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapter . You wo n't regret the decision .
 I bought this to use with a Coleman Inflate-All Quick Pump so I could inflate bike tires and other things without having to be near a car . It did not produce enough power to even budge the pump , even though the manufacturer claims it will work with a pump or compressor.Make sure the seller will pay for return postage if you buy this . -LRB- Northern Tool & Equipment did n't . -RRB-
 I ordered this converter and the first one I received did n't work . I have another converter that runs my DC appliances just fine so I know it was n't my appliances . I returned it and requested a replacement . The replacement did n't work either . I would order a different brand .
 Amazon recommended this product for an air compressor that I was buying . It did n't work for the compressor . It would work for a lower amp 'd item , but that was not why I bought it . So buyer beware of what you need this for .
 I bought this adapter so that I could use my portable air compressor in my house . It does not work with my compressor . It is useless to me . Since the time that I wrote the preceeding three sentences , I have found a use for this item . I can use my cell phone 's car charger in the house with it . It came in handy for a friend of mine who lost his regular AC charger . I am changing my rating from one star to two .
 I PLACED ORDER FOR THE SUNFORCE AC/DC POWER CONVERTER , IT CAME IN AND IT WOULD NOT WORK , AMAZON DID SEND A REPLACEMENT AND LABEL SO I COULD SEND THE BAD ONE BACK . WHEN I GOT THE REPLACEMENT IT DID NOT WORK EITHER . I WOULD RATE THIS PRODUCT A ZERO . AMAZON REFUNDED MY MONEY IN FULL . I WILL CONTINUE BUYING THRU AMAZON BUT TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING MADE IN CHINA . I ALWAYS BUY USA UNLESS THERE IS NOTHING AVAILABLE . I DO N'T MIND PAYING MORE IF USA IS AVAILABLE BUT USA MADE PRODUCTS ARE NOT ALWAYS MORE EXPENSIVE BUT ARE MUCH BETTER QUALITYTHANK YOUJERRY FROM TEXAS
 Despite expert advice this Sunforce product is not a powerful enough tool to convert my wife into an AC/DC fan . It does not work . No matter how long I use this tool she , to this day , does not appreciate the classic rock & roll stylings of AC/DC . Classics like Big Balls , and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap have yet to hit home with her . I 'll have to re-read the instruction manual ... perhaps I 'm using this device incorrectly .
 The dog collar is already starting to tear a little and fade and my dog has only worn it for a day now , so I am a little mad that I paid this much because I expected better quality with paying this much for my dog !
 *** Edit *** Flipped my kayak over while the whistle was attached to the shock cording in front of the cowl to dump out the water . The whistle must have hit a rock , because it split in three pieces . I would expect a safety whistle to be a bit more durable . Lowering the rating to two stars . ********* Not a bad whistle for the price . Not as loud as I was hoping , and it 's extremely difficult to vary the volume with your air flow . I keep this clipped to my PFD when kayaking , and I was hoping to give short signaling chirps to the other boats . It 's pretty much all or nothing , and all is n't all that loud .
 Well , I thought this whistle was designed to work in the event of an emergency in the water . So , the first thing I did when I opened the package , was I submersed the whistle in water . Alas , hardly a sound emerged . It was definitely not audible enough to alert anyone -- which was the whole point of purchasing the whistle . Do n't waste your money .
 Bought two 3-packs of the smaller cans at a hardware store -LRB- they were out of the large ones -RRB- . It proudly claims `` Up to 3 hrs burn time '' when in reality we got about 20 or 30 minutes out of each one . I guess they were lying - it did say `` up to '' and not `` at least . '' Needless to stay our little buffet did not stay warm near as long as expected . Terrible , would not recommend .
 I normally do not write reviews on amazon , especially if I did not buy the product here . For this one I made an exception because it is so horrible . Each one of these cans last for about 20 minutes and they have a very small and a nearly cold flame . Do not buy this product .
 WARNING ... i own a Nike Triax C6 watch and guess what Nike told me when i tried to get it fixed ... `` Sorry we 've stopped manufacturing spare parts for Nike Watches '' ... Buy at your own risk .
 Here 's the problem with these inflateable canoe 's kayak 's
 I own a Colorado canoe . Its very comfortable but very frustrating to paddle . It does n't track well at all . It works okay with tandem paddlers but is very difficult with a solo kayak paddle and impossible with a canoe paddle . I can turn a perfect circle but ca n't go straight . The boat goes 2 feet left or right for every foot forward on the opposite side of your stroke . Those were the best results I acheived . My wife and I together can go relatively straight but its still quite a chore . Perhaps a skeg will help but the boat is n't designed for a skeg -LRB- according to Sevylor 's Customer Service department -RRB- so I 'd look at different boats or plan to buy the trolling motor -LRB- which is side mounted -RRB-
 These numbers got here on time but at the finish of the race started to fall apart on some of the sweaty runners . I had the stub on a spindle as the runners came into the chute but some of the stubs fell apart at the hole.Luckily these pieces had names on them so I could place them . I will insist on pure Tyvek numbers next time .
 This is a horrible product for the price . The second time I used it the valve broke . I returned it to the store and they told me it was a manufactures defect . Since I bought it on sale , they would n't replace/fix it . The removable floor is just plain silly it 's one more piece of equipment that has the potential to get misplaced.They claim it is a self-bailing boat , but I found that not to be the case , I usually just pulled over and flipped it over to dump the water.If you are looking for something on flat water like a lake this will work fine , but I still think it 's an absurd price . If you are looking for something to take on a river or some place with a current or rapids DO NOT BUY this product , your money will be better spent on an NRS.Sevylor 's quaility has gone way down . I would give it NO STARS , but the review does n't allow for that . Having seen the boats my friends have gotten for the same amount of money , this is a complete rip off .

 These are very cheaply made socks . The material is thin and they are not at all comfortable . They have n't washed well .
 Nice size and design but very poor quality . I bought to put on the back of my Suzuki Sidekick to carry a deer on but there is no way it could handle a 200 lb deer without bending .
 There are a couple of things I do quite like about this watch . The firm uni-directional bezel ring that is never accidentally turned . Also , the relatively smooth sweep of the second hand is a neat feature for a watch in this price range . The watch seems well-built and the band and case feel like they 'd hold up to a fair bit of abuse.On the other hand , as others have mentioned , this is a hefty watch . There 's a lot of steel here and it makes for a lot of weight on your wrist . If you do n't find that appealing , this watch is n't for you . Also , in contrast to the bezel ring , the dial for the compass ring is quite loose and is easily rotated during wrist motion . I 've found this to be annoying having the cardinal directions perpetually skewed off-centre . Furthermore , and more importantly , despite the screw-down crown the dial on the left side of the case which turns the compass does not screw down . This seems like a serious design flaw for a watch rated to 200m and I would n't trust it for more than a shallow swim . In addition , the scoring on the crown causes the edge of the crown to be quite sharp and can dig uncomfortably into the wrist.Also Noteworthy : - I 've used and abused this watch while doing things like mountain biking , hammering and camping . As a result of some significant force , the -LRB- free floating -RRB- coiled spring in the movement jerked down and got caught on another internal component requiring a jeweller to dis-lodge the spring . Whether this issue is unique to this watch or movement design , though , I ca n't say . -LRB- Update Dec. 2012
 Not happy that it was not marked clearly as a chinese made seiko .
 You can find reviews about this watch from others vendors . But I want to complain here that I received this watch with a small scratch on the bezel!Of course it is not refundable because it is not in `` original condition '' . No wonder why they sell it $ 20 less than other merchants . If you want to buy this discounted watch , be careful .
 I bought this watch and knowing seiko 5 is a good brand . But all of the sudden after 3 times first is when i got the watch , second after 1 week and last one is just last night and that was after a week as will of reseting the time and date . The Crown was not good quality it was a lost thread or i spring or i do n't know i just like i coud n't lock because the short and long arm was moving while i trying to lock the crown . So try a quality brand and good item .
 I bought this watch in 2007 and I 've had to send it 3 times for repair in the past 2 years.First time , the watch started running really fast.Second time , the compass ' crown broke off.Third time , the watch simply stopped working.Every time I send it back I have to pay shipping.The service and responsiveness of CoServ -LRB- the Seiko repair service in the US -RRB- has been dismal
 Soft metal . poor edge . Used for splitting wood at camp . Edge got beat up pretty quick.Finally the head fell off the tubular handle and now I am shopping for a new one.Maybe an old one . This one is cheap junk . Avoid .
 It 's a ten-dollar hatchet sold at department stores . This same hatchet is also marketed by Coleman , Ozark Trail , Land 's End , and many others . They 're all the same China-made hatchet , except the branding.The hatchet is 13 '' long , and except for the rubber grip cover , is all steel . The handle is solid tubular steel , and it goes all the way through the rubber handle cover . The rubber cover is black and slightly oval-shaped , a welcome addition to the circular handle . The handle cover is 6-1/2 '' long and has a slight axe handle shape , as opposed to a straight channel . A hard plastic disc is molded on to the handle to serve as -LRB- I think -RRB- overstrike protection . It 's not attached to anything , it 's just formed around the handle , and will slide around after the first few strikes . If you want to add a lanyard hole , you can drill one into the rubber handle cover . Go through the rear part and you 'll avoid drilling into the steel handle . If you leave this hatchet in the rain , or even outside overnight , it will rust.The head is attached to the handle with a metal fusion . It 's drop-forged 1045 carbon steel and weighs 1 pound , 4 ounces . I tested mine at 47 on the Rockwell scale . The edge is 3 '' top-to-bottom , and has a flattened butt for driving stakes or hammering . The entire head , except for the edge , is painted black . The edge is absolutely horrible ; it 's too high . I had to buy a 40-grit belt for my 1 '' X 30 '' sander to get the edge angle right , as all the other belts I had were too fine . With the edge angle established , final sharpening was easy . The hatchet will take a razor-sharp edge , but the steel is too soft to hold it for long . For splitting wood , it 's fine . The head has n't come loose at all . There 's also a small nail removal notch , but it 's pretty much worthless . To use it , the nail has to sticking out by at least 1/4 '' , and the opening slot is only 1/8 '' at its widest.This is typical of a department store hatchet for ten dollars . It 's serviceable once you grind the edge right and do some basic rust prevention . If you want a better hatchet for $ 10 , buy a used one at a flea market or yard sale and bring it back to life yourself . This Coghlan 's hatchet is okay for the average homeowner , but is hardly worth mention as a serious tool .
 I brought this to take it to our car camping trips . It 's small and easy to carry but does n't do the job.I brought a stack of pre-cut logs and just wanted to cut one into smaller pieces and this axe wo n't do it . Very small handle and almost blunt edge is a big problem . I would have wasted more money in return shipping , so I 'll just throw it away .
 First off the 1 star is not for quality , its for a health hazard . Well I wish I had known this before buying it but on the shaft there is a warning about a harmful chemical . May cause cancer and birth defects ... . If this does not bother you then go ahead and buy it , it seems to be a sturdy hatchet , bigger than i was expecting . Again this product appears to contain lead or some other harmful material ...
 Off and on I 've been eyeing a few of the Benchmade knives online and thought I 'd go with one ... I turned out pretty dissapointed.So let 's cut to the chase ` what do n't I like about it ' ? let 's review ... * Cutting Edge : Out of the box I did n't like the cutting edge , it 's a thin cutting edge and it 's really no sharper than a Schrade slipjoint you used to get in a dept. store ... of course that was about ten years ago.I expected the 940 Osborne to be at least as sharp as a Buck -LRB- or better -RRB- for a $ 145 + knife . * The Axis Lock : The lock design is neat , it 's more of a rail-type of design being that the rolling bolt rides along the base of the blade.What throws me off is the design even though it 's ambidextrous because you need to grab both ends of the rolling bolt to comfortably unlock the blade.If you pull the axis bolt down on only side the bolt tilts so the pressure is n't equalizing on the clip-wire , springs , or whatever it is that controls the tension applied on each side of the bolt.The rolling bolt I think has a safety issue versus the Nak Lok design which uses less parts and is more foolproof.The blade tends to vary on closing when it stops at roughly 160 degrees and you manually close the rest of the way and when it just flat out hacks your finger from closing so fast in a mechanical fashion if your ' e holding the knife vertically.I think the safety issue occurs when you release the rolling bolt that tension that pulls the bolt upwards and ` takes a ride'on the blade base thus throwing the blade closed with unusual force.I 'm a safe knife user and the 940 Osborne is the first modern knife I 've ever experienced that I feel has a semi-dangerous lock design , at least I could say Benchmade 's mediocre sharpness on this knife kept me from getting stitches on the multiple times it 's got me ... maybe Benchmade could sell that as a feature.The clip-wire is something else to mention , if it rusts and/or breaks during use I 'd expect the injury to be a little more severe from a locking failing combined with spring pressure . * Engineering Design : When I first bought the Osborne I really liked the weight factor as it was a light carry knife ... but in the future I began to ponder it everytime I looked at it.My perspective?I think the knife is designed with structural integrity in mind , not durability ... and I ca n't have that.Here 's some factors to observe about it 's design....-Yes the 940 Osborne is made completely with metallic alloys and these materials do make a durable knife , but at certain thickness levels.Once you start taking away durability you ca n't really put it back.-Take the aluminum scales for example : Benchmade knew they made them so thin that a firm clutch could bend the handles inwards permanantly , so they added slim steel liners.I hate the paint job on this knife , it 's a beautiful shade of green and thoroughly done but it feels like dry/unglazed pottery ... seems cheap.-The steel liners taper in a v-formation and extend down the scales and stop a little past those two bolts in the middle of the handles , which secure the liners.I 'd rather not have the steel liners cut away.-The thin titanium backspacer concept I ca n't really knock because it does keep the handles together , nothing overly special about it but it serves it 's purpose.What I do n't like about about the Osborne is the backspacer screws are exposed where a backspacer 's design results in the screws being covered by handle inlays or a full scale material ... protects the screws from falling out/getting lost from being dropped over the years , keeps the knife rigid also.Final Thoughts : In my opinion the S30V blade steel will outlive this knife overall , because it 's high edge retention is the only promising and long lasting thing about this knife.What can I say it 's designed on the mark to be structurally sound in your hand yet most modern knives will blow away the Osborne in durability.Some may/may not think I 'm being hard on this knife regardless of the facts about it , but I 'm glad I relieved my curiosity on Benchmade 's upscale knives ... I 'm just dissapointed I could n't find somewhere locally so I could inspect it , would have saved me $ 145 + . UPDATE : As of 2/27/13 I 'm dropping my rating to 1-star because I officially hate this knife now ... blade play issues.I 've never owned a modern knife that remotely has blade play problems like this knife does.I 'd notice it during normal use so I stopped using the knife and literally had to tighten the blade pivot screw at maximum to cease play altogether , as you 'd expect the opening action slows down significantly.Testing by opening and closing the blade repeatedly for about 30 minutes starts to loosen and the blade play comes back.I know someone 's going to suggest the loctite idea but I checked with Benchmade on that-they did n't recommend it and stated it would be considered altering the knife and would void the warranty , plus the risk of the loctite freezing up anything ... just return the knife for repair or replacement.Seems to me the blade play issue is a common flaw that is n't really common on cheaper knives as other people are experiencing this problem too.When it comes to Benchmade I think their Red Class -LRB- that 's not rehashing a Lone Wolf design under the HK name -RRB- are pretty good.I really liked their HK Monochrome , their Ridge Top by Lone Wolf Knives was pretty impressive for China-made . Aside from pretty nice steel and hi-tech yet questionable lock design the 940 Osborne is just an expensive knife built on the cheap side.1-star highly unrecommend knife ... you can do better !
 first off i love benchmade , i think they make a top quality product.I wanted to love this knife so much . I love how light it is , i love the blade shape and steel . I like the size ... BUT ... I HATE THE GRIP MATERIAL . I tried to keep this knife , but i couldnt . I hate the grip material , i like handling this knife . It is unbearable to me . I have never had an experience like this . I cant stand the grip . it could be just me , because i know many others love everything about this knife.just thought this review mite help someone else . to those who like the feel of the grip , congrats you got an amazing knife !
 The part you connect to the Bow String fell off on the 2nd use on the first bow . Then it fell off the 2nd arrow on about the 7th use . Very disappointed and will not be ordering again . Not worth the cost to return them .
 The fiberglass shafts should be plenty durable , and are straight , but the field points were cheap-looking , The plastic fletchings were bent from being pressed against the package . The fletchings can be straightened by heating them with a blow-dryer and smoothing them out.I did n't try to shoot these with my bow , because it has a maximum 35 lb draw weight , and the arrows are printed on the shafts , `` MAXIMUM DRAW WEIGHT 30 LBS . '' Do n't take chances with safety ; only buy these for very light draw weight bows.Probably okay for kids just learning to shoot , but they are n't a good dollar value at about $ 5 each .
 Tips broke off in styrofoam target block . And since the tips are wider than the arrow shaft , the tips get stuck in the styrofoam - some `` surgery '' with needle nosed pliers to retrieve tips . Happened numerous time on new arrows . Not worth the money .
 I really wanted these arrows , but after ive shot these , and then the really nice steel feathered arrows , in the long run it is $ 10 more to get 6 of those for $ 40 , while 6 of these would be $ 30 , the plastic fins scrape the top of your hand and mess up the flight path , but i got 6 real nice steel , feathered arrows at my local archery place for $ 40 , -LRB- btw 6 is the normal number of arrows in target archery -RRB- I 'm sorry to say , these aroows are useless , two of the tips dented and one broke from shooting at a cardboard bow w / styrofoam in it yes it BROKE THE TIP ! the tip -LRB- width wise -RRB- is larger than the shaft , resulting in it getting stuck .
 These are very pooly made arrows . The plastic fleching comes bent and never really gets strait which makes for very poor accuracy , so even if you 're a new archer you wo n't learn much if your arrows are inconsistent . Also , the tips are very cheap and dent and fall off . I have also had a couple of nocks fall off .
 They worked for about 1 week before the flights started to come off and also the piece that goes in the arrow string was falling off after 3 days DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS !!!!!!!
 These arrows are cheaply made , and have a two dollar value , when I got them , one was already broken , and when I shot another arrow it snapped in half , another 's tip dented when it hit a wall , and they have bad accuracy . The ends easily crack and the splinters are very sharp , and painful . The arrows also have a tendency to flip in mid air and go in an unwanted direction .
 I bought this for my son and the notch broke the first time we shot it . I was very disappointed in the quality .
 The Bear Archery Safetyglass Target Arrows are the WORST arrows Ive every shot . Kids , amateur , or professional does n't matter these arrows are terrible . The fletchings hook the rest on its way out of the bow throwing off your shot , causing alot of frustration for anyone . Second I nearly took my eye out due to the loose nocks which decide to come off the string as you draw back or as your standing motionless aiming which is a safety hazard and becomes VERY frustrating also . Third after you shoot them about 30 rounds a piece the nocks decide to fall off in flight or break on contact with the target . I know how to shoot so that cant be why they fair so terrible . If your looking to shoot Traditional archery go with a wood or cedar arrow ; they last longer and are more accurate then any other arrow you can find for youth or adult -LRB- Traditional -RRB- shooting , plus where you can buy one of these fiberglass arrows for $ 5 you can buy one cedar arrow for $ 3 . All around this is a terrible buy do n't do it , its a waste of 15 bucks ! And for the parents who buy these arrows look at them and say there great , ask them to go out and shoot em ' .
 All I can say is , if you have an high performance compound bow , do NOT use these arrows . You might hurt yourself as you release the string . Mine arrows broke as I released the release . It was a good thing that the only thing that broke was the nocks ' end .
 I bought these for my granddaughter to learn on . They seem to be designed to be bulletproof , not to be shot from a child 's bow . Way , way too heavy .
 We bought these for my son to practice with . They are junk ! Have shredded and crumbled . Never seen anything like it .
 After a few hits into the target the points came off . Now they are unsuable and a waste of money .
 First of all , the ` feathers ' are plastic . Not too good for shooting accurately.Bottom line , I do n't recommend buying archery supplies online . Better to go to a local archery shop and get help figuring out which products will suit your goals.Good news is that Amazon 's return policy gave me most of my money back .
 This item was purchased for my seven year-old grandson with the purpose of encouraging him to hang up his clothes daily . Unfortunately the clothes rack fell over almost immediately after assembly and was broken rendering it unusable . I do n't know what the problem was but suspect that the top team emblem is too heavy for the slender rack to support . A cute idea that did not work!MargaretFan of the San Diego Padres
 I 'm new to running so I bought this bottle based on reviews and guessing it would fit the bill . Here what my experience was from a new runner 's perspective : - Bottle leaks unless overtightened which can only mean it will strip with use.-Strap on back of hand kept slipping open while running.-Pocket is good for keys and maybe mini ipod but not a phone -LRB- as designed but I think it should be a bit bigger -RRB- . - If you carry a cold drink -LRB- ice water -RRB- , you had will freeze as it 's against the bottle and not an insulated sleeve.-Stopper is hard to open/close ... I could n't use my teeth unless risk losing one.So for me it did n't work . Bummer I went past the return window .
 I purchased this thinking it would be a handy way to hold my water . However , with cold morning training runs , I found it annoying to carry . Not just `` annoying '' but rather that the bottle was cold , the carrier is n't well insulated , so my hands were cold within minutes . I will keep with my water belt and stay away from this .
 I love the holster , and the bottle was a nice size but it does n't stay closed . It leaks water when tilted or turned . I use the holster with a different bottle and I like it alot .
 There are two problems with this water bottle . 1 -RRB- Your hand rests right up against the water bottle effectively warming the water and icing your hand . 2 -RRB- The mechanism which secures your hand to the bottle is attached to the elastic which goes around the neck of the bottle . Therefore , if you want the pressue against your hand to be tight , then it pulls on the elastic which weakens the security of the bottle to the pouch . I would not buy this item again .
 I am new to the running world and read the other reviews on this product . I decided to purchase it from REI . I am so glad that I did so that I could return it and get something better . The top is really difficult to unsrew which makes re-filling on a long run awkward . Also , the rubber pop-top leaks and is very hard to close . This is awkward to drink from while running .
 When I first purchase this , I loved it ! I used it during my first half marathon and realized quickly that I did not love it . Your hand gets sweaty and it is annoying holding onto something for the entire race . Most races will have enough water stops along the way anyway but if you want to have your special blend of some energy drink , I suggest a fuel belt . The belts take a bit to get used to but you get to keep your hands free and you do n't get sweaty palms . I kept switching hands during the race . The pocket on the front holds a decent amount of items , it has a loop to hold a key , which I used . I could also put shot bloks in there along with my id , credit card , and a $ 5 . The bottle , like most bottles , will end up getting moldy if you do n't clean and dry properly .
 I use this water bottle for power walking , not running . The bottle itself is rather flimsy . The carrier is also lacking in construction.I 'm not a huge fan of the bite valve . I felt like I was going to tear it out -- maybe I am too aggressive with my drinking procedure . The bite value has a distinctive plastic taste and leaks whether tightly closed or not so be sure to keep it in an upright position . If you close the valve and completely invert your bottle , there will be a shower of water.The reflective hand strap comes loose easily and is not as thick as I would like . A thicker piece of fabric to grip the palm around would have been great . I find myself actually gripping part of the holder , which is composed of a thicker piece of fabric so I can keep a solid grip . Unfortunately , if your hand warms up it is then lying on the bottle and may warm your water as well.I do like the pocket . I have a small flip phone and it fits nicely along with a single car key . -LRB- There is no way you would be able to fit a smart phone in it . -RRB- Even with a small phone , there would be additional space for a license and/or credit card.I can not continue to use a water bottle that drenches everything because it does not stay shut . I may try to salvage this by finding another water bottle that will fit in the carrier . I do like the pocket but that is about it .
 The first thing to remember about this is that it 's still a handheld carrier . So it will interfere with your arm swing , stress your forearm and shoulder , and unbalance you unless you use two and sip from them alternately . Those are issues common to any handheld . Given that , I still did n't like this one.The cap leaks - not enough to lose significant amounts of water over a short run -LRB- which is all 22 oz is good for -RRB- , but enough that I needed to put my phone and car key in a Ziploc bag to protect them . I tried putting the carrier on a standard bottle , but it did n't fit and the walls were too stiff - this carrier needs the bottle it comes with . I also tried adding an O-ring between the cap and bottle , but it still leaked.The top and bottom straps are elastic , which is too weak to support the weight of a full bottle . I had to cinch the hand strap all the way tight to keep the bottle from bouncing in my hand . The elastic was already starting to stretch out and weaken after less than 50 miles.Also , there was barely room in the zip pocket for my old phone , a compact flip phone . Modern phones just would n't fit , so you 'd need an armband or waist pack for your phone in addition.I gave mine away to someone who planned to use it for walking only , not for running.For a really great hydration product -LRB- that also carries enough water for longer runs -RRB- , try Nathan 's race vests -LRB- 2-liter Intensity or 3-liter Synergy for women -RRB- .
 Based on the reviews I read , I had high expectations . But I was thoroughly disappointed by the quality of the kayak . 3 leaks in three outings !! All without any punctures from the outside . The quality of the inner tubes is very poor . All leaks were right at the seams , and very close together . I attributed the first one to overinflation . But that was definetely not the case for the next 2 . And since they 're all within a few inches of each other , I have to attribute the leaks to poor quality . The kayak is also not for people with average or above average size feet . They do n't fit inside.This kayak is too unreliable to use outside of a swimming pool ! Not even deserving the one star I had to give it.I also have an Advancedframe Kayak , which is wonderful , and absolutely trouble free . That I would give 5 stars !
 Given that these inflatable kayaks are not much cheaper than their hard-shelled counterparts I had relatively high expectations of them . I purchased 3 of them -LRB- two 1 person K1 pointers and one 2 person K2 pointer -RRB- choosing them mainly because I was n't able to mount a 3 kayak carrier on the car but could easily put the 3 deflated kayaks in the trunk of the car.In terms of general use they 're not bad , a little harder to maneuver than a hard-shell kayak but overall quite good . The 3 chambers can be inflated with a foot pump in just a few minutes with not too much effort and they 're not particularly heavier than a hard-shell either.The problem though is with the overall quality . Of the 3 inflatable Sevylor kayaks we purchased 2 of them have failed despite only having used them 20-30 times . The first failure was several of the base chambers bursting into one another so that you now have a large lump in the middle that you have to sit on rather than a flat base . The second suffered a complete failure of the material around one of the valves where they appear to be heat sealed around the valve the material has completely come away and therefore the entire chamber can not be inflated.Sadly our use was pretty light meaning that they failed outside of the 90 day warranty period and we 're left with several hundred dollars of useless waterproof fabric . None of the kayaks was over inflated or misused and all were carefully cleaned and washed after use so be warned - do n't expect them to last the distance . Save your money and buy a hard-shell kayak or make sure you can swim ... As a footnote Sears online at least offered a $ 25 gift card by way of an apology but predictably my e-mail to the manufacturer went unanswered.I had high hopes for these kayaks and I 'm greatly disappointed that they turned out to be no better than children 's toys in the end .
 I had owned this less than a year and was out fishing and suddenly , I heard a whistling sound that soon turned into an air gushing sound . It had split at one of the seems and lost a lot of its air . Im glad I can swim . I lost some of my equipment also . I will not use an inflatable again .
 I am not an avid kayaker -LRB- if that 's really a word -RRB- , but I have owned a hard yak in the distant past . I picked this inflatable one up lightly used from craigslist for two bills . Three trips out on a small lake later I am about to resell it . Firstly , I am not a small man . I weigh in at 235 and am 6 ' 0 '' with size 13 feet . Shoe size might seem like an odd stat to mention , but limited toe room was the very first thing I noticed . Folks with large feet or long legs will find themselves in a tight squeeze . Within 15 minutes your shins will be cramping up from having to point your toes awkwardly forward . The 300 pounds advertised cargo capacity also seems to be a stretch . My yak bends horrificly at the middle -LRB- fully inflated , mind you -RRB- creating a space of no more than an inch on either side to avoid water . Casting my flyrod while avoiding taking on water is hard enough , fighting a fish flooded the yak every time . I have yet to come back to my car with a dry rump . The speed is sluggish . I know not to expect Olypmic-level velocities with an inflatable , but this yak crawls through a calm lake . Getting into the vessel is accomplished easily enough , getting out has proven challenging every time under even the most ideal take-out conditions . The inflate/deflate times are probably this craft 's greatest assets . Up and out in 3 minutes with an electric pump . It also has some nice tie downs for alternating between rowing and handling a fishing pole , camera , etc. . I suppose if I were 75 pounds lighter I could give it 3 stars . Bottom line is this
 This is a cheap distress call that takes a big effort to sound remotely like a squirrel or baby squirrel in distress - with that said , other calls take 1/8th of the effort to get 4x realistic sounds .
 At first I thought I had found a great deal with this gun . Except for the plastic / fake wood , the gun had a somewhat realistic look . After fully charging the battery , I went to try this thing out . That is when things started going very sour ! Unlike other airsoft magazines , this one is a pain in the A. . . to load and for such a large magazine it only holds about 35 bb 's . At first I tried semi-auto . The first several shots just fell out the end of the barrel and onto the ground . Then I tried full-auto . It finally started to fire a little better , but then it was time to reload the magazine once again ! later that evening I decided to give this thing another chance , and now it has quit working all together ! If you want a gun to just hang on your wall , this one will work . If you want a good shooting airsoft gun , keep looking ! You can get a good spring sniper rifle for about $ 115 - $ 130 , but you will need to pay a little more for a good electric airsoft gun . I hope this info will help someone from making the same mistake I did .
 I recieved the gun 9 days after I ordered it . When I opened it , it looked okay . then It took me an hour to figure out how to get the battery cover off and after I charged the battery , I tested it out and It had absolutely no power to it . It only shot about 15 ft.
 I do n't know what J.Spencer is smoking but this is the worst gun that i have purchased . After receiving my fourth replacement of this gun because the all fell apart right when you take it out of the box , i decided to get the Tokyo Marui AK-47 . The deferences were astounding . Plus the Tokyo Marui gun looks 10 times more realistic . -LSB- I love how Amazon lies and says it is better then the Tokyo Marui -RSB- They Should be sued . The crappy gun shoots 220 fps witch is ok for a low grade gun . It also shoots low grade bbs .12 gs to be exact witch makes it much more inaccurate . Do not buy this gun !!!!! Look At Tokyo Marui brand , Classic Army brand , they are much better guns . I think That J.Spencer works for Amazon and is writing a good review for this gun so people will buy it .
 The product was poorly represented . The fabric was uncomfortable and description of product incomplete . However , shipping was very fast , and when I returned the item , I had no difficulties .
 I ordered this holster for my Glock 27 and it was a terrible fit . The handgun did not seat properly and it hung out of the holster . I guess that is what I should have expected once I noticed it was made in Mexico ! I found a Galco -LRB- made in USA -RRB- and it fit perfect !
 This towel does not wash well . The fabric hangs onto grass clippings . Besides , there is not way to attach it to a golf bag .
 My dog wore it for a week maybe and he started chasing after another dog . As I pulled his leash which connected to the collar , the collar ripped . Really disappointed since these things are supposed to be able to support large dogs . Oh and my dog is only 35lbs .
 First off , this brand is much harder to install on the buttstock than the MidwayUSA brand . The other thing that I do n't like on this is the flap . It seemed like a good idea , but once installed I realized that the flap is much to big . It either goes way past the velcro , or you can line up the velcro and have a huge floppy cover which gets in the way a lot . I would buy a different brand .
 This buttstock shell holder needs to be tighter/smaller because it slips and needs to come in different camo patterns . Or they can add a strap to it like the M4/M16 buttstock mag holders . If it were designed like those and with a cheek pad it would be perfect . You can always spray paint it and tape what you can to the stock to keep it in place though . Itches your face but you will get over it . Definitely needs to have a cheek pad sewn on to it . I do like the fact that you can cover your shells with the flap . Nice touch . Holds 6 rounds pretty good .
 Unit arrive in unmarked plastic bag no directions.The rifle needed to be disassembled to allow replacement of the factory bolt lock cover with the machined plate portion of the mount . The machined plate was too large to fit in the cast slot in the receiver . It was n't close , lubrication and light tapping with brass hammer did n't help , nor did deburring .30 minutes of lappling on my knife sharpening wheel got the plate resized to slide in the slot.The barrel assembly needs to be assembled back to the stock before attaching the balance of the mounting rail to the replacement cover plate due to interference with the plastic stock of the all weather rifle with the mounting rail . Not sure if I got the rail true to the barrel , will find out when I sight in the red dot scope I installed.The description reads `` Ruger Mini-14 Scope Mount -LRB- blue -RRB- '' . I made the inaccurate asumption I was buying a Ruger Factory product . I followed the links to Global Sportsman , to M1Surplus . I then discovered it was after market . I also discovered I could have bought it from M1Surplus for $ 12 , vs the $ 22 I paid Amazon.If I had to do it over I would look for a weaver or picatinny rail that mounts in the two scope ring slots on the receiver , vs the one mounting point on the unit I received .
 I had the same problem as the previous reviewer , the part simply did n't fit and I had to grind off a little of the metal in order to make it slide in . I kind of thought it was a ruger factory part too until I got it .
 CRAP ! Big pile of garbage . Installed the mount to my mini , after some modifications to the ends of the plate provided . Had to sand edges down just to slide into place . After that applied blue locktite to the thumb screw provided . Slid the mount on and tightened it down , waited 24 hours for locktite to cure , went to the range next day ... had my scope almost dialed , 4th shot went 3 feet low after being 1/2 inch from bulls the previous shot . Mount teeters up and down . Removed the screw and mount and noticed a hairline fracture thru the threaded area . Would not recommend for anyone . Bad deisign . Do n't deserve the one star I gave it .
 we mounted it and the mounting screw hit the bolt , not a very good design , think of something else next time
 This unit is worthless . The one point mount will not tighten without extra washers , and even then will rock 2 or 3 degrees up and down elevation . Required gunsmith machining expense to mount the replacement bolt stop cover plate , which does not come close to being same tolerances as stock Ruger part , and even then does not work because of design flaw . Ridiculously incompetent design . Total waste of time and money .
 Broke first day in use . My problem , I waited 3-4 weeks to install and the side plate broke the first day we shot the rifle . Appears to be more of a pot metal type cast . Will pass on NcStar products going forward
 its cheap and kept coming loose , would n't recommend this brand at all . If I still had the rifle I would try another brand , but sold it .
 I bought one of these last summer , after using it a couple of dozen times I would like to make the following comments : Pros - stores in very small package , easy to transport , light weight , cost effectiveCons - takes a long time to inflate -LRB- including with electric pump -RRB- , takes a long time to deflate -LRB- including with electric pump -RRB- , poor directional stability when paddling , However , biggest issue by far is ... . the boat seems to slowly take on water between in infalatble hull and outer skin , when the boat is removed from the water often several gallons of water are trapped between the two skin layers . The affect is to cause the boat to slowly sag in the middle to the point where you often find yourself paddling with water upto your waist .
 I have used this line before and was happy with it . The last roll I purchased as 30 # , but seemed small diameter so I tested it several times on a scale and found that it broke at 15 # . I have had it long enough now that I can not return it .
 I WAS using 10 lb test on spin cast and underspin reels and the line is too stiff for those type reels , it MAY be ok for bait casting reels but I am so displeased with it , I did n't even try . The spool went to trash can .
 I purchased two packs of Hi-Seas Grand slam several months ago . 8 and 17lb mono . I spooled a Shimano sedona 2500 with the 8lb . Went on nice but seemed a little thick . Took it out fishing for trout . When casting light lures the hi-seas line would n't spin off the reel easily . After several casts I looked at the reel to see if I had any problems and found nothing . I continued casting 1/8th ,1 / 4th and 1/2 ounce jigs . casts were all very short and again it came off the reel like a 20lb . Seems this line will only work with heavier weights like are used in bait casting . The 17lb may work out but the 8lb does n't with small spinners . Never again !
 I purchased the 5 lb-spool of 250 lb test . Compared to a 100 lb test , this 250 lb was half its diameter . Returned product for refund .
 I put this stuff on two of my conventional reels and did a fishing trip last week . This line delaminated when it rubbed against anything . I had a fish on the hook that went under the boat and where the line came in contact with the boat the line had shavings attached to it . When I pulled on the shavings they eventually peeled off the line . Usually in this situation I can feel a rough surface where the line rubs against something but I have never seen this delamination/peeling . I may have just received a bad batch but I wo n't be using any of it to fish with . I have not contacted the seller yet .
 This short has an underwear liner that feels rather strange . I am going to return these .
 My head is 22.5 '' in circumference . This helmet that was supposed to fit up to a 23.5 '' did n't . Lies and also lies.Does look good though , when not on my head that is . For that , two stars .
 I received this just a few weeks ago and the paint is all ready flecking off ... looks like they used some paint that is not meant for metal ... too bad. , . . a hunk of iron is not that hard of a thing to make well . It would have been better if they did not paint at all .
 We only had the Volleyball for a month and could n't figure out why it alway felt flat ... finally figured out that one of the seems on the volleyball had a crack . Now the volleyball wont keep any air in it all all . The leather on the volleyball was great quality , just how they put the volleyball together wasnt very good .
 i oder 3x not 2x i ask them if they coule oder big 3x sd they could ` nt they were out of stock , but could not oder it , i wil l never order things again from amz thanks dianne wright
 This looks like a nice item . However , I would n't know personally because I never received it from Fogdog . I ordered it 3 weeks before it was needed for my son 's birthday , then received a message saying that it was on backorder but I would be informed when it was shipped . A few days before I needed it , I received a message telling me that they canceled my order !!! I will never order anything offered by Fogdog again !
 I bought this thing because I needed a set of battery-powered speakers for my mp3 player , and I thought it 'd be awesome to have it hold my Mountain Dew too . However , the cooler is not very good , in that it 's not solid and if it 's not full , it topples over or folds in on itself . And the speakers only worked for about 2 hours before dying , and the antenna broke off when someone touched it lightly . Not recommended .
 It was the right size for a cat playhouse or place to put a kid for time-out .
 this is a cool kill bill sword but it is not like the photo but they give me a cheep kill bill sword and I dont like it but I went to -LSB- ... -RSB- and it looks like the photo better deal if you want a better deal then go to swordsswords I pad only -LSB- . . -RSB- but it mite be more money but it looks just like the photo that you see .
 it got here right after i ordered it . when i pulled it out of the box the handle fell off . it is a massive piece of crap .
 Just happens to be at the mall and saw this sword , was ` nt worth the money they were asking for ,4 X as much , got to be kidding.Stainless steel -LRB- cheap -RRB- not design for -LRB- tameshigiri -RRB- . guys want real katana ? save your money get a real one.Forget this under $ 20 junk .
 I was able to bend this katana with my hands !!! what the heck this thing is a real piece . And it is not even sharp . This is a really suckish katana , no wonder it was only 13 bucks . I will certainly not be buying from thins seller again .
 Great sword , but did not include stand and Hanso stamp on blade . I must return for these reasons . I would be happy if the stand would have been included
 its not a bad sword realy but the blade wiggles in place if you move the sword around , and i realy dont like that . Also the hand wrapping came loose as soon as my hand gripped it . And another thing is , this sword is n't even a katana it is actually a tachi -LRB- witch is very similar to a katana but a katana is worn on the belt cutting edge up and a tachi is worn cutting edge down ... hard to explain -RRB- i realy would not reccomend this to any body who knows much about how katanas -LRB- or even tachi 's -RRB- should be . If this will be the first sword you have ever owned ... or even held , then get it if you wish , but i would try getting somthing else .
 Any sword that is only $ 15 is in fact very dangerous . These swords are called wallhangers because they are only designed to by hung on a wall , not swung . The reason is that underneath the handle is a very small piece of metal that connects to the blade itself . -LRB- Called the Tang -RRB- In a real martial arts sword , the tang is normally a thick piece of metal that is almost the thickness of the sword itself . If you swing a wallhanger too often or too hard it can break at the tang , and fly off and hurt someone.If you want to learn more about how dangerous these wallhangers are do a google search on the words
 First of al it is not stainless steel . It has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap ... Handle is not that reliable it is like it 's gon na break easily I mean do n't think of any usage . It is only for decoration . .
 Great feedbacks from J. Leigh.This sword is for display only . Try swinging it around and you 'll see what happens . They should add that to the description .
 This is not a usable sword . This is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall . There are very few swords that can be used , among these are Paul Chen 's , Cold Steel 's and the Last Legend stuff . Only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade .
 This sword is like the 440 High Carbon Steel that is cheaply made . You would need to get the 1045 or 1060 High Carbon Steel to do any cutting .
 I odered this item with the weaver mount for my ruger mini 30the first problem i had while zeroing was the windage adjustment was marked backwards so i had to adjust the windage the opposite directionafter i figured this out the windage adjudtment was maxed out before the scope was ever zeroed at 100yds leaving my zero 2 inches to the left with no way to adjust it.this product is not worth the shipping cost to have it delivered let alone the cost of the scope.If you need warranty work you have to send 10 $ to ncstar for them to ship it back to you.The range instructor who helped me mount and try to zero this scope told me about 1 in 50 of the ncstar scopes he sees work ok , so i would assume the quality control for there products are very poor and would definitely not trust them to fix it correctly , or replace it with one that worked if i sent it in for waranty work.I definitely DO NOT reccomend this product .
 A total waste of money . You ca n't hear the bell even if you have it clipped to your body , the vibration feature did n't work and the timer has a mind of its own . I smashed it with a pipe wrench and felt good afterwards .
 I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing products from this seller ! I ordered this product Nov. 5 , 2009 , and as of today , December 12 , 2009 I still have n't received the product . After a few weeks of not receiving the product , even though I got an email confirmation from Amazon that the product had been shipped to me soon after I purchased it , I tried to contact the seller to find out the status of the order and to find out why it had n't arrived . But I never received a response from the seller . I 'm glad the product was n't too expensive , but it is still a waste of my money and a complete disregard of customer service by the seller . Buyers beware !
 Poorly assembled , the one I purchased did not work . I exchanged it and the second worked for several workouts , then stopped working . I exchanged that one , and the third works when I can get a battery to stay in it . The battery does not fit properly , and will often pop out , knocking the battery cover loose in the process.When it actually works , it is marginally useful .
 This product was spot on what I was looking for . However there are far too many glitches , and I 'm still trying to figure out how a company screws up a timer . I threw out the strap from the get go , and as if I clipped it onto my shorts it would flop off.The screen can be hard to read but not impossible , the `` bell '' is not bad but could be louder . Mine worked fine in the beginning but now frequently miss counts rounds,re-sets it self , and freezes ! Its a pain when doing heavy bag work since I need to take my gloves of to re-set everything . For the most part I put up with it as I am a broke college student and somethings better then nothing.SO NO EVERLAST THIS IS NOT A SMEAR CAMPAIGN !
 So I began boxing intensely in the last few months , and few of the older boxers told me about this timer ; thing is , the timer is not for intense filled work outs . If you are calm about your stuff and take it easy then get it - I must say that I did drop it a few times . Perhaps it 's not that bad when I think about it ; however , my rating is due to my experience .
 Unlike a lot of reviewers giving this a poor rating my timer has actually worked for a few years . Even with that said , I believe it was the last Everlast product I will ever buy . The company has tanked in quality for about ten years , leaving only -LRB- some -RRB- heavy bags and perhaps medicine balls to hold up to Everlast 's former reputation.My biggest issue with this is n't the timer itself , it 's the strap and clip that come with it - those are junk and I would suspsect the reason many people have their timers break so quickly . The strap that was included was quite a bit longer than the average boxer/martial artist could use , making it difficult to secure on smaller people . The clip is designed to hook in to this strap , unfortunately the spring behind it is extremely weak which means it 's going to bounce off if there is any intensity behind someone 's punches.In short , spend your money on a different timer .
 I bought this one because I figured if it broke I 'm not out much money , I figured I might get lucky but I did n't . Sure enough the other reviews are correct , it is very cheap and very porely built . The batteries do n't fit in well and the cover to them is tough to keep on . It worked for about 8 work outs and then it just went nuts and even by adjusting the batteries it wo n't work right . Save the 10 bucks and buy something different . This is a terrible product . I can only imagine how many of these end up in the local land fill within a month of purchase .
 It worked great , for a few weeks . Now it just does whatever it wants to do . A piece of junk . I also got a pair of bag gloves from Everlast -LRB- they should throw an 'N' at the beginning of that -RRB- that fell apart after two workouts -LRB- even my inflated sense of self refuses to believe I hit that hard -RRB- .
 The idea was good , but Everlast failed in the execution . The bell is so low you can not hear it , and the vibration feature is so weak , you can not feel it unless you 're holding it in your palm . I 'll probably try a timer from another manufacturer . I assume that Everlast has different lines of products for people that are in the business of boxing , because what they sell to average consumers is of poor quality , including their corny DVDs .
 Broke within 1 round . Quite possibly the worst built product I 've ever purchased .
 I figured for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- how could i go wrong ? well ... by wasting $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . the round counter is always rounds behind actual rounds , it freezes , stops in mid round , all the other stuff you read in prior reviews.i do n't mind the limited features of only 30 or 60 second rest periods , and only 2 or 3 minute rounds . for the price i just wanted it to do what it was supposed to . i 'm bringing it back to where i bought it , and will try to get a store credit . in the meantime , i 'm back to watching the second hand on my wall clocki boxed as a kid , and everlast was always the gold standard of gear . maybe they should refocus on quality , and forget about all the designer clothes and made in china junk gear.Addendum to original post : I have found that by using good , new Duracell batteries , I can increase the reliability by about half . It still occasionally drops rounds , ` forgets ' to ring , freezes , etc , but is reliable enough to use in my garage . i still find myself going ... `` whew ' , this round seems long , and look over and it 's stuck or frozen , but with a real timer going for near $ 100 bucks , it 's tolerable . just keep a clock with a second hand nearby ... With that in mind , I 'd up it to two stars .
 I just picked this up the other day and was excited to start my workout . This seemed perfect ; although the band was too small for my arm , I could clip it to my shorts . So , I started it up and started punching the bag . After getting tired and not hearing the bell , I wondered what was going on . It had stopped at 1:51 . Figuring I must have bumped the button , I tried it again and again it stopped at 1:51 . Weirded out , I set it on the ground and started it , and it went past it once and stopped randomly at another point . So , this piece of equipment was basically useless to me.I 'm not sure how such a simple piece of technology could fail so miserably , but I 'd rather pay a little extra for a product that actually works .
 This timer works great and is easy to use , but it 's impossible to read the numbers head on ... you have to tilt the timer to a funny angle in order to see how much time is left . Annoying . But other than that it works great .
 Not well made at all and only works half the time ; and the programming changes on its own . I recommend spending a little more for a better piece . Do n't waste money on this one .
 Bought one at Dick 's Sporting Goods ... did not work right out of the box.Replaced it without fuss by Dick 's ... worked just fine for 10-20 times.Without any misuse whatsoever , it suddenly stopped working altogether.This is my second negative review of Everlast products on Amazon.com The fingerless heavy bag gloves i bought at Sports Authority were of such poor durability and workmanship they should come with a warning `` for display only , not to be used for punching . `` Everlast is a shadow of its former self , and I for one will never again purchase an Everlast product . This is a company on the way out.The Everlast of today is a disgrace to the brand , and to the boxing tradition with which it is associated .
 What a total waste of money !! I bought 2 , one for me and one for another personal trainer . Mine stopped working the FIRST day . The LCD screen would randomly shut off . Luckily , I was able to return the other one because I did n't open it . After replacing the batteries twice -LRB- thinking that was the problem -RRB- , it sill does n't turn on . It is now part of a landfill . Gymboss Interval Trainer is what I purchased and is awesome ! Spend the few extra bucks .
 It 's really easy to use but it 's got a really annoying sound . You ca n't customize it at all . For what it costs this thing is a complete ripoff . It should only cost about 7 or 8 bucks .
 Its embarassing that such a respected boxing company would put out something like this ... I dig the ringer , great ring but it only lasted for a couple weeks , the battery case must have been put together by gremlins because its just not designed to hold batteries , doesnt even close ... all I can say is ... what the hell ? go see GYMBOSS instead
 No flexibility on interval time - you have your presets and that 's it -LRB- 2 or 3 min round , 30 or 60 second rest -RRB- . More importantly the bell is simply not loud enough in a moderately noisy environment and its hard to distinguish between the 30 second bell and the round ending .
 Wish I 'd seen these reviews before I bought it . Just like everyone says , it worked for a while , then did random things for a while , then stopped working completely . For me , it only worked properly on the first time I tried to use it . Then the next time it would n't let me adjust the number of rounds . Then it would n't turn on , and I messed with it until the display come on , but could n't get it to work . Then it never turned on again . I tried replacing the batteries , no luck .
 I wish I could give this a zero , but that is n't allowed . This item broke before my first workout was over . Contrary to what other reviews are saying my bell was too loud , & te vibrater would continue for 30 seconds which I found distracting . But as I said earlier , it quite working before I was done working out .
 I boxed amateur for a few years , and still do the workout now and again . When I saw this , I thought `` What a great idea !!! '' . Only problem is - they cheaped out on the production -LRB- Typical Everlast -RRB- . It is really poorly made and poorly thought out . Too low a tone to hear when you are shadow boxing , let alone hitting a bag . All the tones are the same , so you ca n't distinguish where you are in the workout - could use a 30 second tone as well . Buy yourself a stop-watch instead ...
 This worked for about three workouts then it fell apart . The back fell off and the batteries fell out , so I figured I could just use tape to keep the batteries in ... no way . If the batteries fit in tight , that would have solved the problem , but they did n't . They were loose . A total waste of money . I 'm am now on the hunt for a timer that actually works !
 The bell on the timer never worked . Was n't worth the hastle to send back .
 As a loyal Everlast customer I was very disappointed when my timer developed glitches after just a few uses . The bell stopped working , settings would change on their own and then it just stopped working.I have been using a Gymboss timer for a few months now and it is more versatile and better quality for about the same price . Get one of those and save yourself the aggravation .
 I bought one of these only to find it did not work at all . I returned it for another and the sound and vibration did not work on the second . I did n't bother with trying a third .
 After using for 12 rounds it showed 10 completed . after using another for 3 rounds it showed 0 completed .
 Original and replacement items both defective out of the box . Why are these items still for salein the face of so many negative reviews ?
 I was very disappointed in this product . It did n't even work when my son opened it for Christmas . I have ordered alot of Everlast products before and they were all fine , but this item is a piece of junk .
 As soon as I received my Timer and began checking it out , I realized right away just how poorly this thing was made . The `` Rest '' feature , the setting to determine how long you have to rest between rounds , has two options , 30 or 60 seconds . Mine only allows 60 seconds , regardless of which position the setting is actually on.I truly expected much better from Everlast . I 've been kickboxing for years and I have many of their products with nothing bad to say about anything else they 've put their name on.For someone who does most of his workouts at home on my own heavy and speed bags & jump rope , etc , this timer is all I thought I would need.Very disappointed .
 The thing never worked , right out of the package . It counts down alright , but the buzzer and vibrator do not work at all . Junk , dont waste your money .
 My timer lasted longer than some reviewers ' have , but the clip broke , the battery cover broke , and it then it stopped ringing at all . It 's disappointing from Everlast , which has such great gloves and other products .
 I wish I could give this item a zero , but that choice was n't available . The timer broke before I was done wrking out .
 But they skipped out on actual product value . Problem with battery fitment as others stated . Loose internal parts rattle like marbles rolling around inside.It 's sad , everlast turned an outstanding concept into a crappy product.Everlast lives up to it 's reputation as the bottom of the barrel of boxing products , yet again .
 Most of these reviews are from the manufacturer . Please research before you purchase . Anything that is highly promoted from the dealer is suspicious to me . IF they REALLY believe in their product , they should wait patiently for buyers to leave positive feedback .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .
 Updated Review
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 This is a nice scooter , but the decal on the body of it is already coming off after just one use by our daughter . She rode it for less than 30 mins , and there is noticeable wear . Large pieces of the black sand papery material have just peeled away , making it look old and worn out after just one use .
 Hard to ride , not enough cushion on wheels -LRB- plastic -RRB- , and heavy - so it is harder to push . Get a razor .
 Ordered the item for my Grandson for Christmas . Received package in good and timely manner . HOWEVER , very disappointed in the way it was packaged for shipping . The box was beat up , torn , and not even suitable for wrapping . If the box had been packaged properly -LRB- inside a shipping box -RRB- ... there would have been no problem . The seller just pulled the item off the shelf and stuck it in the mail !!! Also , when the item was delivered , because it was in the orginal box from the manufacturer , my Granson 's surprise was ruined , because he saw the picture of the scooter plastered all over the torn box.Bah Hum Bug ...
 This looks like a nice item . However , I would n't know personally because I never received it from Fogdog . I ordered it 3 weeks before it was needed for my son 's birthday , then received a message saying that it was on backorder but I would be informed when it was shipped . A few days before I needed it , I received a message telling me that they canceled my order !!! I will never order anything offered by Fogdog again !
 i oder 3x not 2x i ask them if they coule oder big 3x sd they could ` nt they were out of stock , but could not oder it , i wil l never order things again from amz thanks dianne wright
 I was somewhat disappointed when the purchase arrived , because it was n't the same quality as the picture online . It was a similar but cheaper version ...

 I bought this cart for my father about one year ago . It worked for a few months and then started behaving erratically , probably due to an acute malfunction in the control module . For over six months I 've been trying to sort this out without success . Amazon claim they are unable to assist and there is absolutely no response from NFM - they did not even respond to a letter from my lawyer . Beware !!!
 I purchased an earlier model NFM and had nothing but problems with it.The drive pins would break and the plastic gears wore out in less than 1 year . I got no help from NFM until my son -LRB- an attorney -RRB- got involved . He eventually got two new motors from NFM , but I continue to have the same problem with the drive pins.I now carry spare pins and tools in my golf bag and cam make repairs on the course if necessary . I would never purchase or recommend NFM products to anyone .
 I bought this cart last Xmas . It ran well for a few months , but then started behaving erratically . Pushing the forward button sometimes sent the cart in reverse . The cart has died on several occasions leaving me stranded . I 've emailed both Amazon and NFM on numerous occasions over the past 4 months trying to get the cart serviced . I have yet to get a reply from either NFM or Amazon . I 've ordered many items from Amazon over the years and have generally been satisfied with their responsiveness and honesty . This expensive experience has me questioning whether I can continue to rely on Amazon .
 Can not recommend this product . Blasted thing 's plastic clip -LRB- one of two -RRB- broke when putting it on the basket hoop . Only thing I can think that might have contributed to this was that it was stored in the garage before putting it on -LRB- temperature probably 45 degrees -RRB- and I guess that contributed to it `` snapping '' when I put it on . Hard to believe . Maybe they should tell you to only install this product during the summertime ? Tried to follow up with Mfg but no response so $ 30 dollars later I am stuck with a broken product .
 Bought this for my sons . Sounded like a good idea . My husband installed it and it broke the second time the ball hit it . We literally had it one for ten minutes . Not worth the time it took to order it .
 I bought this for my son 's new basketball hoop . The plastic broke within the first 10 minutes on the hoop . I would recommend getting a metal ball return .
 My 11 year old shot no more than 10 baskets for each side started cracking then popped off . This is junk .
 whole thing is plastic with hooks that clip on the rim . the clips wont stay on and it is very flimsy , Not worth more than ten bucks ...
 Clips to the back of the rim both broke within the first hour and during normal shooting - no horse-play was involved !
 This is terrible . Broken first time my son used it . It is made of cheap plastic . Do n't waste your money
 It actually broke during the installation . I used some wire to secure it.I do n't think it is going to last very long.When it ships , it comes in a flat package .
 I was disappointed to find only one band in the package . The picture and title `` cords '' -LRB- plural -RRB- led me to believe that all three were included . Had I known , I would not have ordered this product . There were others with a lower price that included a workout guide . This one comes with nothing extra .
 I ordered the carbon fiber hori hori and they sent the stainless steel model . I did n't want to bother with returning it , but still pretty frustrating
 Seems a little cheaply made . Cheap sheath and the blade is n't sharp enough to cut anything
 Tool came with three rust spots . I take care of my tools and would never allow rust to take hold of any of them ! I ca n't believe that I had to pay for a `` new '' tool that came with rust does not make me happy !
 I was somewhat disappointed when the purchase arrived , because it was n't the same quality as the picture online . It was a similar but cheaper version ...
 This is a very noisy treadmill . So noisy , that I 'm giving mine away . I could just have a lemon , and others may be betters , but this one is noisy !
 Hey alright Flip are not a known bran for there hardware i Would et silverados or lucky they are 2 well known brands who are the best
 Item great , vendor bad!Thought this was a good deal because i had purchased a 4oz bottle somewhere else for much more.Turns out this is much more expensive only 2oz bottle they show small picture of product and do n't specify how big bottle is ! VERY DECIEVING !!
 This looks like a nice item . However , I would n't know personally because I never received it from Fogdog .

 I purchased this unit 18 months ago . Within 3 months the resistance did not work . They sent me a new motor ... 3 months later , no resistance . Then they sent me a new console ... 3 months later , no resistance . They sent me another new console , which I did have to pay for ... did not fix the problem at all . I finally give up !!! Called them and they refused to help me . Customer service just repeated over and over , `` You are no longer under warrantee . '' I told them I wanted to return the console , because that apparently was n't the problem . They said I could return it , but I would have to pay a restocking fee , even though they advised me which part to replace !!! Poor customer service and poor quality products .
 After using it for a month 5days/week 20-30 min a day the axle sheared off . Implies a very bad product design .
 I purchased this item in November of 2004 and used it 3-5 times per week for 30 minute workouts . While I love the workout I get from an elliptical trainer , this piece of equipment could not handle the usage . Ultimately the frame bent and it wobbled more and more until I could no longer use it . You may be wondering how much I weigh - 150 lbs . What I discovered with this piece of equipment is that it is not meant to be used . If you want something expensive to hang your close on then this is the right thing but if you truly want to get an excellent cardiac workout then I would recommend a gym quality elliptical . They are expensive but will handle the movement . Oh , by the way , I contacted the company and they do not back their product .
 i bought the machine about 14 months ago . broke down after 5 months of regular use , but to `` sears '' credit they sent a repairman to fix for free.after about another 5/6 months use -LRB- not even on a regular basis the axile broke again . I did some research on line and found an article that stated that the line of proform products are not built to last if they are used everyday or regularly , they are built for the causual exceriser -- i guess that explains it all .
 We purchased a Proform elliptical several months ago ... it took hours to assemble and then clearly had defective parts . It has been months of calls and complaints and the product is still not working -LRB- and we ca n't say the Proform people seem to really care -RRB- ... avoid this company at all costs !
 I paid over $ 300 and the main axle broke in the first 6 months . Company said sorry 90 day gaurentee only . You can contact these companies and pay them to fix it .
 After about a year the machine broke on me . I then got it fixed , and about 6 months later it broke again . I am now searching for a different elliptical . I will not buy proform again .
 I bought this item direct from ProForm . I should had known better than to be fooled again . The item worked for five months , and then the main pedal axel broke . Well , no problem I thought - I have the extended warranty . That turned out to be a joke . It has been almost three months later and the piece of equipment still sits broken . If they actually cared about their customers they would send a new unit out after the first time a technician could n't fix it .
 Extremely disappointed ! Do n't be fooled by the good price and the no interest payment plan offered by Icon . They do not honor their 30 day money back guarantee.It was one problem after another . I rec 'd a damaged unit . Then the console did n't work . Unit would n't turn off . Resistance motor quit working . You ca n't get a customer service rep when you need help . I left messages and sent emails . I was REFUSED 30 day money back guarantee . They sent a tech out 3 times to attempt to fix it . Tech contacted Icon and they could n't help him . I had my elliptical four months before they decided to replace it . I had to file a BBB complaint to get a replacement unit . Rec 'd replacement unit that does n't work properly . Now customer service wo n't return phone calls or emails . I filed another BBB complaint.I bought this equipment 11 mos ago and it 's only been usable for maybe 4 months .
 The axle broke after 6 months of use . Dont bother unless u dont want 2 use it . Use only for show .
 I bought this machine from someone on CraigsList who purchased it direct and never used it . The first thing to go out was the digital console , then the fan , then the axel on the right side started giving away . I had it for 7 months before the axel for the right pedal broke completely . We tried to repair it , but to no avail . I am about 160 lbs . and used it for about 45 minutes 4-5 times a week during the time it worked . I doubt weight has anything to do with it , it is just a poorly manufactured piece of equipment .
 I bought this elliptical from my mother who could not turn the foot petals . They are VERY stiff . I can use it for a few minutes but this I am exhausted . I could do the elliptical at a fast pace for 45 minutes in the gym , but the resistance on this is unreal . I can not make it any looser . Something must be wrong but I do n't know how to fix it ! If anyone knows , please let me know ! The fan has also never worked .
 My husband loves all things Miami Dolphins so he was happy to receive this . I felt the apron was thin and cheaply made and will not likely hold up to many washings . I am not happy with this purchase .
 It took my wife examining this apron for me to realize that it is not well-made . As with other clothing she has examined from Pakistan , the quality control is poor , the stitching in some places looks like it was done by someone who was not paying attention . It wanders around , instead of being in a straight line , with loose threads hanging here and there . Unless you can take this item out of the package and examine it carefully , I would recommend finding something else to buy .
 I purchased this item on NOV. 21 , and I have not recieved it yet . I do have the tracking information , but from Nov. 24th , it shows the same information telling me that the pakeage is in transit . I want to know if I can ever get my stuff .
 I was thrilled to find this Browns apron for a friend . I was disappointed when I received it . While it is packaged nicely you immediately notice how thin & flimsy the fabric is - it is actually see through !! This is a good novelty item but DO N'T BUY if you want to actually WEAR IT/USE IT .
 it feels cheaply made i got it as a gift for my brother and it looks cheap lets see how long it will last
 This apron is made of cotton , but is extremely thin . More of a gauzy material than anything that would actually protect your clothing during cooking . And for the price it does not live up to expectations .
 The logo is about 1/5th the size of the pictured apron . As well , the quality of the fabric is very poor . It 's very lightweight and not coated , so not sure how much it would actually protect . Disappointed .
 It seemed great until the cigarette plug overheated and melted the fuse inside ... Tried replacing the fuse but still wo n't work the plug gets too hot to touch after about 8 minutes . Guessing that the fan motor is bad or there is a problem in the plug itself . Not something that makes me ever want to buy a koolatron product again . Junk .
 I did a little research on the different electric coolers that are on the market . Koolatron seemed to get decent reviews , but not great . I had a Coleman before that lasted about 2 years with occasional use and it did a good job to keep our food cold over a 48 hour period . The cooler arrived in a cardboard box , no packaging to protect it and without any bill of sale . The condition was something that you might expect from a garage sale . The latch was broken and did not close and the sticker was peeling off . Luckily I was able to return it and order the same Coleman that I had before . However , I did so through Walmart.com for two reasons , better price and quicker delivery . As a rule , I try to avoid Walmart when possible , but due to inferior product from Amazon , I was left with no choice .
 After reading through all the shinning reviews of this product I had thought that it would have been well worth the trouble . However , that was not the case . When it arrive it was in it 's original shelf box with no packing material at all . The quality of craftmanship was horrible . When opening the lid to examine the interior the seams that were held in by tiny screws began to seperate ... I had the unit on for several hours hooked to a 12 volt system to get cold . Once again I was disappointed at the results . After several hours it was only mildly cold . The outside air temperature was in the 60 's . I filled the unit up with items from my regrigator anyways to test it out . Along the way on my trip with the unit plugged in , the unit failed yet again . The dairy products were warm and everything else was as well even with being plugged into the colling side . I would not recommend this product at all to anyone .
 I bought this for our boat . First it blew a fuse . I could not find any where what size fuse to to put in it . Called their support line and got the answer . Then the plug keeps coming out of the adapter . Bought a different plug and wired it up , worked for a few days and now it does not cool or heat ? It did at first with the new plug . I would not buy this unit ever again .
 Koolatron stopped cooling after 5 uses . Of course , it is not under warranty any longer.Weak fan and poor cooling . Cheap electronics . Overall , just a pooly made cooler.Koolatron told me it was probably the `` chip '' . I asked them to send a `` chip '' to me and I would repair it but ehy said , `` no , we do n't allow that . Even the authorized repair people instal then incorrectly '' . Not worth the cost to ship to a repair facility , have them repair the unit , then ship back.Don ' t waste yout money on Koolatron .
 Do not buy this cooler . This cooler only lasted 4 months past it 's one year warranty . It 's too bad because it seemed like a nice cooler , but it should also last far longer then 16 months . I 've tried Coleman brand coolers and Koolatron coolers and none of them are worth the money . The longest lasting cooler I 've ever owned in this price range lasted 1 year and 9 months . I do n't know what the problem is with these coolers but I think their all junk .
 I 'm a truck driver and have used the coleman and igloo electric coolers , and recently purchase a koolatron . The cooler freezes up , the motor spins both fans and is too weak to turn fans as fast as they need to go . Within 3 weeks the latch broke . It is cheaply made ; will not but another . I 'll go back to Coleman and keep some money in my pocket ; it was the better value for my money . Customer service was great on sending replacement for latch .
 It works when you can get the 12VDC plug fully seated in the recepticle . One of the four receptlcles I own will run the cooler . The cooler plug has a larger diameter area that keeps the plug from fully engaging in standard 12VDC recepticles . I 'll probably have to buy a replacement plug and wire it in so that it will work on my boat .
 After reading the reviews , I bought one of these . I am an over-the-road trucker and was tired of buying a new Coleman every 6 months . I thought I would give this one a try . After about 3 months of use , I would rate this a DO NOT BUY . It will not keep frozen water bottles frozen more than 1 to 2 days in my cab . It does keep things cool , just not cold .
 I ordered this item the end of May 2010 . We used it once to go on a day trip and put it back away . We pulled it out of the box in July and took it on a family vacation . On our way back home , the unit stopped working . Of course this was after the warranty expired . I contacted Koolatron about the issue to see what they recommended . They told me to check a fuse in the cord that runs to the outlet , which was not the problem . I contacted them again to ask what else I could do and they have never contacted me back . I would think this unit , for the price paid , should be more durable than to go out after one week of usage .
 If you place warm items in here , it takes forever to cool them down , and then only keeps them cool not cold .
 The Koolatron cooler was broken when I opened the box . The cheap , plastic lid latch was in pieces . So I returned the product for another one , not a problem . Except it was a problem , as the second time I opened the box , I found that this cooler was also broken . The cheap plastic of the lid latch was broken once again . So the cooler goes back and I 'm not getting another one . I never even got to try the actual cooling/heating action of the cooler itself because of the stupid , cheap , crappy lid latch . Just looking for a quality product and this my friends is far from it .
 We researched electric travel coolers and decided Koolatron was the best and ordered one . When it arrived I noticed the plastic latch for the door was broken off . Not a problem if you are using it as a chest cooler , but if you are using it upright this would be a problem . Ordered a replacement and it arrived in the same condition . So I went to a local store and bought the Coleman version , for less money , and it has been working great . The Coleman version has the same plastic latch as the Koolatron but the door on the Coleman is designed better so that it can not shift as much . I believe the shifting of the door during shipment and handling caused the plastic latch to break . This is probably a good product if you do n't have it shipped and just buy it in a store . But I am happy with the Coleman version . It cost less , works good and looks better .
 I have bought two of these P95 coolers in the last year , thinking I just had the misfortune of a getting a lemon the first time . Both had to be returned.The second time , the unit had so little cooling capacity that I had to throw away hundreds of dollars of food and medications because the temp inside was no different than the ambient room temp , although the motor was definitely running -LRB- and seemed cool when I put the items in -RRB- . Is it possible that the motor burned out with a single use?Amazon was good enough to refund me each time , but I ca n't help wondering if the units were packed appropriately -- rather than being shipped in only the descriptive cardboard -- would they arrive in better working condition?I have purchased other Koolatron products in the past and have been somewhat satisfied , but I 'm thinking these things are just generally poorly manufactured .
 We used it less than two weeks and it `` burned out '' . It started blowing out hot air and ruined all of our food including expensive cheese . Our car had to be professionally cleaned because of the smell , the whole thing was very costly.I discovered the part that needed to be replaced was about $ 4.00 wholesale . So instead of just returning it for a refund , I contacted the comapny and asked for another part . They offered to sell it to me for $ 52 plus S/HBad experience all around .
 Had to send it back - twice . Both came with no protective packaging with a different piece broken each time .
 Bought this halter because the headline said `` Yearling '' halter . NOT MINI YEARLING which is how it arrived . I 'm so angry they need to be very specific with their advertising whether these are actual HORSE size or miniature horse size .
 We have a baby -LRB- 3 year old -RRB- shire who keeps breaking out of his halters , and any replacements we find are all too small ... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin , and have no complaints . Even though the description says 1100 + pounds , it 'll fit your 1600 + Draft with no problems . : -RRB- Edit
 I can see why Bag Boy does not make this product anymore . I think they discontinued it the next season after it was introduced . I found the system they had for inserting the clubs toooooooooooooo hard and because of that my grips are wearing away on the end of the shaft . I complained to Bag Boy and offered no help or resolution . You would think because I have damadged clubs they might offer a coupon for a discount on another one of their bag but no they did not . Very poor customer service . They lost my future business .
 We play a lot of golf and my husband was needing a new cart bag . I bought this after careful research . After one day on the course , he is trading it in . He had trouble reaching for items in the side pockets with 2 bags on a cart . The top club holders were great but he could not easily gain access to items he needed . Only the pockets and cooler on the front were easy to reach . Back to the search .
 This product is poorly manufactured . The crank which is an internal screw in the middle of the wheel powering this machine was not a solid piece of metal . It broke within 2.5 months of consistent use . I purchased this product for $ 500 . We ordered a new crank and new attachment screws which I not only had to pay for , but was charged about $ 15 in shipping and handling for a package that weighed less than one ounce for standard USPS shipping . The new crank is one uniform solid piece of metal which indicates to me the company received complaints . -LRB- I did read two complaints about the quality of their products on Buy.com -RRB- . Thank god my husband is mechanical because otherwise I would have had to hire someone to come out to do this repair . Research proform before buying their products . You 'll find I 'm not the only disatisfied customer out there .
 I got this machine for my birthday . During my first use , I noticed that the resistance was not working . I reported it to ProForm . They sent someone out to repair it in a little over a week . When the repair guy came out , he took it apart but could not fix it ! He left it in 20 pieces in the middle of the room and left . After 2 weeks of trying to get a hold of ProForm , they informed me that it would be cheaper to replace than repair . They demanded a receipt . But it was a gift and I do n't have a receipt ... so now ... 3 months later ... it is still sitting in pieces in the middle of the room . We have spent over 40 hours over the phone with them . Lately , they do n't even answer the phone anymore.When we did finally get a hold of someone , they told us that they now want $ 150 to repair/replace it !! Buyers beware !!!
 I got this machine thinking that a broken part - the situation described in another review - could n't happen with every machine . It was a decent price , and I needed an elliptical badly.Pluses :1 -RRB- Easy to put together . I did it by myself . With two people , it 's not hard -- just time consuming.Negatives :1 -RRB- I use the machine 4-5 nights a week for 45 minutes . Shortly after I started using it , a bolt on the front of the machine unscrewed itself . This caused another piece to slowly move away from the main platform bar . When I rocked the machine , this protruding piece - slowly dug a hole in my hardwood floor - . We have rescrewed this bolt repeatedly . The motion of the machine keeps unscrewing it . It 's magic .2 -RRB- This machine squeaks and groans no matter what you do .3 -RRB- The pedals are grinding against something and sprinkling black dust onto the floor .4 -RRB- No weight entry . It 'll give you calories burned , and fat calories , too , but without your weight , these numbers are as good as fiction . Fat calories are useless , too . It 's actually depressing .5 -RRB- The programs suck .6 -RRB- The heart monitor is sporadic . Sometimes it 'll tell me I am at 52 beats a minute , then go up to 162 . I do n't - think - I 'm having a heart attack . .7 -RRB- The machine rocks back and forth , further skewing calorie numbers and just being outright dangerous.Frankly , I need to buy a new machine after maybe 2 months of heavy use . It 's usable now , but it 's loud , breaking , and untrustworthy in its calorie count.Get this if you 're not a daily exerciser and a lazy calorie-counter .
 I own a Pro-Form CardioCrossTrainer800 purchased in Spring 2005 -LRB- an earlier version of this model -RRB- . I was extremely pleased with the machine -LRB- especially the fan -RRB- UNTIL 8 months in when the resistance just stopped functioning . Because the resistance is magnetic and controlled by the computer consol -LRB- electronics -RRB- , there is no way to manually adjust the resistance . I had repair techs out three times to my house and they were unable to find or solve the problem . Currently the machine is holding my garden hoses and collecting dust in my garage . Maybe they 've fixed this in the newer model but be careful !!
 I must agree the ProForm Cardio Cross Trainer series axles are prone to break easily and often . I went through 3 axles at $ 50 + a piece in a 1-1/2 years , and I am not that heavy . But hey they are cheap and when it is not broken I liked it . I am tired of taking it apart and repairing it though . Only gave it 2 stars because it is cheap . It might be decent if you are very light .
 I bought this one last year and it was working fine . All of a sudden last week the left side pedal and the shield broke !! The materail is so cheap and the welding portion at the center broke into 2 pieces !!! Luckily I was not injured by using this machine .
 This machine is really cheap . the internals are all made of plastic . The machine was used lightly and the resistance went out three times on it . Once you take it apart you realize it is not built to last . I called the manufacturer and they are terrible to deal with . You have to leave a callback number and then they call back at 9:00 at night . Stay away from this machine and this company for that matter .
 We purchased a Proform elliptical several months ago ... it took hours to assemble and then clearly had defective parts . It has been months of calls and complaints and the product is still not working -LRB- and we ca n't say the Proform people seem to really care -RRB- ... avoid this company at all costs !
 HI Bought mine for $ 500 , it worked for a few months and now the program setting wont work , so its set on hardest resistance -LRB- useless -RRB- . At first we thought the batteries were dead , well nooooo , Ive taken it apart , all wires and in contact , the little motor that changes the resistance still works , so its a mystery to me , Im not so sold on proform products now ...
 Like many of the other users with reviews here , I purchased a ProForm CardioCross Elliptical Trainer because of the price and the fact that I was n't going to use it all the time . Biggest mistake ever . It has been one problem after another with this thing . So far , I 've replaced the main console , the right crank arm twice , the left crank arm , the crank , and a few other `` less expensive '' parts . Icon , the company that makes ProForm , knows they make a sub-standard product and they do n't care . Customer service is useless and they refused to honor any warranty . STAY AWAY . THE PRICE IS N'T WORTH IT . YOU 'LL SPEND MORE IN THE LONG RUN THAN IF YOU JUST BUY A QUALITY PRODUCT .
 Extremely disappointed ! Great price and they allowed payments with no interest . They do not honor their 30 day money back guarantee.It was one problem after another . I rec 'd a damaged unit . Then the console did n't work . Unit would n't turn off . Resistance motor quit working . You ca n't get a customer service rep when you need help . I left messages and sent emails . I was REFUSED 30 day money back guarantee . They sent a tech out 3 times to attempt to fix it . Tech contacted Icon and they could n't help him . I had my elliptical four months before they decided to replace it . I had to file a BBB complaint to get a replacement unit . Rec 'd replacement unit that does n't work properly . Now customer service wo n't return phone calls or emails . I filed another BBB complaint.I bought this equipment 11 mos ago and it 's only been usable for maybe 4 months .
 This looks like a nice item . However , I would n't know personally because I never received it from Fogdog . I ordered it 3 weeks before it was needed for my son 's birthday , then received a message saying that it was on backorder but I would be informed when it was shipped . A few days before I needed it , I received a message telling me that they canceled my order !!! I will never order anything offered by Fogdog again !
 i oder 3x not 2x i ask them if they coule oder big 3x sd they could ` nt they were out of stock , but could not oder it , i wil l never order things again from amz thanks dianne wright

 Well , if you BBQ alot and you are a fan , you can wear this proudly . So , reason for the low rating ? When you wash it , the logos start peeling off . Not after your 10th , or the 50th wash ... after the 1st wash , the logo started peeling off.So I guess it 's a great apron if you do n't plan on washing it = -RRB-

 While the leather in this holster is nice , and the workmanship is good , the left handed holster I ordered from Optics Planet was not correctly assembled . The snap is on the INSIDE of the holster , next to your body , where is is difficult , if not impossible , to unsnap it quickly . Optics Planet could not understand the problem , and would not send me prepaid mailing labels . Will never deal with them again.Be ware , or maybe I just got one that was incorrect , and the others are ok .
 BUYER BEWARE !!! I never received half of my order , and my entire order were gifts for people , and the half that I did receive took over 2 weeks to arrive . I had to call the seller several times . The 1st time the said they were reshipping it & again it never appeared . The 2nd time , I was asked to leave my phone # & then was never called back ! I was finally sent an email stating a refund was to be given , but I was never called back & explained why . This has taken well over a month , which is totally ridiculous in my book !!! These people are awful !!!
 When we '' tried '' to put the line on our trolling rods/reels penn 301s . I use this term loosely , it did nothing but curl , bind and create birds nest . Usually this brand is one of the best . I feel that it was n't the brand , but was old line . Maybe sitting on the shelf for too long causing the irreversible twist that could not be forgotten
 Pay attention to the product description , which contains these sentences : `` Double iron castings are permanently adhered to durable rubber rims . '' `` Not intended for heavy lifting . INSTRUCTIONAL USE ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AFTER A LIFT . Not warranted against breakage . `` In other words , these are NOT solid rubber bumper plates . It is awesome that the company is honest with it 's customers about this , but it 's a little like selling a compact car with a warning that says `` Product actually as big as a Semi . Not intended for city driving . `` True bumper plates can be had for less than the price of these too . So I 'm not sure what the product strategy is .
 We were very disappointed in this product . We purchased a set of four to anchor a portable soccer goal . The first time we screwed it into the ground , it broke . The metal did n't snap , but it bent . The corkscrew shaped portion kinda unwound . So now it 's useless . Wo n't go back in the ground when we move the goals . -LRB- I do n't know if it hit a rock or something , but our soil is n't ** that ** hard . And after all , we are using it for it 's intended purpose - it 's supposed to go into the ground.I 've seen similar -LRB- or identical -RRB- products offered by other vendors . I suspect they 're all made from the same manufacturer . I think this is just a fundamental design flaw . We 're going to try another type anchor . I think these corkscrew type anchors just wo n't cut it .
 I live in Philadelphia and have an outdoor garden patio . Believe it or not , we have lots of mosquitos . For some reason , they completely ignore my husband and feast on me . This past August , we did a cross-country road trip and discovered this device in a prominent fishing store in Durango , CO. . The sales person assured us that it worked . As a matter of fact , he told us , his avid fishing buddies said nothing works better . My husband was leery , I said , `` I 'll take one ! `` Bottom line is I still get bitten . I 'd like to think less bites than before ; truth is , not much less . I wanted to justify the $ 14 spent on it , to say , `` This device is AMAZING ! '' . Not possible . You will get bites . Also , the buzzing of the device is so high pitched and loud that after having it in even a thigh pocket for a short time , your ears will ring all night . They ring as if you were at a rock concert next to the amplifiers . I 'd hoped to get away from chemical sprays but this product does n't have the swat to make those pesky skeeters go away . Truthfully , if I want my ears ringing , I 'd want my ticket worth at a great concert . The Mosquito Annoyer is a gimmick and should be booed off the stage like a bad opening act .
 The description states two times that the unit is solar-powered or charged . I ordered this unit specifically because it was solar . It is definitely not solar - as verified by the seller after the sale and by my own research on the William Joseph website . I have wasted time in getting this item , printing the return label , posting it back to them , and ordering another item . The seller says that , on Amazon who ever lists an item first gets the listing and everyone else who sells the same item has to use the listing that they have provided and we are unable to change the listing . Does n't matter ; the seller knowingly sold an item that could n't perform as advertised . I am so tired of blaming someone else . It remains to be seen whither I get a return shipping reimbursement or not . By the way , I received 3 units instead of the 2 I ordered . Maybe it was accidental , maybe it was meant to pacify me .
 It does n't get any better than this . It attracts mosquitos like it were just me standing alone in the middle of a swamp ... oh wait , that 's not what it 's supposed to do!Oh well . I 've always heard these sound based things are crap . Now I 've proof . : -LRB-
 I was very disappointed with this product . Not only was the sizing way off but the Dodgers emblem on the front of the shirt was placed on the stomach area rather than on the upper chest like most emblems are on a shirt . In addition , the emblem started to peel off after only 1-2 washes . Very disappointed .

 This product is n't high quality . Although its cheap , you get what you pay for . This chain can bust into pieces pretty easily . I had this on my trek 930 for about a week . While riding though my neighborhood I changed gears . One of the chain links busted open and jammed in my drivetrain , gouging out chunks of paint . I 'd expect this to happen maybe while mountain biking a real trail , but on a paved road ?! That has to be a really substandard chain for that to happen . I suggest you avoid buying bike parts anywhere that is not a bike shop . For like 5 more dollars you can get a much much stronger chain at a bike shop . Do n't be cheap when it comes to parts that are vital for a bicycle to move . You 'll regret it when you are stranded miles away from your destination with busted bike parts .
 I do n't give a 1 star review lightly . I bought this chain at Walmart . As soon as I put it on my bicycle it was making crazy rubbing sounds . I adjusted my derailleur and it still was making crazy noises and jumping back and forth between sprockets . I brought it in to the bike shop and they adjusted it and it still would skip teeth when coming up hills . Replaced it with an SRAM chain and everything is perfect again . I ca n't believe this product is even on the market , it 's worthless .
 Although the pack looks great at first , after actually using it on vacation , I would definitely recommend paying the extra $ 25-50 and getting a good durable pack from a known brand.The clips that hold the lid down are made of obviously low-quality thin plastic that simply are n't going to hold up to any remotely demanding use.I used this pack once , taking it on a 2 week trip in Europe , and by the time I got back 2 out of the 3 connectors on the front of it were broken to the point that they 're no longer functional . Since the lid does n't snap down all the way anymore , the bag is no longer worth using and I already had to replace it.I 've had a smaller Vaude bag for about 10 years that 's been on many vacations -LRB- as a checked bag a few times -RRB- and camping trips , and its still going strong with absolutely no problems . This Harvest bag was horrible.I would have given it one star , however I did make it back from Europe with everything still inside of it .

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 what an incredible waste of time , did not want to try on the socks afterward . it looks a lot thicker in the picture , but when you get it , it 's panty hose material on top , and styrofoam on the bottom . super light weight , and WRONG SIZING , now i have to go back and order a smaller size , and pay for shipping if i want a refund from this person . p * ssed off .
 I bought a pair of sand socks for a beach ultimate frisbee tournament . I wear shoes normally in a size 13 , occasionally 14 , so I purchased the extra large -LRB- listed sizes 12 1/2 - 14 -RRB- . While they fit my feet fine , the fastener around the calf must have been designed for enormous , overweight people . There was no way using the socks ' fasteners to keep it high and tight on my leg , which in turn led the foot portion of the sock to become extremely baggy with every step.I would n't buy again , but with an pair of easy fixes -LRB- more elastic up top and a longer velcro-faster , it had the adjustment range of about one half-inch -RRB- , I 'm sure they would be a fine product .
 I purchased this cue because I am a beginner on a pool league and needed to have my own stick to prevent the `` variable '' factor of using the crappy house cues . I selected this particular cue because it was in my budget -LRB- under $ 60 -RRB- and had good reviews ; I however , do not find it to be as great as the reviews have made it seem . I ordered the 19 oz . cue and received the 20 oz . version . It does have removable weights in the bottom to make it as light as 18.5 oz , but I have not had an opportunity to go through the hassle of removing the weights . I understand that is a nice feature in general , but I did n't want to change the weight , I wanted a cue that is simply 19 oz . When I received the cue , there were stickers and labels ALL over it ! I saw the reviews about the made in china sticker ... that was the least of the problems . There was 3 sticker labels on the cue . All of them were difficult to remove and all of them left a sticky residue . I also found that the stick is very masculine and the graphite is smooth , but I still needed chalk with this cue -LRB- going to get a billiard glove here soon -RRB- . Overall I am not thrilled . I am stuck with it now though , so I am going to purchase a different cue -LRB- one with a traditional wood shaft -RRB- and keep this for a break stick in the meantime . : o /
 A strand has come loose after one day of use . I can not believe that it is already broken ! I use it to transport 5 basketballs . It is also very flimsy and cheap looking .
 I 'm not sure what engineer thought that driving a lag screw into a plastic hole would be a good way to securely hold a backboard but that 's what they did . I bought both the backboard and the mounting bracket from Lifetime . I followed the instructions to the letter . Not only did they have me drive a lag into the plastic hole , they later had me remove it and add an additional bracket that just made the whole assembly less secure as now the lag was not able to fully tighten . By the time we had the thing on the roof and secured the lag was already pulling out of the backboard . I re-tightend it as well as I could without stripping it but I have no hopes that this installation will last . Wasted money . Pay a little more and go for a more robust system .
 This backboard feels flimsy . It looks ok , appears to be well-made , etc ; it just has a lot of flex to it.As a result , when the B-ball hits the backboard , the backboard flexes and this results in an unpredictable rebound.I mounted it to a brick wall using Lifetime 's universal mounting kit and 5/16 '' Red-Head masonry anchor bolts . It 's not the mount that 's the problem , it 's the back-board itself.Don ' t get me wrong , it 's not a terrible product for the money . But if you can afford something better , and basketball really matters to you , you can do better .
 Kit arrived in good packaging . I also ordered the mounting kit.The hoop and backboard kit was missing a pair of grommets and springs for the lower bolts to the hoop.There were no directions included with the hoop and backboard kit.I believe the quality of the parts supplied was good but not all the parts were included .
 save up for something of better quality . plastic housing around plexiglass is not going to hold up . was shipped the next day if ya live in the phoenix area was the only plus
 We had such high hopes !! Unfortunately , after throwing away the box ... and using the raft only once ... we discovered that it leaked air . It was used once in our pool and the next morning it was a little soft and each day it became squishier . We have been unable to find this little leak which we assume to be in a seam somewhere since it had not been used in a way that would damage it . Anyway , we feel `` stuck '' b/c by the time we would box it up and pay to ship it back , it would nearly be a loss .
 School has n't started so I have n't used this product yet , but right off when I opened the package there was a small problem . One of the snaps was broken on the little velco tabs . I am going to see if they will send me a replacement , but that was a disappointment . If they do I will amend my review .
 I own a Red Label 20ga . I purchased this product because I frequently shoot several boxes of shells a day.This product made an impressive difference in felt recoil , so much that I shot four boxes one day and played a round of golf the next with not a twinge of soreness in my shoulder.However , the `` pre-fit '' label is pretty misleading . Start with the fact that , after I took my factory buttplate off , I had to fill the factory holes because the Pachmayr holes did n't line up . In fact , one of the holes needed for the new recoil pad was so close to the old hole that I was very concerned about it holding and had to use epoxy . This is Carpentry 101 - either use the existing holes -LRB- ideal -RRB- or make sure you space the news ones appropriately so you get clean wood for your fastener.After filling the old screw holes , letting the glue/filler/epoxy dry overnight , and sanding excess filler , I installed the pad . Now all that was left was almost an hour of Dremel work to grind the edge of the pad to align with the edges of the stock . Now , admittedly , I 'm picky and you might be able to hustle through the grinding in 15 minutes or so , but I was n't eager to scratch the stock on my four-figure shotgun , so I took my time and used plenty of masking tape to protect the finish.Does the Pachmayr work ? Heck yes . Is it `` pre-fit '' ? Heck no .
 I ordered the item as pictured here but I received something else . When I inquired from the seller , no response was received .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 This item was purchased for my seven year-old grandson with the purpose of encouraging him to hang up his clothes daily . Unfortunately the clothes rack fell over almost immediately after assembly and was broken rendering it unusable . I do n't know what the problem was but suspect that the top team emblem is too heavy for the slender rack to support . A cute idea that did not work!MargaretFan of the San Diego Padres
 I 've used the raft twice . It 's still afloat but the oars suck ! I 've broken both of them already . They 're plastic threaded tubes that screw together . They need to be reinforced .
 Installed the units and it was not shown as display in the picture . The poles are sticking out . The metal sticks are not at 90 degree angles . I tried contacted Amazon , but it was no help . Amazon asked me to contact the manufacturer and so I did . I went to the website www.tiedown.com / and contacted customer service . They do not deal with consumer , only whole sales . They responded to my inquiry and did not believe that I contacted Amazon , and there was NOTHING they -LRB- Tie Down Engineering -RRB- could do . The whole experience is not pleasant . I was forced to run around , and pushed over by manufacturer and seller . I am now leaving the useless unit . I will never BUY anything from Tie Down Engineering . Do not buy this product . !
 I returned these guide-ons immediately after opening the package . The angle of the base supports IS NOT 90 degrees as depicted in the ad . Rather , they are configured to angle outward from the trailer . I 've had issues with other guide-ons where the trailer lights protrude from the top of the guide-on beyond the trailer resulting in damage at toll booths , danger to pedestrians in tight areas and danger to oncoming traffic . I will NOT put these guide-on brackets on my trailer . Thankfully Amazon has an `` easy return '' policy and I am only out the little time it took to bring this package back to the local UPS store .
 Buyers Beware ... these guide-ons are not as pictured and they are not `` Heavy Duty '' . The angle of the metal square-tubing is not 90 degrees as shown . When installed , these guides are at an angle of approximately 15 degrees ; meaning that the top -LRB- orange tipped area -RRB- sticks out into the on-coming traffics lane . Also , the galvanized coating on these support tubes is nothing but some cheap spray paint and the PVC pipes will not spin when they are installed . Due to the cheap galvanized coating and potential traffic violation from the guides crossing the center line on the highway , I 'll be returning mine .
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .
 It turns out this kit did not come with a foot pump or the oars that were supposed to be in the package . I do n't know what happened during shipment but it makes me feel cheated . Product is good so if you buy this for the boat alone , then buy the 22.99 one and not the $ 27 . It 's supposed to be the same product .

 From the web site photos and specs , I thought this watch was a decent watch . Upon arrival , it 's clearly a discount looking material and design . Online , the gray parts look metal , but in reality the watch is all plastic and the gray dial is a `` painted coating . '' Entering data is tedious and time consuming , and display of that info is very poor . I use it for timing my swimming/running since it is light weight and has Indiglo . However , I do n't wear it to work or formal as it 's too cheap and plastic looking . Casio has much better looking watches than this one . For a few dollars more , I could have bought a much nicer watch with timer and backlighting , and a `` REAL '' METAL FACEPLATE/DIAL !

 It did n't come sharp . I , of course , understand that every knife needs eventual and regular sharpening , but this one came just dull . Yes , it is sturdy and quite heavy , but since it was dull , it does n't really matter . I really ca n't imagine where and how one may use this knife . You can attach it to the pole and use it as a spear to kill a bear . Maybe you can use it strictly as a weapon against other human , I do n't know . But to peel something , to cut something , to hack something-not really . Oh , you can use as a pry tool or a chisel . The blade is just ridiculously thick , its ' angle resemble the angle of an ax .
 My wife bought me the Smith & Wesson SWAT knife several years ago and I was really pleased with it . The knife is quick and light and easy to handle . I bought this one thinking I would be getting something comparable ... WRONG AGAIN . This knife had got to weight almost 3 times what my SWAT weights and , again , MADE IN CHINA written all over it . I do n't know if these are knock-offs or if Smith & Wesson went cheap on me but I 'm on to greener pastures . Maybe Gerber or Spyderco or Kershaw . A few more bucks but top in quality .
 I ordered this watch on April 8th , received it on the 11th , and now I 'm writing this review on the 12th . On the day I ordered the watch , hours before I was debating whether or not I should buy this or another watch I was thinking about purchasing . Upon reading customer reviews and saying to myself
 Like a few other people have mentioned , the `` second '' hand often stops and results in an incorrect analog time reading . The second hand is ticking ... but it is not moving , just sitting in the same spot ... tick , tick , tick . A few taps with your finger get it going again . However , since this happens several times each day , it is impossible to keep accurate analog time . I know that this style of Casio has been around since atleast the mid-1990 's . They used to be very durable and a bit more expensive back then . Casio apparently has changed something in the movement to lower the cost ... and as a result , ruined this classic timepiece .
 I received my watch less than a month ago and one of the `` pins '' that holds the band on broke and the watch fell off . It appeared rusted -LRB- I do have it to returen with the watch -RRB- . I replaced it and thought no big deal . All was well until this past week and I noticed that there is moisture inside the watch on the inside of the crystal . That is no big deal as I had not even had it in the water.I have had this same watch style before and would like to receive another one in it 's place . How do I reture this one and receive a new one?Thank youScot
 I purchased this watch on a different website , took it to swimming , and started to see fog fog within . The watch looks great , so I am going to exchange it for another one .
 I bought this watch as my every day watch - and mainly wanted to use it snorkeling and diving since it was rated to go over 100 feet , Even before I ever got it in the water , the analog clock would lose time within the first week of ownership.I would see that the second hand would just get &#34; stuck &#34; at random times ... Sometimes if I pushed one of the buttons it would start working again.I ended up diving with it and snorkeling numerous times and the watch stayed dry.Unfortunately , the random time losses were too annoying to deal with so I returned the watch.I found that the digital time was accurate , but too small to read in low light conditions .
 I have been a more than happy with the G-Shock line of Casio watches and assumed this one would carry some of their quality features . Unfortunately , the rotating bezel came off after 2 months of low impact use . This was the only part of the watch 's structure that protects the face of the watch and I fear scratches or worse are sure to follow . If you 're on the fence stick with the G-Shock .
 True , it is nice to have analog and digital . True , the watch looks nice in a rough-kinda way . However it stops there
 I have no clue where I can get this watch worked on.I only wear it on special occasions but neither the analog or digital part of the watch will keep time correctly .
 I bought my Casio AMW320D-9EV at auction , so when it stopped working I assumed it only needed repair . I mean , what a GREAT looking multi-function watch ... and surely Casio is a name that can be trusted . So , I sent it to an approved Casio repair facility . They refurbed the water seal in the back plate and added a new battery . They also answered a question about possible design problems - `` nothing reported . `` Good to Go !? Not quite.The watch continued to stop intermittently . I could shake it a bit and get it started again ... but who wants a timepiece that you have to wack around like a flashlight ? And so much for accurate timekeeping -LRB- I work in radio , where such things are vital -RRB- . To cap it off , I ran into a friend who had the same problem with the same model . So much for accurate info in the Casio knowledge base.I hate to say it , but my old Timex is still ticking . Maybe someone can squeeze Casio for a refund .
 the stupid watch was broken -LRB- again -RRB- ; the battery die or the watch delayed every day by 5 minutes . look like they have this watches in storage for too long . do not buy this watch , look good but be ready to pay for a new battery as soon as you get it shipped and pay for a water proof test after battery installation .
 After having the first watch 's sweep hands stop working altogether , I ordered a replacement via Amazon . I wish I had bought the first on Amazon , but did n't and it cost me due to Sports Authority 's return policy . Anyway , the second watch came and once again the sweep hands started to malfunction after only 4 months . Thankfully , Amazon allowed me to return the watch for a full refund and I 'm off to another brand . Two malfunctioning watches out of two orders can not be random !
 This is an edit of my earlier review in which I gave the watch 5 stars . After several weeks , the analog part of the watch started running slow . This week -LRB- 02/04/2011 -RRB- it stopped completely , but after I tapped the face a few times it started running again . Several days later , it is losing a few second each day.The digital part is working perfectly ... whoopeee !!! Now , I HAVE TO PAY !! to send it to Casio for repairs . This is the first and last time I will ever buy a Casio . The watch I will use while it is in repair is a Timex Expedition that I paid half the price for -LRB- $ 26 or so -RRB- over 15 years ago and it has not lost a second of time since then nor needed a battery ! -LRB- I thought I had lost it but after ordering the Casio I found the Timex , thankfully ! -RRB- UPDATE 02/09/2011
 I was a sucker ... twice.Both times I had the watch snugly strapped to my wrist.I somehow bumped it while surfing , causing it to break from my wrist to the ocean floor , gone forever . I bought another one . Same thing happened at my office , fell to the floor and crystal broke . This has never happened to the myriad watches I 've owned over the past 3 decades . Casio not responsive . Very disappointed .
 I bought this watch from another store , but it 's necessary to share my opinion here to assist others . It is a fairly nice looking watch and the price was low so I bought one . It was purchased as a replacement `` beater '' watch , that could be worn for fishing , etc. . Water resistance was a big factor as well as looks . It was to replace my G-Shock that had lasted for many years of rough use . I wanted a `` dressier '' look . Mistake ! The problem with this watch is that the crystal has NO protection and it scratches VERY easily . Definitely a HUGE negative . The scratches made it difficult to see the face , so I gave it away . A waste of money . I 've never had a crystal scratch so easily !
 A watch is supposed to tell the time . I owned this watch for eight months and then it stopped working . I changed the battery and it worked for a couple of weeks and stopped again . So , I contacted Casio repair . It was going to cost me more than I paid for the watch on Amazon to repair it so . . forget it . In a nutshell , do not buy this watch .
 With a name like that I should have been aware . Have been an amazon customer for over 5 yrs , and have never dealt with a crooked seller before , but this seller never sent my watch , should be banned from amazon ! Did n't pay attention , used one click and assumed I was buying direct from amazon , got hosed , buyer beware .
 What a review ? Though I placed an order for men 's Casio divers watch on Sept. 19 , 2007 , I have not yet received it from you or Chelsea Watches.I paid U$ 67.00 for the watch on the same day . So far I have not received the watch or your refund .
 Initially , I liked this watch , I really did . I liked the appearance , the gold colored face with the black ring surrounding the bezel , the large size , the weight ... I liked it after doing a lot of pre-order research , and I liked it even more after I received it . The size and weight did not bother me at all.However
 I have been purchasing this model -LRB- or very similar -RRB- Casio watch for nearly the last 14 years . I usually get about 3-4 years of reliable service then the battery begins to fail . Unfortunately even though I 've used different high-end jewelers to replace the batteries , they all leaked water afterward . No big deal since otherwise they 've held up very well , they 're fairly inexpensive , and did n't mind buying a new one every few years.The last one I purchased locally a few years ago finally start showing signs the battery was dieing . The digital display and time still work fine but the mechanical hands start to fail . I decided to order a replacement from Amazon . My first Casio dive watch from Amazon started showing the dreaded signs of battery failure after just a couple of months . I figured it was a fluke so I ordered another . The second Casio divers watch of this same model has now also started showing signs of the battery failing after just 3 months . I 'm guessing Amazon must have a lot of old new stock sitting on their shelves or Casio is supplying them with old stock that has been sitting around a few years . Needless to say I 've given up on this Casio model , at least from Amazon .
 I 've owned two of these over 20 years & loved them both . I 'm in the water on and off for kayaking & sailing and both watches survived getting wet and a the usual daily slapping around with aplomb -- the odd drop and bang did n't seem to affect them at all . Nice to have the analog & digital displays working together ; large size & high visibility dial are great , the crystal was tough & you could buy a couple of hundred of them for the price of one Rolex.When watch # 2 died I went out & bought # 3 . For four months it was subjected to bouts of New England 's high humidity and daily drops of an eighth of an inch to my nightstand . It stuttered a few times & then stopped completely -- no digital read-out , analog hands motionless . I mailed it back to Casio for repair . For all intents and purposes this was a brand new watch -- no bangs , no marks , no drownings . True , the band was now curved , not straight . Casio offered to repair a four month old watch for $ 20 more than it cost new . No explanation , no chance to question the judgement . The Casio warranty is apparently good for as long as it takes you to open the box , and then you 're SOL . Or maybe a curved band voids the warranty?Maybe you 're supposed to buy a couple of hundred of them to get a few that work -- and I was just lucky with the first two.Now I know why Casio , despite having some decent products , has remained a third rate player on the electronics counters
 Bought my Casio in August 2010 for a two week rafting trip . Worked fine for months afterwards . One day the arms stopped moving , so it no longer tells time . Thought it was the battery , but the watchmaker determined it was the gears , noting that Casio has gone to using plastic gears that break down . I 've sent this watch back to Casio for repair , awaiting Casio 's repair estimate .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .
 Updated Review
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .

 Good watch easy to read . The temp function is useless and your body heat makes the real air temp higher . It is also a big watch and heavy too .
 Sorry to write a review like this . How can a person write a review on a product that has not turned up to him at all . But still the system has generated an email for review . It will be good enough if the system has not come up for this review . One good part is the product has not reached me , but my money is returned back . Thanks Amazon .
 This watch scratched up within a few days of moderate use . The temperature gage only works once watch is removed .
 I like the watch at first . Temp . feature is miss leading and is only accurate if you remove the watch . Your own body heat effects the temperature reading -LRB- dah -RRB- . However , after 3 month the watch died . It felt like I was just renting the watch .
 Never had a chance to use this watch . The band ran quite large for my smaller wrist .
 It 's a shame this excellent watch movement has a piece of trash for a case . Within a few weeks of getting the watch , the display started to fog on the inside . Soon , the band pulled loose from the case . Expecting I would simply reattach the band , instead I discovered that the flimsy plastic case was split -LRB- allowing it to leak and fog -RRB- and one of the pin holders for the band had broken loose and was missing . Unless Casio releases a `` new and improved '' version of this watch -LRB- and the other watches in this product line -RRB- , you 're wasting your money .
 A great watch but Casio does this thing where the watch band pin goes into the watch is cheap plastic ; after awhile the pin just wears out the pin hole and the watch is unusable because you cant put a pin in it to hold the watch band . A big rip off . I have had 5 or more expensive Casio watches become unusable because there is n't away to put the watch band on ? I am sure that as people wake up to this , there will be a class action lawsuit against Casio for premeditatedly having watches to break after awhile . I wish I could buy a Casio watch , I wont give any more money to those con artist 's . A greedy shame of them . What used to be a trustworthy brand is now just a rip off scam .
 The watch seemed great and I loved it , but sadly it did n't make it even a year . The band broke at the base of the watch where it connects to the watch itself . The underside of the watch is plastic and broke without capability of repair . Broke at night while I was asleep , thus not the good of quality . Would be a great watch if the plastic was a metal .
 I bought this watch for my husband less than 6 months ago as a gift . Initially we were both thrilled with all the cool features and the very cool look of the watch . When it came down to wearing it , it does n't stand up . The face scratched the first day and after several weeks he was worried about scratching it up and stopped wearing it . His work is not a rough job , he 's a pilot . A week ago , the plastic piece they hide between the metal front and the back of the case broke , mind you he was just sitting at home on the couch , and CASIO refuses to warranty it because he lost the receipt . This watch is crap , unless you only plan to wear it once . Do n't waste your money .
 I got this watch for Father 's Day , and about three weeks later , the tab on the case that holds the pin for the watchband , broke . It was then I noticed that the case was plastic with a sliver-like coating . I sent it back to Casio , -LRB- repair IDESS337539 -RRB- , expecting a repair under warranty , and was told that Casio does not warrant their cases . -LRB- Unbelieveable to me . -RRB- I read my guarantee that came with the watch and that 's what it states ! Casio 's price to fix their cheap plastic case ? $ 29.95 , almost the price of a new watch , and I would STILL be the owner of a new watch with a cheap , non-warranted , plastic case . No thanks , Casio . I plan to tell the world exactly why I 'll never buy one of your products again , and if you 're reading this , I hope you do n't either.Deane E. Kogelschatz
 The sheets are a very poor quality and what you are actually paying for is the steeler pillow case - certainly not worht $ 50 in a twin . Will be returning it immediately .
 The black background on this watch makes it very difficult to see without using the light.Also , the temp is not accurate without taking the watch off because your body temp translates through the metal casingO yeah , unless you have tree trunk arms , you will have to pay a repairman to remove the links in the band = add $ 5-10
 A normally cheapoid Casio . The digital display is impossible to see in daylight , but you can activate auto-lighting tilt device . Band length simple to adjust . A true monument to over-engineering . The moon phase and tide data are really useful in mid-town traffic . Wonder why these Japanese rocket-scientists did not put in a simple compass ? My science-minded girlfriend participated in an experiment

 This is overall a functional nice looking watch , but I agree that the face scratches too easily and after 3 years the solar recharge has stopped working -LRB- even if the battery is brand new -RRB- . Yes , I know it has worked for three years , but now that the solar recharge does n't work , it goes through batteries extremely quickly .
 Got a casio wave ceptor watch with metal band for Christmas with the same wrist band design - the band pulled apart at the case the first day . The metal pin that holds the band on is attached to the case with a cheap rubbery plastic peice that rips out easily.The worst part is if you look at Casio 's warrentee the band and case are not covered.My watch is now held together with epoxy - very fashionable ! Goes good if you have glasses held together with masking tape.My advise is move on and find a watch with a metal to metal connection from the band to the case . Do n't buy this one !
 I bought the watch 15 months ago and the thing has officially gone kaput . It became increasingly difficult to keep it charged , and now it is `` frozen , '' displaying a random date and `` 4A '' as the day . If you want something that will last more than a year and a half , I 'd keep looking .
 I liked the watch while it lasted . Very attractive styling . But about a year later , well before I 'd be replacing a conventional battery , the solar battery now does n't hold a charge for long . I 've had to reset everything twice in the last week . Solar power is n't saving you anything with this watch .
 This was my very first solar-powered watch . Three years ago , I saw it while walking past a watch store at a local shopping mall , and the price tag said `` $ 50 '' -LRB- about US$ 33 -RRB- , so I bought it on impulse.At that point in time , I 've always thought that solar powered watches cost at least $ 500 or more . Imagine my delight at finding a cheap solar powered watch!However , my joy was pretty short-lived . A couple of weeks down the road , while wearing it , it switched off right in the middle of the day ! Lunchtime in fact , while I was out walking around in bright sunlight ! Hands stopped moving , LCD screen blank except for a `` LO C '' blinking indicator . It was impossible since I have never seen the watch move from the `` Hi '' battery level indicator before.An hour later it turned itself back on while I was back in the office . Hands moved to the correct time , LCD screen was back on , and the battery indicator said `` Hi '' . A few incidents similar to this happened a few times , in the following months . So much so that I decided to junk this watch and threw it inside my drawer , never touching it for about 8 months or so.Recently , I took it out of the drawer again and the watch turned itself back on when it was exposed to light . Battery Indicator said `` MID '' . So I left it on the window sill for 3 days straight , hoping that it stays at `` Hi '' . On the 4th day , I wore it out . We went to the movies , and right in the middle of the movie when I wanted to check the time , I pressed the backlight and ... nada . No reaction . I tilted the watch to let the light from the movie shine on it and saw the watch had turned itself off AGAIN , about 40 mins ago -LRB- checked time with my mobile phone -RRB- . Somewhere along the way , still during the same movie , the watch turned itself on again , because suddenly I heard it do the hourly beep thing . Now , I know for sure that the watch was not exposed to light in any way , and even if it did , the light from the movie is nowhere near powerful enough to charge it up to turn it back on.My take is this - it 's too cheap to send it back to Casio for servicing . If it works while you wear it , enjoy it . It will suck when it does n't . The other thing about Casio analogue watches which I did n't like much is that the `` luminous paint '' on the hands is almost useless . It glows for like only 15 mins and then stop glowing . Practically useless . It 's not just on this watch - I own a couple of other Casio digi-ana watches from the G-Shock line and every single one of them had the same problem of short-lived glowing luminous hands and markers .
 This Christmas gift for my husband never arrived ! I was charged for this item and was given notification that my order had been shipped . I never received my item . I was unable to track my package because the shipping site listed the number as invalid . Their website gives some excuse about shipping numbers coming up as `` invalid '' if they are checked within a day or two . This never changed for my order ! I contacted the company and was eventually told that the item was unavailable as it was not in stock . It was frustrating to be told that your item was shipped only to find that I had been lied to . It has been a hassle to contact this company as they are unreachable by phone . I have waited upwards of 30 minutes on hold , only to become frustrated and hang up . I then had to take time to fill out online forms requesting that the order be canceled . Such a hassle . I am still awaiting reimbursement from this company . I have never had an issue like this with an Amazon seller before . Fans Edge is truly awful .
 Just received this pkg today-had wrong jersey -LRB- Jets-Revis # 24 -RRB- ! This would n't usually bother me because I can return it , but I bought this as a Christmas present , so now I 'm hoping they have the Urlacher jersey size I 'm looking for . So much for shopping early !
 The Kit was well made but impossible for me to use . The arbors that were supposed to fit my rifles would not hold the boresighter upright but rather allowed the boresighter to rotate down so that it was impossible to use.PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS MATTER AGAIN AS I AM DEALING WITH THE PRIMARY VENDER.Kenneth G. Phillips
 Defective 22 cal arbor ... semi half spring at front of arbor broken . . everything else seemed O.K. . But returned it as defective , could n't sight in my 22 cal rifle ...
 After using this reel for about five hours it became very hard to reel in as if the spinning part was jammed . Once I got it turning there was a constant rubbing sound -- it looks as if the part that spins -LRB- the cylinder that holds the bail -RRB- is bent and rubbing against the part it surrounds.I paid $ 13 to send it back to Okuma and they did fix it so it does not jamb anymore , but still rubs and reels in very roughly -- that roughness is very annoying to hear since it constantly reminds me what low quality it is.On a side note ; I am pretty sure that Okuma makes the Cabela 's Salt Striker reels which are much lower in price .
 Purchased two of these reels from Sportsman ' Warehouse in Chattanooga . Both had the extremely annoying problem with the line hanging up in the bail pickup . They exchanged them for new ones but when the second pair had the same exact problem I got no help from Sportsman 's Warehouse . They said they were sorry but they no longer carried the Okuma reels so I ended up tossing them in the trash . No more Okuma reels for me and no more Sportsman 's Warehouse either .
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .

 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 I purchased a white one and it looked great.However , the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and is n't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing . It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It 's a nice brand , not worth the price and there are better ones out there .

 I purchased this band for my husband as a replacement for his original Luminox band . Big mistake . It is VERY cheaply made - this appears to be a knock off of an actual Luminox watch band . The only reason I ordered from this company instead of from Luminox is because of the free shipping . I should n't have wasted my money or my time .
 We bought two of these for family reunion fun , but the fun did n't show . One boat never made it to the water because it deflated quickly . The other one stayed inflated , but the black patches on the side must have retained heat from the sun and became soft because it bulged and looked like it would pop at any moment . One of the oars broke with normal use . The one bright spot was the pump . It was small but worked fast . For the price this was very thin plastic and a total bust . Thank goodness the dealer took them back with no problems .
 I was very happy with a front wheel that I purchased earlier from Niagara for about the same price as this rear wheel . When I bought this rear wheel , I thought I was buying a matching rear wheel to the front that I had purchased earlier . However , the quality of this rear wheel is terrible compared to the front wheel . The front wheel had a low cost Shimano hub that spun glass smooth with very little resistance . This rear wheel has a lot of drag when one tries to spin it , to the point where one has to make sure that one has a fairly tight grip on the hub so that it does not spin with the wheel . In addition , the wheel is visibly out of round . Not much but , enough to be irritating.I ca n't believe the difference in quality between the front wheel that I bought and this rear wheel . Both cost under $ 30 each .
 My daughter loves this bike . It was her first `` mountain bike '' . The price was good and we like the look of it and we were happy not to get a brand that was too common . But we 've had some issues with the brake cables . And she 's had to learn to put the chain on herself , because she 'll be riding and the bike will just come to a stop . She has to walk it to a safe place and then fix the chain . She 's pretty independent for 9years old , but otherwise - I would n't recommend it .

 The table has a flaw , the table inverts too fast and the safety strap is not adjustable . Also the adjustment for height & weight makes no sense.Then the warranty has a different name -LRB- Sylvan not Chapmans -RRB- no phone number -LRB- had to find it on the web -RRB- and the Chapmans website has no phone number . When you call you get a recording and no one returns calls.Amazon customer service is n't any better!And to add salt to the wound , the table sells for less on Chapmans website .
 This table comes with absolutely no instructions on how to use it . Unless you are blessed with extraordinary strength it is veritably impossible to return to the starting position . Letting yourself rotate backwards in any controlled manner is also impossible . It is something akin to free fall . You MUST have someone spot you if you are going to use this table . On the positive side , it is well constructed and the assembly is not all that difficult . The very worse aspect of this is that the same company sells the table on Ebay for $ 50.00 less . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 This item is very dangerous . The assembly instructions are poor , but after figuring it out , I was optimistic that the item would work well . The usage instructions are about 2 sentences long . After getting on and slowly raising my arms , I was thrown backwards at an extremely fast pace and I thought I was going to break my neck . Fortunately , I did not panic and my wife assisted me in getting up . I do n't think I can use this item and I believe that I wasted my money .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .

 The hat was closer to a size 8 than the 7 3/8 size that I ordered . It absolutely did not fit my head and it was obvious that the original New Era tag had be cut off and replaced with a tag from this supplier . You cheated me and I should ask for my money back but I 'd rather make people aware of this so they do n't buy anything from you and get cheated like me . Your package was also 2 days late , yet the company delivering the package stated that it had got to my place on time , which it definitely did not . This was about my 6th or 7th time ordering a New Era Cap from Amazon.com and you were by far the worst . Get your act together or you 'll get caught by the wrong person because your defiling a product that is not yours , which you know is illegal . Good riddens .
 I 'm sure this is a fake . This there is n't a New Era logo stitched on the hat ... And the quality is poorly stitched in comparison to my other New Era hats ... the hat has no form and the bill is shorter than normal ... pretty disappointed that Amazon would have this on their shelf .
 i told amazon.com that i will never order from them again because i think it 's incredibly cheap of them to only use USPS when super saver shipping has been qualified for . especially considering the amount of money i have spent with them over the years . i hope you do the same

 i bought 2 falcon air horns for christmas.they were for my grandsons for use at the ny ranger games.one worked the other had no air . i would not buy this product again because its real use is for saftey on the water and the odds of it working is only 50/50
 I was happy with this watch when I received it . It was aesthetically pleasing and was easy to read . It comfortably fit my large wrist and had these grooves in-layed in the strap so the watch would n't move if your wrist got sweaty . Simple to program and use and very tough -LRB- so I thought at the time -RRB- . I was boosting my buddy over a wall and he stepped on the watch , it did not break . Mind you to the fact that he does not weigh a lot , maybe 130 pounds.After a couple months of loving this watch , I was starting to notice the hinges that connected the straps to the watch face would squeak . This concerned me as I felt these would give out one day and the watch would fall apart . I showed it to my brother , who owns a real G-Shock , and we compared watches . His G-Shock -LRB- DW6900-1V -RRB- did not have movable hinges but instead had stationary hinges , thus no squeaking . His watch felt also more solid and well built . He works as an EMT , so that 's what he primarily uses his watch for . This concerned me further but I decided to just see how things would pan out.A couple weeks later , I was working out at the gym . I always wear my watch to tell time since I do n't carry my phone at the gym . While I sat up from working out , the watch edge snagged on a bench and the hinge broke . It was so fast I could barely tell what happened . I picked up my broken watch and said `` Should of got the G-Shock . `` It is repairable but if this going to be a serious work or duty watch you ca n't have this happen on the job . Of all the crap I put it through , it was a simple snag that broke the hinge.Also this is not a defect in my watch , this is poor design and if you look at G-Shocks they have a fail-safe against this issue.Save up the extra 23 bucks and buy a real G-Shock , my brother has had his for a year and it 's still running strong .
 when i was going through the pictures i saw the gshock box but it doesnot come with that box and also the watch looks cheap
 The watch is actually pretty nice for the price . However it is not a real g shock as shown in the picture And stated in title . Box is regular Casio and bevel on the face is not raised like g shocks . Nice touch though , countdown timer does n't automatically start again aftear reaching zero . Not a bad watch . Just not what was stated .

 This sword is pleasing to look at , but not very good as a practice weapon . The weighting is poor -- the handle is way too light -LRB- being plastic -RRB- and it is not hollow enough to allow for adding some weight internally . Do n't buy this sword if you actually plan on using it .
 spend a few more dollars and buy the Red Chinese Tai Chi Swords . It 's only a little more and it is a much better deal ! I bought both at the same time .
 This sword is nice for display only , the body is too long while the handle is small and short which make it unbalance when practice , you can use to `` cut '' like broadsword but have hard time to `` point '' for a strike.Don ' t recomended it ...
 blade is not carbon steel but stainless and wobbles so much it may fall out of the sword completely

 I bought this over the Yakima equivalent for the locking accessory . What a mistake i made . The racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work . I called Thule to complain and was told i have a faulty unit and i need to RMA it . I sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case . But i would steer clear if i was you .

 they were fun except hard to keep them tied and played with them so much i wore off the wheeles , and the wheeles feel off .
 My daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them . She learned how to move about on them although a year later she 's still quite wobbly . The shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use . My problem is that there really is no way for her to stop . No knob brake like normal skates have , so most of the time she 's pretty out of control or walking like Frankenstein . Also , the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own , so we have to dot it for her . It was n't like that when I first bought it , though . We bought her normal skates for Christmas to replace these .
 I followed the instructions on the package . I placed the mug in the freezer for no more than 10mins and it cracked .
 Their are several Final Fantasy replica swords on sale here on Amazon.com . . Many of which i 've bought , own and are happy with . But this does n't even vaguely resemble the sword from the game . I understand its impossible to make a sword of water . . But . . It could at least look like the original sword in shape and size . . The hilt/handle does n't even look the same . . This is NOT a replica , A true replica should resemble the actual sword.Go check out the other FF replicas many of them are of good quality !
 You would have to be nuts to beleive this . Mishapen , out of proportion , umm , lets see , WRONG COLOR ! Absolutely Insane !
 Is this a joke ? This is not Tidus 's sword ; not by a longshot . I think that fact is painfully obvious to anyone looking at that picture right there . I mean , just LOOK at how different they are !
 I have a hard time believing they put much thought into this replica . Honestly , how hard is it to make the thing blue ? Attention to detail , thats not too much to ask for is it ?
 I dont own this and never will . This thing isn nothing like Tidus ' Brotherhood . The Brothehood was blue , its had a point at the end of the blade , and the curve at the point looks nothing like that . The Brotherhood was an awsome sword and this thing is crap . I would recommend spending $ 40.00 on this .
 Others would more likely agree you would have to be out of your mind to buy this sorry excuse for a replica .

 The grip extensions do the job but they 're hollow on the underside . I had hoped it would give a little bit of extra space for the rounds to fit the magazine as well as extend the grip to make the glock 27 have a more stable grip . It gave a better grip but did n't help with the spring tension .
 Pearce has great products but this one does n't work the best for my Glock 27 . First it was tough to replace the original mag plate to add this one . And then it does n't really add the surface needed for my pinky . I ordered the larger one which add two more rounds for what should be the right fit . I 'd only recommend for someone with smaller hands .
 I hate that this did n't work out , seemed like a great idea for more grip but I found EVERY TIME I fired , there was a little space between the grip and the extension causing it to pinch my pinky finger on absolutely every shot . There was no getting used to it unfortunately so I had to remove it and go back to the regular ol' mag .
 I thought it was grip extention as it says , but its Magazine extention , and if you have 10 magazines you have to have 10 of these , what a dumb product , its not what the title says , &#34; GRIP EXTENTION &#34; NOT ITS MAGAZINE EXTENTION
 - ProsThis pistol grip provides a place to put your pinky that the standard sub-compact Glock -LRB- 26 , 27 , etc. -RRB- does n't offer . With the pinky , you can achieve better accuracy through better stabilization and it 's less exhausting for your hand and grip to shoot with a full purchase on the handle of the weapon.-ConsThe sharp edges on the top of this floorplate do not meet up with the bottom of the mag-well . This is designed for tolerance reasons -LRB- I would imagine -RRB- since the magazine flexes up and down a small amount as rounds are cycled . This magazine flex , combined with the sharp edges make pinching inevitable and make the weapon painful to use.The face of the extension did n't match the style of my Glock grip either , thus negating the `` factory '' look that Pierce is promoting . You can definitely tell it 's not from Glock due to the material that it 's made out of and the design change between the pistol grip and the magazine extension.Although the extension is small it made concealability very difficult . This extension brought my Glock 26 size to the same size as my Glock 23 . I found myself carrying that , instead , due to comfort , stopping power , and similar concealability due to the similar sizes.I also found that the added leverage from your pinky -LRB- which was n't intended by Glock -RRB- was pulling down and twisting on my magazine and magazine release as I used my pinky . It started chewing up the area where the magazine release holds my magazines in place and would have probably -LRB- I did n't let it get this far -RRB- caused feed issues in the future.-ConclusionI know that , in a defensive situation , you 'll only shoot a few rounds making my `` pinching '' problem a non-issue , but you have to practice how you play . That means firing hundreds -LRB- if not thousands -RRB- of rounds , with the extension , at the range to become proficient with your weapon . I found that the pain made me hate shooting my gun to the point I avoided practicing it , lowering my accuracy.Taking off the floorplates made shooting more comfortable and more enjoyable . The disadvantage with accuracy can be -LRB- and is -RRB- more than compensated with the added practice and proper holding of the weapon without the extensions . I consider myself MORE accurate now WITHOUT the extensions than I ever have been simply through practicing more and holding the weapon properly for the small size -LRB- with the factory floorplates -RRB- . Concealability has become a non-issue with the factory floorplates -LRB- as it was designed to be by Glock -RRB- and printing is minimal . The weapon also looks more aesthetically pleasing -LRB- to me -RRB- without the extensions than it did with the extensions.So , to wrap this up , I just do n't see where the advantage of having a place for your pinky trumps comfort , concealability , and accuracy . My Ruger LC9 comes from the factory with an option for a pinky extension , and that works perfectly due to proper fit and finish . If Glock were to come out with an extension , I will definitely try it out , but I 'm never buying or use a Pierce grip extension again .

 I have had these wrist weights for at least 2-3 years and use them when I do my walking workouts outside . They are great wrist weights , as far as that goes , and I 've never had any problem with the fit . The problem I have is that they , of course , absorb perspiration as I work out and become very smelly and gross and require periodic washings . I just learned from the manufacturer that they are NOT to be washed !! Who would ever design a product for working out that could not be washed ?? Anyway , they started exuding a rust-colored substance a while ago and the last time I washed them by hand , therefore making them very wet , I tossed them in the clothes dryer for about 20 min to get rid of some of the moisture so I could use them . The entire inside of the dryer was splattered with that orangish , rust-colored stuff and required me to completely wiped down ever surface of the dryer interior to avoid having that all over my next load of laundry . I was finally able to speak with someone at the manufacturer of this product -LRB- not Danskin , actually , but they referred me on to the manufacturer -RRB- and they confirmed that the weights are in fact filled with steel pellets . Apparently it says on the workout schedule that comes with the weights that the weights can only be surface washed but that packaging has long since vanished in my house . Surface washing would not even come close to keeping these weights clean enough to be used long-term and I 'm going to have to throw mine away , even though they are still perfectly functional as wrist weights . They have become gross and disgusting !!
 I was very disappointed to see that these are in no way ankle weights , unless perhaps you are a thin child . I bought these to use as ankle weights and there is no way these would fit my ankles . I am 5 ' 7 '' and 135 pounds , so I am hardly overweight . These should only be advertised as wrist weights . Also , they are one pound each . I may return them .
 These are tiny -- way too small for my wrists . I 'm a small woman at 4 `` 11 ' and 115 lbs . If they do n't fit me , they wo n't fit anybody . Maybe 0 starts would be a better choice .
 These sheets are basically a plain set of cheap white sheets , with a pair of Falcon logo 's pillowcases . Certainly not worth what was charged for this item . My son was very disappointed to open them .
 We bought these for my son for his 4th birthday and although they are very sturdy , the buttons to release the wheels are on the inner part of the outside of the shoe . So when he is walking in them , one of the shoes will hit the button on the other shoe and pop out the wheels mid-step ! This happens several times a minute ! They should have put the buttons on the other side of the shoe so that they do n't hit each other ! He has had several bad falls -LRB- which drew blood ! -RRB- I would not recommend these until they make it impossible for the wheels to pop out spontaneously ! -LRB- maybe making the buttons flush against the shoe instead of sticking out so far -RRB-
 The quality of the glove is OK but because there was no size choice on the order , I assumed that one size would fit all . The gloves came and were in fact small/medium which is too small and consequently must be returned . This is a hassle .
 First off , let me state that I received a pair of these gloves as stocking stuffers on TWO occasions , so there is little chance that I happened to get the bad apple of a batch twice.These gloves , on a quick , first impression seem to be decently constructed , etc. . Of course , first impressions are often dead wrong.Given that the padding is on the thin side , one really ought to use these gloves with handwraps if hitting the heavybag -LRB- ` tho one can go wrap-free if the mitts are used on a double end bag -RRB- , so one must purchase gloves that are at least one size larger than one 's hands . If that were the only prob , these gloves might be okay for `` beginners '' and those who do n't hit very hard becuz they fit over the hand well -LRB- actually , these might not do for novices as the thumbs are neither padded nor affixed at the side to the rest of the glove , increasing the danger when a beginner punches improperly , esp if close to the area on the heavy bag where the chains are attached -RRB- . Unfortunately , after used a few times , the seams on both of my pairs began to rip and the leather over the knuckles and the areas that are `` folded '' when one makes a fist started to `` crack '' / split pretty soon after , making the gloves all but useless.Save your money and snag yourself a pair of quality -LRB- i.e. NOT Everlast -RRB- neoprene bag gloves , but be prepared becuz they 'll eventually start to stink as much as leather mitts -LRB- ` tho they are easier to clean and , indeed , some have `` inserts '' that one can remove and wash -RRB- .
 I had a pair of these years ago that I purchased from Everlast when they were headquartered in the South Bronx . They were great and I literally beat them to shreds.I just started training again after a long hiatus and was looking for another pair but all I could find at the local chain sporting goods stores were the MMA type bag gloves so needless to say when I saw these on Amazon I was thrilled.Well the excitement ceased when I opened the package . The leather had a texture that was nothing like the old ones . They feel like they are very cheaply made . They were also too small . I was aware of this complaint as I did read the reviews before I ordered them but I do n't have large hands so I thought I could get by . Well I was wrong . The one size fits all is just plain misleading . Especially when the gloves came clearly marked S/M . This is the first Amazon purchase that I did not like at all . You should only buy these if you have the smallest of hands . Then again , the quality of the leather is so cheap I would n't even bother getting these . Everlast clearly sacrificed quality to achieve this price point . I promptly returned them for a refund .

 Purchased two as Christmas gifts . Ball came off both gifts within the first month . Poorly made product.We have a 20 year old zim zam that still works .
 I am pretty disappointed in this product . I purchased it for my kids and the raquets that came with the set were too cumbersome for them and the string a bit too long . The ball broke off the string after a few attempts at playing and the whole set was in the garbage in two weeks because the pole got broken and bent . Not at all like the zim zam I had as a kid .
 The main pole bent on the first use , and the tennis ball came off the string attached to it . Poorly made .

 IMO , these ankle weights are DANGEROUS and should be RECALLED.They do not appear as in the current picture . They contain a large pouch on the front -LRB- as worn , middle as resting flat -RRB- , filled with sand . The pouch sits on the front of your foot , and gravity pulls the sand to the bottom of the pouch , making all the sand weight balance precariously on top of your foot -LRB- or your shoe/sneaker -RRB- . Gravity then works further on this weight , to pull it to the side -LRB- usually the inside -RRB- of your ankle.There are two heavy , hard metal bars in pouches on either side . These weights are supposed to rest on the sides , toward the rear of the leg . However , as gravity , assisted by body movement , pulls the big pouch of sand to the side , one bar begins to rest in the front on the bone , while the other begins to rest in the rear on the tendon . As you move , these bars bang against your bone and your tendon , potentially causing pain and damage . This has caused me enough pain , to the point at which I had to halt my workout.I have tried various methods of positioning and fixing in place the weights . Some slowed the movement , but none stopped it . IMO , this product is simply not worth the risk .
 I wanted to point out a few things that were n't clear when I bought these weights :1 . Each band is equipped with removable weights -LRB- 2 1lb bars each -RRB- so you can lighten them if you need . However , the inserts are not made of sand , but of metal , and are very hard and can bruise your ankle bone if you leave them in .2 . The box says that these are NOT to be used for running or walking .3 . They are too big for me , I 'm a size 4 female with small ankles and I positively swim in these . So be wary if you want them to fit snugly.My rating is partly based on disappointment , I bought these because I thought as they were designed for women they would be small enough to fit me , or at least adjustable . And I thought I could use them for hiking .
 Do not buy these if you have relatively small ankles . I liked them at first , but very quickly they became stretched out , and they would frequently fall off as I was walking . Over about only 6 months of use -LRB- two or three times a week -RRB- , the material was gradually stretched longer , and then the velcro does not secure compeletely . They have fallen off many times as I was walking in the gym and/or crossing the street in NYC , which was very inconvenient !
 This product is yet another example of terrible business ethics , wherein manufacturers sell their products using misleading descriptions -LRB- and then to be `` technically correct '' - they have some additional qualifiers written in smaller fonts -RRB- . They mislead you to think that it will fit all ankles -LRB- and then write `` snug fit for most sizes '' in a smaller font -RRB- . Why the hell ca n't they provide sizing with their product -LRB- like the wrist-bands that come for writs stability -RRB- . Similarly , the 10lbs weight pairing is cleverly written to mislead the buyer into thinking that it is 2x10lbs . I can imagine this product being workable for some customers , who have a much wider ankle/wrist - so to be fair , the product itself is probably ok -LRB- not sure for the price though -RRB- . But having said that I would never buy -LRB- or recommend anyone to buy -RRB- products of a company which cons people . Hence - ve stars from me .
 I purchased these weights to wear on my ankles during daily work and replace another brand that I have . I own a pair of Valeo ankle wieghts but hated them . They were huge and filled with sand pockets . Now I understand why they want sand in those things , its to be easy on the skin and tendons . But what happens is that the sand accumulates on the bottom of the sacks and you have a massive bulge that undoes the velcro.The Danskin Weights look nothing like the picture here on Amazon . In reality there are two small rods of metal one pound each and the three pound that are left are sand ! Again with the sand.How hard can it be to make a non-sand one ? It will reduce the size by more than two thirds . If they are worried about the comfort they can coat them with gel.I guess I expected too much from a Made in China product .
 The description for this item claims that each weight is adjustable from 0.5 to 2.5 pounds . THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE . Each ankle weight contains 1-1/2 POUNDS OF FIXED WEIGHT THAT CAN NOT BE REMOVED AND then TWO 1/2 WEIGHTS THAT CAN BE ADDED . Each ankle weight can only be one of 3 different weights :1 -1 / 2 pounds2 pounds2-1 / 2 poundSTHERE IS NO .5 POUND CAPABILITY . Look elsewhere if you want weights that are adjustable from .5 or 1 pound and up .
 the fact that you can adjust the weights is great , the idea to wear them on your ankles does n't work well . they are huge even on the biggest ankles of the whole wide world.i made them into above the calves weight , and that is the only place they stay on ... so adjustable ankle weights means , you can adjust the weight , nothing else.the material they are made out of is great , it 's super soft on your skin ...
 I ordered the product based on what I read at the top of the page . At first glance , I thought I would receive -LRB- 2 -RRB- five pound weights for each leg . That is not the case . Each weight is maximum of 2.5 pounds . So this is misleading if you do n't scroll to the details . I was lucky to cancel the order .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 These fenders are thin and bend easily . Install them quickly or they will even bend on their own . The real problem is , they came with no mounting hardware.I contacted Pyramid Cycles about it but they never responded . I also contacted them about another issue , but no answer . So do n't expect any support from this seller.I have looked everywhere on the web for mounting hardware for these things , but I can not find anything . So I guess I 'll have to make the mounts myself . If anybody knows where I could find them , or how to make them , please let me know . Thanks .
 The blade on this came out of hte box dull . I have sharpened it with my sharpener and I hope it holds an edge . .
 I bought this replacement tire tube for my son 's bike , but once we put it on and started blowing it up , green slime immediately started pouring out ?! My husband did n't even get the tire blown up completely before it started leaking from the valve . Thinking it might just be a slow leak and because the green slime is supposed to fix flats , we figured we would continue to blow it up and see if it sealed itself ... it never did . Now I 'm out $ 6 and my son still does n't have a bike to ride .
 The red wire from the two 9-volt battery power supply was disconnected upon product arrival . Unfortunately there was no way to get at the downstream connection to solder it without breaking the thing apart . Cheap quality all around . Do n't waste youy money !
 I purchased this item because I had a $ 10 credit and the credit was only good if used on an item for sale by Amazon . This is a cheap plastic product , that while the noise and arc will definitely scare a potential attacker , it is not up to standard . The belt clip is plastic that is secured by one screw . It wo n't fit over my belt and if you were to simply use the belt clip to slide over your pants or bluejeans , that would work , but if you did anything but pull the unit straight up , e.g. pulled it at an angle from your body , the plastic clip would snap . The wrist strap is not a detachable safety item as other units I have seen are not able to be used if they are detached from the wrist strap thus preventing an attacker from taking the unit away from you and then using it against you . I highly recommend buying the other product I bought , the Blast Knuckle Stun Gun .
 Loved the jersey , but have washed several times since receiving -LRB- maybe 8-10 times -RRB- and the lettering is washing off ! Not the quality I expected . Will not order through this vender again .
 I bought two for my bike . One was good when I had a flat tire , but the other did not last long-only two days ! It suddenly got blown . I almost had a big accident . It maybe came from my bad luck or maybe from its unreliable system of sustaining its quality . At this time I should find other brand for my flat tire .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .
 Updated Review
 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 This smelled fine and worked okay , I suppose . However -LRB- ! -RRB- , when I checked on my horse the day after the first -LRB- and last -RRB- application , each and every sensitive area -LRB- flanks , girth area near legs , etc. -RRB- was very scurfy and flaking . Much of the hair later fell off those areas . So , give this a fly spray a shot if you want , but stand warned
 Well , after reading the reviews , the actual performance of these tires has deffinately left me wanting . I have put a number of rides on these tires -LRB- they came on my new 29er -RRB- and I ca n't wait to change them . I have experienced a flat almost every ride ; even with heavy duty tubes . The traction provided by the little tiny numbs is all but nonexistant . These tires may , and probably do , perform well on hard pack , but in the NE we almost never get that . The type of riding we typiv = cally do is technical with lost of roots , rocks and mud ; these tires just ca n't cut it . As far as puncture protection - forget it . I have pull three large thorns from the tire that penetrated all the way through the casing . These tire are probably best suited for the rails-to-trails paths !
 Well made , nice chamois . I am 5 ' 9 '' and high waisted - these fit very low on the hips and barely covered my knees even when ordering a size bigger than I normally wear .
 I ordered this product in January . It is now the middle of March and after being told it would ship in March I am now being told it will not ship until the end of May ? I just canceled the order . Why should I have to wait 5 months for a coffee mug ?
 The Slime Liner had sharp ridges on one side and smooth on the other side . The Slime instruction did not mention the Liner needs to be installed side specific . A brand new tube was destroyedAfter 90 miles I got another flat , small steel wire went through the Slime Tube Protector.I posted pictures.Slime customer service did not respond to my email complainant .
 After getting the occasional tire punctures once ever few months , I thought this item would have been a good idea , preventing some of the punctures.But after installing it , my new tire went flat one day later . I was very displeased but went and replace thet tube again.Again , after riding the bike for 30 minutes , the new tire went flat.I was angry at this point . I noticed that the stem/valve of the tire was shifted and no longer coming out of the wheel at a perpendicular angle . I suspected that the liner was too slippery and was causing the tube to shift and ripping away at the stem.When I took the tire out , I confirmed this on both of my tires.I would n't recommend this product . I ca n't believe that this does n't happen with other people too.Perhaps an adhesive would have remedied the problem .
 My mom got me a pair of tire liners for my mountain bike tires when she got tired of driving into the woods to rescue me . Funny thing
 I used these with the slime thorn resistant tubes and I have had two flats due to this liner . The first flat eroded through the tire and caused the flat . Yesterday it sliced the tube . STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT . Best just to run with the Slime thick thorn resistant tubes alone which is a great product . I even carry a spare .
 I am very puncture prone and bought this product to safe guard myself . However this product has caused many more punctures by slicing my tubes . I have tried covering the edges with duct tape , but it has been of no use.Pretty poorly designed product-Nikhilesh
 I bought these at the local Walmart for about the same price as it goes for on here ... I had read the reviews here and thought the tire slicing reviews would n't apply to me because my V2100 had 2.125 '' tires . I went out on a 15 mile ride in ~ 35 degree weather on Sunday night , and the next morning noticed my rear was flat . The end of the liner in contact with the inner tube had cut a crescent shaped groove and had caused a pinhole at one of the corners . I did n't have a spare tube with me at the time since I had a -LRB- non-liner related -RRB- flat on the front tire the previous day , I ca n't believe how close I came to being stranded , at night , in cold weather , 7 miles away from home . Needless to say neither tire has this liner anymore.Since I ride streets frequently I need protection from unseen broken glass . These are not the solution .
 I think there may be quality control problems . I 've used these liners in the past without problems , but this set really cut into my tubes , and I went through a variety of tubes before removing the liners .
 I bought these from my local Big Box a few months after I started commuting 10 miles per day . While I have n't ever had something outside of the tire puncture them I have had 2 or 3 flats caused by the liner itself . The inside end where the liner overlaps eventually cuts my tubes no matter which edge you overlap or which side faces inward ! I 've had to trim the liners to eliminate the sharp edge and even then I only had marginal success . On a positive note , they ought to stop most anything 9MM and below if you ever get caught in a shoot out . Sure wish I would have looked online before I picked these up . Mr. Tuffy 's it is from now on.Update 10/05/2012
 I ran one of these -LRB- of a different size -RRB- in my front tire , 700c32 , 60-70 psi for 8 months on roads . I had no punctures during that time , which I believe I would have had without the liner , but then the liner cut a hole in my tube . It was at the end of the liner , where the tube under high pressure has to stretch itself over the sharp ledge . it was a small enough cut to patch , but I 'm not letting that liner back in my tire.I used glue to help position the liner in the tire as I assembled it ; experience with tire liners in general tells me if I had n't done that , it would likely not have been centered and a puncture in the tread area could get past it.Another liner , maybe not this brand , once sliced my tube lengthwise in S-curves , as it was not centered in the tire . Had to throw that tube out when one slice finally got all the way through .
 Length :
 I 'm an avid cyclist . I 've used these tire liners on both my mountain and road bike . Long story short , they simply do n't work . I have had just as many flats since I installed them .
 As noted elsewhere , these liners are nearly impossible to install uniformly centered in the tire and the sharp liner edges will damage and actually cut into the tube . Living in AZ I got ta have flat protection , but these liners are a problem , not a solution .
 I ran these in my mountain bike for a while with over 60psi in my tires for commuting to work ... they worked great with that much pressure . When I went down to trail pressure -LRB- 50psi or so -RRB- I got one ride in before they caused a laceration all the way around the tube that was not patchable ... there was literally a cut all the way around the tube from the edge of the liners . Other brands -LRB- Tuffy Liners , for example -RRB- have a tapered edge that is not as sharp as these . Slime needs to redesign these things in a big way . I love the thickness of them for the thorns I deal with , but they really need a tapered edge . I would avoid them .
 I installed the liner on both the front and back tire . Since I had a major flat on the rear tire before I installed the liner , I also replaced the inner tube with one prefilled with slime . 30 min into the initial brisk ride on city streets , the new inner tube burst . I replaced it with a 2nd slime inner tube - 10 days later , burst again . Kind of wondering if the liner is rubbing against the inner tube . I noticed a 1-2 '' laceration along the tube slightly off center . I am now trying something else - buying a kevlar tire with a generic inner tube and did not install the liner on the rear tire - will see how this lives up . Bottom line , I suspect the liner causes the inner tube to slide around and eventually rub against the inner tube and cause it to tear .
 Bought these at the recommendation of my LBS . By the next day I had two flats - slice marks , not puncture marks , in my tubes . Walked my bike home then went back to the bike shop and got a refund for the Slime liners and two free new tubes . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 Like everyone else has said , these cause flats by cutting into your tire.I called slime . They are aware of this issue . They were nice enough to send me a free set . The tech advised me to wrap them in duct tape.I reported them to the cpsc.They should issue a recall.The fact that they have n't shows serious moral and quality issues.This is a deadly serious safety issue.I 'm never buying slime again.Incedently , I 'm at 3,000 flat free miles on my ebike with tuffy tire liners and stan 's sealant !
 I was hoping these would be as good as Mr Tuffy . Very disappointed . We have lots of puncture weeds where we live and they go right through the liner without any problem . I would not recommend buying them .
 It will cut the tire in 30 minutes . The cut is about 1.5 inches long , looks like made with a knife or a blade , along the tube . The cut is where two ends of the `` protector '' meet . I am an engineer . I read the reviews about how this product actually causes punctures , but I thought it was from incorrect installation . So , I made sure I followed instructions . Common sense tells me that where two ends of this product meet , they create extra thickness . That extra thickness creates extra pressure on tube , and also there is a sharp edge of the product in exactly same area . All conditions are perfect for creating a cut in your tube.The manufacturers of such `` products '' always post reviews about their products
 Have used tire liners for for over 20 yearsOriginally used Tuffy , which were and are good.Have also used Slime liners for years , which were good and now have no positive value.Others have mentioned their sharp edges cutting tubes ... This is true - Slime liners have sharp edges on both the end and sides - these cut tubes.Also instead of being molded -LRB- rounded to the two curves of a tire -RRB- Slime liners are flat . The result is the Slime liner snakes around on the inside of the tire , sometimes going all the way down the sidewall.With a little finishing by the manufacturer -LRB- smoothing the edges , molding the shape -RRB- they would be useful . As currently sold , they cause flats .
 Ditto for me . I had the same problem as phwang . I did a search on the web and found others have too . After getting a flat in the rear tire I thought I see what I could do to prevent it . I picked up both a Slime tube and Slime Tire Liner . One thing about the Slime Tire Liner is that it is difficult to run down the center of the tire . The liner does not have an adhesive . You are relying on the tube you are installing to hold it in place . After two repeated flats with the slime liner , each with in a couple of days , I took out the Slime tire liner and noticed at one of its ends it got folded double creating a some what sharp edge . The hole was a pin hole size , much less than an eighth inch which is published by Slime to instantly patch . It did not seal the hole even with the tube outside of the tire . Exasperating ! Maybe Slime can work , but I am not a believer . It 's aggravation !
 I used a slime liner with a slime tube and I still got a flat within within two weeks of installation . Do n't waste your money .
 Take note that I discovered this manufacturer soliciting on Freelancer dot com to pay someone to write FAKE REVIEWS here on Amazon . Aside from this being terribly unethical , it undermines the value of reviews on Amazon . Do not reward those jerks by purchasing this product .
 I used to play table tennis with my dad on a regular basis and for several years played in a local table tennis club . I recently moved to a place where I have room for a table and decided to get one for me and my son to play on . This table caught my eye as it was built by what I thought was a quality company . I 've never been more let down ! I was immediately disapointed when I opened the box and found the corner to one table was chipped and the entire side rail was bent . Once I got the table set up I was even more disapointed to see how unstable the entire table was . For $ 600 I expected a lot more and will be returning this table ASAP .
 Even though this table appears to be of excellent quality so far , I rate it low because of the company support . The table arrived by truck and was unloaded by fork lift on a wood pallet . It weighed almost 300 pounds as shipped and was packaged very well and had no damage from shipping . However , there was a defect in workmanship on one of the folding legs with the wheels and the part had to be replaced to make the leg secure . When the company was called the individual that I spoke to did not want to listen to what I had to say and only wanted to know the number of the part needed to be replaced . In order to replace the part and install the new part I had to grind a rivet out and use a nut and bolt to replace it . Another nut and bolt could not be removed therefore it had to be cut off and a new nut and bolt used to replace it . I was able to do this but some individuals may not and have to hire someone to do it . The individual that I spoke to on the phone was very adamant that the rivet and bolt and nut could be removed with a phillips screw driver and hammer and used again . If that is true , I must be stupid . I have never seen a rivet that could be reused with any quality or reliability . I will have to say that the replacement part came promptly when ordered , however these parts are mirror images of each other for opposite legs and of course I received the wrong one so I just made do . It just folds in the wrong direction but it does not hurt anything . I would give the table a 4 star rating but company support a Zero .
 I personally would give this zero stars if allowed ... I received my ping pong table today only to find that there was significant damage to the side of the table . THIS WAS MY THIRD -LRB- yes , third -RRB- attempt at setting up an appointment to have the table delivered . The shipping company scheduled 2 previous appointments with me where i needed to block off 4 hours of my day only to call me the day of and tell me the table was not in their warehouse . After try # 2 , I called and they gave no good reason why they would call me to make an appointment without an actual table available for delivery . I am a patient person -LRB- so i 've been told -RRB- so gave them the benefit of the doubt but delivery attempt # 3 sealed the deal . The table is packaged up as if they are delivering you bath towels so it 's not shocking there would be damage . I am not sure why you would ship a $ 600 item with no real padding provided . Amazing . I have a note into Fogdog for a full refund but of course I need to set up another appointment with the delivery company they use ! I just hope to have this mangled table out of my garage by the new year.I 've read good things about the table itself so it 's sad to not be able to try it out . Wish I actually had the option of playing on the table . Do yourself a favor and pass completely to avoid this nightmare.Mike
 This table is listed in Amazon as an outdoor table . We learned the hard way that it is an indoor table . It got warped and the top bubbled due to moisture . Amazon has agreed to take it back , however , and change the listing for it . No where on the description from Amazon does it say it is an indoor table . As an indoor table , I 'm sure it is very good . It is easy to assemble .
 Bought the T8611 . Forget about getting it together . Poor customer service . Rude . Not helpful . Written insructions do not match the video on the site . Totally confusion . This company takes your money and runs . I lite it on fire in my backyard . RUN RUN RUN form these guys
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 I had been `` trying '' to keep from spending the big bucks , and get a GOOD low/mid priced backpack spotting scope for hunting/birding . I 've tried `` several '' - Bushnell , Tasco , Burris , BSA , Brunton , ever increasing in price ? - returned all as very unsatisfactory!Getting closer to my guided hunt date , and decided to try the Pentax PF-63 kit -LRB- I could find no user reviews ? -RRB- ? - The only pro- it was n't to heavy.Cons - It was virtually impossible to focus on anything over 30x ! The adjusting knob was way to fast ! - I 'm talking about the thickness of a hair , back & forth hoping to stop on focus!If you focused at a lower power & moved up - It would get blurry!The flimsy kit tri pod was so jerky/wobbly that if you barely touched the scope it would shake BADLY!I contacted the seller for an RMA return for refund request - Shipped it back to him , and no problem `` so-far '' ! - A month goes by , and seller still had n't refunded my money !? Called/Emailed them 4-times with scanned return receipt copy ... , and they still played dumb ! I finally had to make an Amazon A-Z refund request complaint , to get my money!I 'll never do business with this seller `` W. '' again!I bought a 15-30x 50mm Leupold Gold Ring , and went on my hunt.The rest were junk compared to the Leupold , but 30x was not strong enough to judge horns at 400yds -LRB- Leica range finder -RRB- . 50mm was n't bright enough in early morning/Late afternoon either -LRB- go 60 + mm !? -RRB- I then got the Leupold Golden Ring Spotting Scope 12-40x 60mm -LRB- not HD -RRB- , with the lightweight/solid Vanguard MARS 1 compact/hot shoe tri pod -LRB- Not OS . All the guides used solid/lightweight Vanguard tri pods , and felt they gave the best quality bang for your buck ! -RRB- Was I happy with my new Loopy ? - Nope , it 's not at all clear/sharp -LRB- the cheap scopes were better ! -RRB- , PRICEY , and 3/4 '' blurry at edge!I gave it a 1 star review!I 'm now trying the Nikon Spotting scope 16-48 x 65 ?
 I ordered this item from Webyshops listed as 3 in stock . Got an email three days later stating back ordered out of stock as of this review site stills claims three in stock . They have n't updated their site . They still have n't credited my account . Beware !
 The Slime tube sealant , i.e. the green goop that comes in bottles , works . These slime tires are a gimmick ; they only succeed in making a mess.I replaced 3 old flat bike tubes with these slime tubes , and each and every one was flat within a month.I should be more specific
 Arrived with valve problem . Too time consuming to return . The packaging and arrival time were excellent , but it would take more time to repack and return it than it is worth .
 I hate giving bad reviews - this is my first . However , when this tube burst after the first hour of my son using it , all the slime did was to make it significantly more messy to clean up . I may have overinflated , which is why I do n't give it a one or no star . Tire went dead flat and slime went over half the tube . I would 've thought the slime would function something like a run-flat . Great price , but not worth it in my opinion .
 I 'm sure this will work okay if I need to use it , but the more I looked -LRB- after I ordered it , of course -RRB- the more I wished I 'd ordered a plain tube . Some of the problems are the `` slime '' in the tube making a huge mess in some instances . I 'd rather pay a lot less & buy a couple more regular tubes .
 This tube was the one of the cheapest mistakes that I 've made . It lasted one week . Then popped . Seating this tube is tricky also , due to it 's 1.75-2 .25 size range . Save yourself time and trouble . Do not buy this tube . Get a tube that is exactly the right size for your application . Skip the Slime B.S. And do not , Whatever you do , Do not purchase from Grady 's Online hardware . I had to wait 14 days for it after purchasing .
 The camera is priced right , no doubt . But there is one thing about it that makes it not quite the bargain that it seems to be.This camera lacks an internal memory . The Bushnell packaging and their web site mention that this camera has an SD card slot . What this does not tell you is that an SD card is necessary to enable the camera to function . So , you pay for the camera , then you have to get one or more SD cards for it and a card reader , if you do n't already have these items.As far as the quality of the photos you are going to get from this unit , I do n't know yet . I have n't had it out long enough to know . But do n't buy this camera thinking it is going to work for you out of the box if you do n't already have an SD card to put in it.I do like the password feature . Once you set the password , you have to type it in to make the camera work . That 's a theft preventive !
 The features are great - internal reflector , two low power LEDs and one ` high ' power LED which does a good job for the batteries used . The lighting modes are also welcome and battery lifetime seems good -LRB- several months with perhaps 1 hour use per week day -RRB- . The bad
 I 've owned three , mounted on three different bikes . The first worked like a charm with never a problem . The other two worked fine also , until I really needed them . Moisture would shut them off leaving me caught in the rain with my taillight not working . Two days later when the switch dried out the light would be blinking in the garage . This happened on both the second and third lights . One is mounted on the wheel stay of my road bike , the other behind the headrest of my recumbent . I switched to Portland Design Danger Zone lights -LRB- uses same mounting bracket as Blinkey -RRB- on both those bikes and have had no problems since .
 The removability is a nice idea , but mine bounced off the mount after just a few uses -LRB- and because I did n't notice it until the end of my 8-mile morning commute , I never found it again -RRB- . Impressively bright , but if I get another -- and I may -- I 'll zip-tie it down .
 Beware of this light in extremely wet weather . I got caught in a very heavy extended downpour of rain and when I pulled off the road to seek shelter , I noticed that the light had packed up due to water obviously getting in through the supposed seal . Even after letting it dry out , it remained useless and I just threw it away and got a different brand . Waste of money and potentially dangerous as goodness knows how long I 'd been riding before I 'd noticed it had packed up .
 The light is bright , but has 2 major problems . 1 -RRB- as stated in other reviews the switch is very poorly designed . Most of my low light riding is early spring and fall , when I often need full finger gloves . The switch is hard to use bare fingered , impossible with gloves on . It is n't really a switch , just a marked spot on the case . Which leads to , 2 -RRB- I turned the light on yesterday when caught in light rain -LRB- wanted visibility -RRB- , reached back to my bag and pressed the switch . Apparently that was enough to open the case , because when I went to turn it off after the rain , the light was gone , all that was left was the back and the clip . For $ 25 I expect much better .
 I purchased and used one of these lights for two weeks before returning it and getting a Princeton Tec Swerve instead , making the change for one reason
 I bought this tail light because I do a lot of early morning riding in the dark and I got a new bike so I wanted a good tail light . Trouble is , the light part of it fell out of the white casing somewhere on one of my 15 mile rides only about a month after I bought it . On my older bike , I have a cheap tail light that I bought at Wal Mart about 4 years ago . Never had a problem with that one . Makes me think I wasted my money on this supposedly much better light . It 's not going to do me any good if it falls apart while I am riding . In fact , it can be dangerous . I think I have a light to make me visible to traffic behind me ... and I do n't ! Would not recommend this .
 Okay so it worked pretty good out of the box and it 's bright alright . However a month or so later I 'm barrelling down the road and turn a corner , hit a small bump and the light flies off along with a pair of eneloop aaa 's -LRB- which I never did find -RRB- . Actually most of the light flew off , part stayed on . Seems part of the plastic tabs that hold it together fractured , and I certainly never abused it . It 's as if the weight of the head with batteries alone was enough to shear the tabs off from bumps . I recovered the light and have been using it by taping the halves together with clear packing tape each time I change batteries . Every few times I have to use adhesive remover to remove the buildup or the tape wo n't stick . The switch is kind of sucky too . It just is . Get what you pay for I guess , price was right for its brightness at the time -LRB- 4 years ago -RRB- I will be merciful and give it 2 not 1 star merely because it is an effective taillight . I guess it 's not a great deal if I add the cost of $ 6 on batteries lost and tape and time to fiddle with it .
 I know its only a blinking red tail light , but I 'm really disappointed in two things
 I bought three of these things before I realized how bad the design is . I must be a slow learner.This is a fine light to keep on a coffee table to make cheap light shows in a dark room when you 're high , but it does n't work on a bicycle . The problem is that the guts -LRB- lens , bulb , and batteries -RRB- are designed to fall out any time you hit a bump or hop a curb . Have you ever ridden your bike anywhere that does n't have bumps or curbs ? Nope , me neither.All bike tail lights have two parts , a stationary park that attaches to your bike and a removable part that exposes the batteries so you can change them . The intelligent way to design a tail light is to mount the batteries in the stationary part and keep the removable part light . The hippies that designed this light went the other direction and put the batteries in the removable part , and could n't be bothered to secure this part with a screw . So if you mount this thing on a bike , one day you 'll go to turn it on and you 'll find there 's nothing there but a piece of white plastic without no batteries , no light , no switch , and no lens . If you 're forgiving , you 'll think `` OK , that was a fluke , it 's a nice light I 'll just get another one . '' And then the same thing will happen again.If you already have one of these losers , you can probably keep it from falling about by wrapping it with a zip tie , but for the price that should not be necessary . I finally wised up and got thePortland Design Works Radbot 1000 1W LED Tail Light . It 's a much better design , with the heavy stuff firmly attached to the bike and a screw to hold the removable part in place.I recently purchased another Planet Bike product that 's also poorly designed . Apparently that 's how they roll .
 I have tested countless rear bicycle tail lights . No tail light so far is without problems . Planet Bike makes very good products . To be considered a great tail light a few requirements must be met
 Planet Bike is a great company , and this is a very bright light ... but yesterday when I was biking to work , it fell apart while going down a curb . I have a rear suspension bike and the light was clipped to a soft trunk bag , the curb was a standard size and I was not going very fast . So I can not see how a much shock was transfered to the light itself . Luckily I was on the pavement so I heard the sound of the lens section and batteries hitting the parking lot.When I put the unit back together , it worked immediately . However , it is not acceptable if an important piece of safety equipment can fail in normal use , and you may not necessarily notice it . I would rather have a light that was half as bright , but I could be confident it would not fall apart hopping down a curb.The reason why it fell apart seems to be that all of the weight , including the batteries is attached to the lens part of the light . If they instead put the majority of the weight on the mounted part of the light , it would be less likely for the thing to fall apart .
 This light has a very bright flash , but the mounting system is insecure and badly needs a redesign . The first time I used this light , I added some rubber bands to hold it more securely . The second time , I forgot the rubber bands , and the light bounced out of its mounting bracket somewhere on a stretch of rough road , and I lost it . There are other strobe lights that are every bit as bright as the Super Flash with a better mechanical design . Until Planet Bike redesigns the mounting bracket , I would give this light a pass .
 I ordered 1000 chips from this company . I received two DIFFERENT styles of the same chip that did not stack up to the same height . This is a huge problem to any poker player . I spent 26 days of emails and phone calls and the problem was never fixed . Totally DISAPPOINTED and will NEVER shop here again !
 It 's a beautiful set but arrived broken . There is not enough packaging to securely transport this poker set . Considering it 's weight and size , the seller needs a lot of improvement in terms of shippng to get it to you in one piece . But hey , that 's what you get for buying a cheap toy , right ?
 Just played first night of poker with these chips and I have to say that although they look and feel nice enough , they have no grooves , so they stacks are constantly falling down . Even just ten high , your stacks will constantly be collapsing at the slightest touch . Not a good purchase at all .
 The chips in this set are fine , nice weight and design . But , the leather case does not stay open . The `` hinge '' is a piece of leather connecting the bottom to the top and it is not wide enough to let the top stay open . This means you have to hold the top open with one hand and take out the chips with the other , which is quite cumbersome .
 I ordered the 500 piece set , paid shipping on 500 piece and they sent a 300 piece set completely different than the one they advertised . They still advertise the 500 piece set on their website at the price they charged me , but wonder which they will ship to you?The chips they sent are dull and dusty , while the ones they show are bright and clear . Which ones will they ship you?Amazon should be ashamed to even allow them to promote their products through their service .
 Outside looks good . Chips are good too.The box frames inside the box broke on the second day . I had to return it .
 Did not include dealer buttons and cut cards , only chips and case .
 I followed the instructions through step four , where I allowed the tire to fully deflate . Step five is to attach the hose and install the sealant , but I could not proceed beyond attaching the hose . The sealant would not flow through , and actually ended up on parts of the wheel and on the floor . I tried clearing out the first bit of it , then shaking the bottle to mix the contents thoroughly , then removing the the tube from the tire and rim so that I could give it one last go . I gave up after fifteen minutes of trying to fix the punctured tube and decided to instead replace it with a brand new one.I 'm not sure I 'll try this again any time soon .
 I got this stuff at Wal-mart thinking it would prevent flats , but instead it caused a flat . I followed the instructions just like it said and the first ride I went out on it was flat by the time I got back . I looked at my tire and found the hole . All the slime did was ooze out like snot . I thought maybe it just needs to dry to seal it but even after a few days it is still slimy and no good . Now I have to by a whole new tire and throw out the one with the slime I just put in it . This stuff sucks . I posted a picture .
 Its a temporary fix not a permanent , I even patched my tubes and they leaked air when I left the bike stationary . It only works when wheels are spinning .
 Warning , this product does not work with Presta type tire valves . This is not stated in the description . Fine if you have Schrader valves
 This backpack seemed to have everything I wanted for a major backpacking trip
 After almost 20 years of trekking , backpacking and mountaineering , I decided to hang up my trusty mule of a pack , the Lowe Alpine Contour IV , and splurge on a comfortable load master , the Gregory 95 -LRB- large -RRB- . I packed it for a 10 trip to knock out 5 14ers -LRB- and a few 13ers -RRB- in the Sawatch Range of Colorado.When I pulled it out of the Eagle Creek XXL duffle in Denver , I noticed the plastic in the hip belt was snapped.What that meant was for the entire time we were backpacking to basecamp , my heavy load -LRB- 60 + lb -RRB- was pinched into my shoulders.I do n't know if it cracked during transit , or if I missed the crack in the store -LRB- as some other reviewers have noted that these packs often come defective -RRB- . Additionally , just through normal usage on one trip , the fabric has several rips , punctures and tears . It seems delicate . I did n't notice any stitching blow-outs , but will watch -LRB- as other reviewers have noted on different back country sites -RRB- for that since it seems to be common.I guess that they do n't make them like they used to . I have contacted Gregory and am waiting for a return authorization.In the meanwhile , for my upcoming winter trip , I am pulling out the trustworthy Lowe Alpine instead.Sadly , I had always heard that Gregory 's were the top of the line in comfort and durability , and for the price they charge , you would expect that.Be very cautious if you are looking at an extended trip with more than 40lb loads , have a backup plan in case it fails far from civilization .
 I really liked the style of the darts , but the tips were horrible and the body would not stay tight . Basically I just ended up using the flights .
 They label this Magnet as a `` Car Magnet '' and so I did n't notice that it is a foot tall ... the only way we could fit this magnet on the car is if we decided to put it on the door or hood . Saying `` car magnet '' made me think it was like those ribbon magnets you see . Also , the return policy stinks .
 It does not fit 3in PVC pipe , there is a gap that I 'm going to have to use buildup tape or something on to make this work . The wye is too small . Do n't buy this unless you have something that is adjustable to hook it up to or you will be in the same boat that I am in .
 I felt the product should be more clearly marked . For example stating that the item needs a special lithium battery , so that if the item was purchased as a gift as the one I purchased was , I could have also purchased the battery . This made for a very unpleasant Christmas for myself and the person I purchased the gift for . I can not rate this product until I purchase the battery .
 After ordering the Los Angeles Angels T-shirt , Amazon delivered a Texas Rangers t-shirt . They still show the picture for the Texas Rangers shirt , yet the description is the Los Angeles Angels . Amazon even charged me the shipping cost , even though I returned the product and requested a new one.Very unhappy customer
 I had to send this product back for an exchange , for one the product is different then her orginal exercise shorts that I ordered many years ago when they were new to her product line . The size chart was way off . I ordered a large according to the sizing chart . they were way to big and now I have to wait for an exchange , I hope the next pair fits cause I hate to pay for shipping again and again . .
 Although the overall fit is comfortable , after wearing these shorts twice I found that I could not take how hot they were to exercise in . I am giving mine away .
 I got them today and back they go today ! This item size chart is totally wrong base on measurements given !! I just got 2 pairs that I bought a few days back and I bought two since I am on a diet and I want to have an extra pair for after I loose the weight . Neither one fit . I am going to return them today . They will have a lot of returns if they do n't change those charts . I hope they are not measuring cows instead of women to take the measurements . What a waste of your clients time . Back you go !

 The Trigger Point products are very good . You would expect the video would provide a number of ways to use their products for your hips and lower back . This video fails in that regard . Very little substantive information
 i was hoping to get an in depth lecture . unfortunately , this video gives a shallow and broad overview and presents no solutions . wish there were 0 stars . save your $ .
 Good looking safety glasses better priced at $ 10 or $ 12 . I expected more for $ 24 I returned it , ca n't recommend too expensive .
 It dose not meet the requirment sory to say that.Iwant you please to review my order some of the Items I didnot recive it untill today floater eyewear yellow and adjustable Eyewear Retainer , Royal please advise .
 The shirt is ok , the material and color are ok , but the problem is that it is HUGE ! I wear XL all the time , but this one has the XL tag but is like a XXL or maybe XXXL , it is huge , I just ca n't wear this thing .

 Unfortunately , this revolving bar as received did not revolve well at all . I had to file down several metal burrs at the rotating points and lube it up with grease to make it turn semi-decently . It still `` grabs '' on occasion , which is kind of annoying at the end of a tough workout .
 I receieved this swimming suit in October 2012 and first used in early November.However , the coating started to peel off in large areas starting on Demcember 10 , 2012 . It 's only been 30 days since I started using it and that 's outrageous!I guess the product was n't designed/made for the sea water ? It was fine when I swam in fresh water in indoor swimming pool for 20 days until I went to a Cruise Trip to Bahamas for 7 days in early December . During the trip , I swam a lot in the pool and on the beach , which are both sea water -LRB- salted -RRB- . Plus , I enjoyed the hot tub for a few times with my swimming suit on.In all , I give this product 1 star just because there is no Zero star !
 As everyone else has mentioned , these suits run small . I found they run even smaller than I could have imagined . Talk about tight thighs ! I normally wear a size 30 , so I ordered a size 32 . Even these were too small to wear . I would have to wear a size 34 to be comfortable , and I was n't about to order that . I also found the material to be a little irritating . I might not notice it for a short workout , but for longer stays in the pool , it might be a bit uncomfortable . Returned these bad boys in a flash .
 I was disappointed . These are more like underwear than a swim suit . Because of other reviews , I bought a 38 '' waist when I normally wear a 36 '' . They are still too snug , especially if you want to wear something underneath for support or modesty .
 Pros : Size is about right and looks good when it was new.Cons : It only took a few weeks -LRB- 2-3 months -RRB- to discolor -LRB- balck has changed to bownish -RRB- . People is telling me they now can see through from my back .
 I have a MPL , a gift from Ameritrade , and it worked like a champ all the way until its first refill . I used some Ronson Mult-Fill butane , available at Wal-Mart , to fill it up . It sends a flame like a blow torch , unfazed by the flame setting knob . In just a couple/few uses , it is out again . It is as though something is stuck or jammed fully open . When I checked the web site for warranty instructions , they will fix it but want you to send them a $ 5 check for shipping , plus pay the shipping and insurance to get it to them . That is at least another ten dollars invested in an item that costs about $ 25 new , right ? If it is working , I give it 5 stars . However , this sinks it to 2 stars for me .
 I read the reviews which looked solid and it crapped out less than two weeks . Looked like a good watch but maybe i got a lemon . Buyer beware .
 I bought this because I was traveling through Europe and did n't want to bring a good watch.It barely made it through my 8 week trip .
 OK , you get what you pay for -LRB- if you 're lucky -RRB- but I was very disappointed as soon as I took this one out of the box . I was looking for an inexpensive replacement for the rock-solid Timex that had served me well for 15 years -LRB- until I lost it -RRB- but this Casio is not it . It looks great in the photo but looks like a toy on your wrist . Nothing about this watch suggests quality or durability .
 I have seen many of these bikes around town , and all have been in very poor working order . This bike is designed to have the looks of a nice racing bike , but has none of the technology that goes into a decent bike to make it safe and longlasting . The brake calipers are flimsy , and should not be installed on a bike that is designed for the road . Also , the wheels are cheap and easily go out of true . If you do not have the skill to true them , you will have to shell out a good percentage of the original price to get them working correctly . The handlebar is cut in half to install the shifters and then welded back together . There is a lot of force on the handlebar of a bike , from holding your weight , forces when standing , and pulling on the bar . To cut a handlebar severely damages the integrity of the part , even if it is welded back together . Now while at first I had respect GMC for making a road bike that is low cost to let people try road biking , once I saw the bike I was shocked . The bike is not safe to be ridden . I also decided to go to a wal-mart and see one of these bikes for myself . The bike was in very poor working order . The breaks were making contact with the tires , the headset was loose , the seatpost was n't tightened down , the derailleur hanger was bent in . The bottom line here is do not buy this bike , it is not safe . If you are interested in getting into road biking and think this bike is a good decision , realize that the money you will put into it to get it to work will not be worth it in the long run . You can purchase road bikes on craigslist and ebay for 200 if you look good enough for long enough . If you 're only looking to put 100 into starting road biking , then now is not the time for you to start . If you would like further info on looking for bikes or why this bike is dangerous , please contact me
 I rather recomend to expend a couple more dollars to get a better bike , i just got it and i already have to put work into it , the breaks sucks , pieces were missing , anyway , that is what you can get for a GMC i guess .
 I bought a gold one and I found out that my front wheel had some problems , my kickstand broke down , my rear brake was stuck to the wheel . I do n't know what other colors will be just DON `` T BUY THE GOLD ONE
 This is my first bike in my life and I am very happy with it . It feels smooth to ride and most importantly it costs only $ 160 . However , I do think the bike needs some tweaking before serious riding . My bike makes clicking noise when in higher gear and I can feel something is shaking a little bit inside the bike . Gear does n't shift very smoothly also , sometimes the chain just does n't move to its adjacent gear so I have to keep twisting the gear control in order for the chain to `` skip '' the gear . Does anybody have the solution to this?Since I have zero knowledge on bike , I have been googling new bike tune up tutorial and it 's actually pretty difficult to learn . So far I have tried only turning the barrel adjuster and I sort of have a feel that the problem comes from the rear derailleur . I would greatly appreciate if anyone tell me how to tune the bike.UPDATE
 Assembly was n't too bad . Once I was able to get it on the road the back tire went flat in under one mile - I 'm very disappointed .
 This was a great bike for the first two months . Unfortunately , after that it pretty much fell apart . - Month 2
 This is the first time I 've ever returned an item I bought from Amazon , and I 've bought a lot of junk in my time . Like most of the other reviewers , I was drawn to this bike by its low price and mostly positive reviews . I did n't want to spend too much because I already gave up my spring break so I could work to be able to afford a new bike . I also did n't want to spend to much because I graduate in a little over a year and do n't know where my job search will take me and do n't plan on moving very much stuff . It all seemed perfect . Then came the assembly.The tires that came with my bike were too big . The front wheel was in contact with the frame when it was straight on . I did n't even get around to inflating the tire and it was already rubbing against it ! If I turned the wheel it would come in contact with the pedals , unless they were specifically out of the way . I could n't even test ride the bike because it was n't possible . But everything did seem to be pretty low quality . I also have no idea why they positioned the brake levers where they did , I 've never seen a worse spot for them.Thankfully I am like a kid at Christmas every time I get something from Amazon so I was able to realize what a blunder of a purchase this was while I could still return it , because Amazon 's window is really short for this item . Also thankfully I will be home all day tomorrow to wait for the UPS guy to come back and pick this piece of junk back up.I really need a bike to get to work so it 's back to the drawing board.Some people seem to have no problems with this bike and love it , but I feel it is my duty to give it a one star to show it is n't necessarily all gravy . I know I 'm not willing to risk a replacement being as terrible and I 'll just take my money back and look for something better . May mean a bit more money but I need something that will actually work.The question is , are you feeling lucky punk ?
 This is the cheapest bike I have ever seen . The front brakes and front tire does not align properly . The second time I tried to take my bike out , I noticed the front tire was completely flat . I pumped it under the max PSI -LRB- 80 -RRB- and seconds later , I saw the tube come out of the side and it popped . cheap bike .
 I purchased the 48cm gold frame of this bike , and there are so many things wrong with this bike , some to the point of just plain dangerous.The wheels supplied are not the right size for the bike . I am basing this on when I was trying to assemble the bike . I noticed during assembly , the front wheel barely had enough clearance to prevent itself from hitting the bottom tube of the frame , and this was only avoided by locking the wheel onto the frame as low as possible on the vertical dropouts -LRB- which I might add is pretty damn unsafe to do -RRB- . What could not be remedied in any way though , was that the wheels would make contact with the pedals in certain positions no matter how you inserted the front wheel onto the fork . So there is the huge possibility that the wheels will clip your toes as you 're pedaling and making a turn , which is also pretty damn unsafe.Also the headstem , which is of the quill type , is utter crap , I tightened the stem as much as I could to the frame and yet it was still loose enough to the point that you could turn the handlebars without turning the front wheel with it , which is the unsafest and scariest thing about this bike . Yet tight enough that it took severe effort for me to remove the stem from the frame where the bottom piece of the quill stem proceeded to jam inside the frame.And lastly the front brakes in no way could be adjusted to effectively go around the front wheel.This bike is an immediate return for me and I can not recommend this piece of junk to anyone .
 It 's a good quality for the money you pay.Assembly is simple , but when I tried to ride it , I found that it 's not for me.To be able to reach breaks , you need to fold down.If you driving and need to break , it will take you a couple of seconds to change your hands position . It feels unsafe.I tried to turn handlebar into up position , but there you can not use breaks at all.Breaks themselves are too weak - be aware.Overall - OK bike for the racing , not for cruising.Still unused and I am looking to sell it.Somebody interested ? I am in CT. 203 * 809 * 1462
 It is what you paid for , a light frame with heavy forks and rims . The brakes , levers and derailleur 's are garbage . Same thing 's on my 7 year olds bike.I knew upgrade items would be needed , but also the shifter 's ? These are not Revos . Bottom drawer crap the Chinese replaced them with . Along with the saddle , rear derailleur and tires . These have 700 x 32c tires on it . Shall I go off roading now ? On a road bike?The rear tire has a 5 mm difference between left and right frame seating.Who ever is managing this manufacturing sight for Kent abroad is doing a piss poor job . I will probably send this back due to the poor quality issues.Schwinn is made in China , and they do it right?Guess I have to go back to to Schwinn if I want what I expect . Quality , no questions asked .
 I got the bike in a package that was partially damaged , after trying to assemble the bike which was already partially assembelled i found that the front wheel did not fit properly and rubbed against the from fork legs , this either a sizing issue or the fork legs were slighlty bent . So i returned the bike without any hassle and cancelled my order got a full refund , and bought another one from my local bike store
 Do not use this as a city bike , I know it 's cheap , but get a hybrid . It is not stable dealing with pot-holes , grass , low speeds , or aggressive drivers.Assembly directions are hilariously convoluted -LRB- though thankfully the bike itself is a joke to put together -RRB- and definitely need to be redone via the IKEA model .
 So , I bought this bike as an option to get to and from school -LRB- located in city -RRB- and other places that I wanted to be . I was excited to see the low price ; however do not be fooled by this price . I was one of those people who decided to get it even though some of the glaring bad reviews thinking they were bike snobs . They are completely right.I had to take this bike to the bike shop twice and each time the ride after I got home the gears and shifters were still messed up . They made a terrible amount of noise and it felt like the bike was dying each time I shifted when I was normally riding . Sometimes it would ghost shift and just shift by itself -LRB- when I thought I had already changed gears -RRB- . I am not a `` noob '' I went to the bike shop and had it adjusted.The shifters are in a TERRIBLE location and it takes away room from putting on things like a bike lite and computer . The shifters themselves are mountain bike style and nearly impossible to shift during a ride -LRB- they are so hard to turn -RRB- . The frame is an oddshape so it 's hard to even clip on things such as bike locks and other things that you 'll need for your bike . Not to mention this bike is about as heavy as a mountain bike . The brakes are also terrible on this bike as noted in other reviews.I would honeslty save up some money and go with a different bike -LRB- look at Diamondback Podium 1 or 2 for the best entry level bikes that are n't complete crap -RRB- . DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE . You get what you pay for and this is utter garbage . The only good thing about this bike is that it looks nice .
 O.K. Let me admit this one first
 I 'll set aside the fact that this bike is cobbled together with the cheapest and least durable of components . It 's a ` mart bike , after all . That 's to be expected . A lot of people do n't realize that bikes come in different sizes , like clothing . If you buy a bike from a reputable shop -LRB- even the cheapest of their bikes -RRB- the shop will make certain the bike fits you , or you fit the bike . That requires putting you on the proper size bike , and adjusting the seatpost and adjusting or replacing stem -- even changing the handlebar if necessary . People with wider shoulders need a wider bar . The chances of this bike fitting most people is pretty slim . Nothing will take the shine off riding like a poorly fitting bicycle . There are other options . If you learn how to determine what size bike you need , and there are plenty of online computers to help you do that , you can find a nice used bike on eBay or Craigslist . Better yet , you can look at some of the online-only bike sellers , like bikesdirect dot com or ibex bikes dot com . They have bike shop quality bikes for pretty cheap prices -- some as low at $ 300 . That 's more than the Denali but those bikes come 95 % ready to ride -- with shifting and brakes adjusted . Much better than the Denali or the Schwinns Amazon sells .
 This -LRB- medium frame -RRB- bike is not for people with small hands ! I am 5 ' 9 '' and maybe my arms or hands are short , but the brakes is difficult to reach , i can only touch it with tip of 2fingers . If I knew better I should have tried small frame or even women 's size .
 We bought this bike as a father 's day gift . Our intention was to smack a toddler seat on it for family rides . -LRB- Assumed it would be compatible -RRB- Well it 's not . We even took it to a specialty bike store to see if we could rig it somehow . But the bike does n't have the pre-drilled holes or the single bolt to anchor the seat . Other than that the bike would have been fine . -LRB- Instructions were a little difficult to understand ... need to use your own logic to put it together .
 This bike came partially assembled , however they did not even bother to include assembly instructions . The manual in the box is for the gears and other stuff . Very disappointed .
 I 've been riding for 14 years and looking back on this specific bike I can honestly say that I would never buy nor recommend it to ANYONE!The gear shifting is shotty in both the front and back . The brakes were also cheap and did n't stpo the bike they were supposed to . I 'm speaking out of experience when I say all these things because I have bought 4 of these bikes just to see if the reviews were true or not . Bottom line ... DONT BUY THIS BIKE PLEASE !
 I know I rated this bike 2 stars . I 'm specifically writing on quality compared to other road bikes in general . I do n't ride this bike ; however , when I needed repairs on my normal ~ 1,000 dollar road bike , I used one temporarily . I 'll start out by saying it 's not terrible . It 's far better than most other generic bikes , but if you want a bike to actually train on , this is n't what you 're looking for . This bike is the type of bike I would use to commute across campus probably , to get from a dorm or on campus house to the other end of a fairly large sized college campus . If you 're looking to be a cyclist , you 'll want something else though . This bike comes with a Shimano 550 groupset , this is a very low quality set , Shimano is an excellent company , but that is the poorest quality you can get from them . You can buy lower level Dawes , Windsor , and Mercier bikes for about the same price and receive better components such as a carbon fork , Shimano Sora or 2200 , which are still not high-end , but you 'll be more satisfied with them . Or you can dish out another 200 dollars and go up to Shimano Tiagra or 105 on some websites such as Bikesdirect -LRB- I 'm NOT advertising for them , they just stand out with cheaper bikes and good components -RRB- So , my ultimate conclusion on this bike is that you wo n't be absolutely disappointed with it , but you can still get better for your money .
 Its an ok bike . Good for maybe short rides definitely not a race bike ! It has pretty cheap quality gears break easy
 I am an avid Biker , I want to point this out before I go on so I dont get a lot of backlash about how i probably ride once a week etc. . I saw all the remarks on this bike so i figured what the heck and got 2 . Both are used 5 days out of 7 and each clock up around 10 miles a day . They are cleaned and checked every week . First to go was the sprocket that the chain goes around on the back wheel -LRB- on my bike -RRB- A week later the gears on both bike 's crapped the bed and now slip even on a flat road . So i called good old Kent bikes customer service in April 1800-451-5368 -LRB- remember that date -RRB- I was told 7 to 10 days on parts . Cool i put them in the repair shop and waited for the parts . In the mean time i rode an old bike from walmart -LRB- that has as a point lasted 4 years and cost me 88 bucks -RRB- After April and May went by i called Kent bikes customer service.They didnt have me on file and placed another order for parts.June and July came and went I called again to be told much the same thing -LRB- nothing here with your name on it -RRB- This time i was told to fax all my info through -LRB- yet again -RRB- So I did and this time called back to make sure all was ok with the fax . Yes 6 to 7 days for parts . Its now the end of August so i called to be told yes you are on file and we see you have been waiting since April ... however ... there is a back order -LRB- no shxx -RRB- call us back in another 6 weeks ?????? I hung up . So if you want this bike because it has a great rating go for it but be warned . If you need parts buy something else
 The bike i received was defective and the wheels were the wrong size for the frame . i could n't make a revolution of the pedals without hitting the tire with the pedal.the shifters are horrible and in a really bad location.brakes are crap.get this if you have no money and are n't worried about crashing it .
 Save your money and buy road bike from bike shop , GMC bikes are same poor quality as walmart bikes , customer service does not exist , impossible to get them on the phone they play same recorded message 24/7 . I had this bike for 8 weeks , now i have problem with bottom bracket , cheap components , not worth $ 140 paid .
 This bike is nice to look at but that is about all . The bike makes a lot of noises , it 's completely a disaster.it 's an okay bike if u are not going to bike over 40 miles . i wish i did n't invest in that bike.Was this review helpful to you ? -LRB- Report this -RRB-
 I thought it would be a decent bike to commute with , but it can not even do that . Every time I shift gears , the chain goes all crazy and shifts multiple gears at once . Also , even when simply pedaling , once in a while the pedals would skip forward which gets really annoying . Its just a hassle to ride this bike around .
 I would recommend this product for a place with a mellow weather . It snow a lot here and my bike got rust in less than a year .
 This is a good bike for the price . But one of gear in my bike aft system broke in half after 3 days of buying . It 's fine but when I called customer care they asked me to sent the onvoice and I sent it . After three days when I called them they said it got shipped . And after a week when I called stating that I did n't yet recieve it , They said they do n't have the spare for it and it will take 4 to six months to get the part . You know what tell them to shove the whole bicycle in their *** . I have bought a new gear system .
 This bike is very heavy . You can only use this bike for riding around the neighborhood and not a good bike for long distances . The components are horrible . The bike works against you if you intend to use it for commuting or racing . Not worth the price ... . Very disappointed . I found mountain bikes cheaper and lighter than this bike .
 So many things are great about this bike , which is why I did n't give it a 1 star , but I wo n't give it any more than 2 because I received a defective product.The issue is the front brake . When it came , I noticed that the front brake was assembled incorrectly . -LRB- On the back of the fork instead of the front -RRB- . I figured this was no big deal , and went to turn it around myself . When I did this , I noticed that the brake boots do n't reach the rim , and that they 're lowest setting reaches the middle of the tire . Upon further inspection I realized that the problem is with the angle at which the hole for the brake clamps was drilled . Because it was drilled at a weird upward angle , who ever assembled the bike decided that instead of wasting a frame , they would assemble the brake wrong and hope the customer did n't notice . Problem is , I ca n't turn the handle bars the way it was installed , so I have no front brakes on this bike.I really want to love this bike , but that 's a huge let down for me . If I did n't get a defective product , it would be 4 or 5 stars .
 You get what you pay for . I have had nothing but problems with this bike since I started riding it . 1st day riding both tubes blew and i had to get replaced , cost me $ 30 . Also had to upgrade the tires , they are big and not the usual skinny 700c tires you see on most road bikes . At 50 miles the chain is starting to skip while climbing hills or in 7th gear . The brake pads suck , so u will have to upgrade . The gears do n't change correctly and must be adjusted after each ride or during . The bike must be tuned up out the box nothing works right , brakes , gears , etc. . . And yes i had the bike tuned at a professional bike shop before i rode it , and its been downhill ever since . I was told all the parts to include the derailer , crankshaft , etc. . . are the cheapest shimano makes and it will cost me $ 250 to get the bike up to speed . Just make a good investment and buy a better bike with better parts . After u finish upgrading this bike and blowing tires you could have bought a $ 600 bike . Do not buy I 've only rode 50 miles so far and now i need major repairs on my drive train .
 I got the bike as I have ordered one a couple years back but the bike was horrible and with cheaper parts . When I say cheaper parts I mean cheaper parts . It was way worse then the first time I bought one . I lost out and sold it for 100 I was totally a cheaper bike than in the past . I gave up and went to buy a Giant .
 Yes the pricing on this bike for an entry level road bike looks tempting , but honestly you get what you pay for . The bike looks all shiny with stickers and such but after months on the bike it starts to fall apart HARD . as the other reviewers have mentioned brakes on this bike is terrible , but thats the least of your worries . i think the biggest problem on this bike is just poor build quality . everything will eventually break whether it be your seat , handlebars , or the craptastic gear system . also the rims on this bicycles are perfectly designed to puncture your inner tube so get ready to patch and replace the inner tubing often . To sum things up , beautiful bike terrible quality . stay far and clear .
 I 've been having problems with this bike since the first day itself . In the first dew days I had problems with the front derailleur and now both the derailleurs are malfunctioning . I 've already spent 20 bucks on it just a few days ago . It was fine for a day or two but is still giving me problems . No matter how you try to change the cable tension for the front derailleur , it just does n't work . The front derailleur does n't shift and in case it shifts the chain touches the derailleur cage and makes one hell of a noise -LRB- not due to cross chaining -RRB- . Tightening or loosening the limit screws does n't help here at all . In addition to all this the rear derailleur does n't shift and skips a few gears . The guy at the bike shop tried everything he could but it changed nothing -LRB- but it cost me $ 20 -RRB- . I 'm not sure how much more I 'll have to spend on this one . This is the first -LRB- I think its the second anyway - the first was SKS CT-Worx 20-Function Bicycle Tool -RRB- item that I regret buying on amazon.Also , I think the bike was damaged during shipping . Both my wheels were slightly bent when I got the bike . My advice to anyone would be to buy anything like a bike in a store where you can check that everything is good and functioning properly before buying it . You can even take the bike back to the store if you have problems with it just within a few days of purchase . But here on amazon there is no one to go back to and no one to blame -LRB- I ca n't even return or have a replacement for the bike -RRB- . The customer will be the one to lose his money , time and trust .
 I recently purchased this bike and was initially satisfied with the purchase ; until I rode it . Over the first 100 miles the bike became louder and louder until it sounded like an amusement park ride that had n't been greased in a few decades . I took the bike into my local bike shop and they said the rear hub was bad ... it was pretty obvious the bearing housing part was defective -LRB- bent in -RRB- . This was still within about two months of purchase . I called Kent International , the maker of the bike , and they said they would check on part availability and would call back . I got no call back . I called again the next day and was promised a call back before lunch . Two more days , no call . Then I email , no reply . Finally over a week later , after sitting on hold for 10 minutes I am told that `` they do n't have the part , sorry '' . Ever been to a hospital and they said , `` sorry , all out of doctors '' or a gas station that said , `` sorry , we do n't do gas '' ? It was absurd , I explained how a warranty is supposed to work but this seemed foreign to the woman . Eventually she promised that if I sent a picture of the defective part and a receipt I would get a part in 4-6 MONTHS if approved . What B.S. - these people sell terrible bikes and then lie on the phone to save the money it would cost them to honor their promises . I rate this DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING
 I was initially impressed with the price , look , and decent weight . After a few rides , the cheap components start to show . I am not a professional rider , or even think I will ever make it to a triathalon , however , this bike wo n't hold up past a stoll in the park . The shifters could never adjust right , skipped gears , and ever slipped the chain a few times . The tires are quite out of round and very unstable at high speeds.I enjoyed riding around with my kids , but on my own training time , this bike worried me . I have taken it back and will spend a few extra bucks to get a good upgrade .
 THE NEGATIVE
 Tire rims did not spin true right out of box . The brakes are slow to stop and are not positioned for quick easy access . You have to squeeze brakes hard to stop on hill . The tires are not thin this was the most disappointing thus not like good road bikes . All components are on the cheap side none are quick release . With this all said it is fairly priced at $ 169 . To get a good road bike you have to pay much more.I should have tried to find a good used road bike instead for the 169 I spent .
 I was very excited to receive this bike however I am forced to return it . The front derailer does n't have enough movement to select all three of the gears so you have to pick either gears 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 -LRB- so its only a 14 gear bike -RRB- . The brakes have very little stopping power so if you have to suddenly stop for oh lets say ... traffic , then prepare to meet some cars . The rear gears are n't that great either and after a couple days of riding the rear sprockets started slipping and the chain has trouble holding its place . This bike is a mass produced product with inferior parts , sometimes you luck out and everything will work together -LRB- all the 5 star ratings -RRB- but most of the time things just keep breaking / falling apart because this bike is built from a spare parts bin.Don ' t waste your time risking it , this is a DO NOT BUY . I tried to love it but I just ca n't !
 The `` low '' price reflects the additional time and money I had to spend to fix the bike , which arrived in need of repair . I could 've shipped it back , but then it was going to cost me the same to have it fixed . so , all in all , I do not recommend seller at all , the fact that I have to run around trying to fix a new bike just ruined it for me .
 Cheap bike but ok for the price . The bearings in the crank broke down within 3 weeks of buying the bike . Amazon customer service were v helpful
 I bought the bike thinking it was a great value . Tried to tune it myself , wow that was a pain to do . More difficult than any other bike I 've owned . There is no suspension and the wheels are 28 '' . The ride is EXTREMELY stiff , too stiff for me so I sold the bike shortly after I bought it . It has to do with the larger wheels and the steel frame . The aluminum in higher bikes deflects more than steel so aluminum frame bikes ARE a little softer than these steel framed bikes.I 'm 5 ' 10 '' and I think the large would have fit me better . If you 're ok with a stiff ride then go for it , the bike is a good value . Shipping was really fast too .
 UPS delivered the contents intact . The assembly is straightforward but then ... Brakes needed adjusting - this was the easy part . Both the rear and front derailleurs needed adjusting and this took a while longer . So , even with the impact of disassembly and assembly , it looks like quality control out of the factory gates is krap . It is upgradable , in the same way that with patience , Windows 95 morphed eventually into 2000 or XP which were more stable . However , given the cost of all you ` d want to change by keeping just the frame , one would do better to looks elsewhere . The ride is OK , for what you paid for the bike . Bottom line
 This bike is nice to look at but that is about all . I went on what was going to be a 40 mile drive and ended up only going about 18 since the bike broke . I can get the part for free from Kent -LRB- when I get all the hoops jumped through -RRB- but there is a special tool needed to replace the part . The bike shop wants more that the bike cost to do the repair ... So there it sits in my garage awaiting a miricle from the cycling gods .
 Not a good bicycle , makes a lot of noise . U can see and feel the joint of wheel which is not good for breaking .
 I am a beginner to road cycling and like most other people that either purchased or are considering the Denali , I didnt want to spend a lot of money on a bike not knowing if I would enjoy the sport . So I went to my local walmart and picked up a Denali . I 've ridden it for the past 2 weeks and I just do n't understand how people enjoy this bike . It is heavy , the shifting is absolutely terrible , and the hardware is very cheap . In my opinion , as well as countless other reviewers , this bike is not worth the money until after you spend money on some critical upgrades -LRB- shop tune up , new brakes , new tires , new rear derailluer -RRB- and some minor upgrades -LRB- new seat , new pedals -RRB- . After all of the upgrades , you will be down another 150-200 bucks , and you still will have a very entry level bike . you might as well spend 500 for a bike that you know will hold up , instead of 300 on a bike that has many vulnerable components.I ended up enjoying biking and truly believe that investing in a good bike is worth the money . You will be get much more out of cycling experience and it will make it that much more fun.If you expect to cycle every now and then and do n't expect to go more than a few miles , this bike may be worth it . If you plan on becoming a serous cyclist , this is not the right bike for you . I know that I will be returning my Denali tomorrow .
 I was so optimistic after reading the reviews that I went and bought the bike at Walmart for $ 159.00 . Happy with my purchase and the look of the bike , I had thought I had a great deal.Day one I rode the bike , it did sound clanky as one poster wrote but I didnt let it get to me . The brakes were weak and if your a person with small hands like I am , your going to have problems getting the brakes to really work for you because of their position . I had thought about modifying the bike to make it work better for me as I continued to ride.Day two , I rode and wanted to try out the shifting . As a shifted to 2nd gear the pedaling become hard -LRB- and I thought uh oh -RRB- so I went back to first gear and continued on . I reshifted to second then to third only to have the chain fall off , I couldnt move the pedals at all and with the poor brakes , I almost crashed . Back to Walmart it went . Good thing I took others ' advise and rode close to home to make sure nothing would go wrong . Thanks Guys!Its too bad that the bike performed so poorly . For the cost , I 'll look for a good used bike . My old bike that I used to commute 10 miles a day on , worked and sounded better than this bike and it was 15 years old when I got it . Dont waste your money .
 Do n't waste your hard earned money on this bike . I rode the bike for a few miles then I realized that I should have went to a bike shop to get a road bike . This one does not pre form the the presicion of a the Trek 1000 that I test road at my local bike shop . The Trek has it beat by at least 5 pounds and the Shimano Sora shifters work far better than the revo shifts -LRB- who puts grip shifters on a road bike anyway -RRB- . They you ca n't shift gears when you are in a aero position and the only way to brake is by being in the drop outs . Yes it cost $ 140 but it will only last a year . Spend about $ 650 and get yourself a good bike that you will be happy with .
 The bike arrived with a large scratch along the side from delivery but that was not the biggest problem . I attached the front tire and it just ran into the pedals . I 'm not sure if the wrong tires were shipped but I was very disappointed and returned the bike .
 GMC Denali Road BikePlease do n't convince yourself that you are buying an actual road bike . Rubber parts are more plastic than rubber . Cheap tires and rims . Looks great though . Aluminum frame . -LRB- Just like a beer can -RRB- . Other than the 4 dollar levers , it 's all big box junk parts with pretty paint . It 's basically a 49 dollar heap made to look like a road bike . You get what you pay for . It 's that simple . If you can justify this in your mind then you 'll get what you deserve . Landfill . A new roadbike can be had for under $ 500 . And if you maintain it , the cost will be much less than the Denali . It will have resale , NOT long gone into a recycleing bin .
 This bike is sturdy , but honestly you should n't be buying a bike off of a website unless you know what you are doing ! I made that mistake and even though this bike was right for my height , everything else did n't fit my body . Trust me , go to a store , it 's an investment that needs to be taken seriously ! I returned it within a week and went to a professional bike retailer and got fitted .
 -LRB- GMC women 's road bike -RRB- I knew that shipping would be awhile , that was n't my problem . But I did n't know it would take as long as it did . I finally got my bike , I got it 4 weeks later from a neighbor that I do n't even know . It was shipped to the wrong house and left there . Ichecked the address and it was my house , so I do n't know what happened with that . Good thing he was honest , it was at his place for a week . Second , I went to the bike shop so they can put it together . I had to pay for 2 intertubes because of a manufacturer deffect on the wheel itself ; did n't fit propperly and air kept coming out . I have n't been on the road yet , hopefully it wo n't fall apart on me . I do like how it looks if that any consolation .
 This bicycle is not worth a dime . The whole set up of the gears is not logical and difficult to manipulate and my kids did not like this bike and chose to ride their old bikes .
 I 'm not sure how anyone could give this thing a good review unless they are very inexperienced and also had n't ridden the bike much yet . Three piece handlebars ? Grip shifters on the bar flats ? 30 + lbs for a road bike ? I do n't -LRB- would n't -RRB- own one but I have repaired MANY of them . There are tons of options in bikes for the same or similar cost that destroy this piece of junk . This is n't some review based on snobbery . This `` bike '' is just a ripoff and someone should say it .
 When buying bicycle you are not only buing a bicycle , but also a service . With this bicycle you are getting NO service at all . It is simply a bad deal .
 This is the worst piece of trash I have ever bought . It was essentially like getting my money stolen .
 Broke within two months -- the bearings within the wheels -- I am trying to return or get a new one . So far I have a very bad impression
 When you pay this kind of money for a bike , you know they 're skimping somewhere . The tubes are poorly constructed , the welds are ugly , the components are bottom of the barrel . Everything will eventually fall apart on this , and if it does n't , you 're stuck with a heavy bike that you ca n't upgrade .
 I ca n't believe it ! I spent hours unpacking and assembling this bike only to discover the back wheel is totally warped ! Now I have unassembled it and stuff everything in the box to return . UPS is suppose to pick it up tomorrow but I do n't have time to wait around . If I knew I was going to have these problems I would never have ordered it . My advice , buy a bike locally unless you have nothing but time to mess around with receiving and returning faulty merchandise .
 I opted for the cheapest bike and shipping charges and i got what i ask for . The free shipping was great , but I read the shipping eta incorrect the date that was given was the shipping date , about one week from the order date was the actual day the bike was shipped . Got here pretty fast after it was shipped . So expect a two week processing and ship from order date.As i was assembling it I noticed the handle bar wrap was ripped in two different places . I used electric tape to remedy that problem . Put air in the tires rode it around felt okay and sturdy . Next day the rear tire got flat . Not the perfect bike . If you buy this bike be prepared to make some minor adjustments and repairs.Also wanted to note the weird neck and adaptor for the handle bar . Ca n't figure out why the manufacture would use an oversided neck then an adaptor . Why not just use the correct size . Well I 'm over that now . You get what you pay for .
 This bike was an aweful purchace , the pedal threads stripped out on me after only a week of riding , and i was n't even riding that hard , most of the protective plastic was shattered when it showed up and the bike never did run to strait .
 This bicycle is inexpensive , but it rides like it . It also looks cool , but that 's it . The gear-shifting system is horrible and outdated . It makes a grinding , metal-on-metal sound while riding in the lower gears . Does it look cool ? Yes . Does it need major work after market purchase ? Yes . I should have paid the extra $ 100 to get a different bike , because now I 'm stuck with a $ 159 P.O.S. I was trying to save money , and at the same time look good , but it only half worked .
 When I received the bike , it looked nice and I was excited to get it put together and out on the road . However , after taking the time to get everything attached and ready to go , I discovered some broken parts . I instead decided to send the bike back for a refund - I do n't want to deal with the possibility of another bike with issues .
 I started cycling to loose weight and I successfully lost over 60lbs in less than 3 months by riding 100 miles a week . At that time I was riding leisurely on my own and I had faced a couple of problems during that time . First , I was constantly breaking spokes on my back wheel . I can understand that though because I was 280lbs . After I got down to 230 , I was still having the same problems . One day I rode 60 miles without knowing I had broken spokes . As I was returning home my back wheel was so warp I could no longer ride . I had to walk the rest of the way home . -LRB- thank God I was only 2 miles away -RRB- . Another problem with this bike is with its brakes which are horrible . The brakes are so bad I felt like Fred Flintstone using my feet to assist me in stopping . If your are heavyset person and you get a stronger back wheel and change the brakes this bike wo n't be so bad for some one who will use if for leisurely rides and wants to save money.As I got into cycling even more I met a lot of cyclist along the way , I realize that this bike is no longer for me . I started joining group rides and realize that compared to other cyclist my Gmc Denali bike is extremely heavy . My 32 lbs bike made it harder to keep up with everyone else 20 lbs or less bike . Even though I was 230 lbs I am strong rider . Grip shifters made no sense on a road bike.So I believe that if you 're going to use this bike leisurely than at this price it 's a good deal.But later on you might be tempted to really get into cycling and then you will then realize that you need a 1500 bike .
 The bike came -LRB- of course to mount -RRB- BUT with a missing piece and I had to go buy it!Don ' t buy this bike online
 The Large Bike was way bigger than 25 '' and the brakes are horrible . Not only because you wont stop but because of their placement on the handlebars.Tube came off of rim on first ride . IT WAS NOT OVER INFLATED.I WISH I COULD REFUND THIS HORRIBLE PIECE OF JUNK BUT unfortunately some minor damage was done while I was assembling it and while i tried to fix the tube because i wanted to use bike.DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE ... NOT EVEN WORTH THE $ $ $ IT COSTS.I am very upset with this purchase and I hope you will avoid this bike .
 This is a bike of very poor quality . To begin with , the bike was received with a pierced tire tube and incorrect seatpost size -LRB- the seatpost included was too wide to fit in the hole - this was confirmed by a bike shop -RRB- . When I contacted Kent Bicycles for support , I received yet another incorrectly-sized seatpost , despite my specific instructions . Eventually , the bike shop had to order the seatpost at a cost of $ 20 . Very quickly , the front gears broke and somehow bent , making the lowest gear unavailable for use . Eventually , once other components started breaking , I contact amazon.com for a replacement , and lo and behold , the incorrect size seatpost was included . Does Kent Bicycles send out this same incorrect seatpost for all Denali bikes?Bottom Line
 I received my gmc denal road bike about a week and a half ago , the first day I received this bike the stock tubes blew out after about 20 minutes into riding , then the following day the kick stand on the bike snapped offwhen it was adjusted back up -LRB- not exagerating -RRB- , and on top of these things the chain constantly slips and the brakes are horrible even when adjusted . And when riding one day the allen nut that hold the handle bars and the fork together loosened completely and almosty made me wreck.I guess the saying is true `` you get what you pay for '' ... I highly DO NOT recommend this bike to anyone , not even a begginer it is dangerous and a number of things go wrong with these bikes . So in conclusion I had to send this bike back after not even 2 weeks of riding it !? unbelievable.Down with wal-mart bikes !
 took the bike to get it adjusted for my sons height and they spent over an hour working with the gears . Said it was a really bad gear job . It also came missing a brake pad . the company refunded us without any problem and we bought new pads .
 I have only owned this bike a month and have put a little over 400 miles on it . It has already had numerous problems so you do get what you pay for . I would only recommend buying this bike if you do n't mind putting in some work or for whatever reason you do n't want to spend any more . It will still get you around for atleast a little while . After only about 100 miles , the bottom bracket started grinding like crazy . I ended up taking it apart and found the bearing cage in the fixed cup to be in very rough shape . The fixed cup also appears to have numerous miniscule cracks . The bottom bracket used on this bike is normally only found on bikes from the 70 's and 80 's -LRB- adjustable cup -RRB- . I ended up replacing it with a 122.5 mmShimano UN55 BB Square Taper Bottom Bracket . I 'm not an expert and I have n't had time to test it out but it appears to be the right fit . After 200 miles the rear started grinding pretty badly . The hubs used on this bike are of very low quality -LRB- pressed-steel -RRB- . I usedPark Tool FR-7 Freewheel Remover for Falcon Brandto remove the freewheel and found one of the cups that contain the bearings -LRB- which I believe should be welded on -RRB- was completely loose from the rest of the hub . This causes the wheel to wobble a significant amount and makes adjusting the bearings much more difficult . I plan to epoxy it back together to get a little more life out of it . I have also replaced the handlebars with aAvenir 200 Series Rise Mountain Handlebars , Black , 640mm widebecause the narrow drop bars with shifters far from the brakes just did n't work for me . This also required new brake levers/cables and grips.I also recommend finding some new pedals because the metal on the ones it comes with are very sharp and cut my legs up a couple of times before I changed them.Some details people may wish to know : The bottom bracket is standard 68mm english thread with adjustable cup similar toPyramid Bottom Bracket Cup Set 1.37 x 24 Englishbut with a 36mm fixed cup instead of what looks like 16mmThe rear fork according to my measurements is close to 135mm spacing which is the spacing for mountain bikes and not road bikes.The freewheel on mine was produced by Sunway Group Co. and a freewheel tool for Falcon Brand freewheels was able to get it off.The handlebar stem seems to accept 31.8 mm handlebars well.The drop bars are two pieces of steel tube bolted together to allow the twist shifters to slide on from the middle . A set of aluminum plates then adapts them to the 31.8 mm stem .
 Beautiful bike , bright colors , nice design ... best price ever.I got the 26 '' version , it was too tall for me . When I climbed onmy feet were dangling . The brake pad was constantly rubbing againstwheel , even though I constantly adjusted it . The gears would stickin between shifting . I also did n't like the gear shifters , I wouldhave to take my hand off the bar to change gears.Overall it was not a comfortable ride , so I sent it back .
 This bike could n't even be put together properly . I never got the opportunity to use it , as the frame did n't fit the tired properly . I sent this bike back .
 After having my bike stolen and the transmission go out on my vehicle on the same day , I was looking for a cheap bike to get around on . This seemed to fit the bill . Within a week though , the bottom bracket -LRB- the part that the crank arms spin on -RRB- started making horrid noises . One of the pedals clicked loudly too -LRB- every rotation -RRB- , clearly a bearing problem and not a loose problem . So , I returned the bike and ordered a replacement of the same model . Second one arrives , and I have more problems with it that the first . Bottom bracket issues again , plus the rear wheel was very loose on the axle -LRB- but if I tightened it even a little more , it would n't spin -RRB- . The bike made horrid noises when I put any pressure on the crank arm . I emailed the manufacturer 's tech support , and they told me to return the bike . I did , and bought a completely different bike from a different manufacturer . Not worth the time . Yes , it was a cheap bike at $ 160 . I do n't think that my expectations of having a bike work properly for at least the first three weeks is too much to ask though . And yes , I do know how to fix my own bikes . At one point or another , I 've replaced or repaired every single part imaginable on a bike . I 'm not willing to do that with a brand new bike though .
 I 'd give it 3 stars but giving 2 to counter balance the overall rating that seems too high and mislead me into buying it.I 'll describe my situation so you see if it applies to you . I 'm in a decent shape , 1/2 marathon in just under 2 hrs runner . I decided to diversify and start biking 2 years ago . Not knowing much about bikes , I bought my first after 30 mins of surfing the web . I ended up getting a brand new Vilano bike on ebay for about $ 300 -LRB- I believe it was an ebay order fulfilled by the manufacturer -RRB- . I still do n't know who is behind this brand and how known it is but I 've seen it on amazon . I had it professionally tuned up upon receipt and enjoyed riding for 2 years without a problem.A couple of months ago I added this GMC Denali bike so my guests can ride it . It was a bit big for most my guests though , so I ended up riding it mostly . I had to learn how to adjust derailleurs as the chain kept skipping and making noises . I ride both hills with strenuous climbs and flat terrain.The good : - It works - Good price that seems to be less than the components that make it.The bad : - The speeds do n't shift very well . It has much more challenge shifting going up hill than my other bike - I do n't trust this bike to get up in the seat when I 'm climbing a hill - the chain will likely start skipping - The brakes are not very strong . - Recently , some vibration appeared from the rear wheel which I believe is due to some invisible defect on the rim . Every turn of the wheel feels like a bump especially when I pump it firmer.Conclusions : It 's not a worthy bike for me . I have gained a high esteem for only a $ 300 Vilano bike that feels almost like a $ 2-3k race bike according to my friends who tried it . I have a lot more pleasure riding it now when I have this comparison point . I think I 'm going to educate myself a bit more and look for a ~ $ 2k bike in the near future.As far as this GMC bike , I 'm going to toy around with it upgrading different parts by myself without worrying to mess it up . I have just ordered a $ 100 set of wheels and new shimano gears . Will try to replace them little by little with the help of Youtube how-to 's .
 This bike is extremely cheap and heavy . I bought one from Walmart and could only stand to ride it for about 2 days till I took it back . The components are extremely cheap , the bike is very very heavy and the brakes might as well not even be there since they are absolutely awful and dont stop anyways . Save your money and get a nice used road bike or an entry level trek or specialized bike for under 700 new .
 So my bike was defective . The wire connecting the handlebar with the front brake was too short which prevented the front wheel from turning left . A week of wrestling with it , I managed to break the screw in half and called amazon . So I give a 1 star to the product . The manual does not apply to the model being sold.Amazon customer service deserves a 5 star though . They are sending me a replacement bike , so lets see how this goes .
 I read all reviews and anticipated some problems but the price was lower than all of the others . I need a very large bike because I am all legs even though I am not tall so this bike suits my needs . It came partially assembled but the brakes are on the back of the front wheel and you can not make left or right turns , at all , without fixing it plus the lever to apply the brakes is out of reach . This might be out of my range to fix . I figured out how to tighten the brake cable before I realized this and by then I found the handle bar heavy and hard to steer plus my feet hit the front wheel even at the slight turn it could make and I wear a woman size 7 shoe . All of these problems have been written about by honest people except the one guy who blamed the customer . Well , sorry charlie , the problems are very very real . Still the price is right if you never need to actually ride the bike .
 This was my first road bike , I do n't know a thing about how to fix bikes or why things go wrong with them , therefore I was a novice . I do not recommend this to anyone in the same position . From the day I got it things were wrong . The tire would n't stay inflated . Did I say tire , sorry , I meant TIRES ! The chain comes off the gears in the rear , and like I said , I do n't have a clue why , or how to fix it . If you are not a bicycle repair professional , do n't get this bike . On the other hand if you want to spend $ 200 and learn everything there is to know about how to fix a bike , this is a great on to get .
 The sprocket on the rear hub actually broke in half . Most of the gears unscrewed from the hub . In short not worth depending upon .
 It is definitely built cheaply . I had problems with the rear gear assembly after less than a month , in the middle of a busy intersection . You get what you pay for .
 Works as a bike but there are a lot of drawbacks . The crank is already showing signs of cracking after about a year of use -LRB- I 'm not a very large fellow and unfortunately my legs lack super-human strength -RRB- and there 's a general feeling of cheapness to the bike . It works fine if you just need a riding around campus bike on the cheap but it will end up requiring work/maintenance quicker than average.The format of the handlebars and the positioning of the gear switching mechanism also limits the number of positions where you can attach a headlight.In sum , if you 're going to ride it hard it 's not going to last much more than a year or two . It was decent while it worked but now it 's sitting in the garage until I can at least replace the cracked pedal crank . I 'm too worried that it 'll snap at an inopportune time to ride it .
 I really need a watch with two time zones and a countdown timer . I like a digital and analog combination . I thought this would fit the bill . The drawbacks are that the bezel is blue and hard to see through . The digital functions are so small they are practically unreadable . Somehow I have an hourly alarm turned on and can not figure out how to turn it off . Oh , one more thing , the band pinches the hair on my arm . Too bad , good price but does not come through for me .
 Do yourself a favor and do n't EVER buy Oakley products !!! My son received these as a gift from family on his birthday . On his very first use the goggles cracked . We called Oakley and they said they were covered . They emailed all the documentation we needed to start the claim process of returning the goggles and we emailed everything back ONLY to find out that '' Your product damage was NOT CONSIDERED under warranty due to the proof of purchase being from an unauthorized dealer/seller . '' I am appalled at the level of customer service that Oakley has offered for their warranty within One year program ... but the good news is that once you pay $ 99.00 for the goggles , they have offered to repair them . Then I saw their repair invoice at the final invoice total of $ 94.76 I was even more appalled . Apparantly they think I am a bigger fool than I appear to be because they think I am going to pay for the goggles yet again ... I THINK NOT !!!!! So do yourself a favor ... DO N'T BUT OAKLEY , because in the real world , things break and if your going to pay your good hard earned money , make sure it is to a company who stands behind its product and not behind all its loopholes .
 The table arrived and we took time to setup and found that critical portions of the table to hold it together was missing . After installation , the table fell down and nearly crused one person 's leg because the rod that connects the two hinges together was missing on both the sides . It is a very shoddy effort and not at all happy for the price we paid and for the quality we expect of nearly a 600 dollar table . Need to contact the seller and get the replacement parts . very disappointing as it took 3-4 hours and then realized we cant play on that and nearly broke it due to the missing parts .
 I would like to meet the people that put this table together in 2 hours . It is not easy to assemble . After spending approximately 4 hours to assemble I removed the plastic protective cover from the table top to reveal a crack . Now that sucks.Customer service with Amazon was very cooperative in coordinating the return of the table.I believe I will be replacing this with a different product .
 Here 's what I know about this table . I ordered it well before Christmas obviously as a gift for my kids . Everything seemed to run smoothly and be as promised until I got a call from the local freight company that was to deliver it the following day . -LRB- December 21st as promised . -RRB- And I quote , `` The box is completely destroyed , parts are missing and there is obvious damage to the product . I would estimate that nearly 1/3 of the box is missing . I would strongly suggest you not accept the shipment . '' That left me in a bad position and I ended up driving to the city to find a different table in time for Christmas . So I do n't know what happened in shipping and if it was related to the how it was packed at the factory or not . I just know that the shipping is clearly problematic.If you order this table , inspect it carefully before accepting it.As a side note I was very impressed with Amazon large item customer service . They were very appologetic , offered me multiple options and in the end refunded my $ $ plus a gift card for my trouble . They handled it all in one 5 minute phone call . If I could rate them separately I would give them 5 stars !
 I have taught fishing at a camp for kids 20 + years , and have seen many children delight in the mastery of their fishing techniques . Nothing like observing a child catch their first fish all on their own , it truly is something they will remember for their lifetime ! I recently had a 2nd grader show up with this rod , and witnessed only frustration and disappointment . -LRB- The safety of this rod while fishing with a group truly came into question too , but that is another issue . -RRB- Secondly , why reduce your child 's ability to master small and large motor skills by ` copping out ' from buying the traditional rod ? Take it from my experience , buy your child a traditional rod and closed-faced reel by Zebco or Shakespeare -LRB- lots less expensive -RRB- and take the time to help them develop the motor skills to master the art of fishing . They will feel so much more accomplished when they 've experienced a good cast and caught a fish all by themselves then cheating with this tragic invention .
 Ok so I have nothing positive to say about this fishing pole . I should have bought my -LSB- ... -RSB- an adult pole for the same kind of money . Its a completely over priced hunk of junk ! I spent several hours trying and retrying to get it to work right . It would shoot then the line would tangle . The bobber failed to release the bait . It shot tops 15 feet into the water . In total we actually used it fishing -LRB- not trying to get it to work -RRB- maybe 3 shots with bait before fustration got the best of us . I recommend not wasting your money . The concept is great the pole just is n't . I 'm surprised it has n't gotten recalled yet .
 I saw a couple of little kids with these while I was fishing with my two kids . Of course , my kids thought they looked cool -LRB- they saw them on TV -RRB- and asked if they could have them . That was until they saw them in action . They launched a pathetic 15 feet maximum . Seemed like they were too difficult for the kids to `` pump '' . For the $ 30 each they cost , I bought two Shakespeare Spincasting combos that came with hooks , lures , etc. . My kids caught a dozen or more Sunnies each . The kids with these rocket rods did n't even get a bite . They were bored after about 20 minutes and left .
 My daughter was SO excited to get this , but the first time we tried to reel in the casting bullet -LRB- EXACTLY as per directions -RRB- , the line broke and was lost in the reel which I had no choice but to take apart , thinking the line would be fairly easy to recover and put back together . NO . I 'm a relatively mechanically inclined individual , and rarely do I give up on a project because I ca n't fix it , but this was a serious pain in the - neck . I suppose I could replace the reel or spend a few hours messing with it ... oh yeah , I do n't actually have a few hours to dedicate to that , so ... to the garbage it goes . Very disappointing .
 Bought this for 5-yr-old for a vacation at the lake . It casts and it 's fun to see how far it might go , but that 's where all smiles ended . It constantly tangled and the reel kept falling apart . It was a pain to keep fixing and trying to put back together . We spent more time fixing than fishing . We returned it to the store immediately upon return from our vacation . Do yourself a favor and go pick up a $ 10 theme fishing rod from Walmart that comes with a little tackle box . It will be more enjoyable for everyone .
 I also bought this for my son and it broke within the first 3 hours of using it . It was his first time fishing and he was excited . He launched it and it seemed to be fine but it would n't reel back in . Finally after 15 minutes of trying to reeling it back it , we launched it again and it did n't seem to cast out far enough so we tried reeling it back in and it just stopped . Wasting over 1hr on trying to fix the problem , we finally got fed up and just packed up our gear and left . My son was so upset , he cried the whole time wanting to fish . Thanx FOGO for making kids cry and making the parents look idiots . We 'll buy a real fishing rod .
 I purchased this for my son who loves to fish with his Grandpa after intense lobbying . My son really wanted to be able to cast on his own like the grownups . He was so excited about this product and was devastated that no one - including the grownups could get the necessary items for tackle in the `` pocket '' yet still in a position where a fish could be caught . It does cast - but there is no way to actually catch a fish with it . Do n't waste your money . - Taken Parent
 I bought two of these for my kids in an attempt to do some basic pier fishing . If you 're like me , you fish because it 's relaxing . Taking the kids brings that down a notch . Taking the kids and making them use these things ? You 'd be better served stuck in traffic or waiting on line at the DMV.Kids have a tendency to be rough on reels , but I ca n't blame them for this one . In both cases , the toy -LRB- and that 's exactly what it is -RRB- was broken inside of five minutes , with no way to repair . It 's reliant on a hokey spring and gear mechanism that never stood a chance of holding up to regular use , whether by a child or an adult . And all the tinkering in the world will never get that thing to work right again , which will disappoint your kids and leave them without gear to fish with -LRB- further disappointing them and making your trip a complete waste -RRB- . Your best bet ? Those cheap mini-fishing rods that are available in any department store , with the little plastic plug for casting practice . They 're bullet proof , do n't require a whole lot more training to use than this contraption , and they will withstand abuse , whereas this thing would just stop working even if the kids did n't knock it around.If I can save one person that aggravation , writing this review will have been worth it !
 It 's in the title . On my first try using it , the reel mechanism broke and I ca n't get it back in . It 's a hoax . DO NOT buy this fishing rod . I would rather spend time trying to fix an engine then fixing this .
 I bought two for my sons for Christmas 2007 . One of them broke on the first try of cocking the gun !!! I tried to fix it but realized that the mechanism was made of cheap plactic which had snapped in half . The other gun has continued to work fine after several outings , however , we still have not caught any fish with these . Mainly because the bullet which holds the hook has a hard time opening , and then doesnt allow the hook , bait , and weight to sink low enough to attract any fish . Dont waste your money - we pulled out a cheap rod from when I was a kid , and my kids actually preferred that !!!
 my daughters are 8 years old-this is not an item for them !!! We were all disappointed-we always go fishing , and my girls begged to have these . They shoot out about 20 feet , which is right in front of your feet , and they catch nothing !!! They do better with a rod and reel , and live bait . We have told everyone not to buy them , unless you have children who are 2 years old and want to act like they are fishing-otherwise , not worth it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I couldnt find this item ANY where but Amazon.Its all my Grandson wanted . I asked him after he had been fishing how he liked it - He said '' I dont like it '' I asked why , they arent cheep - He said '' It doesnt soot far enough '' -LRB- OH ! & Dylan is 7 yrs . old -RRB- Hope this helps ~
 I wonder how many people actually catch fish with this rod . We bought two of these at 30 bucks a pop . We have twin sons and they were so excited to use these . They shoot fine -LRB- about 15 feet ... not 30 -RRB- but the problem is with the capsule -LRB- bobber -RRB- that holds your bait . It tends to not release the hook that holds the bait . You are n't gon na catch much of anything if your hook is still inside the bobber . I was discussing the rod with a friend and she said her daughters did the same thing . Its a great idea , but it just does n't work for some reason . I think we will be returning these and getting them a plain old fishing rod . We were out for over 2 hours and no bites . Maybe because they did n't have anything to bite into .
 I bought this for my grandson . It took him about three minutes after receiving this to have a problem with the release latch . I was with him and saw he did nothing more then cast and retreive . I think it is a waste of money .
 I bought this at Wal-Mart for my 4-year-old who LOVES to fish . It 's true what the package says and that it 's not for children under 8 . As hard as he tried he was not able to cast it himself . It requires quite a bit of strength and coordination in order to cast it . And it 's heavier than a normal fishing rod so that made it more difficult for him . I still thought I 'd hold on to it for a while to give him some time and maybe he 'd get better at it but I did n't get the chance . Only after 6-7 casts the darn thing broke . I did n't even ask my husband to see if he could fix it . Back to the store it went ; we 'll stick to a regular pole and just keep doing the casting for him .
 I bought this for my 2 sons figuring it would be a fun way to have them easily cast the line and fish . Within 2 casts , the lines were impossibly tangled and they both broke apart easily when trying to repair . the hook did not properly come out of the cartridge and there is no way a fish will be caught . I feel really taken by the company that put this piece of garbage out in the marketplace . Terrible product . Please do n't waste your money like I did .
 Do n't buy it . I bought it for my 7-yr-old son . I 'm going to return mine after taking it out for the first time . It only casted out a couple times and then started tangling fish line inside , line kept breaking when casting and all kind of fishing line problem . It 's impossible to fix . I spent more time trying to fix the casting and fishing line than to actually do fishing . Old fashion fishing rod seems so make sense after all .
 I gave this 1 star because they do n't allow 0 . this thing is junk . only shoots 15 to 20 ft. the reel is very weak . me and my 4 year old used it for 2 hours and then it broke . the reel quit reeling . the bobber is too hard to get back in the shaft . whoever invented this should give money back . Please do not buy this for your kids .
 Our twins bought two of these with their own money . Neither worked as advertised . Both broke on the first outing . This toy was a big disappointment .
 i bought 2 of these and my kids love them but there to hard for them to use , they dont shoot 30 feet they are luck to go 15 feet.they are yet to get a fish on them , the bobber floats way to low in my opinion it scares the fish.they dont work as easy as they show it to!my kids are 5 & 7 ! i wish i could resale them for half the price so dont waste your money like i did !
 Well , they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it . It 's awkward to get the hook back into the `` rocket '' once the bait is on . I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod . We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current . I 've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money . If you 're going to take a little one out fishing , just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up . The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA . -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I bought two of these for my sons because they were excited by the TV ads and believed that expert-fisherman Roland Martin represented true quality . The rods never worked . The lines snapped before we shot the rods for the first time . I spent an hour putting them back together . Next , pump and shoot mechanisms did not work . I spent hours fiddling with the rods and only cast them 1 or 2 times . The fishing line weight was very light and snapped easily . The mechanics of the rod made it difficult to re-string . My experience was the same with both rods.After my one very unsuccessful outing , I started working on getting a refund . I emailed Spin Master 's Customer Service -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- only to hear `` We are sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the product you purchased . Your feedback is always appreciated ... '' Really ?!? I asked for a refund . There was no mention of a product return policy . They did send a phone number where they told me that you can get a replacement within 30 days with the bar code from the back . Lessons learned
 I purchase 2 of these fishing lines , and my kids where so exicited to get them , but within the 1st day they where both broken and they never even used them . Would not recommened to purchase .
 My wife found it on sale for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- -- which , in retrospect , should have been a clue . It took about five casts for a three year old who loves fishing to see that this is a sorry piece of junk . This is a great way to thoroughly disappoint a child.I have five children , from three to twenty-three , and they all love to go fishing . We fish in ponds , canals , and from our boat - for everything from grouper to bass . Fishing is a great way to spend some quality time with your kids , but do n't waste your money on this thing.The problems with this are legion . It will definitely launch the `` safety bobber '' a respectable distance , but you must tie your hook directly to the six pound test line -LRB- no way to use any type leader -RRB- , you are limited to using one split shot weight , and you must pack the hook , weight and bait inside the safety bobber . Even using just a small piece of shrimp , we found that it would n't usually deploy properly which leaves the child `` fishing '' with his bait stuck inside the plastic float.Stay away from weeds , stumps or anything else that could cause a snag -- in other words , all the good places that fish hang out where you would normally try to get bait to . If you get hung up , you have to replace the entire contraption -LRB- at about -LSB- ... -RSB- each -RRB- which will take some time , especially if you break the line above that little `` line stop '' that the entire system depends upon.If you do manage to hook a fish with this thing -LRB- which is probably a rare event -RRB- , it better be a very small fish . You have no way to `` play '' a fish with this toy bazooka , and six pound test line wo n't let you force the fish out of weeds and such , so a fish of any size would be likely to tangle you up.Note that they tell you this is not for young children . The fact is , this is a child 's toy , that only a young child will be interested in , but it is not safe for them . They must have the age warning because it would be easy to seriously hurt someone if you shot them in the face with this . -LSB- ... -RSB- My three year old was completely taken by the commercials to the point that we had to let him try it . We took him out on the boat to a place where he could `` cast '' without worry about getting tangled up -LRB- and we could simply go retrieve it if he did -RRB- . I literally had a boat load of children -LRB- most of mine , and some of their friends -RRB- , and it pained me to see the little guy so disappointed , but sometimes you must let them see and do for themselves.I remember his PR fiasco when Roland Martin declined the Make-A-Wish Foundation 's request to take a terminally ill child fishing , so I do n't know why I would expect more from him than to lend his name to this . How do you target children , and parents who do n't know better.What kind of person disappoints children for a living?Bill E. BranscumNaples , Floridawww.MrMoms.org
 My child had a little bit of fun with this fishing rod but it did n't last long . Has plastic gears and if the line gets snagged and breaks it might get tangled up inside and no way to get in it to untangle it . The bobbers are hard to find so order extras for yours . Overall is a great concept but not really made heavy duty for kid play .
 What a pain to work with . Bought it for my seven year old daughter , and she used it once before it broke .
 I know kids are hard on things but do n't you take that into account when you design something for them . I bought three rods -LRB- over $ -LSB- ... -RSB- total -RRB- and each one them broke down within one hour of using them .
 I purchased two of these . One for an eight year old and the other a ten year old . These things are garbage and we actually just gave up exchanging them and they have been sitting in the garage collecting dust ever since . The lines constantly get tangled and they do not stay working for more than a few casts . I would highly suggest that you look at something different for your children .
 The rod itself feels cheaply made , all plastic , but I guess that 's to be expected with a TOY like this . And yes , the safety button is an issue for smaller kids . But the biggest problem comes when the line tangles inside the reel , and believe me , it will happen . Incredibly time consuming to try and resolve the issue to get your child fishing again , and that 's IF you can figure out how to make it work . Good/fun concept , horrible execution . You 've been warned ...
 My grandson brought his Rocket Fishing Rods , still in its packaging , over to my house . While I was reading the back of the packing , I came , across a note telling kids to wash their hands after use because of lead content . This piece of crap came from China -LRB- where else would it come from but , China -RRB- . The safety commission is n't doing their job well , the shipment should n't have gotten past the loading dock inspection center . Because of the lead content , this fishing rod should be recalled .
 This was a birthday gift for my 6 year old son . It 's junk . It does n't work most of the time and has ruined two fishing trips with grandpa . He was completely excited and prepared to go out and use this new fishing pole . When they struggled to get it to work Pappaw tried to convince him to use his fishing rod . Needless to say the meltdown ensued because he REALLY wanted to use this one . Trust me - if you have kids you know exactly what I 'm talking about.Don ' t waste your money or time on this product .
 Not for fishing ... honestly is a piece of junk . Cheap line , shoots short distance and the bobber and hook setup is just not going to attract fish .
 Got 1 launch from this piece of crap . Thank goodness amazon.com did n't give me any problems returning it . The biggest waste of time and money . Major disappointment giving this `` must have '' to my kids , only to have to return it . Do n't waste your time!I had to give it 1 star because it would n't let me give it a negative mark ... which is what it deserves .
 We bought this fishing rod for our 5 year old today . We threw it away within 2 hours . Not only did it hardly work if was too hard for an adult to use much less a kid . It is cheaply made -LRB- the telescoping rod broke almost immediately -RRB- and complete waste of money . I would have returned it to the store but it was n't even worth the gas to drive it back ! It was extremely difficult and does n't even open up when it hit the water making it IMPOSSIBLE to catch any fish . Do not spend a dime on this ridiculous product !
 My son got this for a 5th birthday present last year from his grandpa . Last fall he had trouble cocking it , but could shoot , reel , etc. . Like others mentioned you do have to add a little split shot weight to the hook to get it to actually open up the bobber and sink down . My son sees me fishing a topwater plug and wants to do the same thing with his rocket rod , so half the time there 's nothing on the hook and he 's just shooting out and reeling in . As long as he 's having fun , I could n't care less!After a few uses , the reel got completely backlashed . I have no idea how this happened , but it was a real PITA to dismantle the thing to the point that the line could be fixed . After that , it was operation as normal.The rod was n't used over the winter and we just broke it out last weekend . After a few casts , the large button/lid that you press to make it shoot snapped off and fell in the lake , never to be seen again . I 'm not having a ton of luck finding replacement parts either .
 Watch worked OK while it worked , but stopped reading Heart Rate after just a couple of months . Cost about $ 50 for the watch , but they want $ 30 for a warranty repair . I got a new watch with more funtionality than theirs from SportLine for less than $ 30 .
 Bought this in May , used it daily and after 2 months it stopped reading my pulse , when it did , it showed my pulse at 200 + beats per minute . Sure that is possible , but not when I am just about to begin my workout . Also , when it reads those high #s , at the end of the session , no matter how long , I always manage to burn 4999 calories . I had a MIO previously , not the same style and that did the same thing also . BEWARE OF THESE MIO HEART RATE WATCHES .
 Do n't buy this asa a heart rate monitor . Although I understand this is not an expensive , high end model ; it does not perform like it should . It takes 10 + seconds to register if it registers a heart rate at all . Half the time it registers a rate that is so obviously wrong that I stopped using it completely . This is not worth the $ .
 I 've been through two of these watches in the past 18 months . The first on quit after about a year . MIO took it back and replaced the battery , but kept it for over a month . I bought a second one while waiting for that one to come back . First one lasted another two months then stopped reading heart rate.Second one lasted about 8 months , needed battery replacement three times . Changed the battery again yesterday ... now it will read once , then quits . I 've ordered a Suunto ...
 This heart rate monitor boasts no chest strap required . However , to read your heart rate you have to hold your fingers on those two silver buttons in order to get a HR readout . This is totally impractical while exercising . I was very disappointed with my purchase . This unit is more like a watch that will measure your heart rate when your so inclined to hold your fingers on the two buttons for several seconds . Buyer beware !
 The watch looks cool , and sits well on my wrist.You have to be absolutely still when trying to measure the pulse otherwise 9 out of 10 times the watch wo n't give a reading at all or give an astronomically high pulse reading -LRB- usually 212 -RRB- . When exercising , getting still enough for the monitor to work is practically impossible and by the time you have , you 've slipped out of your groove.Great though for checking your pulse when sitting in the office.The watch is advertised as being able to give a pulse reading in the water , however it does n't work when it is on my wrist or is wet . That means when I 'm sweating , or swimming , no go . More or less useless for sport.Today , while swimming , my arm collided with the head of the person coming in the other direction , and ... . the watch broke . The other swimmers head is still intact . Good riddance to a watch that was garbage to begin with .
 This product was great when it worked but unfortunately , it stopped working after a week and a half . After a week the watch settings went back to the default settings , after 3 days of this , I returned it.I tried to exchange it but it is no longer sold by Amazon .
 Return it for a refund ... . it worked correctly about 10 % of the time ... Bought one at Walmart that works much better .
 I purchased this watch based on the decent rating on Amazon . But this watch is very temperamental and frustrating , and I found it very difficult to get an accurate reading most of the time . It might be functional enough for someone wanting to get their resting heart rate sitting down , but I would not recommend this watch to people who want to measure their heart during workouts .
 I received this as a Christmas gift . It was ordered off amazon and mailed directly from the company to me . The package not only had been opened , the watch inside is not the one ordered or even the one shown on the box . The instruction book was not included . The watch I did receive seems like a good one and works quite nicely . I just expect to get what is ordered , new , and the package to contain what it 's suppose to . Despite the fact that I do like the watch I did receive , I doubt I 'll ever order or add another Mio product to my wishlist .
 This is my second Mio Heart Rate Monitor Watch , in 4 months . The first one failed in one week . No light , no heart rate . Then it went blank . I asked for an exchange thinking it was just a bad battery . Sitting on the shelf , these things happen . Well I got ` new ' one . This time a Mio Sport . And as of today 12/20 , it is starting to fail again . None of the buttons seem to work now . The light has failed , and it has the wrong time . I think I am done . There is no excessive use , and this watch has failed me twice . I really do not want to invite a third time .
 I purchased the watch because I did n't want a chest-strap heart-rate monitor . I 've only successfully measured heart rates in the range 40-90 bpm ; higher than that it has always failed . It goes into the `` checking heart rate '' mode and sits there for up to a full minute without displaying . Besides that , the heart rate monitor buttons are incredibly awkward to use.I give it 2 stars because it is acceptable as a stopwatch and is not too bulky .
 I had high hopes for this heartrate monitor and I was let down . The monitor only returns a heartrate about 50 % of the time when I am in the middle of an intense cardio workout - this is when I need it the most ! When I am not working out , the monitor returns a heartrate 100 % of the time . This makes the monitor virtually useless to me . It seems to work better when my wife uses it but even she has experienced the same issue . I am back on the market for a monitor w/a chest strap . They may be bulky and somewhat uncomfortable but at least they work .
 This heart rate monitor is convenience when working ; however , just as stated by other reviews , it does not work when one is moving around and temperamental even when one remains still . The watch has a small display area and will only display one thing at a time . For instance , you have to press a button to see the date when it 's in the time display window.My watch stopped working after just a month . It took Mio support several days to respond to my email . Mio wanted me to mail in for repair and also wanted $ 12 to cover their `` fee '' . I 've lost faith in their products and services and will not buy Mio again .
 this table took me about 2-3 hours to assemble . quality is OK . I like the idea of not removing the nets and post while in folding state.But the laminate surface really give very bad bounce for the ball . I just roughly measured the bounce of the ball free falling , it 's on very low end or not meeting the standard I got from internet . I wanted to return it the next day after I tried . I did n't return it only because it 's too much headache to de-assemble everything and put it back to the boxes.I would n't recommend it if you really love to play table tennis . The low bounce really take a lot of fun away from playing .
 I bought this item based on reviews and advertised quality . Sorry to report that the thing lasted me less than a year . I 'm a hobbyist gunsmith/tinkerer , and although I did use it 3 to 5 times a week , I never abused it . It just came apart . I bought another brand that was a little more exspensive , but I have n't had a lick of trouble with it . Just my opinion of course , but I would look at other brands before this one .
 Looks good in pictures but it was a waste of money . The front gripping device kept falling off the stand . No matter how much I tightened the bolt it would fall off . Almost dropped my AR on the floor .
 I bought the thinking it would help me out well ; when you go to adjust it it does n't work right . The clamps suck .
 Pros : Size is about right and looks good when it was new.Cons : It only took a few weeks -LRB- 2-3 months -RRB- to discolor -LRB- balck has changed to bownish -RRB- . People is telling me they now can see through from my back .
 I receieved this swimming suit in October 2012 and first used in early November.However , the coating started to peel off in large areas starting on Demcember 10 , 2012 . It 's only been 30 days since I started using it and that 's outrageous!I guess the product was n't designed/made for the sea water ? It was fine when I swam in fresh water in indoor swimming pool for 20 days until I went to a Cruise Trip to Bahamas for 7 days in early December . During the trip , I swam a lot in the pool and on the beach , which are both sea water -LRB- salted -RRB- . Plus , I enjoyed the hot tub for a few times with my swimming suit on.In all , I give this product 1 star just because there is no Zero star !
 As everyone else has mentioned , these suits run small . I found they run even smaller than I could have imagined . Talk about tight thighs ! I normally wear a size 30 , so I ordered a size 32 . Even these were too small to wear . I would have to wear a size 34 to be comfortable , and I was n't about to order that . I also found the material to be a little irritating . I might not notice it for a short workout , but for longer stays in the pool , it might be a bit uncomfortable . Returned these bad boys in a flash .
 I was disappointed . These are more like underwear than a swim suit . Because of other reviews , I bought a 38 '' waist when I normally wear a 36 '' . They are still too snug , especially if you want to wear something underneath for support or modesty .
 To me this watch just has to many functions and is way to confusing to set them all up . I would not purchase this watch again .
 This watch was not worth what I paid for it . The quality is poor and it shows . I would have returned had it not been such a hassle to .
 I have owned several casio watches , and from the reviews I decided to order this one . - It looks nice and feels good to wear . - Unfortunately , I have found it to be quite irritating to use . - It keep changing between the modes -LRB- maybe too sensitive buttons ? -RRB- . - Very often the compass-mode -LRB- which I have no use for -RRB- is the one in the display . More problematic is the fact that the watch has dual time and when mode switches to the alternative time display , the other buttons will easily adjust the time with plus/minus 15 minutes . - Now when I think I am looking at the real time I am actually looking at the alternative time without being aware of this . - This has caused me to miss appointments/transportation . - I have found no way to turn of compass and dual time , and for me this makes this watch unusable . - I will trhow it away .
 Probably the best thing about this watch is the look . It does n't appear as an inexpensive watch . It is very thick - very very thick - almost 1/2 an inch . Not sure why that is.It 's got all the std features of a digital want and a `` bearing mode '' , which is not a digital compass.The tide/moon graph is fairly worthless . You can tell if you are at low , high , or in between somewhere . Plus is very hard to read without holding up to your eye or turning the light on.I 'm sending mine back - you will too if you really need the tide info .
 Too big and heavy for what it is . Weighs twice as much as my leatherman and now that I think about it ... the only exclusive and practical functionality it has is a fork . I say that because anyone traveling with this is also traveling with a knife in some sort of multi tool , and almost anything requiring a spoon can simply be drank from the container.Now that I have it and tried it - its going to the thrift store . I 'll just carry a small fork in a handkerchief .
 The item I ordered did not arrive within the estimated arrival date originally given to me . When I emailed the seller , they stated they would respond within 24 hours and that did not happen either . Disappointing . This wo n't hinder my Amazon shopping , just from this seller .
 I received the defective wheel . I tried to contact the sell , Niagara Cycle Works , several times . However , I never got any response . I will not buy anything from Niagara Cycle Works .
 it worked but is just cheap . bearings are not the best you can feel it when u spin it but for the price it worked fine
 After one week of normal wearing part of the molded watch which holds the pin securing the strap broke completely off . The watch is poor quality and would not recommend .
 Extreamly tedious to set . Ok , impossible . You receive a 40 page instruction booklet -LRB- you will need a magnifying glass -RRB- . Good luck with that one . It has an easy to read face for the time . That 's it . Date too small to easily read . Has three or four buttons , each seem to do 50 different functions . Who can figure out what ? The alarm
 While the watch worked perfectly for several months , the plastic hinge connecting the strap to the watch broke for no apparent reason . As the watch only cost $ 15 , it did n't pay to make a warranty claim .
 After one use , the plastic handlebar mount was chewed up by the screws . The bag seems great otherwise but it needs more durable hardware . I wish I had spent more money on a better quality product .
 Although Topeak is a reputable name among recreational bikers , this particular bag has a problem slipping and flopping around . It was next to impossible to get it stationary on the handlebars , which made the map compartment an unusable feature .
 Great Bench ; however do n't buy from J&M ; !!! Terrible customer service the bench they sent me was obviously used and they refused to exchange the bench for a new one . Buyer beware is very true with J&M ; !
 I bought this watch and about a week after I bought it started to get scratches all over the face . Then only about a month later the watch started randomly stopping and ticking backwards . Do n't buy this watch , it 's not worth it .
 I bought this watch a year ago assuming that Casio would still have a decent level of quality at a low price point . I only wanted something that was waterproof and somewhat durable . The 10-year battery was a bonus that pushed me to buy it.I can not recommend this watch because it fails in the most basic , necessary function -- the watch loses time . In other words , the quartz movement that drives the analog watch is off , so that within one day the watch can lose 20 minutes . That 's just too much to be off for such a short period , even at a low price.I will not buy another cheap Casio watch . For that matter , I will probably pony up at least $ 40-50 instead to get a watch that is accurate and will last instead of a piece of junk like this one . And similar to others , the plastic face does get scratched up pretty easily if you do anything outdoors related .
 0 stars if I could mine came with a dead battery . Straight to the trash can .
 Nice little watch but the glass is not mineral , it is poor quality plastic and scratches easily .
 Bought it as a work watch , and I broke off the pin within a week . For it 's price , I would buy it again . But , I 'm not .
 I have owned 2 of these Hakama for Aikido training . I bought the first one about 4 years ago . In less than a year of training the seam connecting the bottom right side of the koshita separated . I repaired it myself . A few months later the same seam , this time on the left bottom side of the koshita , separated . I repaired it myself . Months later , seams on the himo began to separate . I have a cheap $ 25 spare hakama that held up much better.I thought I was just rough on my hakama , until I recently purchased another one of these . I had the hakama for less than 10 hours of training when the seam at the bottom of the koshita separated . I sent an e-mail to returns@e-bogu.com approximately 2 weeks ago asking for a refund for this failed hakama . I have not received a response.The only positive I can say is that I liked the feel of the material . The downside of the material is that it did n't retain the pleats as well as I would like , regardless of how carefully I folded it .
 The description states that the boat will fit 4 people . Sure , if you are 3 feet tall . The boat is comfortable for one adult and maybe a child.Additionally , this boat has the most ill designed `` 4 drain plugs '' which unplugged after one person sits in the boat . Will it kill you . No . But you will get wet in a few inches of water.We went to Yosemite and had to get out of the boat after 4 minutes -LRB- we drove 3 hours to get there -RRB- as my backside was soaking wet / freezing in water.I am giving 1 star . If you are tropic and do n't mind getting wet & you will be boating by yourself - Go ahead . Otherwise . Do n't bother ...
 this thing sucks ... it busted on me ... its not a strong materialand it sis slow ... better buy a speed air pump
 Cheaply made through and through . Any little bit of tension and the hex nuts spin through the cheap plastic used . Also the metal snap pulled through the light nylon strap on the second use . I added flat and lockwashers to fix the mounting problem and luckily had some decent nylon webbing in the shop and made the strap in the fashion it should have been from the factory . Whatever happened to Taylor Made ? They were never top of the line , but really now ... Do n't bother with this mount !
 this shirt came out of the dryer fit for a barbie doll : - -LRB-
 Initially a great watch , exactly what I was looking for.In the entire year that I owned it not a problem ... and then I dropped it . I was putting it on my wrist so it fell from a height of 3-4 feet and landed on its face . I did n't notice at first but the next time I checked the time it was off because the seconds hand had fallend off the center and was just floating around inside , blocking the other hands from moving.Real nice , a tactical watch that ca n't handle a 4 foot fall . Do n't bother with this one .
 i 've owned hundreds of watches of every sort , but this a first . i bought this watch to swim in as it is rated as a 200 meter water resistant watch and the inside of the crystal is fogged after the first time in the pool . my 10 dollar casio that is minimally water resistant has been in both the pool and the ocean many times without issue . this is a pretty disgraceful product . it was very cheap for its spec , so i took a chance that it would work out . nope!btw , it 's a wonder a company like smith & wesson would tarnish itself by having their name put on something like this

 I bought this `` recharchable '' air horn because I liked the idea of being able to re-use it . In fact , on a full charge I get about 30-seconds of air , which in my opion is not nearly enuf . Do n't purchase !
 sucks , the pads are too bulky and its not the snap like it shows in the picture . it does not contour to the knee . waste of money .
 I bought this watch as a back-up when surfing . It supposedly has a 10 yr battery and is water resistant to 330 feet . I purchased it in July 2010 and I used it once or twice and noticed the time was off . I set the time and checked it a couple more times . It worked intermittently . I read the warranty from the Casio website and this appeared to be a manufacturer 's defect since I had n't done anything to it that should have damaged it or voided the warranty . I shipped it to the Casio service center in NJ for repair or replacement . I received an estimation letter indicating it was out of warranty and it would cost me almost as much to repair and return it as it was for the original purchase through Amazon . Needless to say , I 've deemed this watch far too low of quality to justify spending any more money on it and this experience will definitely affect my choice in purchasing watches . Fortunately , there is a plethora of manufacturers that make low to mid-range sports watches so I wo n't have to only deal with Casio .
 I got the watch because of the 10 year battery.The battery is fine but the watch never worked , I found out this because I had to carry it to be serviced .
 This is a very nice inexpensive watch using atomic time , but is impossible to set or change time zones and if you ever try without the directions , you are lost permanently . I am a college graduate and was on vacation , when I wanted to change time zones . I was not able to find anything about this watch to be intuitive . I could not google any help . When I arrived home , I found the watch was not receiving the signal and had to send it back so they could reset it . Not too convenient .
 I liked this watch because of its size and the resin band so I would n't have to take it off in the shower . Worked fine for two months then stopped . It acts like a dead battery , although the battery was rated for ten years , not for two monhts . I think it is a dead battery because when I advance the minute hand it starts going for another minute or two , then stops .
 Good watch but the band did not hold up . The band broke within a month . Now I am having trouble buying a new band because it is not a standard width band . I found one on amazon but the price of the band is almost as much as the watch.CASIO Men 's MW600F-4AV 10-Year Battery Sport Watch
 Bought a pair of these lights , installed them on my deck boat and have already broken the housing on one of the lights . This makes twice -- but at least it was a different light . Will buy the metal `` cased '' lights for my repalcement . Very flimsy/plastic mounting and housing . Will not purchase again .
 The plastic base that attaches to the metal base is very cheap and broke with must minimal movement of the light forward . Do not waste your money on these lights .
 Least expensive racquet string I 've ever bought . Poorest performing string I 've ever tried . Thick in the grommets and heavy . Actually increased racquet weight by .15 oz . Boardy and non responsive by itself at 60 lb . Notched easily as a cross with poly . Use only for people who ca n't tell one string from another . Do n't know about durability cut it out after one session . Very soft easy to string .
 I bought these hand wraps to use under my gloves and at first they were great , but after 2 weeks use , the knuckle area started to split and now they 're kind of falling apart . Even with proper use , they are n't very durable ; I do n't recommend them . I think I would have been better off if I bought traditional hand wraps instead of these frail things .
 I wish I could say that these are awesome but I could n't even get them on . I have small hands . I am 5 4 and my pinky barley comes out of my mma gloves . I was hopng smalls would be perfect . Well these things were tiny . For a very young adult at best . O well .
 In 2 weeks 2 pairs of gloves were destroyed by amateur boxers !!! Waste of $ 40 . Better products out there !!
 i put these gloves on and threw a few punches maybe 8 or 10 on the bag and when i took them off the thread from the finger area came apart an the middle finger was torn ... i also hurt my wrist because there is zero support . . these gloves just look nice they are bad for training .
 These in fact are intended to be used as bag gloves . If it was only a quick `` wrap '' , there would n't be any gel in the knuckles . Once your hand is in this glove , it can not fit into a standard boxing glove.This glove has half fingers which have elastic at the ends . The elastic is so tight that it cuts off your circulation in each finger and is useless . Otherwise , this is a good glove and provides good wrist support , but will wear out quickly.I 've used the Harbinger brand gloves for years , with absolutely no problems or injuries . Although Harbinger WristWrap Bag Gloves are twice the cost , the Harbinger are far superior.Harbinger 320 Bag Glove WristWrap -LRB- Black -RRB- Since these are one of the most important pieces of equipment that you will have , do n't compromise .
 I was so excited to receive this item . I paid for 2 day shipping . I got it and the first time I tried to put them on the mesh on the top of the glove tore at the seam . My hands are large , but not huge and these are the XL size . They do n't have a larger size . The gel was nice when I was hitting the bag with them so if your hands are smaller and you wo n't have to work hard to put them on , it might be a nice purchase .
 Used these one time , and silicone gel beads were leaking out of the gloves . they fit well , and provided good cushion for your hands , but I do n't know how long that will last if it is leaking after the first use .
 The item I received was a different model then the one I thought I was getting . Which resulted in the gloves not fitting because they were too small in that particular model , while the model I ordered would have fit me perfectly -LRB- because I tried them on at a store -RRB- Other than that , the package arrived on time , and the return was easy .
 I used these gloves once under my boxing gloves and the gel beads started to leak . After just one use ! Bad quality .
 They look like they would work nice for my needs but they are way too small . I got them for me to use but they wo n't even fit my wife who has much smaller hands than I do . For the price I paid for them it is not worth paying return shipping to get my purchase price back so I will give them to a child that can use them .
 I bought these to wear under my heavy gloves as a replacement for my regular wraps to make transitioning from my class 's warm-up -LRB- which often includes playing catch with a medicine ball so wraps get in the way -RRB- to our heavy bag work easier . These do n't hold a candle to plain old wraps that cost a heck of a lot less . They give absolutely no support to my wrists or the small bones of my hands . Just not enough material . The gel seems to me to be more `` cute '' than anything . A couple of wraps around my knuckles with my old wraps seem to offer as much if not more protection . To top it off I 've been using them two or three times a week for a month and the mesh next to both thumbs has already ripped through . I guess I just need to get more efficient at wrapping my hands with traditional wraps during transitions .
 I use these as gloves -LRB- I know they are not -RRB- for a kickboxing class and they are very comfortable - so that is not my problem . The problem is that after a month they stink so bad that I ca n't get the stink out ! Washing does n't even help .
 I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought these wraps this week . I 've used them three times for moderate work on a heavy bag and they are already coming apart along the knuckles . I figure they may last another 2-3 weeks before I have to toss them .
 Cut of the circulation in a couple fingers -LRB- no , they were not too small -RRB- , and came apart at the seams almost immediately .
 Used these once with Torso Bob and the sewing around the knuckles started coming apart . The gel inside started falling out . I would not buy these , horrible quality .
 If using these as stand-alone MMA gloves
 WAAAAAAAAAY Too small im 14 yrs old i ordered a small and after wearing thm for 5 minutes the annoyance of them was so great i just used bear hands on my heavybag . Also after wearing them for 5 minutes they started to rip soooo ... dont buy them just get cotton hand wraps or an XXXL . only redeeming quality is they protect really well.Everlast Hand Wraps
 I purchased these Everlast Evergel Hand Wraps as an alternative to rolling and un-rolling hand wraps , but I learned that these do not do a very good job at providing the right support and stability needed to hit the bags or spar . I went back to using good old hand wraps to do the job . I would n't reccommend this item over traditional hand wraps .
 Had these gloves a few years ago so the newer productions might be better . However , when I had them , the stitching came apart after only a few uses so the padding started to detach from the glove . Also , the fit was just weird since those elastic bands across the back of the hands were completely useless . I suppose they were designed so you do n't hyper-extend your fist when you make poor contact . But they did n't even do that . I am going to say that the glove part itself felt fine but I ca n't say that softer or more comfortable material is terribly high on my list of criteria for bag gloves .
 I bought these gloves for my Krav Maga class because they allow me to better grip my opponent . However , they do not protect the fingers enough and I stopped using them due to this -LRB- I was coming out of class with my hands torn and bleeding -RRB- . Also the palms gave out fairly quick with little bits of material falling off all through class which I found annoying .
 Reading the description makes it very clear these are good gloves , however nowhere does it specify they are for a woman . It was n't until i realized they also sell them in pink that they are girls gloves , and naturally did not fit when they arrived .
 I never received these . I 'm sure they are great but between the company that sold these to me , and Amazon , I got nowhere with any of them . It was like throwing $ 20 away just because of the frustration of not getting anywhere .
 I ordered the black version on Jan. 8th ; it 's Jan. 21st and when I called they said the order was lost in the mail , they could n't track it . Amazon said they would replace it , sending it via 1-day service.Then I get an e-mail saying 1-day service does n't apply to PO Boxes ... the customer service rep could n't have said that on the phone and given me the chance to give a different address ? Now we have to wait another week ... if it does n't get `` lost '' again.Not happy with Amazon right now ...
 I bought these gloves to be used in my new punching bag , trying to improve my strength , but after 15 minutes of hard use , I had both hands with injures . I do n't know if these gloves can be useful for other kind of use , but to be used with punching bags , NEVER !!
 We got both these and a pair of more traditional boxing gloves to work out on our new freestanding heavy punching bag . My son tried these wraps first and got large pieces of skin scraped off his knuckles after a few minutes . He 's still soaking one knuckle in epsom salts and using a topical anti-biotic because it became infected . Thinking he maybe did n't use them correctly , I tried them myself and stopped after only a short time when I noticed I was starting to lose skin on my knuckles as well . We both switched to the traditional gloves and found them just right for bag work . I suppose these wraps are good for some other purposes , or perhaps after you 've developed tougher skin or calluses from use . If you ai n't already experienced and toughened up , I would n't use these . Hope this helps .
 These wraps do not provide any real protection to your hands . Yes it is convenience , you can just slip them on . But I recommend sticking to hand wraps . The hand wraps will give your hands the protections they need and the proper support . This only has a gel material around the knuckles and nothing more .
 I specifically measured my hands before buying these gloves , as they come in many sizes and I wanted the best fit . I bought the exact size glove that fit my measurement -LRB- small -RRB- , however I can barely get these on my hands , and once on they cut off the circulation to my fingers . I could n't bear to keep them on for long enough to use them as hand wraps or gloves , so ca n't comment on how good they are for that .
 This product is not made to last . After just one month , the stitching is getting loose on several places , and elsewhere the actual fabric is starting to tear away ! I always thought Everlast was a high quality brand , and therefore I am very disappointed in this product .
 At first I thought its gona give protection but end up it causes too much impact on the joints knuckles .
 I received a pair as a Christmas gift and the stitching between the fore & middle finger was already coming undone on the right hand glove . The other glove had similar stitching problems between the thumb and fore finger . Keep in mind , I have not even used them yet . They were shipped that way !!! Based on my own experiences and what I 've read other places , DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !! Its a great idea but someone at Everlast dropped the ball with this one .
 I bought these to replace hand wraps . They fit relatively well and are somewhat adjustable using the elastic straps that make an `` X '' on the back of the hand . However , they are made of a combination of mesh fabric , foam rubber , and leather . The foam rubber started to tear away from the mesh material in less than 4 weeks . If the gloves were made of a more durable material , they would be great . I ca n't recommend them given the lack of durability .
 i bought this item in small because i am a woman , 5ft 100 lbs . the gloves are EXTRA small and uncomfortable . i contacted the seller MMA ONE STOP SHOP to exchange for a medium pair and they would not take them back for an exchange.this is the problem with online shopping !
 I bought this with a Century BOB punching bag.BOB held up but the gloves did not . The material started to rip away from the stitching , Completely worthless . 30min !?!
 I was very excited about these gloves . Unfortunately , they run very small . I thought that if I wore them a few times then they would stretch out and form to fit my hand ; however , they have n't and instead my hands have started to lose circulation in the middle of kick boxing class : -LRB-
 Purchased these from a local sports store . Customizable fit , excellent gel protection , good wrist support ... but I tore the stitching for the gel after the first few punches -LRB- against a heavy bag -RRB- , tore the mesh stitching over the back of the hand after the next few ... they still work , but these wraps definitely wo n't be Everlasting and are definitely not worth the money .
 I am not a boxer - amateur or otherwise . I like the heavy bag for arm workouts . I used these on my 100lb . neva-tear bag , and after the second use , the spandex material is already tearing at the knuckles . The left hand thumb stitching came apart too . Do n't expect to get much use out of them . Also , they do n't protect the forefinger area , so punching has to be more controlled - which is n't a bad thing unless you miss - ouch ! Gel area provides good cushioning , but I still had the red -LRB- bloody -RRB- areas between the bottom of my fingers - same as I get with cloth wraps . Good wrist support , and faster to put on than wraps , but at least you can wrap the areas you want with more material using traditional wraps . Not worth the price .
 These are good ... the fit and features were fine , as advertised . However , after a couple months of being hurled against my 100 lb bag , the gel burst through the fabric covering the knuckles , effectively leaving me without any gloves .
 This product sounds like a good idea , and maybe somewhere is a good idea . But this is not the one to buy . I purchased two pairs , one tore the very first time I wore them . Getting a response from the vendor and replacement pair took weeks of constant follow-up . I 'm pretty sure if I had been less persistent they simply would have screwed me out of the cost of that pair . The second pair began falling apart a couple weeks later , but at that point I was not about to deal with the vendor again . If you want gel wraps I recommend looking into other brands - these Everlast one are cheaply made and not worth your money . Even better , just stick with the traditional hand wraps , which I am back to after this experiment . Do n't recommend ,
 I purchased these because they seemed like a good alternative to wrapping my hands . And they actually worked very well for a few weeks . But then , they started falling apart ! The EverGel is still on the glove , but all of the black fabric has fallen of revealing a thin mesh . If you intend to use them every once in a while , they 'd be fine , but I certainly ca n't recommend these if you intend to use them on a regular basis .
 When I first got these they felt great . They worked great too , but the seams on the wrist started to tear after a couple of weeks of use . I started to tape around the wrists but the fringe of the torn seams became uncomfortable . Had they been more durable I would have given them 5 stars .
 Well fitting if you take the advice and order a size up from what you 'd normally wear-They started breaking down after the second use on a heavy bag-The low price makes them disposable however -
 I purchased these for my 12 year old daughter who is very small boned . She was unable to get them on her hands since they were so small - they were painful to her . I can not comment on their utility since she was never able to use them ! Tried to return , but vendor wants to subtract charges for the delivery so I 'd have to pay for shipping in two directions . Decided to donate them instead . Maybe there is a 6 year old or a midget out there who could use them !
 this product is good if youer are not planning on hitting the punching bag . i was so excited by the reviews i was reading and when i went to hit the bag with these brand new gloves , i was so disappointed . the gloves ripped slightly at the knuckles and i felt pain but i thought that might have been bc i havent hit the bag for awhile ... but then it started to sting alot . when i took off the gloves , i had skin coming off and hang and bleeding . so i dont know how those people said this glove is good enough to hit the bag ... dont buy this if you want to really get your workout in with the bag . now i have to go buy another glove and i could just bouhgt a good instead of reading these review and listening to all you stupid ass reviewers . now my knuckles hands are messed up so i cant hit the bag for a week or so ... stupid liars and this glove sucks ... it does ... i think the only use for it is if you want to shadow box with them ,
 My wife if fed up washing my wraps because they tangle into everything in the wash and dryer , so I looked for alternatives and really these might be the only legitimite possibilities . I really wanted for these to work and so , despite the mediocre reviews I bought them . They look cool but really do n't work : They are hard to squeeze under the glovesThey do n't protect your knuckles - I 've never had such damage when using regular wraps . `` Gel '' beads started to find their way out of the padding after one use.I was too lazy to take pictures of my knuckles after use but I should have . That alone should tell anyone who actually hits the bag with any force , not to use them . Regular wraps are n't perfect but they do provide superior protection and better wrist stability . I 'm returning these .
 these are meant to use as hand wraps but they suck when using with gloves over them . the fingers curl back and they dont function anywhere near as good as taking the time to wrap the tried and true way . as bag gloves they will tear very quickly . i wish someone had told me this info before i had purchased . . they are pretty comfortable i will give them that but i have decided through my own experience this a fad item or a trend ... i went back to wraps . once you get into a habit you can wrap good in a short time
 Almost a good product . I had the same problem with seems coming apart . I wo n't spend money on Everlast products anymore .
 These are probably the worst quality gloves I have seen so far.They ripped from just trying them on!These are just a gimmick item , better just to go with normal wraps .
 If you intend to buy them as a replacement for handwraps for doing heavy bag punching , then dont . Of course unless you want your hands to be reduced to arthritic claws . I tried to use them under protex3 everlast 16oz gloves for 80lbs bag punching . Felt sorry for buying . I give them one star as they look good and feel comfortable . May be useful during light bag punching .
 I used it TWICE ... and mean TWICE !!! And they fell apart . And I 'm just a girl punching a bag . Do not buy these never had a pair of gloves fall apart on me that fast .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 Strap is really small and barely fits me when buckled in last hole . Strap can not be changed to a longer one . Perfect size for women and children though . Strap can be adjusted to fit almost snugly around my thumb -LRB- minor exaggeration -RRB- . Makes no sense.Initially setting the device up is nerve racking because you have to press the button an awful lot to get the correct settings and it 's easy to screw it up . Several buttons would have made it easier and quicker to set.I 'm returning this product .
 A local store had these on sale . I spent about 15 minutes trying to set it as I would use it , including going over the manual . I have a Polar Pacer that is now giving up the ghost . But the FS1 and FS3 will not be the one I buy . It probably does an ok job , but I did not like the interface , thus not a rank of 1 .
 When I got this bag it appeared to be nice . But within the first week or so of having it on my bike the rubber on top ripped , and the straps constantly come loose . Do n't waste your money .
 Purchased this watch and regretted it . One of the band pins popped out while I was taking it out of the box . Cheap band and clasp , look elsewhere , this watch is very cheaply made . Returned for refund ... which took a while .
 After one month the glass fell out . The watch was not abused . Had to have the glass replaced . The paint flaked off the dial a month after that . The cheap material in the band started to tear just a month after that . I called S&W and they said they did not make the watch . They only allowed thier name to be used . When I asked them who the manufacturer was , they refused to tell me . Not helpful at all . Do n't make the mistake of ordering this JUNK . Save your money and buy a nice Timex Ironman or a Casio G-Shock .
 So this product claims that its `` Water Resistant to 30 meters/90 ft. '' My husband took a swim while wearing it in our pool one week after we received it and it filled up with water , had to have it taken apart , dried and fixed ! Do not buy it if you are planning on using it in water .
 A friend and i each purchased one of these suppossed ` Smith and Wesson ' watches . Both of us regretted it within weeks . They are supposed to be rugged and up to a tactical environment - they are not - not even close.Mine - the watch came away from the strap when i hit a punch bag whilst chatting to a team member in the gym . The thing just flew off and s tiny pin when springing off through the air . We found and and put it back together , but the assembly is so week that any hard bump can dislodge the watch from the strap - so forget using it for anything where you may get knocked . Within a month the pin was lost , the thing just fell apart and we are not talking any heavy exposure.Buddies - one of the hands fell off within weeks . Again , we are not talking heavy exposure here , it just fell off . He contacted S&W ; in the US who admitted THEY DO NOT MAKE THIS WATCH IT IS MADE UNDER LICENCE BY ANOTHER COMPANY WHO SIMPLY USES THE S&W ; NAME !!! Thing is garbage - do n't waste your money . To have 2 of them fail so fast shows these watches are not up to the job .

 The watch arrived broken so I have no idea . It was a gift for my son and he received it that way . So , now he has to wait for an other watch to arrive and hopefully it wo n't be broken also .
 Item received was not as described on Amazon . Amazon listing said `` Lures - 1/12 oz - 3/4 oz . '' The picture showed about 8 Lures with a cost of $ 47.00 , which had been reduced to $ 2.95 . I placed the order and a 5 days later received only 1 single Lure . This Lure I could have bought at Walmart for about $ 2.00 . I called the company and they blamed Amazon for making a mistake on the listing , but they have done nothing to correct it . I am unhappy and very disappointed with this company .
 I recievedmy cover and was shocked that it did not include the bows , the product itself looked to be of good quality but as it was described 54 inches tall threw me to thinking it was a complete unit , I returned it and got part of my money back , lesson learned be sure to write and ask before purchase .
 I received the cover for the bimini but have not received the frame . Placed the order on May 10 , 2011 .
 Bought this for my Giant Roam 1 to hold a U-Lock while I ride around the city.The lock fit easy enough and left room for a multi-too and an extra combo lock to lock my front wheel to the frame . The bag also attached to the bike quite easily . It fit on my seat post with a detachable fender also attached which was nice . The large bag -LRB- not sure about the others -RRB- also has an expandable zipper section so it can be lengthened like most rollable suitcases these day.So despite the nice features of this bag , my one-star review comes from the fact that one of the plastic buckles used to attach the bag to the underside of the seat broke on the first ride I took . The buckle snapped horizontally where the nylon strap is strung through the buckle making it useless . It 's also worth noting that I did not take a hard ride . It was all paved city streets and sidewalks with the exception of one or two sidewalk curbs I rode off of.So i 'll be trying to fix this myself by permanently sowing it onto my bike seat , bypassing the buckles , but I would look for a different solution if you 're considering this bag for your bike .
 You 'd think theses accessory companies would spend ten minutes actually using their own products but N-O-O-O !!! The zipper is located directly under the bike seat , so you ca n't actually zip the item up without extreme distress.I have already broken my zipper because of the complaint above and also because the unit is so tiny . Warning
 If you have a comfort saddle , this wedge wo n't fit . The dimensions -LRB- that were not in the listing -RRB-
 The quality of the bag is fine and so is the zipper that is used to close it . Holds cell phone , tube , tools and more with no problem . This issue that I have is that the bag is n't tapped narrow enough so that when I slide back on the saddle , the width of the bag is wider than my seat , thus my legs end up rubbing the bag , which is annoying/distracting when climbing hills . I 'll going to keep the bag , but replace it with something that is the width of the seat .
 Fit my road bike , but it doesnt fit my TRI back as my seat stem is bigger . Good for road bikes though
 This bag is small small small.But my real problem is that the reviews -LRB- almost all of the 46 -RRB- are for the medium size . I guess I could have noticed when I bought it . But why would Amazon put all the the Medium size bag reviews under the Small bag page ?
 I guess the exercises Tracy Anderson does in this video are OK , but she looks about as interested in her at-home audience as a topless dancer looks when giving a lap dance to an 80 year old ... TA looks like she could n't care less.The video is BORING ! But if you can get past that , I guess it 's OK . I will not be ordering any more of her videos .
 I 'd love to give this tire less than two stars but I am reluctant to do that to a product I never got to try . I have been riding 20 + years and I have never encountered a tire this difficult to install or remove . I went out and purchased tire levers for the first time . No luck . The guy in the shop was able to do it in two minutes , but guess what ? I discovered I 'd punctured the tube and now ca n't get the damn thing off.Am I incompetent ? Probably . Is there any reason for a tire to be this difficult ? No **** ing way .
 Just Great , there 's nothing better to give your eye 's a well deserved rest .
 CAUTION ... stay clear of these glasses ... do n't waste your money ... they are JUNK / GARBAGE ... I threw mine right in the trash !!!!!!
 Yes , these are the same brand/style shades given to us by the Ophthalmologist whenever pupils are dilated ... and , for those of us with sun sensitive eyes and glasses , we end up using them , sans case , until they 're so scratched , we can barely see out of them any more.Love the design , hate the color of these . Amber does n't just take the glare away , it transports you to a different planet
 These were listed on amazon as solar shield Amber , I had amber before the one 's i got were more orange than amber . Does not cut glare at all . They would not take them back either . Advertize as large and they do not even fit over my glasses . Do NOT but these !!!
 I ordered this to fit over my existing glasses which are big . This pair did n't fit and so I had to return it .
 One of frames had no eye glass in them and I sent them back and have not received a replacement .
 I want a refund . It arrived late , took a half an hour to assemble it and then when I pulled it back the string snapped . I have been trying to contact the seller for a month and he wont reply It may be cheep but its a waste of time .
 Well 1st of all hard to install the string but found a way to do it ~ ~ ~ The end caps , plastic that protect the strin broke after about 9 shots and had to take them off and restring without them ~ ~ One of my last shots a small spring popped out ~ ~ ???? ~ ~ Wonder where it came from ? ~ ~ Also 3 of the bolts holding the gun together were loose and one nut came undone and i lost it ~ ~ The 2 end caps that hold the sight and cocker in place are plastic and weak and one broke on me when one bolt came loose ~ metal would have been better to prevent this ~ ~ All in all if u are going to buy one dont buy it or buy the cheapest one u can and modify or improve it ~ ~ ~ Not really worth the money ~ ~ I bought 2 , one from here and ebay and were made by the same place in taiwan ~ ~ Both the same poor quality ~
 when first received item , the initial string broke when loading , but pistol seeme dof good solid quality . However , got a new string , installed it , and that portion seems to work fine , but the bolt does n't really shoot , it kinda pops off and immediately falls to the ground . It is a very disappointing item , I would not recommend that anyone purchase this
 Okay , where do I begin ? I thought this would be not necessarily a serious weapon for the price , but I thought it would shoot . Unfortunately , it did and broke itself . Me , being the documenting type , was recording when it snapped , so if you are still considering buying this , let me send you the video . I did manage to send it back , but it cost me $ 11.12 to ship back , and they acted like nothing came to them for three weeks , and I decided to call Amazon . Amazon got me my money back , but not the shipping , but still , Kudos ! to Amazon . I was really upset , because I felt cheated.So we are clear , I had an experience friend set it up . We did not dry fire it . The arrow came with the crossbow that it broke . It broke on the bottom piece ; it is plastic . Please , do not buy this , and save yourself the trouble .
 Do not buy this product . Firstly , it didnt ship for Christmas , it was reordered and then it arrived late -LRB- jan 2013 -RRB- After assembly the string broke immediately on pulling back the loader . This product is a complete and utter waste of money , and it should be removed . Had I read the reviews I wouldnt have ordered it . The hassel trying to get the product , means I will not waste time trying to get a refund , as I not prepared to pay the shipping . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .
 my husband used it twice then the plastic string guards broke and then he noticed that a nut on the pull arm guard had fallen off .
 How can I rate this product when I have not received it ! It was promised delivery by July 30 , now it is Aug. 9th and it is still not here . I will never again order anything from Amazon , and I would like my money back or credit to my card , or is the money lost in transit also ? How can you as a compa ny trea people in this manner and withhold their products ?
 ONCE WE GOT THE STRING ON THE CROSSBOW IT CAME OFF ON FIRST TRY . SO NO WAY DOES THIS PISTOL CROSSBOW WAS WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME WE -LRB- YES TWO PEOPLE -RRB- SPENT ON IT . . VERY UNHAPPY 16YEARS OLD ...
 My experience did not start well the product was not delivered because the seller shorted the postage by about .45 which isn &#8217; t that much if that was the only problem . But because I have a swing schedule I had to take an hour off of work costing me an additional 17.41 . This crossbow was listed on the box as a 20lb draw rather than a 50lb . I still decided to put it together and gave it a test fire . When I fired from 10 feet away with aluminum arrows I could not puncture a piece of cardboard . After that I contacted the seller I was told I could send it back at my expense . Because it would have cost just about as much to send it back as it did for shipping both ways I declined . Overall my experience with Amazon has been great this one I will just chalk this one up as an outlier .
 Got one online just for fun . I followed instructions for assembly and the first shot was great . The second shot snapped it in half . The metal is cheap and literally shattered . I am d *** lucky it did n't snap into my eye . I am not a careless teenager , I am a grown man and experienced with compound and recurve bows . I am very familiar with care and maintenance . I did n't dry fire . Given the poor quality of chinese materials , this is absolutely NOT something I recommend for ANYONE at ANY age . I took photos and hopefully the links will work . DANGEROUS TO SHOOTER , DO NOT BUY . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 This product is the WORST product ever . When I tried to assemble it , it fell apart . It would take Samson just to hook up the bow string and then the string broke after one shot . DO NOT BUY this product . It is not worth it .
 I bought this exact crossbow at a sporting goods shop , and at first i was super excited . That is , until i opened the package . The bow needs assembly , which is quite difficult . Once the bow is assembled , it is alot of fun , and easy to use . Unfortunately , after repetitive use , the string began to fray , and the actual bow part kept on becoming loose . It is definitely worth the and you will have fun . Make sure to buy extra arrows .
 I bought this same crossbow for my own little X-mas present and I wanted to kick myself for even thinking that it would be worth it . First off the string has to be put on yourself ! If you know how it will take about 15 minutes If you do n't then do n't bother you will end up trying to find something to help get it on easier -LRB- like a screwdriver -RRB- and your line will snap.Yes , I did this because after a half hour of trying to put it together I was desperate . Needless to say you actually have to twist the string just right to get it to go on -LRB- even on my 2nd string I still used something to pry it on -RRB- . It 's really impossible to do it without using something for leverage . Ok , once you finally get the string on you will think that you are ready to go ... not so . The string , once cocked back and safety on , is in a very dangerous place ... I had it go off repeatedly even in safety ! Stupid crazy !! You would think this was enough , but -LRB- lol -RRB- when I did get it working properly after several repeated attempts when I would press the trigger , the string would actually go right over the arrows and just hit air . This now happens on every attempt . Bottom line I say just get the arrows and throw them yourself ... you will get more enjoyment !
 It took forever to get my pistol , never did get the extra arrows , but it does n't matter the first time I shot it , it broke . oh well .
 It was a really powerful crossbow , but it had a lot of flaws . Mainly , the thing would ` nt -LSB- ... -RSB- back , and once it did , the safety would fail and shoot by its self ! Unsafe . It was very hard to -LSB- ... -RSB- back , but when it did work , i was very satisfied . I only got three shots out before the cocking mechanism broke of the rails . oh well .
 do n't get this crossbow it is NOT worth the money . I and my sister had got one of these crossbows . and the sight fell off when we shot it , then we put it back on then we shot it again , and the string fell off too when the string falls off it is like wire cutting something . witch means it could have cut my hand off.THIS IS LIKE A HEALTH HAZZARD .
 i am not even lieing i just got it got the string on pulled it back put the arrow in pushed the thingy back and the string snaped caps broke hit me and i orderd it april 19th got it like may 1-5th so shipping sucks so i called to get a new sting the day i got it and its may 26th what the heack so they lie and rip you off basically DONT BUY
 I hav ` nt received this product yet!Don ' t know how they shipped it.Can ' t check it out ! Supposed to be here soon . I hope .
 The stitching for the towel around the edges is cheap . The hood started coming off after the first wash . The wife fixed the part what was coming apart and as soon as she did that the rest of the hood started tearing . I love my little boy having a Chiefs towel but it is just a cheap quality .
 I have owned two of these bags . The first bag broke 4 miles into it 's first ride . Amazon warrentied . The second one broke 3 months afterwards . Both broke along the clip area of the top of the bag . Really bad design.In the past , I have loved Topeak products , but not with this product . Seems the clip can not withstand a load of a tube , plastic tire tools , a hex wrench and a CO2 cartridge.Bought an Eleven81 bag with the clip to replace the product and have been very happy . The clip mounts easily , and is stout ! Simple mounting with hex screw and has a metal backing where it attaches to the seat . Good quality bag as well . Where the Topeak would rub my legs from under the seat , the Eleven81 does not . The only difference I have found is that the Topeak has a net area on the fold our area of the zipper and the Eleven81 does not.Buy the Eleven81 . Do n't buy the Topeak .
 the pack is large and can fit a lot in it but the weight is too much and the two thin strips of plastic that hold all the weight break . the first time i bought the pouch it broke after about 2 miles the second one lasted about a week , amazon was very good and replaced the first and gave me my money back on the second but i would recommend you do not waste your time and just go with the Velcro .
 This is a handsom bag design with great features such as quick release clip , integral reflector strip and rear light attachment which unfortunately had THREE things break on the bag within the first 2 months using it . First the fixer -LRB- quick release clip -RRB- broke while I was snapping the bag on the bike . After returning it , the guys at the bike shop replaced it no charge but soon the zipper broke off on it 's own while I was riding . That was annoying , but was able to open and close the bag with my finger nail . Now , today while I was riding I heard a noise at my back tire and turned around to see the bag was caught in the rear fork because the second , replaced fixer BROKE AGAIN ! I did n't overload the bag at all - just my house key and wallet with room to spare.I ca n't believe so many things can break on a simple bag all by themselves without trauma . I liked the design , but unfortunately will not be buying another Topeak bag again .
 THIS IS A WELL MADE BAG , BUT THE FIXER MUST BE MADE FOR A DIFFERENT SADDLE THAN MINE . IT ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT FIT ON MY SADDLE . I BROKE THE FIXER TRYING TO MAKE IT FIT . I WILL JACK-LEG SOME OTHER TYPE OF METHOD TO FASTEN IT ON . THE IDEA IS GOOD , BUT THE FIT IS BAD .
 I bought this bag because the picture showed the pack attaching with the fixer to the upright -LRB- diagonal -RRB- part of the rails . When the product arrived , I saw that the fixer only attaches to the horizontal part of the rails . The picture is misleading , and neither Topeak nor the seller took responsibility for the irresponsible and misleading advertising . Topeak 's customer service not only was unhelpful , they gave me wrong advice , and the seller demands a 15 % restocking fee if I return it . So be very careful if you order this , make sure it will work for your saddle .
 The price is right but there 's not much you can do with this bar . There 's barely enough room to slide on a standard grip . To fit brake levers requires cutting down the grip a bit and forget about bar mounted shift levers . It 's the wrong shape , not enough sweep , for inverse levers or bar end shifters so that 's not really an option ; stem shifters would almost make this bar usable .
 yankees rule dont by this anyway it has bad cottton so by a yankee jerseyps this is just a fan but if it were a yankee jersey i would give it 4 stars
 last year I bought my 9 year old a 15.00 louiseville wood bat.He had it for 4 months . His whole team was swinging it in batting practice . This year we just purchased this 29 inch wood bat . When i took it out of the box he was so excited . It felt very cheep to me , almost like a free gift at bat day down at yankee stadium . Well we ran off to the park and on the 12th pitch it broke .12 pitches , my son wasnteven loose yet . Do not buy
 I was very disappointed in the sound quality of the birds . You can hardly decipher some of the birds sounds . The price is low , but now I know why . For bird lovers , I would not recommend this .
 This is a great idea especially for beginning birders . Once past sight identification , sound identification is such a great help . The device is handy and quite easy to use . However , this instrument flops due to lack of crisp sound quality and limited number of birds featured . It is unfortunate that , putting aside the sound quality problem , additional packets can not be purchased to add to the number of bird songs .
 When looking for good resistance bands , do NOT buy Danskin . The handles are affixed by means of a bulb pushed through a ring . Not only does this poor design not hold up to -LRB- go figure -RRB- resistance , it also snaps the bulbs off and sends them flying -LRB- not to mention snapping the hell out of the user with the broken end of the tubing ... OUCH ! -RRB- . Do yourself a favor and stick with the GoFit or Thera-Band brands .

 This is a horrible product that will not get you in shape . It offers no resistance or weight training . I know it 's like 17 bucks , but I can find something better to do with 17 bucks and so can you .
 These spikes wear out too fast . After only two rounds the yellow portions are worn to stubs . The softspike pulsar and black widow tour cleats last much longer , although the BW tour cleats clog with a lot of grass , so I rate the pulsar cleats best .
 I bought these to replace my old Black Widows which lasted three years or approximatley 40 rounds of golf . I am very disappointed with these as 1 of them broke after my first round and three more broke after my second round . The yellow spikes are tearing at the bottom of the shoe , 3 on my back foot and 1 on my front . I do have a fast swing , but I could not believe how easily these broke .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg .

 The watch is great , but if you ever need service , FORGET IT ! You would be better off buying a new watch . Casio service apparently has not grasped the meaning of `` customer service '' ; tried to charge me ANOTHER $ 45 after servicing my watch and having the buttons fall off
 I took this digital watch with me to Bhutan and found it semi-accurate with altitude readings -LRB- within 50 ' of actual altitude -RRB- but the compass was completely worthless . The compass reads off bearing by 15 to 20 degrees . No small error . I followed scores of time to to reset it but nada . Each time I check it against other navigational compasses it was always off bearing . Thank God that I had a magnetic compass too . Always bring a back up ! Not recommended .
 My teenage son loves this watch.Having said that , the screws that hold the wristband to the watch keep coming off.We have exchanged the screws at least 3 times already , once by a professional watchmaker and twice by two seperate professional watch repairmen using original casio screws aquired from the admittedly helpful Casio repair department . It will not hold for any length of time.As a result my son has almost lost his watch 2 or 3 times . The wristband just slides off.It has come to the point where my son ca n't wear the watch at all . He carries it around with him in a pocket.Not cool!The barometer and antimeter readings of this watch are highly doubtful but that does n't spoil the fun for my son.It 's a toy more than anything else.Also , be advised that this watch is big . Very big . Everybody will comment on it.I think it looks good if you could wear it on your wrist which , really , you ca n't . Finally , replacing the batteries 8 months after purchase cost $ 40 which is a third of the price of the watch.I have had it with the Casio pathfinder . I will personally never buy Casio again.My younger son wears a cool Timex with compass which works like a charm , still runs on the same batteries a year later and which I can highly recommend .
 I am a road cyclist . It is helpful to know a few things about a given ride
 Actually liked this watch but was a gift for my son and someone else also bought him one .
 This was a nice watch with lots of cool features . However , when we tried to set the day , date and time , the watch was out of sync . The automatic day of week setting did not agree with the date and year we entered . Huh ?? Also , the temp guage did not agree with our thermometer and when we reset it , it would not calibrate temperture changes properly . The altimeter also resets itself based on air-pressure , which did not seem to work well for us here in the high desert . We returned the watch to Amazon and are now a little gun-shy of buying another watch with these features .
 I became infatuated with all the great reviews of sealine products and ordered this . Can I say this , without angering the `` Dry Bag Gods '' , but I swear when I opened the box this thing came in , the bag yelled out , `` Hey Sucka ' '' , and well I was n't having that , so I returned it , and went to Walmart and got a better more heavy duty dry bag for $ 5 . Sealine may have high quality products such as the black canyon edition , but this dry bag is n't meant to be taken on an expedition anytime soon ...
 Topeak The Mini 9-Function Bicycle Tool do n't know why i have this in my review do n't have this tool someone must have updated the wrong account looks to small to use
 It was n't much money , so I do n't think it will be worth the time and money to return it . There is a noticeable warp in the blade . A waste of money . I always thought that Ontario Knife made better quality products than this . Would not recommend .

 It 's likely that you are a recreational rider looking for different positioning and/or getting out of the wind during your rides if these are of interest . I 'm not , but a sale made me think my road bike might like one . Put them on my ride early in the spring and took them off within 6 weeks . Here 's why.The flip up pads are nice because not many aerobars let you keep the top of your handlebars . Unfortunately , those brackets that flip up break pretty easily . They sell beefed up replacement brackets to replace your standard ones that will break with enough miles . Earlier this year they were not selling the unit with the beefed up brackets standard . Stupid ? Goodbye 25-30 dollars.Second , they make a lot of rattling noise . Lots . Not much to do about this one.Third , the weight of these things is atrocious . Yes , wind resistance increases 4x with every 2x increase in speed . Yes , weight is only 10 % of the concern that aerodynamics are when you are considering maintaining speed . Still , aerobars in a similar price range can be found for half the weight and similar or higher quality.Lastly , I think the hand placement is annoying . The lower half has you turn your wrists up which is not a natural motion . The top half is too high to hold on to unless you point the bars down slightly.I may be a little picky coming from the straighter s-bend extensions of a triathlon specific bike . You might like the Airstryke for occasional aero riding . If you plan to spend more time tucked out of the wind , the Syntace C2 and Profile Design Aerolite come to mind when you want something higher quality , fairly adjustable and more comfortable for a similar price range .

 this item does n't come close to fitting my ankles ... if you have small ankles DO NOT ORDER ... they would fit around my waist . . well almost :--RRB- other than that they 're great . .

 I bought this watch as a Christmas gift for my wife in December . 7 months later the faceplate fell off . Disappointed that I had spent that much money on a watch to only have it break after 7 months . Regardless , I mailed it in to be repaired and fully expecting it would be covered by warranty . Only to be called by Amazon stating it will not be covered and they will send me an estimate on repair after I have paid to have it shipped across the country . I explained in detail what the problem was before I sent it so not only am I upset that I paid to have it shipped , wasted my time but then I find out they are not going to cover it because they are NOT an authorized dealer of Tag . I called Tag and they told me Amazon was not an authorized dealer . When I brought this up to Amazon , their response - `` we never told you we were an authorized dealer '' . Be careful buying from Amazon .
 when i received this gloves i was disappointed with it because i got one x-large and one large glove . it was a uncomfortable fit . therefore i will be returning the glove . your gloves is not what you advertise .
 These gloves are not at all warm and make your hands sweat , futher amplifying any cold weather you may experience . If the lowest temperature you are likely to experience is 45 degrees then these gloves might work .
 I purchased these gloves as lightweight driving gloves to wear from the house to the car to the office . I wanted something that would not impair my dexterity and they are thin and form fitting and you can pick up a dime while wearing them and even operate a touch screen . The problem is that , despite the fact that I generally do not have cold hands , I think my hands are actually colder with them on than off.The synthetic palm material actively conducts heat away from your palm and fingers making these gloves very cold in cold air and particularly useless for holding cold objects like a metal tool or a cold steering wheel . I am really unsure under what conditions you would wear these gloves because if it is warm enough to not be bothered by the negative insulation effect , then I do n't know why you would be wearing them ... they are not really sturdy enough to protect your hands from anything dangerous and while they are not unattractive , they do n't look that good.I relegated them to running glove duty but even in this use , my hands got so painfully cold wearing them at about 30F that I had to cut my run short . Simple jersey cotton work gloves do a better job than these of keeping my hands warm .
 Glove is not suitable for winter therefore the -LRB- all-weather -RRB- glove should not be noted in this glove 's description . My hands were freezing when it was cold outside even with this gloves on .
 I purchased this item with the hopes that I would no longer have fingers that are covered in lead/gun powder residue , and oil . Unfortunately , the gloves were too thick so I could n't even feel the bullets when loading my 9mm or my .22 mags .
 Mild wind blows right through these gloves . They also run a size smaller than what they should . If you think your a large you should buy a XL . I would n't buy again .
 I bought these as a Christmas gift for my step mom and they turned out to be no better than a cheap wal-mart pair . We live in Mississippi and it still did not keep her hands warm . I would not recommend these if your planning to use them in cold climates .
 I was looking for light weather gloves and when I saw neoprene on the gloves , it was clear that I 've made a mistake ...
 not exactly what expected , would be great for driving and minimal outdoor use but for hunting in the cold , gets wet easy and not very warm

 The set with the chips is for kids and not for actual fun play on weekends . Dont Buy this , waste of money : -LRB-
 This item disintegrated when placed in a sunny area covering a flat surface . Completely worthless for covering cord wood or other items for longer than 1 month .

 I had always wanted a Tag watch and finally received this Aquaracer as a gift . First off , it looks and feels good . However , the luminous dial is very small and weak . It is nearly impossible to see the hands even after just turning off the lights in a completely dark room . The second problem is that the automatic movement stops if not worn for 10 hours or so . This is a bit inconvenient , I put mine on first thing in the morning to make sure it keeps running . I would not get the automatic if I was buying this watch again . Hope this is helpful for other Tag fans .

 Received the product on time but it sure would have been nice if it would have included the spray nozzle like it showed in the picture . I guess I 'll have to find something to fit the bottle so I can use it .
 I ordered this item thinking that it would be the perfect bench to easily use and store away . It is also inexpensive compared to others I looked at . I like it because it suits me considering I 'm petite - I would not recommend it to anyone tall or heavyset - and it 's lightweight so I can move and fold it without a hassle . However , it 's difficult to do certain exercises on it particularly if you have to lie down . My biggest pet peeve is that it came unassembled despite what the ad states . Apparently some people did n't have to deal with assembly , but I did and it took hours to do . The instructions are crude pictographs and I had to improvise in areas . Fortunately for me it has n't collapsed and I 've used it several times already . Overall it was a good purchase to start - further along I will probably upgrade to a different bench .
 I had this bench for two months , and all of a sudden the metal bar that keeps the bench upright snapped off and broken -LRB- almost got injured -RRB- . I have another bench that I have been using for over year and never had that kind of problem . The em10 is decent quality but it 's not built for durability or stability . Overall not worth it in the long term .
 To say that this mat is very slippery is an understatement . It is basically unuseable ! I wound up throwing it aside the first time I tried it out . A complete waste of money .
 This thing is bloody awful . I bought it as a Christmas present and sent it back by New Year . It 's a royal pain to assemble and is quite flimsy . The scoreboard does not operate well and the balls tend to stick in the nets even after extensive stretching and leaving balls in them overnight.Absolutely not worth buying .
 I may just be dealing with an unusually difficult case of scratches , but I used this product daily with the recommended spray and my horses condition worsened dramaticaly . case confirmed by Vet as Scratches.see photos on Flicker.Bluemaxfarm.comGood Luck .

 Photo is of a rim with spoke eyelets , but the rim that I received does not have spoke eyelets . That 's an important difference to me and I would not have bought the rim if the photo was accurate . The description did not say either way so I went by the photo . I need to get the wheel built so no time to bother sending it back .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .

 This is a pretty good scope , but the mount would not fit the handle on my Stag AR . It was n't even close .
 GPS portion does not work -LRB- Expect long acquisition time and frequent interruptions in satellite contact -RRB- and the watch shows wear/tear pretty much immediately.Do yourself a favor , either pay up for a better system from a GPS focused company that works passably well or save your money and stick with a cheaper watch/heart monitor combo .

 The picture here is not the right picture !! The picture is one of a CardioSport heart rate monitor when the one for sale is Reebok brand !!

 I bought this `` outdoor '' table about 5 years ago . Keep in mind that I live in one of the mildest climates in the US
 The aluminum top surface starts pulling away from the bottom surface within 6 months , warping and blistering . The table then becomes unusable . It needs serious re-design and a recall needs issued ASAP .
 We loved this table for the single summer we were able to use it . Even with storage in the garage through the fall , winter , and spring , the surface began to delaminate and bubble , rendering the table useless . It was a tremendous waste of money for our family .
 I bought a very similar Stiga table made by Escalade . After one season the aluminum top started peeling away from the rest of the table . Escalade was no help at all .
 Tone-wise , Chromes ca n't hold a candle to Thomastik-Infeld Jazz Swing strings . I suppose that is somewhat forgivable since Chromes cost less than half what Thomstik-Infeld Jazz Swing string cost . However , what puts me completely off them , to the point that I 'd rather use GHS Precision flatwounds if I could n't find Thomastik-Infelds , is that they are very slippery under my fingers . I do n't get the same kind of tactile connection with the strings that I get with every other brand of flatwounds I 've every used .
 Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top . A few months later , the high E string unwound from the ball end . Overall good strings , good sound -- this set simply did n't last very long . I will replace with 12s however . For me the 11s felt a little loose . The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box . I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model . I 'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s .
 This is not feedback for the seller , per se , because I already left positive feedback to them because the shipping was incredible and the price is more than fair . However , if you 're looking to buy these PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TITLE AND THE PHOTO ARE NOT THE SAME THING , AND YOU WILL GET WHAT IS IN THE PHOTO , NOT THE TITLE . The title says the gauge is `` Regular Light '' but they are in fact just `` Light '' . I do n't know if the lister meant to say ` regular ' as in ` just plain ol' or something . . but that is kind of a stupid error to make , honestly . there is a big difference , and if you 're not an amateur guitarist , it is a HUGE difference . I wanted `` Regular Light Gauge '' strings , which D'Addario makes , but instead i got exactly what is in the picture ... `` Light '' gauge , which are a little clunkier . If you are n't a serious guitarist you might be smirking at this review , but if you are , you 'll know what i 'm talking about.PLEASE FIX THE LISTING

 Not as good as I thought . It is heavy and after laying it over the pool table for just over 2 weeks it has started sagging at the center .
 The picture of the product shown online is misleading . It appears that it will fit on a standard size pool table but it is actually three inches too narrow . Additionally , it shows a frame attached to fit inside the table to raise the table platform above the pool table rails . Only the table is provided . The shipping was free and arrived within a week .
 Although the product itself is satisfactory , the shipper used by this seller is absolutely unacceptable . Consider ordering from a local dealer ; ordering online will cost a fortune !
 I purchased this heart rate monitor and it has been collecting dust on my shelf ever since . It 's completely unreliable as it rarely picks up my heartrate for any extended period of time , even after wetting the electrodes . The electrodes are tiny compared with any Polar brand model . Obviously , not much $ and thought when into the monitor 's design . The watch is huge and ugly . For this amount of money , you would do much better buying a Polar FS1 which is just about the same price . That 's what I did and I am thrilled with the Polar monitor !
 My advice
 This knife is very poorly made . The picture looks better than the dagger I received . If someone offered to give me this dagger I would not want it .
 I 'm a pretty handy guy . I 've done plenty of work with concrete lag bolts.I have a good hammer drill , followed all instructions that came with this.This is an impossible install.The lag bolts will either not grab the concrete or will not get inserted because they wont fit.The hole must be precise , I guess.Instructions say to make sure you clean out the concrete dust from the hole you drill.Did that . With a shop vac and a hack saw blade used like a spoon . Still no good . I have three holes and anchor that is not anchored.This is expensive . I do n't mind paying for quality . I really hate paying good money for a poor product.Please check my other reviews . I think I panned maybe one product over the years . This one is BAD.Really , really . Do n't buy it .
 This Anchor is mostly made of plastic . Under the plastic cover is a small metal plate , which could be cut through in seconds by a thief with an angle grinder . The bolts provided are SUPER LOW QUALITY , and all 3 of my bolts were destroyed before I got anything mounted to the floor . I now need to buy 3 new bolts , 2 new drill bits , and that will cost me as much as the product did in the first place . This is not what it is advertised to be . I have mounted many anchor bolts into concrete , and never before have I had so much trouble with bolts breaking . This is a low quality product , and I would not recommend it to anybody .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .

 If I could rate it 0 stars , I would . I set time , date , etc. . Then I moistened chest strap per instructions . Then I pushed mode button per instructions . Whole unit froze , no buttons would work . Called service number , who transferred me to a `` manager '' , who did n't answer the phone . I 'm not playing the runaround game . Biggest piece of junk I 've ever seen . I 'm returning it today !
 1 . Set-up took about 3 hours with a friend2 . Table could never perfectly balance -LRB- got 3 out of 4 side pockets to function correctly -RRB- 3 . Cheap construction including deformed feet , excess glue on pieces , and scratched surfaces4 . Worst of all , the surface is not felt and is excessively smooth . Balls roll forever , and the roll sounds like rolling a ball across a wooden floor . I ended up rigging a felt top by gluing a piece of felt on top , but in the end I looked at the deformity and decided to get my money back .
 We purchased this table for 1/3 this price at Sears . It is advertised as a 7 foot table but that is a lie . The playing area does not even measure 6 feet , much less 7 . The description even gives the measurements , so how can they call this a 7 foot table . To call it that , it should measure a 7 foot playing area . It was fine for what we wanted it for and the price was great but they should advertise it as it really is .
 You will receive a useless hunk of metal that does n't move at all and is pretty heavy for your modern aluminum bikes . You have to lubricate it yourself , which I did but it did n't help anything . I regret the purchase and recommend against it .
 This kickstand was way too small for my son 's bike . I compared his bike to about a dozen others in the neighborhood when the kids were all riding around and it would not have fit on any of the 20 inch bikes I saw . The kickstand was at least 2 inches too short so the bike just falls over . I held it up to a 16 inch bike and it would have been perfect . I believe they sent the incorrect size but there is no packaging so no way to tell . It would be very nice if there were dimensions included . It 's not like that would be a hard thing to produce . They are a certain length , just tell us which one is which length . Because they do n't provide this information I have no way to know if the kickstand just does n't fit any of these bikes or if I received the wrong one.On the plus side , it seems well built .
 As at least one other person stated , this kickstand did not fit our 16 '' bike . It was at least 2 '' too small.We have a 16 '' Huffy Cars edition bike that was purchased at Target and it did not fit and was woefully too short . However , it did fit our 12 '' Huffy Thomas the Tank engine bike , but we will probably never take off the training wheels.I checked the product description and the Wald website prior to ordering this item and no sizing information was provided except `` fits most 16 '' bikes . '' If they would have provided a frame to floor dimension , then I would have probably figured that this kickstand would not work.Here are the dimensions I measured off of our bikes : Our 16 '' bike from floor to frame is 8 3/4 '' and this kickstand will not work . You probably can not use this kickstand if your frame to floor dimension is more than 7 '' . Our 12 '' bike is 6 1/2 '' from floor to frame and this kickstand did work with it.Another possiblity that another reviewer noted , is that the tag included with this kickstand could have been mislabeled and the wrong size kickstand was sent.I did not try to return the item or contact the manufacturer because I felt that that my time , cost and effort to return would not be worth my time . Hopefully the manufacturer will read this review and check their product and consider providing more size information upfront.I gave this product two stars instead of one star , because the kickstand is a very high quality kickstand . It is the best quality I have seen on any recent quickstand . So if the dimensions would work for you , you would be very pleased with the quality of the kickstand . If the size would have been right , I would have given it 5 stars because of the high quality .
 I bought the 16 '' kickstand for my son 's 16 '' bike and it was about an inch too short . The bike kept falling over . Build quality was fine , but it was too small . I returned it and got a 20 '' kickstand , which actually works quite well . My guess is that it would be too short for an actual 20 '' bike .
 The 16 '' version of this kickstand was way too small -LRB- at least 2 '' short -RRB- for my son 's 16 '' bike . There was no packaging , so there 's no way to know , but it was likely a 12 '' kickstand . The vendor denies this and does n't cover return shipping , so I 'm stuck with it
 I ordered this for my son 's 20 '' bike -LRB- I even double-checked the size by measuring -RRB- . The kickstand installs easily , but I wish it was longer . The bike leans over too far and is n't very stable when it is on its kickstand . However , it basically works , I just wish the kickstand were a little longer .
 I broke my arm because of this scooter , let me tell you it is very dangerous because it is so small and ca n't hold people over 100kgs . The sprockets are absolutely useless in cold weather and they freeze up in those conditions . I was riding down a hill in Finland when the handle bars froze up and I went crashing into a garbage can . ADULT SUPERVISION IS NECESSARY FOR THIS ! Do not let children ride around cars .
 This product was very hard to assemble . We had to contact the manufacturer to help assemble it . It was purchased for Christmas and it took several days to get this thing assembled . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 Bought this for my grandsons ` birthday ... 3 parts missing -LRB- Axles -RRB- essential for putting this together!Needless to say BIG dissapointment !!!
 the backboard is warped from the start . the rim does n't bolt up evenly , to make a true 90degree with the backboard . Ok for starters but do n't have high expectations . For the money , ... It 's ok .
 The item arrived promptly , sent in the factory carton , which was a thin , cheap quality cardboard that ripped open in transit and some of the pieces were missing !
 The rim bent as I was putting it together and as a result , the rim sits at an upright angle . The directions say to `` Completely tighten all Rim hardware . '' As I did so , the back of the rim bent and I had not applied undue pressure.I have sent company 2 emails but `` host server '' could not be found.I will call the company today .
 the ball is harder than normal volleyballs but i was concerned that it was really dirty like it had been used or something !!

 I have owed my CardiSport Fusion 10 for ten months and it has been erratic the whole time . The chest strap requires a new battery about once each month . Now the monitor portion has stopped working altogether -- right in the middle of a workout the display went blank . New battery does not solve the problem . The email address listed for service bounces back -- unknown address . And the telephone number given allows you to leave a voice mail , but they do not return calls . This is the second time I have tried to contact them . Maybe if you contact CardioSport in the UK , they can get their US representative to notice you . Better yet , go with some other brand .
 The mechanism inside the step counter is `` loose '' so any movement adds steps . Also , the counter is on the side , as opposed to the top , and is difficult to read when you 're wearing it . For the money - it 's not worth a second look .
 I just ordered this pedometer and discovered that not only does the step function not work accurately -LRB- it said I went about 3 steps for every one actually taken -RRB- , but the fat % & BMI calculators were way off base . I had my fat % done recently by a fitness trainer and it was at least 10 % points off . I realize that it wo n't be 100 % accurate and could vary by a couple of % points , however 10 % is unacceptable . I shipped the item back the same day I received it and will stick to a basic pedometer without all the fancy features that can accurately measure how many steps I actually DO take . Do n't waste your money or your time on this product !
 The price of the product was fair . How the product works is less then acceptable . Claping on the the mouth of a fish works fine , but trying to release the fish from the device can be troublesome.Rapala Pro Guide Lock 'N Grip
 Not at all what I expected ... I ca n't get the straps to stay tight ... I would like to return them .
 This product is strictly for the non athletic person . The snowshoes were very heavy and hard to walk with . The straps and front toe inserts did not work very well . The heel strap did not fasten well . The front toe swivel did not swivel like it should making it very dificult to walk . Overall a very cheaply made snowshoe .
 I purchased these Optima snoeshoes about three years ago to use where limited floatation is needed . Despite all efforts the heel straps keep loosening up after only a few minutes and the shoe comes off making them worthless . These were inexpensive snowshoes and if the straps were not an issue I would have given them a 5 star rating .
 The bathing cap seems to be made okay but it is much smaller than I expected and I ca n't use it . It was a mistake buying it .
 I would expect a bathing cap to stay put when I stretch it over my head , but it does n't . It just shrinks itself back to its original shape and becomes a loose object on top of my head .
 I thought this was a waterproof bathing cap and when I received it I was gravely disappointed . I did not return the item as it would have been too much trouble for what it was worth .
 I ordered this bathing cap on January 21 , 2013 along with other items from a few sellers to create my mud run outfit for a charity race . All my items came in except my bathing cap . I emailed the seller in February and beechbee33 never responded back . So I had to order from a different seller and pay one day delivery for my item to arrive before the race . I am VERY dissappointed that this seller never contacted me that there was a problem . I order TONS of stuff through Amazon.com and have never had to give a bad review . I would have understood if the seller had contacted me to say they had to cancel my order , but I heard nothing .
 These things will give you a headache in 2 minutes . SO SMALL . Great for a kid but not for an adult with a normal head , and I do n't have any hair .
 It feels like polyester and is badly made . It arrived with one of the seams partly open a couple of inches .
 The product stayed firmly on my head but did n't keep my hair dry in the pool . I wanted something that would protect my hair from the drying effects of chlorine . I gave it to a friend who said she needed something she could use as a shower cap .
 I purchased this in hope of keeping my long hair dry while attending swim exercise classes at the Y. I do not go underwater in these classes , just barely `` touch '' the water during exercises . There is some splashing also but overall no dunking , etc. . While very comfortable this cap does NOT keep my hair dry . I am very disappointed in this purchase .
 ordered size XXL for my brother for christmas , he said it fit great overall but it was too short ! he 's 6 ' 5 '' and ussually an XXL sweatshirt fits just fine all over , including length . He loved the sweatshirt , so was disappointed that he had to return it !
 The third time the ball was thrown and hit the ground , it formed a bulge and lost all air . It was inflated below specs . You win some ... you loose some . Would n't bother to waste my money again .
 Here in Atlanta the Vick jersey price has been slashed drastically.Authentic go 's for $ 75.00 Replica is $ 25.00
 People should be selling Vick jerseys for next to nothing now ... they should PAY people to take them off their hands ... not charge for them ! Slash the price more than half and I 'll consider buy one or two ... so I can burn them !!!
 According to the description it sounds like an Instep or Pacific Outdoors goal.Not until you add it to the cart do the words `` Pacific Outdoors '' even appear.You are looking to purchase a DGA Mach V for $ 125 ? Yeah , me too.This is not it ... I was ready to purchase until the `` Pacific Outdoors '' appeared in my shopping cart -LRB- as the title of this item -RRB- . The DGA Mach V photo is a CROCK!Amazon , PLEASE REMOVE this item or change its image !
 The DGA M-14 is a much better basket then this one for a little more money . This seems like some cheap knock off of a DGA M-14 . I do like the red though even if I do n't like the way it catches and the chains rust.All that being said I have seen this basket for super cheap like $ 50.00 . At that price I 'd pick one up for my kids maybe.Disclaimer

 You 've got to have pretty skinny legs to fit into this . I train running and kickboxing , so my legs are way too thick .
 Quality appears good but the fit is terrible for the `` slim '' body-type . As shown in the picture , the front is baggy . They LOOK and FEEL like you are wearing a diaper . Beware , the elastic around the leg is extremely snug relative to other square-style trunks . A fan of the Speedo brand -LRB- briefs and trunks -RRB- , I did n't like the fit of these particular trunks at all .
 I buy size 34 and you shipp size to elephant.This is as size 44 , not 34
 Unless you like your thighs to feel like they have a tourniquet on them - do n't buy this suit . I have pretty thin legs being primarily a runner and not so much a swimmer and I feel like the circulation is being cut off in my thighs although they are plenty big in the waist and butt . These are going directly back to Amazon . Very strange cut in my opinion . I 've been doing triathlons for 22 years off and on and never had a suit fit so strangely . I will try again to find the Speedo suit I had previously .

 Save your money , I should have known better . I am a Clydesdale and laced this rim up for my fixed gear commuter bike . I have broken spokes on every ride . I will be re-lacing the hub to a Sun CR-18 rim that should hold up far better !
 This handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing . The adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable . Do n't risk your safety or your dollars on this product . It 's simply not worth the inexpensive price .
 The product arrived on time , but bent . I have no idea how something could get so twisted in shipping . The handle of the sword was at a 90 degree angle . It was amazing . It would have taken too long to send back , so I just bent it back into form .
 Received completely different product than the one pictured.The ones received are bearings with a cheetah print in a plastic box rather than the bearings in a Pig Tin as pictured !
 It is a sturdy product , but not a true Slo-Mo brand ball - it is a Cando ball , much heavier and firmer , which makes it less useful for rehab/exercise purposes , when you want it only half-inflated and quite squashy .
 Ball is made of a very high quality rubber compound that is very tough and resistant , but construction is very poor . When the ball is inflated , you can see thick and thin streaks throughout the surface . Surface of the ball is rough , not smooth as it appears in the pictures . Very out of round , has `` flatter '' spots . Definitly would not purchase again .
 This is an OK product . Solid and well made , except for the handle , which is unnecessarily flimsy . However , the company 's warranty is neither OK nor solid . And their service is useless.This is not a cheap bag , so I did n't just want to dump it while it was still in almost new condition -- but it might have been less of a pain.I sent this bag for in-warranty repair , and it was n't repaired right.Note
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 This item shipped super fast but as I opened the box I heard a rattle . As I took the item out of the packaging I found the button that separates the two halves to be broke . Being that I was heading out riding the next few days I didnt want to send it back and its a good thing I didnt because I ended up needing it a few times . Other than the button this is great I have used every tool on it .
 when i got the tool the button was broke off in the bag that was a bummer.Other than that its great just hard to open with the button broke .
 I do n't carry this with me ... lots of stuff but too heavy so it stays in my garage and is not used much . Thank you .
 Ordered this Topeak Alien II 26-Function Bicycle Tool on the `` Cyber Monday '' deal and instead received a Topeak Pocket Rocket bicycle pump with the sticker for the Alien II stuck on the package . Waiting to see if the exchange for the proper item goes smoothly or not . Never had this issue on an order before .
 This tool is far too expensive for what you can do with it.We put my son 's bike together with this tool , but we had to supplement it with other tools .
 As i got the tool , i was surprised ... its too small and i got really hard time to fix my bike .
 I was really excited about this purchase , only to find out the locking button is missing -LRB- the grey thing on the side -RRB- . I looked inside the Amazon shipping box but I could not find the piece -LRB- box was sealed when i got it -RRB- . I can only assume that it broke off before packaging . Shipping to return would cost me more than half the product cost as item is no longer in the states . I was n't really expecting this to happen since the item is directly sold by Amazon . The item looks really good and useful , but i guess its just a case of bad quality control and packaging .
 I bought this item . However , I am unable to find the suitable wrench to tighten my seat in my bicycle . There are duplicates of wrenches but none of my size . I really regret buying this item .
 I recently purchased the Topeak Alien II 26-function bicycle tool . I was extremely happy to receive the product , but sad that it did n't come with anything to attach to the bike itself . With that said , I went online again to purchase the Topeak F55 fixer Mount . I heard great reviews about both products via Amazon , as I am not too familiar with cycling and accessories . The only reason I have been buying products is for a fundraiser - the AIDS lifecycle ride in June . It is a ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles , and I 've been trying to train on a semi-regular basis . Yesterday was the FIRST DAY that I tried using both , yet by the end of a 10 mile ride I noticed that it was gone . The fixer mount was still there , but the bicycle tool was gone . My guess is it was a combination of the tool kits bag clip and the fixer mount . I did n't even get to use the tool once . Being that Topeak is supposed to be of high quality , I would have never imagined something like this happening ... especially on the first use ! I emailed Topeaks customer service , and all I got was `` DOES THE BRACKET ON THE BICYCLE LOOK DEFECTIVE AT ALL ? I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE PART JUST FELL OFF . DID YOU MAKE SURE THE BRACKET CLICKED TOGETHER SECURELY ? '' And yes , it did click in .
 It would be impossible to bike with this tool . It is very heavy . I wanted something simple to bike with . However , this tool would be good to use around your garage for fixing bike .
 I wish I had read the description better before buying . The frame is made of plastic and bends when the tool is used . I imagine it shattering when I drop it or use it.I would have gotten a similar tool with a metal frame had I read more carefully .
 I 've been using an original version of this tool for the past 5 years , and would still be , if not for losing half of it on the trail . I bought this newer version as a replacement and have used it for three weeks . I find it inferior : * Steel
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 used it for a week and then it started ripping at the seems ... it comes with 2 support bars to place at the ends of the cot which i didnt use because i didnt realize what they were for until i noticed the cot ripping at the seems but still i feel that the material shouldnt have given in within a week of using it .
 Says it holds 300lbs my husband is 6 ' 3 260 and the leg bent after 1 night of him sleeping on it . the games were fun though . I dont think this holds up to 300lb so if you are a bigger guy try a different cot .
 If you have a perfect swing , then this product may stand up to `` seasons of use , but if not , here are a few problems : - You have to choke up on your club because you are hitting off a raised platform . This is not a good idea when you 're working on your swing . - The hitting surface is small and fairly lightweight , it often moves after you hit the ball . - The hitting surface is made out of fiberboard -LRB- pressed paper-like layers of wood -RRB- . After many many swings , not all of them perfect , the bracket supporting the swinging ball has begun to rip off the hitting platform .
 I 'm totally AMAZED by this product for their ability to design and produce such a super piece of crap in literally all aspects ! People might make things with one or two weakness but these people they managed to make thing with all flaws ! I believe not many people can do this!PROS : The idea is good -LRB- a tethered golf ball allowing indoor practice without nets -RRB- and that 's it.CONS :1 -RRB- WEAK ARM
 What a waste of -LSB- ... -RSB- ! Might as well have gone to the driving range for a month . This device only lasted me a couple of days . Purchased it yesterday and used it a little . Used it this evening and destroyed the darn thing . The posts came right out of the cheap particle board after I hit the ball and string at the same time . Do n't waste your money !!! SWING GROOVER
 never had a chance to use it broke after a few hits . contacted the company twice to warratey or replace item and after 3 weeks no response
 No bolts to mount to the fiber board . First and I mean the very first swing , the simulated golf ball split into 4 pieces and flew all over my garage . Do n't buy , there has to be a better product out there .
 Ball is cheaply attached by glued , knotted nylon line , and came flying off with on first strike . Not only did the ball come off , but blew a hole in my garage siding . Very dangerous , and low quality .
 Put it together and it appeared very cheap/flimsy . I used it cautiously in my back yard using half swings with a wedge . It lasted about 6 of these half shots before the ball broke in half . I think any golfer would know this is not worth a purchase , but if your looking to buy it for a family member I would avoid unless its for a child .
 My goal was to find a backpack for laptops that was multifunctional and could carry quite a few things . Ideally I wanted this for school and work . I was looking a well constructed backpack , carried a laptop , could carry books and my lunch fairly easy , and had a chest strap . This pack does n't do that well and I will be returning as a result.Pros : Well constructed , many pockets , compression strapsCons : Poor layout , shoulder and chest straps not well fitted for my size , missing functional pockets i.e. mouse , laptop cords.If you look at the back pack more or less it looks fat at the bottom with a modular unit attached to the back and that is what it really is . Here is the major problem I have . I could n't put my books and/or lunch in this pack easily having my laptop , mouse , and laptop cord stored in it . What happens is you must use the modular outside pocket to store all your gadgets . So my mouse and laptop cord would take up some bulk and push back into the laptop/main compartment section which is where most of your cargo area is . As a result I constantly was trying to hold the opening of the main compartment open wide enough and put stuff in there . Once in there at the bottom there is plenty of room but you have the same problem removing items from the main compartment . When I moved the mouse and laptop cord to the bottom of the main compartment I could n't always fit my books inside without reaching down inside and moving them out of the way . All in all , it is pain to deal with constantly . I think the issue would be easily resolved if the outside compartment was extended further down so it does n't `` pinch '' the top . Either way I am taking this pack back and I am on to searching for a new one .
 Do n't buy this bike . It comes with a generic instruction manual for what appears to be all Huffy products . The diagrams look nothing like this bike . After getting it together , the derailers simply would n't shift . I used the awful manual in an attempt to adjust . The adjustment screws were not marked on the bike even tho the manual said they would be . The manual then said if you ca n't get it adjusted , take it to a bike shop . Yeah , and $ 50 later it will be fixed . After 3 hours I gave up and returned this and the womens model I bought for a refund .
 Wrong size for me . I 'm a big guy and this bike is to small . Bike got to my house damaged , I sent it back and the second time it arrived more damaged then the first bike . I repaired the second bike and gave it to a needy faimly . Good luck if tou buy from these people.Al Pelletier
 When the bike arrived , the paper box that contained it was a little torn . There are some missing parts when I tried to assemble this bike . I had to find a bike store to fix it .
 I got this bike for Christmas . I do n't know what the deal is with this bike . Maybe it was put together wrong , maybe I got the wrong parts but I can not turn and pedal at the same time because the pedal will scrape the tire . How is this even possible ?
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 I bought this tried it out and it is sooo lightweight that It did not work well , would not reccomend .
 Unless you like your thighs to feel like they have a tourniquet on them - do n't buy this suit . I have pretty thin legs being primarily a runner and not so much a swimmer and I feel like the circulation is being cut off in my thighs although they are plenty big in the waist and butt . These are going directly back to Amazon . Very strange cut in my opinion . I 've been doing triathlons for 22 years off and on and never had a suit fit so strangely . I will try again to find the Speedo suit I had previously .
 You 've got to have pretty skinny legs to fit into this . I train running and kickboxing , so my legs are way too thick .
 Quality appears good but the fit is terrible for the `` slim '' body-type . As shown in the picture , the front is baggy . They LOOK and FEEL like you are wearing a diaper . Beware , the elastic around the leg is extremely snug relative to other square-style trunks . A fan of the Speedo brand -LRB- briefs and trunks -RRB- , I did n't like the fit of these particular trunks at all .
 I buy size 34 and you shipp size to elephant.This is as size 44 , not 34
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 When we ordered this bike . It arrived poorly shipped . The box was beaten to a pulp . It was missing key part such as the seat post clamp . and it was the wrong seat post . Because the seat post was narrow to belong to the bike we purchased . We had to spend an additional $ 80 to have a bike repair shop fix the problem . The brakes were improperly adjusted and the main handle bar was bent and loose . Also the wheels were slightly bent which makes riding this bike very difficult . I would stay away from this bike .
 Do not buy this product . It came partially assembled in a box with several holes in it . No foam or other type protection . I should have known something because the rear derailer was sticking outside the box . The assembly directions were generic for all Huffy bikes . Pics of the handlebars , pedals , seat , etc looked nothing like this bikes . Instructions were OK for the brakes -LRB- as a kid , I adjusted these type brakes and luckily I remembered how -RRB- . The directions to adjust the gears and derailers however were absolutely awful . It said certain parts were marked that were not and after about two hours of trying I gave up . The directions even said that I should take it to a bike shop for adjustment of the gears . Yeah , for $ 75 !!! Needless to say , it was disassmebled and returned . Only good thing is Amazon 's tremendous return policy . Kudo 's to Amazon , but frowns to Huffy .
 I guess I am the only one reviewing this that thinks this unit doesnt work very well . It may be because I tried using it to replace a much more expensive unit that had broken and was used to a HUGE difference in perfomance . I ended up buying another expensive one and this Hunter is going in a garage sale . Live and learn . My Ecoquest is the only air purifier I need for about 1500 square feet of space and it is very quiet . It also features a sanitize option that kills bacteria . I guess I think by the time you buy enough of the Hunters to do a good job you could buy a GOOD unit . And you dont have purifiers sitting all over the house , something I would find annoying .
 I bought this watch a few months ago and already shows some problems , it worked OK for a couple of weeks , but now the dial light would not turn on . I suspect that the battery is running down , which is unnacceptable for a brand new item . I have no solution other than taking it to a shop to check . I ca n't hide that i am dissapointed with the NIKE experience .
 This was a terrible buy I ordered an adult Nike Triax and recieved a child 's Triax I was so embarrassed that it barely fit around my wrist . The worst part was that it was n't even a good deal for ten more dollars which is what I payed for shipping . I could have got an adult sized watch at the local sports store .

 Not durable , broke off clip in a short time . I have had other cases that lasted for over a year , this one only several weeks .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!

 we bought this for our 2 year old 's birthday . He is very small . We were carefull to find the smallest bike available for him we could find in the area . Do n't buy it . The pedals are on the front wheel instead of in the middle of the bike because it is not chain driven . By the time he was able to reach the pedals , we had already bought him a 12 inch bike instead . Do n't waste your money . Get a 12 in normal bike . Not to mention it was n't red . It was strawberry shortcake pink !! So I had to repaint it before we gave it to him for his birthday .
 Rather than push out the pin in the chain link , the tool 's pushpin sheared in half.I suspect that part may have been defective , though , and this review is n't a blanket condemnation of the Super tool or Topeak.The reason why is , I was able to complete the chain repair using the chain tool included in my Topeak Alien II multitool . No problem with that one . So Topeak can make a chain tool that works . I might have just gotten a bum pushpin in my Super.I bought the Super in the first place because I figured the chain tool in the Alien II would be flimsy . The Alien II chain tool was to be a backup , and it performed well.I 'll probably replace this with the more expensive Park CT-3 , though .
 Admittedly , the product description does not mention a tray . However , it was my -LRB- erroneous -RRB- assumption that coolers of this type included trays because they used to.The fact that it does not is a major deficiency in my view
 My holster was never delievered nor were my E-Mails answered , this company is a rip off .
 I have two 70 qt max cold coolers and they are great !!! the 120 qt max cold is junk especially for $ 150 . I returned the first one I ordered thinking it was defective and ordered a second . The lid was the same as the first . Gaps around the front corners . The lid does n't seal . I returned the second and will spend the extra money and get an Engle or a Yetti . Igloo , has some serious design flaws on these larger coolers !!!
 The cooler is large . I am 6 ' 2 '' and can climb inside and close it from the inside . Stuff stays very cold . I purchased it to keep equipment cold in the back of a Subaru Baja pickup with a camper shell . It fits perfectly.The latch is horribly fragile . Never latch it unless you need to as you will have about a dozen snaps before it breaks . The replacement parts cost $ 15 with shipping and handling . They should be mailed free because of their pathetic design defect . You can always string a bungie cord between the handles to keep it closed . ; -RRB-
 Just bought this product 3 weeks ago , within the first 3 days of owning it the left pedal broke . And now today the left side is broken . The screw that was holding the left side literally broke in half . Its not even worth the 85 dollars I paid for it . I say save your money and spend a little bit more to buy a better product . Unless you want to keep tighting screws and dealing with a half working machine .
 Had the machine for 1 week , left pedal bolt sheared . This machine is a counterfeit `` Orbitrek '' , same design with same flaws . No numbers included for parts and warranties .
 This machine broke within a couple days of recieving it . It started out being very loud . It sounded as if something were rubbing against the pedal . Then the pedal just broke .
 My son uses this for his school books and by the 3rd day , the fabric had frayed and the rope came through the hole .
 I should have known that the deal was too good to be true and you get what you pay for . When Amazon offered this compass for almost half of Brunton 's price I jumped on it . However , the compass has defects that should have sent it to the reject bin instead of to Amazon , such as the mirror aligning line is off center and there is dirt inside of the glass on the compass face . I will return it if I can get my money back .
 The link says 561 Portable Camp Toilet Replacement Bags and so does the title when you open the link . You have one little line that says Portable Camp Toilet Replacement Bags . 12 Per Package . This ad was very misleading bordering on fraud I would say . If you are going to use the item number in the title make sure it is clear that it is the item number . The title should have been Item number 561 Portable Camp Toilet Replacement Bags . As far as the bags go they are see through not quite what I wanted the ones in the ad are shown white hence non transparent mine are more like a freezer bag . I can not comment on the smell coming through the bags as others have yet . I can tell you I will not be buying these again I will be looking for a place to make sure I get the white ones or will go to Sams club and buy a bulk box of small heavy duty trash bags .1 . The ad was misleading thought we were getting 561 bags2 . Bags feel cheap3 . Bags are Clear
 yes they are bags , but outside of that , they are not odor proof or see proof . Both those problems will not get me to buy them again .
 Scope was received in a Nikon scope box . The scope was possibly a demo model or was handled by someone . You are supposed to receive Nikon flip covers for this model of scope . They were removed from the box and I never received them .
 $ 108.50 ??? Are you kidding me ? Let alone the $ 179.99 starting price . This Hopper is $ 89.95 if you get it directly from Empire . Why on earth anyone would over pay for this is beyond me .
 I saw this online and figured it would be perfect for my dad 's `` man cave '' . Although I was pretty disappointed when it arrived and was just a little bigger than a standard notebook and extremely flimsy . It 's still a neat little thing to have , but do n't expect too much .
 When I bought this sign I thought it would be about twenty inches or so in width . It is n't . It is only about 14 inches . Made kind of cheaply . But it did n't cost very much so I am happy with what I got for what I paid
 i just got a wrong item , but Eastbay called me before i got the item and promised me to send me back the correct item , but since i live outside EUA it will cost me a lot of money to send the wrong item back so i decided to let things that way and keep the item i got , finally Eastbay/Amazon credit me part of the money i spent in the transaction .

 It 's extremely difficult to find these shirt stays anywhere . This was the only site I was able to find them on . Shipping was prompt and I had no problems ordering , however they broke after only a few wears . My husband uses these on a regular basis and he 's gone through 4 of them already . One strap broke the first time he put them on . They have good service , but the product does n't hold up to everyday use .
 I own these shirt stays in the white color and I hate them.They 're great when they work correctly , but they are a very bad design . The clips do not stay clipped unless you really jam the fabric up under the loop , and even then they do n't always stay where you want them . I have also found that they stretch out over a relatively short period of time -LRB- but then again , they are only $ 5 for a set -RRB- . You get what you pay for . There 's nothing quite like feeling squared away only to be walking down the hall or talking to someone important and have your shirt stay pop off and fall out the leg of your trousers.I recommend either the hidden tailor or finding another brand of shirt stay that uses a real clip rather than just a rubber/metal loop design that relies entirely on friction and constant tension .
 Kind of touchy to get clipped on and broke in several weeks of daily use . Would not buy again .
 After 30 minutes of wearing these I got my first nut check from one in front that snapped off . I went straight to the restroom at work and took them off .
 i 'VE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OVER TEN YEARS & HAVE BEEN WEARING SHIRT STAYS JUST AS LONG . I 'VE WORN THESE SAME TYPES OF STAYS MY WHOLE CAREER & HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM UNTIL THE LAST 2 SETS I 'VE PURCHASED INSIDE OF 1 YEAR . I 'M GUESSING THAT THEY 'RE MAKING THEM WITH CHEAPER MATERIAL & OR MAKING THEM SHORTER . I 'M 6 ' 4 '' & I 'VE TRIED THEM EVEN WITH PENNIES AS ANCORS & THEY STILL SNAP LOOSE . I 'M ACTUALLY THINKING OF HAVING MY OWN MADE BECAUSE I HATE LOOKING SLOPPY . AGAIN , DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOUR WELL UNDER 6 ' TALL . GOOD LUCK !
 Military shirt stays must be used by people that are taller than 5 ' but shorter than 6 ' 2 . These shirt stays are capable of winning the war for the enemy . When the packaging was made up for the product did anyone actually look at what the military actually needed or did they they try to sell the military something else that they did not need ? In a field modification I will change a few things on these military shirt stays and hope that I do n't hurt myself . Unfortunately I do n't have many options for a refund since I need them for July 8 . Eureka , the manufacturer hates our military and is intent on selling them equipment that could get our service members injured .
 These are clearly youth-sized . If my knees are bent and I 'm wearing knee socks I can attach these but walking is impossible -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 10 -RRB- . Ca n't judge the quality because I ca n't use them . Will be returning .
 These are way too short . I read the reviews before I purchased these and wished I would 've paid attention and not purchase these .
 This was my first time trying shirt stays . I found the clips to be flimsy and they would only work on the thinnest of materials . I have n't given up on finding a solution , but these were not it .
 these must be designed for use with knee socks they are very short in comparison to the shirt stays I 've had before . These are maybe 12 '' fully extended .
 Do n't waste you money . One of the stays came apart the second time I used it . Very poor quality . Metal pieces are cheap and poorly put together .
 Used these once , and the bands started fraying and ripped by the second attempt to wear them . Yes I 've used these for years for my dress uniforms and the ones I used before -LRB- military issue im guessing from army barracks -RRB- I can not find . I bought these hoping for the same standard but they are sub par and in the trash .
 These stays do not have clamps -- rather they have a buttonhole on both ends . To use them , you need buttons on both your shirts and socks .
 Extremely short , I am 6 ' and even extended to their max they are way to short . On top of that the clip button attachmets keep poping off my shirt if the shirt material is at all thick . I would personally look elsewhere .
 the quality is ok , but they are too short ; and i have worn shirt stays for 20 + years . if you are over 5 ' tall , order somthing else . even with the adjustment as long as they could go , they are too short .
 These shirt stays are shorter than my normal stays by 3-4 inches . I 'm 5 ' 8 '' and have to set them to their maximum length . Even at that setting they are are n't long enough to make them comfortable . They are so tight that I just bought a different set from a military base - much better .
 The clips on these things are made for light weight material like nylon stockings . The sock end works ok , but clipping the things to a shirt with heavier material and getting them to hold is a pain in the neck .
 It 'll hold like the military shirt stays , but one of the ends will rub on your legs when you 're constantly walking . The ohter thing is it 's not long as the actual military shirt stay . Might as well go to the actual military surplus to buy it .
 Clasp do not hold well and do not fasten well they come undone allot so I stopped using them and I am going to purchase a better pair
 THEY STRETCHED OUT AFTER A WEEK . . THEY WERE ALWAYS POPING OFF AND THE CLIPS WOULD NEVER STAY CLAMPED DOWN . I WOULD NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN.AND YES I DID USE THEM EXACTLY AS DIRECTED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS . POOR QUALITY PRODUCT . THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT ONE STAR I HAD TO PICK SOMETHING OTHERWISE I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THEM ANY STAR .
 I wore these three times before they fell apart . The elastic began to unravel/fray and the metal brackets broke . Cheap , cheap , cheap .
 The clips are very cheaply made and the stiching will irritate your legs like crazy . It feels like they were stiched with fishing line .
 Sorry to say this , but they were useless . I 've already thrown them away . I 'm 6ft tall and had the straps extended all the way and they were still too short . The straps were always coming loose . I would literally be standing still and one would pop off . I 've had several types of shirt stays and these are the worst . I do n't like giving bad reviews , but it is what it is .
 there are way too short . ca n't use them . I can not recommend this procduct . not a great deal . hate them
 I am a police officer . I bought these to wear with my unifirm for work . They were extremely difficult to put on , and then they would not &#34; stay ! &#34; The plastic clips are very poor quality and kept popping off ! I would not recommend these to anyone !
 Rothco Black Military 4-Piece Shirt Stays are cheap and poorly made and I do not recommend them to anyone . They do not stay clipped as they should and I am constantly having to reattach them .
 Im not exactly a giant so i expected these to fit me fairly well . I was wrong , these straps look like they should be worn be an eight year old boy they are so short . Or maybe i just need some thigh high socks -LRB- i doubt thoses are military standard anyway -RRB- My point is if your over 5 ' 8 i would not suggest buying these . This product is for short men
 These are too short use unless you wear a very long shirt and have dress socks that go almost up to your ankle -LRB- I am average height -RRB- . Needs to be longer .

 The mixer was cheaply made . The top knob fell off ofter 2 uses . I just bought a hose mixer from the garden department for less money .
 Have used this mixer a couple times , not thrilled with it.Dispences liquid very slowly after the first couple uses.Seems like its not working right . Ran engine for fifteen min.did not empty cup . .
 This pump works reasonably well on Presta vales . It does not work on the more common Schrader valves . It does not adequately depress the pin in the stem of the Schrader valve to allow air to flow into the tire . In addition , the on-board air pressure guage was woefully inaccurate . When I checked tires using a variety of alternative pressure guages , I found them to be significantly more inflated than the air guage on the pump had indicated.Bottom line
 Received one of these pumps as a gift . Within one year , the gauge read 20 lbs too high -LRB- read 20 lbs . with no pressure -RRB- and the plastic piece that holds the handle to the pump broke at one of the hinge points . The pump was well taken care of and never abused . Topeak no longer has a contact number and wo n't respond to emails about buying replacement parts . These pumps are overpriced and are throw-aways when something breaks .
 I bought this Topeak JoeBlow Pro Floor Bike Pump in 2009 . Within a year a component needed replacing . I called Topeak . They said they would send me a new part ... as soon as it was produced . They would NOT send me a full replacement . So I actually used an old falling apart pump until Topeak produced the component , which took a few weeks . That alone is pretty poor customer service and does not say much for their product . Now ... today ... the part of the pump that attaches to the tire broke . Its out of warranty . This pump was expensive . It was NOT worth the money . Background on me
 I had a Topeak for several years and when it finally died I bought another . That one lasted a month and its replacement lasted two weeks . Ca n't find spare parts for these pumps either . Do n't know what happened but they feel flimsier and cheaper . Forked out for an SKS AirBase Pro -LRB- completely rebuildable when parts wear out -RRB- and do n't plan on buying another pump for a VERY long time .
 Pump was great while it worked . Bought in May ' 09 , the valve broke yesterday -LRB- wo n't seal , plus pin fell out -RRB- . Was only used on Presta valves , was used about 3 times a week .
 This is in general an excellent pump . We used it for a couple of weeks with no issues . However with the guage up top this pump is extremely top heavy , particularly when given its narrow base . If you have it sitting in your garage it falls over with the slightest touch , if its bumped or even with a slight gust of wind outside . After it slams in to the concrete a few times the guage no longer is accurate , no surprise . If you buy this pump make sure you lay it down , or hang it up when you are not using it or its guage is going to be worthless in short order . Topeak makes other pumps with much wider , more stable , bases , I recommend one of those if you want your guage at the top . If you want a narrow base pump , I suggest you get one with the guage at the base , then falling over will not put so much force in to the guage when it falls over and hits the floor.Update : My wife now hates this pump , since it bit a chunk out of her finger . Apparently the lever on the head snaps back with a lot of force and the slot it goes back in to has a very sharp edge . Another aspect of bad design .
 Worked properly on only about 60 % of bike or car tires . Would not depress tire valves enough to pump air into the other 40 % of tires . For those tires that it worked on it did a nice job . After about a year of infrequent use -LRB- maybe used one a month -RRB- the pump would no longer form an airtight seal on any valve stem . A cheap Bell bike pump costing 1/4 what this cost works on all tires and has lasted twice as long so far .
 I bought this pump with high hopes of it lasting forever and being easy to get up to high pressure . My first lesson learned was that the flip valve -LRB- that secures the pump on your tire -RRB- releases VERY quickly -LRB- read
 I bought this pump a little over a year ago thinking it would be the last pump I would have to buy for years -LRB- as some reviews claim -RRB- . I ride a lot and pump-up my tires every time , so this is an important tool for me . I did a lot of research and saw so many good reviews and I liked many of the features , so I went ahead and splurged for this pricey pump . Within the 1st few uses , I learned that the locking lever on the head will quickly snap back when releasing it from your tire . Since the lever neatly retreats into a sharp-edged groove , it will bite anything in its way . I 've gotten blood blisters on fingers and the palm of my hand from flipping the lever down while trying to pull it off the stem . -LRB- minus 2 stars for the pain -RRB- The head also stays so firmly attached to the stem that you have to pull hard to get it off after flipping the lever down to release it . When it finally lets go , your hand gets smashed into the spokes - not very pleasant with blade spokes . -LRB- minus 1 point -RRB- Then it started to make a terrible groaning/squeeking sound on the downstroke while pumping . A little embarassing , but still worked well pumping my tires to 120psi . -LRB- minus 1 star for the noise -RRB- Recently , the pin holding the lever in the head popped-out . I was able to get it back in , but since then the pump will not hold air . -LRB- minus 1 more star -RRB- That should leave this with zero stars , but it did work for awhile .
 I bought this pump because the pressure gauge is mounted at the top of the air cylinder where it is easy to see while pumping , which is a very nice feature . However , within a year the so called SmartHead -LRB- takes both Presta and Schraeder valves without adjustment -RRB- failed . The locking lever pivot pin popped out and air leaked out of the pressure head near the pivot point . Re-seating the pin did not fix the problem . I contacted Topeak and they sent me a new SmartHead . It worked for a while , but this morning it failed again . The failure mechanism was exactly the same . There must be s serious design flaw in the SmatHead . I am now seeing this same failure being reported in other on-line reviews .
 Worked very well for several months , then would not form a seal . Even bought a rebuild kit from Topeak , but did not work . The head is junk .
 I 've had this product a few years . In season , I 'm a nearly daily cyclist and keep my tires topped off pretty religiously . This pump has worked well , has a smart couple of features for securing the plunger and the head , and has an easy-to-read dial with an index dial so you can mark your preferred pressure . All good . But this morning , I was going out for a ride , and accidentally dropped the head onto the garage floor . This is the first time I 've dropped it that I can recall . I figured `` surely they test these things for 20-30 drops onto concrete , given that it 's a garage tool '' . Well , maybe they do , but this one apparently broke on the first drop . The head is no longer airtight , rendering the pump useless . I futzed around with it for a few minutes to try to see if I could find/fix the problem , but no dice . No ride for me this morning.I feel that a quality garage-use bike pump should last for years of abuse . I never abused this one , so I ca n't rate it very well .
 Great the first six months , then the gauge stopped working and the lever on the inflator broke . Will not buy again .
 I really liked this pump at first . I check my tire pressure every time I ride so this pump got used 5-6 times a week . It 's a home pump only . I was n't crazy about how top heavy it is , but that 's a minor issue.I 'm rating it one star because the pin in the head loosened and the only customer support I got was an offer to sell me another one . The new one is now failing in the same way so I 'm guessing it 's a design issue .
 I bought this pump over others based on the reviews here . Let me now add mine . Bought in March 2012 . The pump worked fine for a few months , now will not seal on a presta valve . I will get in touch with Topeak , but I would discourage you from wasting your time with this one.Update 10/07/12
 The needle on the gauge falls off if the bike pump is not upright . I was able to pop the gauge open and replace the needle , but then the gauge did n't work correctly .
 I 'd swear the foot on this pump is engineered to have the pump tip over/fall onto the pressure gauge . The head clamp lever springs closed so hard it will blister your finger . I 've had this pump for two years and the gauge is off 10 psi too high at 110 psi . While it pumps up tires well , it just is n't ergo friendly .
 Did my research but it did not help in the end . Product is poorly designed and not durable . I hate a pump that falls over so easily . Also it was a chore to pull off of the valve everytime . I felt as if I was going to tear out my valve stem . It never got better . Three months in , air would just blow out the nozzle when I locked it on the stem . Feed up with poor quality topeak products , I bent pump in half and sent it to the to trash with my last Topeak Joe Blow . My last Topeak purchase .
 First head lasted about 6 months , had to pay Topeak to ship a new one . Second head lasted about 6 months . Heads work great untiul the seals stop sealing . Wo n't pay Topeak for another one . It 's been used only on presta valves , about twice a week and well-cared for otherwise . Wo n't be buying another .
 I purchased the pump for use on my bike and car . It 's useless for the car since its next to impossible to secure the air valve to the tire valve properly .
 Piece of junk . Do NOT buy this brand . Looks great , does n't work . They 're able to sell this brand because of the design , not functionality .
 This is my second Nike Triax watch . The first watch the band broke in half after 3 years of use . I bought this watch because I liked the functionality and the look of the watch . Now , a couple of years later the band on the watch has broken and the rubber on the body is coming unglued.The band itself costs $ 18 and it must be sent out to be repaired which will add at least another $ 10 . Repairing the watch will end up costing half as much as the entire watch itself.Also , my watch had a tendency to reset sporadically from static . I would remove my jacket and the watch would beep and reset .
 Watch band only lasts about 8 months , can not buy a new one so watch is trash . Not good on your wallet or our earth .
 I liked all the functions on this watch , especially the large display , which is why I bought it . It broke after about 2 years , and like most small electronic devices , is n't cost-effective to fix . I have a Timex sports watch that 's 12 years old and still going strong . Never again ... Also hated the instructions - this huge foldout sheet with all the directions in tiny text in a whole bunch of languages . Clumsy and hard to follow.Just stupid . Nike should know better .
 I can not give a positive or negative opinion about the watch , as up to today I have NOT received it .
 Beware . My Nike watch worked great , but after a year the band broke where it connects to the watch housing . To my surprise Nike does not sell band replacements . Watch still works , but now I ca n't wear it . Get ready to buy a new watch if you want to have a Nike one . I wo n't be among you .
 I 've never broken a watch in my life until I got this watch . The first one broke where the band meets the body within a week . The retailer replaced it with a different one . The replacement broke in the same spot within six months . In neither case did I put any stress on the watch , it literally fell off my wrist . Nike used to be a decent brand , now it 's apparently overpriced sweatshop junk .
 The quality is not up to par . I have returned the Nike Triax 50 model two times.The first one worked fine but the rubber started separating from the body . Nike replaced the watch without problems.The replacement worked during one workout . Before the next workout , I went to set the intervals but it got stuck in one screem . It is now stuck in what appears to be the clock or alarm setting mode as the screen shows 12:00 . I can not get it to change screens or anything for that matter no matter which button I press . I am returning it once again .
 I originally recieved this watch for Xmas and I had it out of the box for 10 seconds and the orange button on the face of the watch fell off . I returned it for the same watch and I have only been wearing it on runs for 3 weeks . I got home and the lower left button fell off . The watch is great with all of the functions it has but as far as realiabilty I would not recommend this watch .
 I had my Nike Triax Speed 50 Super Watch # WR0083-002 watch for less than 1 year . The watch band broke where it attaches to the watch frame . I love the watch and it 's been working great , however I can not find a replacement band . Not a good product if Nike is not going to provide support for the consumer .
 This was my second Triax watch and my second bad experience . I had the watch for about 5 days and it locked up . None of the buttons would work . I replaced the battery and it still would n't work so I returned it .
 I am a big fan of Nike Triax watches , but had bad luck with this model . I had the watch for about 4 weeks and in that time it reset itself once and finally locked up - all of the buttons stopped responding . Replacing the battery had no effect and I had to return it . Additionally , the button on the face is a little too large and is too sensitive to accidental contact . When I would check the time I more often than not had to play with the buttons because I had inadvertently switched to some other mode . On the plus side , it is very comfortable and the display is easy to read .
 what a hassle . i 've had it 9 months , and not worn it frequently , and the band just breaks . part pinned in to the face has the rubbery material break into pieces . ugh ! i would expect it from a $ 10 watch , but not $ 100 . my sports watch i bought at target works better ! do not recommend .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 i had ordered these a few days ago and instead of 12 , I got 1 ! not pleased !
 Bag was inexpensive and gets the job done in terms of cushion and wheels . The knock is that it is bulky for my golf bag and I 'm using a cart bag , not a walking bag . Would be doubly so for a walking bag . Almost as if it was not developed for a golf bag . This difffers from my previous soft bags which have hugged my clubs/bag well making it easy to carry w / the shoulder strap . I will have to use the wheels at all times on this one . Great for a golf trip with the boys b/c you could probably fit all of your clothes in here as well .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 Unless you like your thighs to feel like they have a tourniquet on them - do n't buy this suit . I have pretty thin legs being primarily a runner and not so much a swimmer and I feel like the circulation is being cut off in my thighs although they are plenty big in the waist and butt . These are going directly back to Amazon . Very strange cut in my opinion . I 've been doing triathlons for 22 years off and on and never had a suit fit so strangely . I will try again to find the Speedo suit I had previously .
 You 've got to have pretty skinny legs to fit into this . I train running and kickboxing , so my legs are way too thick .
 Quality appears good but the fit is terrible for the `` slim '' body-type . As shown in the picture , the front is baggy . They LOOK and FEEL like you are wearing a diaper . Beware , the elastic around the leg is extremely snug relative to other square-style trunks . A fan of the Speedo brand -LRB- briefs and trunks -RRB- , I did n't like the fit of these particular trunks at all .
 I buy size 34 and you shipp size to elephant.This is as size 44 , not 34
 This is a simple product that is easy enough recommended to others to use , since it is doing what it is supposed to and does n't have any visible physical defects .
 After I bought this product , I realized that it is almost like the sandpaper in my drawer , except it has adhesive on the back . Very abrasive hand feel after i wrapped it on my hammer .
 I will right a review when I receive my friggin ' paid for purchase ... . So far nothing . Contacted them once they said they re-shipped it . I 'm not sure where they shipped it to ? Total crap . If they have a problem delivering it they should contact me . So far no email traffic unless I initiated it . So `` NO STARS ''

 Granted , this is a low end Nike watch , I have a higher end Nike watch . I also have an Ironman Watch . I like the Ironman watches and you can get an Ironman watch that has these features for about $ 20 . Also , I had to send the first watch back . The backlight would not go off and no data -LRB- time/date or other features -RRB- worked or could be shown . So all I had was a blank backlit watch . However , despite my negative review and the issue of the watch -LRB- broken , however probably an isolated incident -RRB- , I decided for a replacement vice a refund . And Amazon.com did a great and quick job fixing the situation . We 'll see how this watch works out . I kept the watch not for the functions , more so so I can rotate with my other watches and it has a pretty good look .
 I bought this watch to give my sister as a birthday gift . However , I am totally disappointed . This is very big for girls :-LRB- -LRB- I will send this back to amazon .
 This pump was a letdown . That is a shame because it appears to be quite solid and well built . The air gauge high on the pump made it nice to read . The only problem I encountered , and it was a deal breaker , was the head would not consistently make a good seal on either Presta or Schrader valves . I am convinced that they have not really developed a head that is capable of fitting both types of valves and I do n't care for the delicate nature of the dual head models . I returned this pump because it simply was not usable with this head . I intend to purchase a quality pump exclusively made for Presta valves - probably a Lezyne or Silca . I will use my old one for the rare times I need to fill a Schrader valve .

 The watch itself is working , but one of the buttons stoped working after 5 days.I sent an e-mail to the seller asking what I should do to return it and get another one and the seller simply ignored my e-mail . If you want to buy this watch go ahead , but do not buy it from Watchsavings .
 the quality of this product is fine , however it runs on the small side ... if you normally take a medium be sure to order a size large for comfort ...

 even for someone like me with small wrists , this looks like a girls watch . the band looks nice . the face is also small making the clock and numbers a bit more difficult to read . the backlight is not very good . feels a bit cheap .

 this lights instructions were wrong but i was able to set it up anyways , and it worked great with no problems , but after a 28 mile bike ride the darn thing started to cause a lot of drag so when i got home i checked it out and the casing melted , its alright for short rides but if your wanting to keep it for any reasonable amount of time invest your money elsewhere
 This was kind of a strange product . Amazon shipped me an open container , which started things off on the wrong foot . I was tempted to just return it because I did n't want to install it and find that it was defective . I did install it and found that the instructions were incorrect . They indicated that the generator relied on a ground connection to complete the circuit . I found this odd because the generator itself had 2 connectors on it . When I consulted the instructions I learned that 1 connector was for the front light and 1 for the rear . Usually , the these are just wired together . Upon installation , the product did not work even when I explicitly wired the ground . I found that it worked fine when I wired the light to the two terminals on the generator . In other words , it does not rely on a ground.Anyway , it works if you ignore the instructions . It is noisy but I guess it is okay for the price . If you really want a generator powered light , it is better to spend the money and get a generator hub .
 First of all the product DID arrive very promptly but I was disappointed to see that the outside of the box very plainly listed what the contents was , which was annoying because it was a Christmas gift for my husband but luckily he did not see it.Second , when I opened the box the poker chips from one of the stacks had broken open and the poorly made chips were all over the inside of the case . I looked at them closely and found the pain job on them to be terrible and they in no way resembled `` casino style '' poker chips.Upon further inspection I noticed that the inside of the case was ripped apart in numerous sections , the card boxes were all crinkled.And to top it off they do not supply you with a receipt or way to ship the product back to them . So i 'm having to go through amazon now and wait for the seller to get back to me . I 'll write an up-date when I get that all figured out.luckily I found an awesome , and very nice looking/feeling , set at Big 5 for only $ 20 and you get 300 more chips . Totally worth the price .
 Description does n't match the product ... pictures do n't match the product . I actually like the look of the chips a little better than the ones pictured . The aluminum case has an aluminum frame with cheap plastic panels . I 've seen way cheaper sets with better cases than this one . Also , the case has a nice deep scratch in the `` alum-plastic '' panel right out of the styrofoam packaging . I knew I was getting a deal with the price so low , so I expected it to be kind of a cheesy set . The chips are mediocre and about what I expected . I have n't played with them yet , but they appear to be usable . But it 's a lot cheaper than expected ... especially since it seems to have so many great reviews . That and the non-matching item to the pics leads me to wonder if they ran out of the set everyone is raving about , and sent me a cheaper set as a replacement .
 The printing on the chips is all-over the place ; looks like a four year old painted the chips , paint is fading , no clear lines etc. . I wish i could return this item but shipping is prohibitively expensive . Would go for better quality next time .
 The denomination stickers are a pain - they peel off too easily and often cause chips to stick together . Not sure what constitutes `` clay composite '' , but nowhere near as nice or heavy as clay chips .
 I have ordered the white cap in a large twice in the past . This time I ordered the purple one and it was much smaller than the white and I had to return it - very disappointing . The white worked well when i had it , however , with regular swimming it does need to be replaced every year or so as it eventually rips .
 I bought this because I have been searching for a comfortable swim cap that comes in large . Felt good when I put it on , but when I put my head in the water , it was so buoyant , I had to force my head into position for swimming . It may be great for paddling around , but not a good choice for lap swimming !
 the title sys it all-the stapbreaks immediately-and is not replaced or refunded after the 1st event
 My friend and I both bought this . We loved the cool retro look and the promise of it keeping our hair dryer . And it get high marks on both counts . However , after having it about a month , both of us found it had developed tears .
 This cap does not do anything to keep water out . It does not matter if the chin strap is on or not . I would not purchase again .
 I was so excited to finally find a swim cap to keep my hair dry during swimming . I thought I found it but My Swim Cap does not work at all . It is more comfortable and easy to put on but does not keep the hair dry . I did notice that less water got into the cap than my normal silicon cap , but non-the-less my hair was still wet . If you are looking for comfort , buy it . If you want to keep your hair dry , do not purchase .
 Strap broke the first time I used it . It came off at the edge , the clip part broke when I was trying to tighten it the very first time !!
 This swim cap overs my head but it does n't keep the water out ! What 's the point of a cap if my hair still gets wet ?
 I was happy with this swim cap at first . But after a few weeks , the snap tore away from the body of the cap . Wish I could get my money back .

 Mine worked for a couple of weeks -LRB- using it on presta only -RRB- and then suddenly simply would not form a seal anymore . i tried all the instructions that others have posted to get a seal - but they simply wo n't work for me . I am going back to a 2 ` prong '' head , as my ` smarthead ' has unfortunately dumbed itself down .
 Do n't waste your time & money on this product.The head does n't make a good seal on the valve -LRB- Schraeder or Presta -RRB- , and you 'll drop dead before the tire 's fully inflated .
 It was sold to work with hed3 wheels it does not . I now have to purchase a pump head from someone else or find an adapter . NOT A HAPPY CAMPER
 Seemed `` smart '' at the time . Worked okay for a couple of weeks , easily for presta , inconsistently for Schrader values -LRB- it would take two or three tries to get the value to open -RRB- . Then it stopped working at all for Schrader valves . This is pretty much worthless at this point . Going back to the Twinhead .
 I bought this upgrade kit so I could pump up my tires on my HED 3 wheels , which have a limited width of space to connect the nozzle onto the presta valve . It fit perfectly and locks on the valve very well . I also use it for my other set of wheels and it works great too . All around it works with probably all wheels from standard to aero wheels with deep rims . I have the Joe Blow Sport Pump and it connected very easily . -------- update August 3 2012 ---------- Unfortunately it does n't attach anymore . The spring in it that I believe pushes back is completely jammed & I 've tried everything to loosen it , with no success . Unfortunately this problem happened to me right before my triathlon making me scramble around for a crack pipe . Not sure if it 's worth $ 20 for two years of occasional use . I 'm really bummed as it used to work well . I 'm not sure if I 'm going to buy another one for my HED 3 wheels or if there is something better out there .
 This clamp-on air chuck is solidly constructed of quality materials , but I think it must be poorly designed for the following reason . It is easy to push it onto a schrader valve too far so the lever wo n't lock in the up position , and you risk damaging the schrader valve if you try to force it . It is also easy to not push it on far enough so you do n't get air into the tire . What is not easy is attaching it `` just right '' so it works . The sweet spot between these two extremes is so narrow that I hit it in only 1 out of 10 tries . From now on I am using a screw-on air chuck -LRB- as on Lezyne pumps -RRB- and have found them to be much much less hassle . ToPeak makes good pumps , I just wish they made a screw-on air chuck .
 got this as a replacement for a bad hose on my old Zefal pump . Works poorly on schrader valves i.e. does n't reliably press the valve so that when you pump you just pressurize the hose w/o putting air in the tire . I am putting it in the dumpster . Did n't need the presta ability anyway .
 I bought this pump to replace a Schwinn standup bicycle pump I bought in 1975 that finally broke ... at least , the hose did . The all-metal construction of the rest of the pump probably would 've lasted another three decades . I bought the Joe Blow based on price and good reviews here on Amazon.com . First thing I noticed upon unpacking it is that materials ai n't what they used to be . The pump is mostly plastic ; the metal compression tube is thin metal -- I think that may be the only metal part of the entire machine . The cheapness is borne out by the manufacturer 's unbelievable pride and confidence in their product by offering an astounding 90 day warranty . That last sentence was satire ; hopefully you got it.On the plus side , the pump has a dual schrader/presta nozzle , which is handy . My old trusty Schwinn was schrader , so I had to keep a presta adapter handy for my bike . Unfortunately , this dual nozzle makes it bulky , and I had trouble fitting it over the schrader valves of my cars to inflate the tires because of the tight clearance between the valve and the rims . Also , the gauge on the Joe Blow is hideously innaccurate . Not even in the ballpark on the two bike tires and eight automobile tires I inflated , then doublechecked with my AccuMaster tire gauge -LRB- `` Best stinkin ' tire gauge in the entire Universe '' according to Click & Clack , and I do n't doubt it ... -RRB- . So far off as to be utterly useless.One more complaint
 I bought this pump for my bike 's 700 x 23 tires which require for my weight a pressure of 115 psi . Shamefully this pump was not able to get air in the tire above 90 psi - even when I put my whole weight on the handlebar -LRB- fearful of a serious explosion ;--RRB- -RRB- nothing happened.I picked a Topeak JoeBlow Max since I was very happy with a very similar model of the same brand of a friend of mine .
 I am one of the few who probably received a defective one beyond 50 psi . I order this back in December 2011 / January 2012 . In the beginning of this year , I had a mountain bike so it was n't too bad inflating the tires . I recently built two road bikes and inflating my road bike tires to 100psi is so much work . I have to use all my weight and more when the tires reach 85 psi ... I wonder if Amazon will replace this item after 6 months of usage ...
 When I received this pump I was pretty pleased with the way that it looked , and it did appear to be a pretty decent looking pump . I was able to inflate the first tire , and the gauges appeared to report the correct PSI . I unhooked it from the rear tire , and began to inflate the second tire and began pumping . I was after a couple of pumps that something sounded like it `` popped '' near the PSI gauge , and then I was no longer able to pass air through the pump into the tire . Thankfully Amazon has a fantastic return procedure , and I was able to purchase a second pump and it was on my door less than 2 days after the first pump died . I picked up the Serfas TCPG Bicycle Floor Pump , and it is a much better pump for the money .
 it does n't work , its made for an entirely different style of tubbing and they do n't explain that in their notes .
 Called the company when I had trouble getting more than 90 PSI from this pump . They told me that the label was misprinted ! This is a 90 PSI MAX pump , not the 120 PSI printed on the label . These pumps should be recalled!Also , the connector is a pain . It 's difficult to connect a presta valve compare to others I 've used -LRB- Cannondale -RRB- .
 I have used the pump that is a step up from this one and have had no trouble getting my tires to 85 psi . I was not able to comfortably use this one ; apparently the barrel is a little bigger , which means it pushes more air , and therefore is harder to use . It is probably ok for people of above average strength .
 I used this pump for 2 years and hated it . It was very hard to inflate my tires above 60 lbs with it . I had to use my entire body weight to get the handle to go down sometimes.I replaced it with a Serfas pump a year ago .
 Good thing I 'm coupling this with a pressure guage anyways because the pressure guage on this is about 5 psi off .
 had sealing issue with short stem valves . I wanted to use this for all of our bikes , but with my kid 's bike I found it to be difficult to seal on the stem . I 'm not sure if this is more of a product issue or just my desire to have one pump fits all .
 Hitting 75PSI with this pump and my old tires was tough ; now I have some Panaracers that need to be inflated to 115PSI and it literally takes all my weight to push the handle down enough to reach that high . Look for another pump unless you want an epic workout filling your tires ...
 I 've had a Joe Blow Sport pump for 5 + years and it was great . Decided to get a 2nd pump , one for home & family use and one to leave in the car . Based on my old pump & positive general Joe Blow reviews , I bought a Joe Blow `` Max '' from the LBS last week , and it blows ! Once I get up to 80 psi , I really have to LEAN on it for each stroke to get up to 110 . I mean my feet just about lift off the ground ! -LRB- I weigh 170 -RRB- I got my old Joe Blow pump out and tried it ... zip zip zip right to 110 no problem.I am on my way back to the shop to return it .
 This pump is OK for inflating mountain bike tires to 60 lbs -LRB- and the gauge is fairly accurate up to that point -RRB- , but forget about higher pressures unless you weigh a couple hundred pounds yourself.Beyond 70 lbs I had to push down on the pump handle and jump off the floor at the same time to force the handle down , three jumps to complete one pump ! That worked for a couple of pumps , but at about 80 lbs the handle refused to budge with all of my weight on it -LRB- a bit under 150 lbs -RRB- . The gauge was not accurate and read much higher . I tried several tires thinking I might not have the head seated correctly , and yes I bled the presta valves , but I got the same results.I ended up filling road tires to 100 lbs with the compact emergency road pump I 've been using up to this point . I think the `` fast , high pressure '' and `` max 120 psi '' advertising is misleading ; I would n't recommend this pump for higher tire pressures at all . Niagara 's return policy says they only accept returns in unopened , original packaging , so I guess I 'm stuck with it .
 I 've gone through 3 Joe Blow pumps in 9 months . The overall pump is sturdy but the valve falls apart with only minor use in a very short period of time . Lucky for me my local bike shop let me swap them out for free . It 's really a crying shame that this company does n't get it , the valves are just cheap plastic and not on par with the rest of the pump .
 Originally bought this pump for my mountain bike and it works fine . Have also used it to fill my car tires and works well on them too although takes a ton of relatively easy pumps . Last month bought a new road bike and after my first ride and a few days in the garage tried to bring the tire back up to 100 + psi . OMG , I weigh 200 lbs . and after the first 95 it is so hard to get anything else its almost not worth the effort . If I put all my weight into it and literally lift my feet off the ground with each pump I can get a additional 1 lb . Multiply this stressful effort times 25 pumps and I can finally get 125psi . This pump is garbage for road bike needing anything above 100psi . DONT BUY !!!!
 This pump requires excessive pressure to pump , even at low pressure . At first I thought I had a bad presta valve on my tube , so I did n't return it . Sadly , it exhibits this behavior on all bikes . I 've used the next model up -LRB- friend owns -RRB- and it is much easier to pump . I wish I bought that one . Big disappointment with this . Two stars because it is functional .
 I 've used quite a few pumps over the years . I must say I am very pleased with this unit . I 'm not sure how long it will last . It 's mostly made of plastic so do n't abuse it but functionally , it works great . It gets a tight seal with little effort and releases smoothly.Update
 Like P. Bahniuk said in his review , I had a hard time getting this pump to go any further than about 80 psi on my Presta valve tires . It felt as same or worse then pumping up a tire with a portable bike pump . Needless to say this pump is useless for my needs.Other then this the pump looks solid and very well built , but I ca n't say much about its durability since I 'm returning it the same day I got it.Again if you have a Presta valve tubes , do n't take a chance with this pump . move on to something known to work fine with Prestas .
 I rarely write reviews but wanted to spare folks the time and expense of ordering this pump . I will be brief and to the point . I am a serious cyclist and buy good equipment . When my old pump gave out - I jumped on Amazon to get a new one - fast !! This one seemed like it would work - dual head , 120 psi max etc. . Here 's the deal . The dual head is weak and very hard to fit . The lock lever is awkward to use . If you require 120 psi - you are going to have to jump on this to get it there ! This is at best a pump for the beach cruiser and even then the head really makes pumping your tires up more of a task than it needs to be . If you have kids bikes or a beach cruiser - save your self some $ $ and go to Walmart . If you are a cyclist - this pump is not for you . Went to my LBS and purchased a serious pump with 160 psi max and smart head for about the same price-works like a dream . Now I have to spend $ $ shipping this one back .
 Bought one of these a few months ago and it 's been hanging in the garage waiting for me to need to use it . Due to an injury I have not been riding my bike.So today I * try * to use it for the first time . The stupid plastic screw-on ring on the Schrader side of the valve broke as I was operating the locking lever . Of course all the air was let out of my tire by the time!Don ' t buy ! Total junk ! This plastic valve is a weak link in what seems to be an otherwise OK pump design.I submitted a ticket with the manufacturer . Depending on how they respond , I will update my rating .
 I used this pump for about a 1/2 year until it started leaking , Now I ca n't get any air at all into my tires .
 Disappointing ! I could n't get it to clamp onto the valve stem , and after 20 min of frustration and having all the air released from the tire , I sent it back ! It 's a shame , I 've heard they 're good , but I surely could n't get mine to work , and there 's no way I 'm going to deal with it everytime I need air !
 Definetly heavy duty , but its bulky . That makes it hard to store and use at times . Make sure you have enough room between the spokes of whatever you are pumping up . For example , the nozzle is too bulky to fit in between the spokes of our stroller . Works fine for the bike . If I had bought an old school pump for -LSB- ... -RSB- I would not have to buy a second one for the stroller .
 bought this and could n't pump up my tires to 110psi . i had to put all my weight on it and still could barely use it . do not waste your money .
 I 've had this pump for 2 years now . I 've had to replace the gauge twice . Now the plastic handle part has broken and I have to hold it into the metal tube for it to work . Replacing parts via their support is a slow process - and then the part just breaks again!This floor pump is just poor build quality and will not last . Look elsewhere .
 This was the first Topeak product I 've owned and it will be the last . The pump states that it is rated up to 120 psi , but it really maxes out around 65 psi even though the gauge says anything higher . For presta valves the head is nearly useless . I bought this pump to use with my road bike , but ended up buying an adapter so I could use this pump 's Schrader head . Overall it was a waste of money and I plan on contacting the manufacture .
 This thing is junk , if I needed to air up something with < 60 # 's ... then maybe ! Can not get pump to inflate my tire above 70 , wo n't inflate anything more than the hose .
 This pump was fine until wear and tear took its toll . Then the hose came off . When putting it back together it was never the same . It did not hold pressure after that . The guage was never accurate . 5lbs off from day one . Then a plastic piece that connects to the barrel broke and the whole thing ended up in the trash after 6 months of use . You get what you pay for $ 28 .
 I have had many pumps in the past where there is an auto sensing nozzle for presta and schrader valves which fails very quickly . I have had a Ravx and Blackburn Air Tower 2 which I replaced the nozzle with the Joe Blow TopPeak Twin Head replacement and love it . I needed another pump and since this seems to be the only brand with the twin head , purchased this pump . Immediately when I received it , I noticed that it was a very poor construction . Be warned , you get what you pay for , or maybe less with this model . The plastic base wobbles and the air gauge is inadequately attached to the pump . It is suspended from the base , but in no way fixed to the pump at the top and twists . Had I known this ahead of time , I would not have made this purchase and looked for another model or brand .
 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack
 I ordered this 5 piece full comforter set for my son . He loves it . The comforter seems to be of good quality . However , the sheets seem to have a very low thread count . I think they should have atleast been 250 thread count . The seets and pillow cases are so thin , you can see through them .
 Caution when buying from this vender !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This item came incomplete , no mounting hardware , no key to lock the mount closed . None of the stuff garmin included with the mount . I called the vender , he claimed he would take care of it and nothing . Not your typical Amazon transaction . Very dissapointed .
 Do n't order this item . It is for the Zumo GPS and NOT the 2820 or any other StreetPilot series units .
 I bought this rings by doing a search through Amazon 's site . Parameter of the search were
 last christmas i bought my son a razor chopper . he has rode it a total of maybe 5 hours all year . why u ask . it stays broke ! it only has a 90 day warrenty . shortly after the 90 days electrical shorts started poping up through out the system . bad connections , bad wire etc. razor has been no help at all . they are next to impossible to get intouch with . now i gave them the benifit of the doubt and thought maybe i just got a lemon . my daughter loved his so i bought her one for christmas this year . took it outta the box tonight to charge it and guess what ... . its already broke.here it is 2 days before christmas and her biggest and most expencive -LRB- $ 203 with tax and dilivery -RRB- present is broken and god only knows when she will actually get to ride it .
 look if you want to get a mini pocket bike , or a pocket chopper i suggest that you dont buy this one . they dont run good , and fall apart easily , if you want a good pocket rocket that can go up to 40 mph you can get one for $ 170 on www.minipocketrockets.com
 this skooter is stinky very stinky if i dont say so myself . . im 80 years old and i run faster then it so it is for stnkiy people
 Bike did not run right from the beginning . THe battery did not stay charged . After awhile just quite running altogether . Company was not very usefull . Warranty only 90 days . Do not buy this peice of junk .
 After reading many positive reviews on other sites , I ordered this product for our barn ... of two horses . It did n't do a think to alleviate our fly problem . However , since starting on this product two months ago my horses coats are extremely shiny . So that 's a positive.Will I order it again for that ? No , but they do look very nice next to other horses at shows .
 They sent a left handed holster - picture is incorrect - called Optic Sale and spoke to Alex - customer service - he was out of the right handed holster ordered and maybe I would like a more expensive one . He would check and get back to me when the one I wanted would be available - still no call - I placed two more calls and no one answered - left maessage and they are not returning the call - would buy uncle mikes holster just not from Optic Sale .
 Using the size chart Uncle Mike provides I ordered -LRB- and returned -RRB- a # 6 holster for my Ruger MkII . I can only describe the fit as dismal
 I heard Uncle Mike 's made a good product , so I gave it a try . I wore this holster a total of 1 time for about 2 hours and the cheap plastic belt loop on the side broke , causing the holster and gun to fall to the floor . The holster is now worthless . Thankfully , I was at home at the time and not in public . I expect better from something made in the USA . I 've never had this happen with ANY other holster I 've owned . -- As a follow-up to provide an alternative option for folks wondering what to get - I replaced with a Fobus paddle holster , which I wore for about 5-6 hours of hard yard work . It 's not as soft and slim as the Uncle Mike 's , but it stays in place better -LRB- not flopping around -RRB- because there are ridges on the paddle that grip inside your waist band while the holster itself hangs over on the outside , and most importantly at no point did my gun wind up on the ground . It 's plastic , but not a cheap kind , and I 'm sure it will handle some wear and abuse . There 's no retaining strap , but the gun clicks into place , requiring a firm draw ... meaning it 's not universal like a generic holster , so you have to get the model for your gun.For those wanting to avoid a junk holster , Fobus is an Israeli company , and based on my experiences so far , Israel seems to make good , quality innovative products . It 's incredible what that tiny country can come up with in spite being about the size of a city here in the US and surrounded by enemies on all sides . I 'm guessing they make quality products because they do n't have room for anything else .
 What was shipped is NOT what is pictured on the Amazon site . A wast of time . I had to contact the company to find out they where out of stock , a lot of time wasted and then when it arrived , it was the wrong item , NOT EVEN CLOSE to what is pictured . Very disapointed !
 I ordered a left handed holster for 25 auto with a steel spring belt clip.When i got the holster there was no belt clip at all on the holster.And it was to be a 2 in one holster and it is not.Nothing like i ordered.Wasted my money .
 this size 1 as described by uncle mikes website is wrong . it says it is for medium autos i bought it for a sig p239 . doesnt fit . tried my walther p22 . doesnt fit . tried my smith and wesson j frame . doesnt fit . honestly i have no idea what this will fit ??????
 I bought this as just a place to put my S&W 629 3.5 inch when plinking in the woods , so I did n't have to set the gun on the ground -LRB- no fast draw or combat practice -RRB- when checking targets . This holster is just too tight to be practical for even a limited carry or storage , and it does n't seem to be stretching after a month with the revolver holstered and snapped . It fits 4 inch K-frame Smiths , okay , but I think I 'm going to have to spring for a custom leather holster for the 629 . My fault for cheaping out . This might also work better for an automatic like a Glock or 1911 , as it 's the cylinder on the revolver that makes the holster too snug .
 I purchased this elliptical in April of 2008 . Over the last couple of weeks it began to make a loud knocking sound every time I used it . I found a broken bolt from the pedal mechanism on the floor when I investigated the problem . I made several calls to Keys to get warranty support as I am within the warranty . They have a message on their voicemail stating they are moving offices and wo n't be taking calls until after 11/24 -LRB- It 's 12/3 today and the message still has n't changed -RRB- . They have n't responded to any of my emails . None of the local repair companies will perform warranty work on the machine so I now have to pay out of pocket to have it fixed . It will probably end up costing me upwards of $ 200 for something that should be covered under warranty . Ridiculous . Stay away from this company and from their products .
 I have owned this Nike Blade watch model WC0037 for 7 months . It is a very neat watch . Unfortunately it broke and I do n't know how . One evening I remove it from my wrist and notice the black bubber wrist band had separated from the body at the rear battery cover . The entire rubber/plastic hinge had cracked . This wrist band is not replaceable . I wore this watch daily to my office job . A sports watch should be made rugged . This one is not . Lesson learned is to buy a watch which has a standard replacable wrist band .
 It all started upon opening the package . With the contents spread around the entire game room floor , we saw that the table arrived with 3 cracks in the ` ice ' surface . Amazon would have replaced the surface , but with their strange policy it would have taken up to 2 weeks and I would have had to receive an entire new game table -LRB- this was a very large package ! -RRB- just to get the part I needed . I would then have to return or throw away the rest of the game . That did n't make any sense to me , so I called the company directly , and after some prodding , Harvard replaced just the surface within a few days - which was the right thing to do . Beyond that , assembly took another 12 or so hours to complete . The directions were vague in parts , and we often had to supply our own nuts and bolts . There was a fair amount of finesse and nuance involved , and after alot of aggravation and silicone spray , we finally got it to work properly . Its been used for about 2 weeks now , with no incident , but I have to say that I am waiting for something else to break or go wrong . Spend the extra money and get a better quality rod hockey table , it was a real frustrating experience .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 Does n't fit a Ruger P90 as advertised.And I need to write at least 20 words for this to counts as a review . Additionally , there 's Velcro on the inside of the slide that goes on the duty holster . It makes it incredibly difficult to put it on the duty holster .
 Very simply , this board does not have any stringers ; carbon rods paralleling a board down the center . It gives strength to the board , something this board does n't have . I bent and broke mine within a week with 5 ' waves . Not for a semi-serious boarder . Spend the extra money to get a board with stringers .
 I ordered a $ 1500 exercise machine from Smooth Fitness and regret ever doing so ! Before I even received the machine , I spent countless hours coordinating the delivery of my machine . I paid $ 199 for the service to deliver and set up my machine . For this additional fee , I would expect much better customer service than what I experienced.When I got frustrated with Smooth Fitness , I cancelled my order and they have made me jump through hoops ! First of all , I never received the exercise machine but they are making me pay a 20 % restocking fee and shipping charges ! This is on top of the $ 1500 that they already charged to my credit card and refuse to remove the charge . I never even seen or touched the exercise machine . The Customer Service management team is very unresponsive and rude . I am still trying to get my money back but they are putting up a fight . My advice is to NEVER purchase from Smooth Fitness ! They provide very poor service and are not customer friendly . Beware !
 This product was awful . When i received the product and started putting the hoop together , one of the pipes broke and I did n't have all the pieces . So I called the manufacture and got new pieces and they sent the wrong ones . So i called again , and got new parts . While waiting for them I went to the hardware store and got the screws needed so my daughter could play with this thing . Well I got it up and about 15-20 minutes into playing with it we noticed the ball return was tearing . Now mind you these balls are tiny , there was no reason for this . So I packed it up and sent it back . I did get a quick refund , but other than that , I have nothing nice to say . Sorry
 This was the biggest disappointment ever ! I bought this as a Christmas gift , and unfortunately I lost the shipping/receive order so i ca n't send it back . The instructions are very poor , and someone has handwritten some of them in because they forgot to put them on the original print . I was going to deal with the cheapness of the product except for the fact that one of the frame pieces is incorrect , so I ca n't even assemble the thing . Keep looking , and do n't waste your time . I would spend a little more money and upgrade to one that is nicer !
 The product is ok . I brought one a few years ago and the frame was made out of strong sturdy steel . This one is made of very ! cheap ! material .
 I ca n't review the product because I have n't received it yet . At first Amazon shipped me the wrong item . I was supposed to get a replacement in 1 week . Then I was told it is on back order until April . All I was offered as compensation is 2 day shipping versus standard , not really a big deal since the delivery is delayed 3 months anyway . Hard to believe Amazon could n't go to some other retailer and purchase this to supply a customer in a reasonable time frame . Overall a bad experience so far . But who knows , it could get even worse . I may not even receive it in April .
 We bought this for use with P90X as well . My wife used it successfully going through it once , although I suppose she did n't apply as much pull as I was able to . Within 2 weeks of using it correctly , braced through a door -LRB- using a third-party door attachment , which was not the problem -RRB- , the left handle plastic tube that feeds through the grip -LRB- which is hollow , and the nylon fabric passes through it -RRB- cracked . I was by no means pulling it so hard that it was equaling an actual pull-up , but it had a little tension at the bottom of the pull and I figured I 'd use it for a few weeks and maybe get a heavier one later on or on a repeat of the program.Again , this was n't a band-snap incident . This was the handle that cracked . By rotating that 1/2 '' crack away from the nylon fabric running through , my wife can still use it , but if I give it another go it 'll probably crack completely and be useless .
 When I bought this product , I was really excited because the four braided bands made it look like it would n't snap , and it was a value for $ 20 . It also came with a workout DVD . Unfortunately , when I actually used the cord , the big black plastic part connecting the cord to the handle was VERY uncomfortable and prevented me from using it as directed . It hits and rubs against your wrist and you ca n't avoid this without awkwardly holding it away from your body , which is also difficult and dangerous . I am going to return it and look for one without the big plastic part . It seems Gaiam has one .
 consumer beware on this item . I purchased it and when I went to watch the video , it would n't play . I thought this was odd , so returned the purchase and reordered it . same thing with the second purchase , DVD was defective . I then returned it again for a refund . I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing as I found many complaints with the cord as well . live and learn ...
 Loved the concept , I paid $ 50 for mine and was ready to hit the beach , the concerts , etc. . Unfortunately , the arm broke while trying to get out of the thing . I 'm 6ft 190 lbs and barely fit into the thing , but still , the arm should not have broken like it did .
 I was disappointed with the Kelsyus chair . I was hoping it would be attractive , well made and comfortable . I found it attractive and well made , but very uncomfortable . I have two similar beach/camping chairs which fold to be carried in a shoulder strap bag . I can sit in those chairs comfortably all day long . I found the Kelsyus chair small and cramped . It had an uncomfortable ridge under my thighs . It seemed too narrow for my body , and too short to support enough of my thighs . The head rest is too low for me . I 'm about 5 ft 11 in , and 190 lbs , but a friend , who is shorter and lighter , expressed the same opinion without prompting by me . I want to emphasize that this review applies to the particular model of the Kelsyus chair which I purchased and returned . If there is another larger model it might be comfortable.For your information , the similar chairs I have are made by `` MAC Sports '' , and cost me about $ 10 on sale at Kmart . They are not attractive chic designs like the Kelsyus , nor do they have the attractive optional sun shade . However , I can sit in them comfortably all day long .
 I loved the concept but found it to be disappointing . I wanted to watch soccer/ulitmate games on a grassy sideline . I find the leg -LRB- s -RRB- in the back to have too narrow of a footprint . It just tips too easily . It might be great in the sand , where it could dig-in a little , but not on a solid surface . The seat is okay but the shade seems a little flimsy in the wind .
 This is a good size for outdoor concerts that do not allow chairs more than 4 inches off the ground . Design could use improvement as the manufacturer has obviously never taken it to a concert . The `` cup holder '' in only one arm is shallow and will not reliably hold a bottle of beer or pop without spilling when you move around . The cup holder is also small in diameter and will not take most sports drink or water bottles that have quick closer tops . Way too heavy for any mountain overnight backpacking but a nice weight for other uses such as concerts .
 A shoddy design . A good concept , but I found it cumbersome and poorly designed . While it does give you good shade , it is poorly constructed and tears with ease . The velcro attachments need to be reinforced . Any wind will easily tear the anchor points .
 Just broke another flimsy arm on the sunglasses for the second time in a year and a half . I 'm pretty careful with my stuff . If they did n't break so easily -LRB- thin and brittle -RRB- , I would be happy with them . Because of their fragile nature , the $ 20 or so pricepoint is too high . They are probably worth more like $ 5 .
 Really disappointed in the quality of my second pair of Solarshields fits over sunglasses . Let me say that the first pair I had lasted over 2 years . Unfortunatly I lost them . I tried really hard to find the exact same pair with no luck . I purchased the smoke colored pair and I could not be more disappointed . The coating they put on the glasses started peeling off after had them for 2 weeks . I have now had them for 6 weeks and they look terrible . They are also too flexible and cheaply made . The lenses are the only thing I like about them . .
 When my large Polar Shield `` fit-over '' sunglasses finally broke -LRB- my fault -RRB- I looked for a replacement pair . Polar Shield no longer makes the same model -LRB- the newer Large model is more stylish but smaller -RRB- . Two other brands looked identical on the Amazon site - Solar Shield and OverxCast . I bought one of each and they are far from identical . The Solar Shield glasses are inferior to the others . The optical quality of the lens is poor . There are cloudy spots and the clarity is poor . The frame construction is also poor - appears very fragile . Due to the poor visibility of the lens I wo n't be wearing them . To make matters worse , the Solar Shield glasses cost more ?! The Overxcast glasses are terrific . It game with amber lens , which I was a little concerned about , but they 're terrific . The optical clarity is terrific and the frame construction is solid . No comparison . I 'm going to buy another pair of the Overcast just to make sure I always have one on hand .
 If the temple arms did n't break off because of cheap brittle material this product would be rated very good . For this kind of money I would look elsewhere .
 I have worn Solar Shields since my eye surgery 7 years ago . The first ones I had were just fine and lasted many years . I replaced them and the bows lasted less than a year before one broke . I guess I am a slow learner as I have 4 pair , all with different shaped bows or the same bow broken so I ca n't even make one of 2 . The last ones lasted 4 months .
 I have bought two pairs of Solar Shield `` Fit Over '' glasses . The first pair broke rather easily after just a few weeks - one arm -LRB- or `` temple '' in eyeglasses terminology -RRB- snapped midway between the frame and the ear portion of the arm . Thinking it was a fluke , I bought a second pair of Solar Shields . This time an arm snapped while just holding them in two hands and raising them to my face . Since that pair was ruined too , I carefully applied light pressure to the other arm and it snapped at the same point - midway to the ear . This is indicative of very poor quality materials / workmanship . Too bad they break so easily , as they fit well and I had high hopes for them . At $ 19.99 , they about 10 times as expensive as they should be . I am trying another brand now .
 I have had about eight pairs of Solar Shields and they all have broken -- most at the left ear piece . The plastic is brittle and cheap , even by current standards for eyeglasses frames , which in general are incredibly over-priced and flimsy , and a major consumer rip-off . In my opinion they are engineered to fail . I picked up a pair of Solar Shields at a Fred 's store that were discounted down to $ 2.99 , which is about the price they should sell for , given their cheap quality and lack of durability . They were made to end up in the landfill , along with mountains of other throw-away products -LRB- junk -RRB- produced in China for international corporations who take pride in how efficiently they can rip off millions of customers , over and over again .
 The sunglasses are comfortable and function well but break easily . I bought one pair that lasted about a year before the temple arm snapped . I thought that specific pair might have been defective , so I tried another . I was very careful in handling not to stretch or strain the temple , but after about six months this one snapped as well . Otherwise a good product , but I wo n't buy another.The manufacturer should be reading the multiple reviews & comments noting flimsy temples . I suspect it would only add a dollar or two to the price to incorporate metal reinforced temples .
 As an owner of 6 or 7 pair of Polar Optics / Solar Shield sunglasses , I 've experienced most every problem this brand is capable of having . The lens quality is excellent , but earpieces are very fragile . So why continue to pay 20 bucks each for so many pair ? Well , until about two years ago , warranty was great . A simple email was all it took to get an exchange pair , no matter what the problem . Then the emails went unanswered -- maybe they changed ownership , or fired the `` good '' warranty lady . So I tried the new customer service contact info . Oh sure , no problem , just send them in prepaid -- with proof of purchase -- oh yeah and be sure to include $ 5 or so for `` handling '' . The old lifetime guarantee is now a year -- and for sure , the earpieces will be shot before the warranty expires.Solar Shield Polarized Glasses
 My wife and I both have bought the Solarshield twice and both of ours broke in the same area from cheap plastic . At 20 bucks a pop they are too expensive to continue . Will look for American made .
 These bike gear cable sets are low end equipment . I guess you get what you pay for . First , the cable housings are large diameter - the same size as brake cable housings . Second , they do n't have an internal nylon lining - they are just bare metal inside . Third , the cables are a sloppy fit in the housing and you ca n't adjust them precisely - they are not compressionless and wo n't work very well with modern index shifting systems . They are acceptable for older gear shifting systems that are n't indexed . Amazon should have provided a more comprehensive description on the product being sold . I 'd return them but it 's not worth the trouble . I 'd give them one star , but I am going to try using them temporarily .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 the scope came in a opened box , you folks purchased it from someone else than the manufacture , there were missing parts , the experiance was distasteful , you sold the unit as new , it was not newTerrance Silva
 When you drop these balls on a flat surface they will bounce all over the place . You get what you pay for . They are OK for the kids to slam into each other .
 We bought these ping-pong balls for our cat to play with . However , we CAN NOT let her play with them now , IF EVER ! They smell like a chemical waste dump ! It is horrible ! I have had the box in the garage for several days -LRB- opened -RRB- in the hope it will air out . So far , after a few days they are still very much like a toxic waste dump!I certainly do n't want my cat to get sick from playing with her toys . Just so you folks know , most cats love to chase ping-pong balls on a hard floor . Carpet makes it impractical .
 Lot 's of balls , but not very bouncy.These are not balls that did n't quite make the 3 star cut , but balls that were probably destined to be shot out of kid 's toys and it shows .
 These balls are not round and the material is not uniform so they wobble when they spin . Some are dead right out of the box and break when they are hit . I do n't know if I just got a bad batch or what.I have played 1 star balls before from other companies and have had much better experiences . These balls are n't even as good as some no name brand balls we got as company swag a while back.I would advice against these balls for all but the most casual play and honestly if you are that casual a player why not buy a 6 pack of better balls ...
 I bought a new indoor - outdoor table and bought these balls . The balls are not lively at all . For a while I thought it was the table then I got some other balls and now I know that it is these balls . I do not recomend you buy these . The price is great . The packaging is nice and convenient . But the balls are dead and not great quality . Sopend more andd get something decent .
 If you are looking to learn the game or are a decent player , do n't get these balls . They do n't bounce as they should and seem a bit wobbly .
 I ordered a jacket from Amazon . I selected the size and color that I wanted ; however , I received a jacket in the same style but another color . The tag on the sheet still said the color I was supposed to get but it was not correct . Item was returned .
 It 's very poor watch . It has a horrible red button -LRB- and they do n't show it in the picture -RRB- . It looks nicer in the website .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 The beach chair felt flimsy and cheap . The canopy straps were attached in such a way as to make it look way lopsided when attached to the chair . Was that designed in ? Also the tear-down was not user-friendly although yes it was easy to figure out , just not very convenient . All in all , a disappointment for me .
 OK the concept of a small chair that reclines got to me . But what you get is a chair that feels like you are always in the reclining position.Also the stitching at the front of the arm rest near the cup holder has undo stress due to the design of the chair , mine came undone on the first trip . Its cheaply made so the price for this chair is also a drawback . On the plus side it is a very light chair to carry around and easy to pack , but knowing what I know now I 'd buy something else .
 While I was impressed with the video about this chair and was excited to get it , the chair became a disappointment after only using it twice . The trim on the arms tore through and it really does not slide up and down in the sand . Next time I will carry the extra weight and get a chair with wooden arms .
 I ordered this chair twice , and both times Amazon failed to send the UV canopy with the chair . I eventually sent both chairs back . I did use one of the chairs at the beach and found it to be rather uncomfortable . The sling design is kind of cool , but you end up sitting right at the front edge of the chair . It might be different on a hard surface , but on the sandy beach , it was n't all that great .
 I purchased a reclining beach chair w/canopy . It broke the first time I tried to use it . The canopy was useless and the rod burst through the material when I tried to put it on the chair . When the metal frame is inserted into the webbing on the arms , the frame ripped right through the webbing . The chair is way too small for a grown adult and trying to repack the useless canopy is tricky and the illustrations are not clear enough .
 The chair is way too small for a grown adult . The canopy worked the first day , but not the second day . It flopped forward on to the chair for some reason . Others may have had a working canopy but mine is an epic fail .
 I ordered this item and the first came with no canopy and i had to return it . Amazon overnighted me a replacement and the second chair came with no canopy . The canopy is the major reason I wanted the chair because I am fair skinned and burn easily.The chair is very small and not meant for tall or anyone larger than a child . I am disappointed in this chair but love Amazon for being so great about the replacement and customer service . A + customer service but not a great product .
 These chair are too low to the ground , too tippy and the shade is too flimsy.I would n't buy them again , but expect I 'll get 2 or 3 years of service from them .
 I ordered this chair for an upcoming camping trip , they sent me a huge empty box with only the canopy in it . tried to contact the company and never got a response . very very upset and still need a chair for my trip
 This item was made for Kelsyus in TWO -LRB- 2 -RRB- colors , blue and stone . Color was not mentioned in the description at all !! The item was ordered hoping it was STONE . The item arrived , blue . The chair was returned for credit and I took the hit for a reduced credit because you people thought it was my error that it was returned . Moral of the story
 I purchased 4 reclining beach chairs w/canopy . Every single one broke . When the metal frame is inserted into the webbing on the arms , the frame ripped right through the webbing . The company replaced the four chairs and they , in turn , broke the same way . The company states that this is a known problem but offers no help other than to replace the chairs once more.To add insult to injury , within three days of using the chairs , the elastic cord required to hold it in the upright position snapped , the zipper on one of the pouch came off , and the loop on the canopy cover tore out . All this happended within the first day or two of use .
 This thing is junk . Looks nice and sleek but is really poorly built with plastic at critical areas . Broke on first use .
 We were very disappointed in this item , mostly because of the quality . The first time we went to the beach with it , the fabric on one of the arms ripped , making it impossible to use the chair . We had to take it to a tailor and have both ends of the arms stitched and reinforced.Also , the beach is always windy , and while the canopy is a great idea , again the quality of the fabric used in this chair is not good . We already have several small rips in the canopy , and the bungee-type cord that fastens it down to the chair arms frayed in several places and will undoubtedly break in a short time ; we 're not sure how we can fix that when it happens , and at that point it 'll just be a chair without a canopy , which is n't what we bought this chair for.All in all , this was a great design , easy to set up and carry , BUT the quality of the materials used in this chair is what makes it worthless . We definitely would not have bought this chair had we known it was n't going to last more than a few times at the beach.Would most definitely not recommend this to anyone other than someone wanting to watch their kids play soccer . It 's totally useless at the beach .
 It looks pretty cool but unfortuanetely the canopy is just a mess to deal with.mine did not last one day , I was trying to fold it using the instructions but it seems I did it to hard , and the metal thing just rip off the folding.the canopy is just 16 dollars so it 's not reasonable to pursue any replacements or fight for the garantee.Overall you go better buying an umbrella and a chair independently .
 I used this pump for two months and could not figure out why i lost pressure every time i hopped on my bike . My bicycle is my primary mode of transportation so this was becoming very frustrating . I checked my tubes in water for leaks and nothing . finally the seals blew out on the pump and in a rage i smashed it into the ground . best thing i could 've done . So i stopped at a community pump we have here in Portland and lo and behold when I used that pump my tires held the wanted pressure for a little less than a week as opposed to a little less than a day . After some thinking and asking shop mechanics what they thought i came to the conclusion that you always want a pump with a hose attachment on it . there 's no way to throw 80 psi into your tire without moving the valve connection around at least a little bit , and that makes all the difference . so i spent the extra money and got a mini pump with a hose attachment on it and have n't had to stop at that community pump since . spend the extra money and get one with a hose attachment . the mini morph is what i went for and i have n't had any problems with it after 3 months
 This pump does n't fit onto a Presta valve very well , and you have to be very careful when inflating the tire or else it will become disconnected . Also pretty slow . Finally , the bracket for fastening the pump onto the bike frame is a little odd , holds the pump off to the side of the tube instead of directly in the plane of the bike frame , so that one 's leg is likely to contact the pump as one pedals . I have owned two other Topeak pumps both of which work better than this model . Buy one of their larger , more expensive frame pumps , this one is a poor product .
 I bought this pump hoping to inflat the tires on my snowblower when needed , instead of bringing it to the truck every time no matter how I did it , it wouldnt work Im pretty good with things and this `` PUMP '' has got me stumped it doesnt fit on any tire no matter whats on or off . it ant worth the trouble to return
 Even though it looks almost identical to the one pictured , I must have received the wrong item . There is no way possible for this thing -LRB- the one I received -RRB- to be compatible with a Presta valve , as the description says it is . It works OK with Schrader valves , not great though , so even if that was the only criteria I was basing this review on it would still only get 2 stars ... max.On top of everything else , the package was obviously opened and the item used before I received it.Nothing else to say about it . Just simply do n't waste your money on this product , especially if you have Presta valves .
 It works , but I had a devil of a time getting and maintaining a seal on presta valves . It 's very cumbersome to use and heats up quickly . But , it is affordable , small , lightweight and connects nicely to the frame -LRB- plastic holder bolts to the frame -RRB- . So , I 'm keeping mine for emergency use , but if someone swipes it I wo n't shed any tears , and will happily replace it with a pump that 's easier to use.Note -- I have n't tried this on a schrader valve .
 I purchased this pump and tried using it before a really long ride ... It took me about 30 min to get it to work in my house , after i lost most of the air in my tire trying to get it to work and still wound up with really low tire pressure . I wound up having to go to my local bike shop to use their pump ... This is only good for extreme emergencies where you have no other choice ...
 I could not get the head to work on my presta valve . Returned it for another one and same thing . Was hoping it would work , as I liked the idea of placing it on water bottle cage.Amazon was very good at working with me on this issue.Thanks ! Sorry it did n't work out .
 I would give this one star , but I added the second just in case there was user error or just a suspicious coincidence.Why would they not include a better diagram of how to switch the valves ? I know now that this method of going from presta to schrader is commonplace , but this being my first small frame pump , I had to search online for directions . No big deal really , until ... I tested the pump out on the front tire of my cross bike after maybe 25 miles of riding . Swapped to presta , put it on the valve , locked it , and heard the swoosh of air escaping . I removed it quickly , thinking it was not connected properly , and when I did , part of the headpiece was left stuck on the valve.When I pulled the headpiece off , I heard air continue to leak . I knew immediately something was wrong , which was confirmed when my tire went FLAT , and FAST.I grabbed my tire levers , and lo and behold , I had a rip in my tube where the valve connects . I can only assume this happened either when I attached the valve , or when I had to remove the piece of the headpiece that got stuck . Tire had always held air perfectly prior , no sign of leakage.I did n't plan on replacing a tube today , but thanks to Topeak , I had to . Swell .
 Bought without any research from that well known bike shop beginning with `` H '' . Looked good , with a handy bracket that secures well to your frame , but I ended up carrying mine in my backpack.On the plus side - this pump worked well for about two years of regular use . I 'm a regular weekend club mountainbiker , and would use the pump almost weekly , just for punctures . I have a stand pump for general inflation . It 's not too heavy , and fitted nicely into my packs . But that 's about it ... On the minus side - after a while the pumping power faded , as the plunger wore out . The connection mechanism to the valve also wore quickly . The other day it gave up after half inflating the tyre.Try Blackburn -LRB- with a lifetime guarantee as long as you keep it -RRB- at a fraction more of the cost .
 When i received my pump it came without any adapters for a Presta valve . The packaging it came in and the description shown on amazon stated it was compatible with a Presta valve yet I 'm still wondering how its supposed to when it does not fit my Presta valve .
 Little Tikes Grow With Me TrikeWhen I searched for tricycles this one came up . I was searching for a trike that could grow with my neice . Upon arrival , I noticed that it was reccommended for up to 24 months . It did n't say in the description that it was for such young children . She had outgrown this before we got the box open . It was cheaply made . I wish I could have returned it , but after putting it together , it would n't fit into the box , so I just threw the thing into the garbage and we went anf bought a real tricycle . I will never order toys from Amazon again . Their descri -LSB- ptions are misleading .
 We have a lake house and an inflatable raft 30 feet off the dock . I was very excited to order this product to use as a carriage for beverages to and from the raft . I have had it just a few weeks and it has never held air ! Has a leak somewhere.My neighbor had the more expensive version ... the Yamaha brand , and it 's awesome ! I thought at 30.00 I assumed this one would be as good . Too late to send it back ... should have stuck with a known brand .
 My biggest issue is that the label is stamped on upside down ! Otherwise it 's just kind of weird . Strange zippers and compartments that I do n't see any use for . I should have returned but I did n't want to bother , it still does the job but it 's not what I expected !
 This would be worth the money if it were bigger . You can only fit a limited number of cans with ice . Without ice you could get about 12 cans .
 This item filled with water , was a maze in terms of unfolding the material to change from carrying configuration to floating config and generally did n't seem to be a good design . Not a bad idea and I can tell they put some thought into it , but just not functional -LRB- for the pool anyway . -RRB-
 Just received my floating cooler . Am a little disappointed that the interior of the cooler has no nylon liner ... I 'm thinking maybe I should have ordered the Aqua Oasis ... it has a removable cooler that just sits inside the tube ... and ... there is NO outside zippered storage pocket ! You should take that out of your description . I 'll be trying it this weekend on the lake ... we 'll see how it performs . Might be sending it back .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 The construction is nice and works for schrader and presta but I can not get my road bike tires to the correct psi . The valve seating is convertible to presta and will get you about 80 % of the way , but it 's very hard to keep the presta open AND push more air into the tube . I am grown man and certainly strong enough to pop the tube if only I could secure the pump on the valve . This pump leaks air and makes it hard to know when you 've got it set right . Keep shopping .
 I gave the product 2 stars because living in a warm weather climate but having a small backyard I was looking forward to the portability and hopefully the sturdiness of the product . Unfortunately , as some might be able to read on the Target related reviews of the same product here , I weigh about 185,6 ft `` normal '' guy and was quickly sinking to where I could basically feel the support poles every time . Unfortunately what would have been perhaps a 4 star comment later on became a 2 because my father laid down to relax , and he weights perhaps 200-210 max and the support structure completely ripped through , and he could have injured himself pretty badly . So I guess it 's really the luck of the draw and I might risk myself at purchasing one again but through a brick and mortar store to be sure it can be returned .
 I have used the hammock about 2 times and it is already ripping at the seams . . I 'm pretty disappointed that after 2 uses , the product is tearing . . I think when I bought the product , it said that it would hold up to 200 lbs . I weigh about 96lbs and it ca n't even hold my weight ...
 It was difficult , if not impossible to set up and would not support the weight of a 150 pound person .
 I should have paid attention to the reviews . My husband barely weighs 155 pounds and when he is in the hammock he is dragging on the ground . Might still send back , but we are on an RV trip and he did not use it before we left
 The first time I used this it broke . The plastic snapped . OK I weigh 200lbs but ...
 Waste of money . If you weigh more than 150 pounds or anyone you know that does gets in it , your/their butt is on the ground -LRB- ca n't swing -RRB- and then it 's stretched out and does n't work for small people either .
 It says 22 pounds ... what a joke ... this thing is heavy and not the `` lighweight , portable '' hammock it announces itself to be .

 I wondered why this can not be shipped to APO address ! I 'm going to a beach in two weeks , hoping to learn to surf . Now I got to find something else to do while staying there . : * -LRB-
 These snow shoes arrived promptly as promised , which is what I 've always experienced with Amazon orders . However , a strap broke when my husband was just fitting them in our living room once they arrived . The materials seem `` cheap '' , although the bag to carry them is pretty cool , featuring `` backpack '' type shoulder straps . Not the quality I was expecting . Unfortunately , it 's been a `` dry '' winter in Denver , and we have n't had a chance to use them yet .
 Ok I am a enthusiast SCUBA Diver and when I buy products I but quality merchandise that I review and that has a track record as reliable and reputable . With that this Freestyle Men 's FS75211 Precision Polyurethane Watch is the worst Under Water rated watch I have ever owned . To begin with I purchased it in January this year , its pretty annoying to operate , the screw down crown unscrews easily and its hard to sync the Digital Watch with the Analog Watch and the Digital Display is extremley small . The Strap/Band is very uncomfortable and rigid -LRB- not a good attribute underwater -RRB- , the advertised chronograph alarm can not be heard at all . Those are just regarding the features of the watch . On Feb 21st , 2011 I was Scuba Diving at St. Thomas , USVI as part of a tour from a Cruise Ship . Very 1st Dive at a depth of 50ft I noticed I couldnt see the Digital Display so I looked at the Analog and my Second Sweep Hand was not moving . I checked the screw down crown and it was tight . This watch is advertised to be water proof to 200 Meters -LRB- 660 ft -RRB- and at 50 ft. It stopped working . So back on the cruise ship I took the watch off rinsed it with fresh water and put it up to dry on the nightstand . After coming back from dinner that night the glass face encased in the Stainless Steel body had poped out and you could see the water/condensation inside the watch . I will be returning it to Freestyle for a replacement or refund along with my disappointment , my other Freestyle Watches have preformed flawlessly over the years to depths of 100ft .
 I am currently sending this watch back to Freestyle . I 'm hoping that it is covered under the warranty . This is supposed to be a dive watch for up to 200 meters . Well ... . it did n't last one `` dive '' in our swimming pool . It now has condensation in it that comes and goes , but is very disappointing !

 When I got this pump I was impressed . Quality , design , and Material was superb.However the pump fail after 1 day of use . the valve lock refuse to lock on.I 'm sending it back to Amazon for refund .
 I was very disappointed with this purchase . My grandson watched Dora and Diego all the time and really wanted this bike . Unfortunately the pedals broke on the first day out and could not be fixed . As the bike was inexpensive it was not worth replacing them . I would not purchase this bike . Very cheaply put together .
 Foremost , I smack the beegeebus out of my knuckles when I use this thing . It really ought to stop the stroke high enough that someone with normal-sized hands does n't have this hassle . -LRB- seriously , my glove size is M across the board -RRB- . I end up having to forgo the flip-out handle feature and move my hand in-line with the barrel . Also , I have some minor issues with this chuck grabbing valve stems , but it eventually gets there and does n't leak or let go once it does . The flip-out cleat is not locking , does n't really brace the unit , and is generally worthless . The gauge -LRB- almost requisite for road tire psi -RRB- is helpful and accurate.I wish I had bought a Lezyne . If it were not because I use frame pumps so infrequently , I would .
 Like the title says , it is : a . A good idea to have a morph pump with a pressure gauge.b . A poor implementation because the gauge is pretty useless -LRB- i -RRB- highly inaccurate -LRB- ii -RRB- usable range is cramped because gauge goes all the way to 160 psi -LRB- iii -RRB- highly inacuratec . No mention anywhere how to convert pump between Presta and Schrader . I had to watch a youtube video uploaded by a good Samaritan that showed process of dismantling the value and inverting the rubber busing and the plastic air channeler . Topeak SUCKS .2 Stars because pump will get the job done
 Well packaged is about all I can say for this - it came in a nice box.You can use both type of valve on this pump but it 's a pretty tricky set up . I ended up letting my tyres down more than getting them pumped up the first few times and had to borrow someone else 's pump!It 's a pretty weak piece of plastic that comes with no instructions.Do youself a favour and go to a bike shop so you can check what you 're buying .
 I purchased this pump based on the reviews on Amazon but will steer clear of Topeak in future . First , the bracket that clips the pump hose in place snapped of the first time I used it . I contacted Topeak using thier ticket system and included photos of the defective part . I waited for a replacement but when it arrived I found that they had sent the wrong part . So , I contacted them again with more photos . This time they sent the right part but no instructions on how to replace it . I called them on the phone and they talked me through the replacement and I thought it went well until I went to use it one day and found that the unit was leaking and would not pump up my tire . Contacted them one more time and was told that a part was missing where the guage connects to the pump and that I would need to contact their parts department to order the part . I 've had enough of wasting my time with this thing and will be purchasing a pump from another company . To Topeaks credit they seem to try to help but in the end it was not worth the frustration .
 Let me preface my review by saying the following : I want nothing more than to write a positive review . It means that I got a good product that met or exceeded my expectations , and I went home happy and content in the knowledge that my money was well spent . Not entirely the case here.The pump itself is solid , as is the pressure gauge . No complaints there . You can read the 40 other reviews that rave about those features , I have nothing new to add . However , the plastic construction on every inch of this is questionable . I 'm not sure what kind of plastic this is , or if they had to pick it because it happens to be lightweight or cheap , but it is very , very brittle . The footpad has held up for me so far , but within seconds of removing the pump from the box , the small retaining clip that holds the hose to the body of the tube for transport snapped when I tried to detach the hose . Huge wtf moment . As of right now , I 've reattached the broken clip using some magical stuff called JB weld , but needless to say I am NOT impressed .

 These boots are poorly constructed . Within 3 hours of wear the heels had begun to delaminate from the rest of the boot
 The strap of this watch absolutely sucks . It is quite hard , and not very comfortable . After wearing for only a month the holder for the strap broke . The watch also has a slightly cheap look to it .

 I purchased this item on Amazon several months ago . After I had already started to assemble it , I noticed a manufacturer defect , i.e. the holes for the middle tier rack were missing . In other words , there was no way to attach the support bars to the frame of the dumbbell rack . So I call Amazon for a replacement , repackage the item , wrap it in duct tape , and have UPS come pick it up.I get my replacement a little over a week later . I open it up and , what do you know , the holes for the middle tier rack are where they should be . But this time the manufacturer forgot to include the nuts and bolts . Needless to say I was starting to get frustrated . So I call Amazon again , tell them the problem , and they contact the manufacturer . The manufacturer tells Amazon not to worry , a set of nuts/bolts will be sent right away . Fast forward two weeks - no nuts and bolts . I call Amazon again , and they tell me they 'll send the entire shipment all over again . Sooo , I repackage the item , wrap it in duct tape , and have UPS come pick it up . -LRB- see a pattern here ? -RRB- Finally the complete package arrives . But this was a much bigger hassle than necessary , and the manufacturer only provided the product as described after the third attempt . It 's a made-in-China piece of crap , and quality control is obviously not a priority of Apex . I would strongly recommend that Amazon not carry this dumbbell rack on its website .
 What a nightmare when I opened the box ! The bolts , washers and nuts were scattered all over the box . As expected , most of the pieces were missing . I was alsonot able to find any Square End Cap . The left and right beams were also scratched and the base of the beam was dented . I 'm not even sure if I 'm able to fit inthe base end cap . These were just some of the few things I have noticed upon quick inspection . Not sure what else is missing or wrong with the rack . I 'm returning the item . What a waste of my time .
 When I received the Apex Rack , it had obviously been used . Everything was out of the packaging , and was rewrapped lazily and quickly . All of the bolts and washers were loose in the box , and some were suprisingly missing . The rack was scratched and dented , probably since it was used previously . I bought this as a new item , but it was n't even close . Very disappointing .
 First , my dumbbells did not fit on this rack ! They are neoprene . Also , the hardware provided did n't fit . The nuts had little rubber stoppers that prevented the screws from being tightened . Big dissappointment . Returning today .
 Just tossed this piece of c -- p in the garbage !!!! What a waste !!!! Spend the extra money on a better brand .
 I was happy to read the other reviews of this product , but when it arrived , I had to wonder if the company had changed hands - or manufacturers.The box seemed well-packed from the outside , but the first thing I noticed when I opened it was that the cardboard and plastic container that was supposed to hold the small parts had broken open . The pieces were everywhere . It 's a miracle none slid out of the box . This is n't a catastrophe , obviously ; it was just the first hint that there was no care taken in packaging.The larger metal pieces were loosely rolled in bubble wrap and taped once or twice , then thrown into the box where they could slam into each other during shipping . Most of the metal pieces are scraped and scratched . Unlike the photo shown above , there is lettering on each of the rack uprights . Not surprisingly , the `` A '' in `` APEX '' is missing on one of them . Again , not a disaster from a usage perspective , but I do n't have a basement , so whatever rack I eventually choose , it will be in my living space , so details like this are not unimportant . This just shows a further lack of attention to quality.Last , but definitely not least , I took a look inside one of the uprights as I was putting it away . It 's rusting . It also does n't feel as heavy/sturdy as some of the other reviewers describe , so again , it makes you wonder if it 's the same equipment as they received . Needless to say , it 's going back .
 Ordered this product around the 20th of January . Received it on the 27th of January . Upon opening the box there was loose hardware as others have stated . I began trying to put the rack together , seemed pretty straight forward , however what I soon realized was that the left support beam did not even have any holes drilled into the middle bracket . It floors me that this was not identified before packing . I mean , it was n't something small , like a missing washer , or even a missing bolt , it literally did not have any holes drilled into the bracket . I was at a standstill . After contacting Impex I was initially told a replacement left support beam would be shipped out within a couple of weeks . A couple of weeks passed by , no replacement beam , so contacted them again , and was then told that the part is on back-order -LRB- probably because of the missing screw holes -RRB- and it would be the second week in March . I contacted them today and was told that it will still be another three weeks , that the part should arrive by the 30th of March , which will be over two months later than when I ordered it . From what I can tell of what is actually there , it looks like it might be a pretty solid rack , but buyer beware , since this is coming from China there is apparently no to very little QC , and their Customer Service is very aloof .
 I received the box and it was clearly opened . Two of the dumbbell rack bars were missing . I have tried contacting the company to rectify this , via phone all I get is a busy signal and by email they have yet to respond at this point . So it looks like I will be returning it . Too bad , because the unit seems to be pretty nice.Steve W
 Was not packaged well . Components received damaged and the parts bag was damaged enough that it was open and parts were missing .
 Overall this is the product I needed for my dumbbells , however it was either packaged poorly and damaged during shipment or there was no quality check before it was sent out . When I opened the package and started to assemble it , one of the legs had a huge dent on the outside part.Obviously it is going to get banged up with use -LRB- especially weights going on and off all the time -RRB- , but it always frustrates me to get something already messed up . Will still use this product since it is what I am looking for but will definitely avoid this seller when possible in the future .
 Size is a big disappointment . They measure 3 &#34; x 6 &#34; , not much bigger than an index card . The quality is fine and holes are pre-punched but if you are expecting these to be the size of a small race bib , order something else .
 Tear resistant race numbers are fine for an informal race or event . Check some shoe company resources or other sponsors .
 I ca n't believe nike would slap their name on such an unreliable piece of crap . The watch worked great until about 4 months of ownership . The crappy rubber straps broke off from the display then the display became all distorted after one use in the rain on a run . It then proceeded to stop working completely . I 'll buy a different brand of watches as this is the third nike watch that this has happened to me with .
 I bought this product and I thought it 's with the hat as the picture shown , but it just a net like the product of $ 2.89 , if I knew it 's without the hat , I will buy the other one with the hat or the cheaper one without hat .
 Handy to slip on for quick trips outside , no tying needed . Hat rim and hoop need to be bigger to keep net off of skin .
 Product does not look like the photo . Very small - mesh sits too close to face for comfort . Would only use in an extreme emergency . Not comfortable for any extended period of outdoor work in buggy conditions . Very disappointing .
 The bars are very light and feel cheap when you pick them up . No worries I say , they 're CHEAP and I do n't want to shell out the Benjamins for real , solid professional equipment . Besides , I 'm not running a professional gym ; it 's just me and my son working out in our home gym.All goes well until the end piece -LRB- where the weight plates sit -RRB- on the curl bar pops off with no warning . The force of gravity causes the weights to fall with loud noises , YIKES what surprise . Loud noises , cussing , the curl bar twists violently in my hands -LRB- one side is now considerably lighter then the other -RRB- , dents in floor , etc. . No injuries , but certainly could have been broken feet , crushed toes , and serious wrist and forearm injuries from the sudden violent twist when one side unloaded quickly.Well , now I 'm out what I pad for the damn bar and I 'm feeling silly to boot . I share my pain only to prevent you from making the same stupid mistake I did . You do n't get something for nothing , you get what you pay for , and cheap equipment will cost you more in the long run.I will now do what I should have done in the first place , namely belly up to the -LRB- curl -RRB- bar and pay for a solid professional well made curl bar , not this junk .
 I purchased this item for two reasons
 Well , I , like many , decided to give up driving to the gym and work out at home . Unlike many , I DO have the dedication to keep it up . I have 550 lbs of weights -LRB- granted I can only bench 405 , but hey , I 'm working on it ... -RRB- If I was to ever try ` roids ... but , back to the rating . I 'll give it 2 stars ONLY because the weights fit the bar . The clips barely hold the weights on , the collar is too small , allowing the Olympic weight plates to tilt , rattle and slide around , if you have too much weight on , you need two clips to hold the plates or they will slide off . The dumbbell bars are so long , I can do two handed curls with them . If you do n't turn them on the way down , you 'll actually hit your crotch with them . The curl bar on the other hand , while again , the plates rattle and rock way too much , it does the job . Length is good , you can put a lot of weight on it , and the funny thing , it weighs less than 5 lbs . Expected 20 pounds . The dumbbells would be much better if they were about 4-6 '' shorter on EACH END . But for the price , might have to consider a 3 star .
 Purchase date
 Do not waste your time with these . They are too light , so do n't stand up over time and the spring clasps could n't hold a baby 's diaper on let alone a 5 pound weight plate
 Stay away . This product is terrible . Very low quality and borderline dangerous . You get what you pay for . I should have known better . Low price and low quality .
 This set is hollow and feels low quality , the curl bar works ok but the dumbbells are just to light and hollow feeling . I would recommend getting a hight quality set .
 The bars worked ok for a few months , but then broke . One end of one of the small bars detached from the bar making it useless . Not happy .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 fast delivery , items arrived in good shape .
 In fairness our house has anly two stud partition walls , but I bought this for its ability to accurately detect mains cable in walls ... I think it works on a combined photo-optic / acoustic principle . ie if it ca n't see the cable or hear the sound of a light switch that it 's just bumped into , it gets a little vague.Yes it detects electrical cables in walls but it can also throw up some very spurious readings . For instance , I appear to have a wall that is full of electrcity ... The mains indicator and beeper stay on for the whole of the wall scan.Maybe I 've just located the National Grid ... A friend of mine makes / repairs boat rudders and asked me if I could trace the metal element within his most recent repair job
 I purchased this product to install my new projector mount . After wasting much time I set my son to writing this review . I approve of his assessment whole heartedly!This product can not calibrate at all . A good example for how it works is , practically not at all . My theory is that a hamster could sniff out studs better than this `` so called '' product.Don ' t bother !

 Tried these because they are so cheap . Tey are not good at clamping and you can not see through the rings on a Ruger MKIII Hunter pistol with Simmons Prohunter scope . The REAL Weaver rings work perfectly however and are worth every penny . -LRB- Weaver See-Thru 1-Inch Detachable Rings -RRB-

 This item snapped after one month of use , with pieces flying across the room - could have been dangerous . I was only stretching it slowly while gripping the handles in each hand , and I 'm not particularly strong .
 Exactly what we were looking for in terms of size and function . Yet taking it out of the box yielded a poorly constructed product that was received in numerous pieces-especially where the legs were supposed to be attached . Too much plastic that was brittle and consequently prone to shattering , and that is how it was received . Kudos to Amazon for accepting it back with a full refund .
 Placed order 0n Jan 2 , 2010 on Amazon . Did not receive from Target untill Jan 13 , 2010 . I have been using Amazon for about 3 years . This order was the most I 've ever waited for . Maybe Target needs to kick it up notch .
 Admittedly this table has a sturdy , good quality top , and as one person stated it 's not quite 37 '' but that was ok . Our problem was that the the legs were attached but we found several unused screws in the bottom of the box . When we turned the table over to look more closely there were 4 holes that were never drilled -LRB- so no way to put the screws in -RRB- and the legs were not completely attached . The other screws in the bottom were meant to go into already drilled holes -LRB- also supporting the legs -RRB- that were so wallowed out the screws just fell right out.Bottom line - we returned this table - somewhere along the way someone or some machine did n't do their job - and apparently no one checks to be sure it 's 100 % correct . If you do order , be sure to double check that the legs are attached correctly , that way there wo n't be any surprises if it all of a sudden falls over .
 This is the most disappointed item I ever purchased from Amazon . The first shipment I received was missing 5 screws . My second replacement table was not only missing 5 screws , but also had a dent in one corner -LRB- although the package was in perfect condition -RRB- . The amazon customer service was great , just this particular product they sell is terrible . I do n't think I want to buy any Lifetime product in the future .
 In my opinion I would not advise to buy this table . The table arrived and most of the screws holding the metal frame to the plastic table top were missing some were loose in the box . I took the few loose screws in the bottom of the box and re-installed them . One of the screws came through the top of the table , I did not know this until I got large scratch on my hand . The remaining screws are loose because they are only secured by the plastic table top and once they come out and re-installed they will not tighten properly.Very poor product in my opinion . Lifetime who 's lifetime ?
 After reading the reviews about this table , I decided to ignore the warnings about screws missing , uneven legs , etc. and went ahead and ordered it . I should have believed them . My table arrived with one screw loose in the box , another one missing . I put the screw in but it does n't go in all the way . With the other one missing , I have to go find one that will work . The table legs are not straight when unfolded . What is happening to the quality of U.S. made products ? Once everything is fixed , the table will work fine but I should n't have to take the time to make these adjustments , nor should you if you decide to buy it . If you do buy it , just beware that these are shortcomings you might have to fix yourself .
 The table top is great and the hardware , under the table top , is great . But , it just is n't designed very well . Every screw , connecting the metal hardware to the plastic table top was loose . I tightened every screw , but you ca n't really tighten it that much because the screws go through the metal and through the thin plastic . So there is nothing for the screws to attach to . I think this is why so many people have complained that the screws were loose or fell out . I know I 'll have to periodically tighten the screws on my table.My table arrived on time , but the box was damaged . One corner of my table has a small dent in it and one of the metal hinges was slightly bent . These problems were not big enough for me to bother sending it back . The table top is sturdy and it looks great and I need it for a picnic in a few days .
 This 37 Inch folding table is great.We bought a few from Amazon and other places at a lower cost basis too.From Amazon they arrived damaged but still usable . It was not packaged well . The Bill of Lading was a JOKE -LRB- I HOPE -RRB- as it lacked any details.Why did the other shippers send them in great packages as well bills of lading ? Amazon we rATe 1.3 out of ten -LRB- 10 -RRB- . The shipper AMAZON we Rate ZERO , ZILTCH , NY BAGEL HOLE , ZIP ... At least the table we gave/delivered to the Seniors did not have to be in perfect shape as AMAZON shipped damaged goods sold as new but arrived as old used pieces marred . .
 Complete garbage advertising . This did not come with the mini-disc or anything else . Just the 10 discs which were great ... except there was only 3-4 different colors so lots of multiples.Don ' t get me wrong ... these are great discs at a good price but I figured they needed a bad review to get the attention of the sellers.Don ' t advertise a mini disc etc if you are never going to include it . Apparently no one gets the mini-disc ... see other reviews.Also try to not have so many colors doubled up ... I got the feeling they were trying to get rid of some of the less desirable colors .
 The stakes are light but are easily bendable and probably will be not usable in anything but soft soil without rocks .
 I ordered this watch because it was shown that it was a `` NEW '' watch . It was n't . It was obviously a very used watch with an original Valjoux 7750 movement in it which is a 17 jewel and not a newer 25 jewel version . The rotor was not the decorated one but a plain one . The case and dial are the same and this is a gorgeous watch but you could tell the bracelet had been sized and the identifying marks on the back of the watch had been very wore off . I was disappointed it was n't new . I will still be in search of a new one since this model is no longer in production . It took about a month to receive a refund .
 I paid $ 500 for this watch and the bezel broke within 6 months . it feels pretty cheap although the movement looks cool through the back . I would n't recommend this watch . Also the hands never lined up right ... terrible purchase on my part .

 We bought the T72 a few months ago . We had a used treadmill and decided we were ready to make the investment . Actually putting the thing together was not that easy because the holes did not match up on the hand rests . That aside though , we were ready to get started.The product worked great for several weeks and then the belt just stopped in the middle of a running workout . The computer kept working , but the belt did n't restart . When the machine was turned off and back on , it started up with no problem.The same thing happened several more times , so we called customer support only to discover they are only available from 8 till 5 . So we sent an email . Several days later we get a response asking us to verify that it is on a `` dedicated 20 amp circuit . '' We have since moved it to 5 different locations with no success.After another 3 phone calls and 3 different associates with a whole list of failed suggestions , a customer service rep said we might need a new drive motor . Since the part was on backorder , we must not be the only ones with this issue . They said the installation would be easy but that they could send a tech if needed.The installation was NOT easy , so we called for a rep. -LRB- Is n't that why we pay for the warranty ? -RRB- We were set up with a 4 hour time slot the next day . Three hours into that time slot , we got a call saying the tech could n't make it . We were told he 'd be here somewhere between 8 and 5 the next day.We are now out countless hours troubleshooting this ourselves , plus several phone calls and emails , and two days of work all to get a treadmill working that has been sitting in our home -LRB- paid for and warrantied -RRB- for several months.I would not waste my time on Horizon Fitness . I think that if the product works , you 'll have a good experience with the treadmill , but if you need help ... you wo n't find much customer service . I 'm not saying this to be hateful ; just trying to save other buyers the headache .
 The assembly of this treadmill should not take more than 1/2 hour , but it took me almost one and half hour !!! Why , this is due to the poor fit and finish . They were 3 places I could not get the bolts to fit in no matter how I tried . Another place the bolt fitted in very poorly . I left with 3 bolts for 3 different places that I could not get them to fit in ! Fortunately , they are not crucial . The poor alignment of the parts are just terrible !!! I have never encountered anything like this before . There is no way that I was going to pack this monster back for exchange because they were not crucial areas . Besides , what makes you think another one would have a better fit ? This is the worst Chinese made product I have bought . I just hope the treadmill is reliable for a few years . Good thing that I bought the extended warranty . I would suggest that you stay away from Horizon products !
 I was disappointed that a piece of cardboard is the stand for the ball ... . other cubes had clear plastic and for less price ... I made a bad choice , I should have chosen another ... Price was too much for this product ... it looks like something I could have found at The Dollar Tree .
 I bought this flash stand for my hard tail bike , realize that its plastic material at the bottom bracket support area is quite weak . Upon fitting it up onto my bike , I realize I can actually `` bounce '' my bicycle like a basketball when gently pressing down onto the saddle . Its quite difficult to fit it up , reason that its fold-able legs and top arm moves around when trying to get it up and standing . The rear wheel ground clearance was n't very high , not good enough for me to do maintenance work on my bike as the flash stand will `` bounce '' when I start to pedal the bike . Very disappointed with Top Peak products , I bought both their flash stand and tune-up dx , and was very disappointed with the design ... I support Top Peak a lot , I bought their cycle bags and bicycle pumps which are very good , but it seems that their bike stand was n't !!!!! Top Peak , wake up !!!!!
 I bought it and thought it would be ok for my folding bikes ; however on the product description page , it didnot specify what type of bikes it is tended for . But there 's more detailed description on the product which type of bikes the stand is to be used . but it is for sure a handy tool for the road .
 I bought this at a local shop because I was doing brake work on my daughter 's little mountain bike . To begin with , it 's so tiny that it does n't have the leverage to keep the bike elevated for long to begin with . I was using it on concrete , and it kept slipping after a few minutes , even on that rough surface . Also , the size only allows for maybe half an inch of clearance below the tire at best.Finally -LRB- and most importantly -RRB- the expandable part is made of plastic -- I broke it within an hour of use .
 I held high hopes for the product - being that I live in a little apartment in NYC , I was looking forward to saving space . The tune-up stand is little/portable , however it was not too sturdy . The bike , while on the stand , will not withstand much torque at all . The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand . Forget about turning the crank , the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over . This stand would be good for LIGHT work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag . Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike . Overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person 's bike or a bmx . I used it on a men 's road bike size 57 .
 I can not recommend this device for most people . This little stand , while cute and convenient to tote along in your larger tool kit , is too flimsy and unstable for anything more than very delicate work . Lube your chain carefully , or check your rear tire for debris . It even says in the included instructions `` not to spin the tire rapidly , or apply the brakes abruptly '' . If you do it will fling itself to the ground . The stand is also rated for no more than 30lbs , so is unsafe to use on larger hybrids or mountain bikes . If only the legs opened a little wider , or they used aluminum in place of the soft plastic , I would be willing to pay more for the convenience . Even setting on a level blacktop surface , my best road bike was knocked over with a slight gust of wind . I spent more on deraileur repairs after that than the darned stand cost !
 I bought it from a cycling distribution rag even before Al Gore invented the internet . At first I liked it , but it started to bug me after a while . First is that it stands the bike up too high even on it 's lowest setting -- the back wheel is several inches up in the air . Not a big deal , but somewhat of a pain . The next issue was when I graduated from my steel frame bikes to carbon , the `` cradle '' that holds the bottom bracket is just plain not big enough . It allows the BB area of the frame to slip and slide all over . The last thing that really sent it over the edge was the plaastic piece that joins the main body to the single arm that goes around the downtube , split in half . I was just putting a rack on the bike , so it was n't like I was really wrenching on it . I called Topeak who is usually excellent in CS , and they said they do n't offer replacement parts for this device . So , I would stay away since the design is a bit old -LRB- small tubes -RRB- , and it could have the tendency like mine to break . I 'm going to try to epoxy it back , but we shall see.I own many , many Topeak products , pumps , racks , bags for racks , you name it and they are very well engineered . This is by far my least favorite of the Topeak lineup .
 I got this product in hopes of using it with my very heavy , very large 45lbs downhill mountain bike . After trying for a while to make it work , it would turn out that this stand is n't sturdy enough for a large bike . The instructions state not to put something more than 30 lbs on it , despite advertising it as a stand that can be used with a mountain bike . It also states it can not handle wheels larger than 26 '' . I tried using it with my hybrid bike , which is much smaller and lighter than my mountain bike , and the stand still struggled to work with it . I then finally tried it on a female friend 's hybrid bike -LRB- which is s considerably smaller than my hybrid -RRB- and the stand worked fine.So if you have a heavy bike , or a bike with a large frame , this is n't going to work . If you have a smaller bike , it will probably work , but there are better and cheaper options . Topeak normally makes great products , but this one is a dud .
 This watch was a great price but it arrived with no setup instructions . I have found it very difficult to set because freestyle does not have instructions on set up either.I guess I must return it because a watch that doesnt show correct time is really no deal .
 What they do n't tell you is it 's made of gauze or something similar . The tag says `` Line Dry '' . I have n't bought a shirt in 30 years I could n't dry in the drier . As a result , one wear , one wash and it 's got one huge and about 15 small holes in it.My son 's first Pirates shirt was a horrible waste of money .
 While I ca n't say why , the activated carbon was unusually dirty -LRB- gritty -RRB- . When washing in a fine strainer it was quite dirty , and a significant amount of the volume was lost . I suppose it is possible it was end of production lot and therefore more composed of carbon dust than most . I 've switched to another brand .
 Be careful if you decide to purchase this watch in that it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to read the numbers on the face of this watch . It 's true even if you press and hold in the light button . I have had more expensive Freestyles before and they worked just fine . I called Freestyle directly today when I received this new watch and could not read the dials -LRB- 800.874.0907 # 2 -RRB- . I was told that `` yes , some of the Predator models were a little difficult to read '' . They were professional about it & admitted that there had been some other complaints with this lower end watch . I then asked
 I purchased this for my 12 year old who is a runner . I was hoping he would be able to use it to clock his running times , and use it for general purposes , too . However , the digital readout is really hard to see , its dim . And if you turn the watch to a certain angle , its impossible to see the time . There is a light that illuminates the face , but it stays on for approx one second . I do n't think we 'll be keeping the watch . The video clip on the listing shows a fairly accurate picture of the watch and its display . I should have paid more attention before ordering .
 I am a 5 '10 225 bodybuilder with average length arms . I had to stand up to grab the curl bar then sit down and do my set . The bench rest sits way to far out in front of the arm rest . I tried to do grab the curl bar while remaining in the seat and I almost cracked my elbow because I had to fully extend my arms to start the set . There is a reason why a commercial gym will never purchase this bench ; people will be hyper extending there elbows left and right - law suit ! This thing has a BIG DESIGN FLAW and I wish I did n't buy it .
 I got this airsoft gun just for fun and i 'm not that serius about it , but it does n't work very good . It is easily jammed and then the bb 's will fall out all over the place . It also sucks that it will only hold 10 bb 's . It 's pretty much what I expected for the price .
 With today 's cheap electronics and LED technology it 's trivial to make a super bright bike tail light . What you are really paying for here is the housing and mounting bracket.I bought four of these when there was a blowout sale at REI . They 're not terrible as other people have mentioned -LRB- cheap , small , light , bright , cheap , long running , clip for clothes , cheap , and did I mention , cheap ? -RRB- What I do n't like is that the light snaps together - this is not unusual but the plastic on mine are thin enough that dropping the light onto a hard surface means you might be chasing the batteries on your hands and knees . Also , it 's the plastic on the mount/clamp is n't very sturdy and if you put it on a mountain bike , it will need to be adjusted after every hard bump . Basically the plastic is so thin that you ca n't really tighten the adjustment screw sufficiently to keep it from slipping.Do a search here at Amazon or the other online bike retailers - it appears you can definitely do better for the same price or even get something better for less!Cateye makes top notch stuff , and it appears they have one which is the same price . -LRB- LD-130 -RRB- I ended up with a more expensive Cateye tail light LD1100 and do not regret the extra $ 20 I paid for it.Princeton Tec , Marwi , Blackburn and Topeak make good stuff - not as good as Cateye but certainly better than this.Ride safe ! Be seen!If you 've found this review to be helpful , please let me know !
 While riding in a Critical Mass event , I hit a small bump on the street and the jolt sensation was mild , but apparently enough to cause this light to unclip itself and fall off . I was unable to retrieve it as the situation could get dangerous with so many cyclists involved in the event.I bought a second one of the same make and model , but this time I 'm adding a fix to the flaw ... electrical tape to further secure it .
 I ca n't even figure out how to get this thing open to install the batteries . I do n't like it - it 's not very user friendly .
 Was very frustrated trying to figure out assembly and installation of batteries ... . no directions came with it . Also , mine was defective so contacted Amazon 's excellent customer support , and they credited my account without returning it . I bought the Portland Design Works Danger Zone taillight and glad that I spent the extra $ 20 as it works fantastic .
 Good news :1 -RRB- Bright Light2 -RRB- Good construction3 -RRB- Batteries includedBad news :1 -RRB- Poor design2 -RRB- Wo n't mount on rear bike rack -LRB- included seat mount 's do n't work if you have a bike rack -RRB- The mounting bracket is rotated 90 degrees -LRB- 1/4 turn -RRB- the wrong direction to mount horizontally on the standard rear bracket on a rear bike rack where your rear reflector normally mounts . To make it work you have to bend your mounting the bracket 90 degrees . It should come with an adaptor . You ca n't mount on your seat shaft if you have a seat storage device mounted , so those two included options are useless . Fix this and I would give it 5 stars !!! Found out from another person on Amazon that the vendor makes the required piece of plastic for mounting their light to a rear bike rack , BUT THEY DO N'T TELL YOU THIS $ 3.40 IS REQUIRED TO MOUNT THEIR LIGHT ANYWHERE BUT ON A SEAT POST ! This $ 0.25 piece of plastic should be part of the kit I already bought . The fact that they have this piece and do n't include it , and do n't tell you that you MUST have this to mount their light on your rear bike rack AND DO N'T TELL YOU , but instead rip off their customer for ANOTHER $ 3.40 , tells me that they are dishonest and I will never recommend or buy from them again and lowered my rating to a ZERO/ONE for this dishonest method of marketing this product .
 I was initially excited about receiving this bike lamp , but when I tried to mount it , I realized that one needed a Phd in mechanical engineering to determine how it works . Talk about over complicated ! First thing is it comes with only one nut that is so tightly jammed into one of the two provided mounts that it was nearly impossible to remove . After cutting open the first mount with a pair of nippers , I successfully disengaged the nut from the jaws of death and was finally able to use it in the smaller mount provided . I think the engineers at Planet Bike could come up with a simpler mount - or perhaps -LRB- oh , ghastly silence -RRB- include TWO nuts - one for each mount ! Or would that break the profit margin ? My recommendation is to shop elsewhere .
 The LED lights do not work . I replaced the batteries and even tried putting them in the other way but still no luck . I contacted the seller I am waiting to hear back .
 This came tossed loose in the shipping box with the other items in my order . There was a sticker slapped on the lens of the light . No seat post mount . No stay mount . No box . No batteries . Come on Amazon , what the heck !? I ordered one of these a few weeks ago and it was perfect , but this one was a disaster . Makes you wonder what the heck Amazon was thinking shipping this out . Very disappointing .
 just putting batteries in and closing it up made me lose years off my life . thankfully it finally broke , now I 'm shopping for lights again .
 I have a trek 1.5 and I mounted mine under the seat post . It was a tight fit , apparently my seat post is almost too thick for this light - it was a little hard to get on , but it worked .1 week later while riding a normal ride , I noticed the light was n't staying in place - it kept lowering and pointing downward . I had to lift it up multiple tmes while riding and keep checking on it . Next thing I know , the light is gone
 I could not say more good things about the light itself , especially for the price . But the clamp is so cheap , it renders the light useless . I guess proper engineering takes money . If the light was n't so good , I 'd give it a `` 1 '' star because of the clamp .
 So I bought this due to the price and great reviews . The light its self is great . Very bright and seems of good quality . The bracket is what sinks the product . I just could n't get it to fit snugly any where in my bike . Finally it seemed to be securley fastened to my rear rack bars . Went for a ride got home and guess what ? It fell off ! I 'm now going to try and get a refund from the seller without having physical possession of most of the item . Wish me luck !
 The light itself is really bright . The bike attachment piece is cheap soft plastic . Could n't get the screw tight enough to hold the light in a level position , so it was often pointed at the ground . Finally the screw vibrated loose and I lost it somewhere . I did n't have the light attached at the time so I mounted it to my rack with the mounting kit that was provided with the rack .
 It attached very firmly to my seat post . Everything was great , but it has a quick release that made it fall off my bike . I was not on rough terrain . Where is a blinky that will not fall off ? I would not buy again .
 Feel off on a bump - LED unit fell off and was lost . Did not last more than a month . Road Biking only .
 I recently bought three different bicycle tail lights , one for each of my family 's three bikes . This was the worst of the three . It is fairly bright , but not as bright as the other two -LRB- all had new batteries -RRB- . The other two can also be seen through a wider angle , making it easier for traffic to see the light even when they are not approaching from directly behind the bike . The best of the three was the Planet Bike Blinky Superflash .
 I received this and mounted this bike light on the same day and biked out to my night job , which clearly explains the need for a rather bright bike light . I will concede that the light is quite bright , and blinks reasonably well . However , let me frame the scenario for you
 Snaps together with a friction fit -LRB- NOT using clips or hooks as some others do -RRB- , as a result it fell to pieces after a year or so.Secondly , the switch is a carbon disc soft contact type instead of a true switch ; as a result , when it gets gummed up it will stop working.Even at $ 10 this light is overpriced .
 Worked for about six weeks , after which water got in and caused corrosion which made it non-functional . For a little more money , you can get a much nicer light .
 As others have stated , you break every finglenail on your hand trying to get it open to install the battery and still could n't get it open .
 Far too many other options out there to buy before this . Very unhappy with the quality and the ability to fasten to a bike .
 I could never get this apart to actually put the battery in and turn it on . Maybe I 'm an idiot . Or weak . Or both . Does n't seem like it 's intuitive to use . Very cheap feeling & flimsy - would not recommend . BOO .
 If you want to keep the light from slipping out of the bracket , duct tape it . After 3 months of use , it bounced out of the plastic bracket and shattered on the road.I could imagine the bracket breaking completely if accidentally caught by a backpack strap or something . Get something else , this item is only worth the cost of the batteries.Flimsy junk .
 it took my husband over an hour to get the cover off to put the batteries in.i still ca n't figure out how in the heck to install this on my bike ! there are no instructions - just a picture of the installation options on the side of the carton . but , it does n't help you figure out where the bits go!edit
 This rack is pretty much a piece of junk . . but I think since it 's all cheap plastic I will probably end up just drilling mine out to try and make it safe.I believe the tubes slip under the weight of the bikes and/or expansion/contraction due to temperature changes as others have mentioned . We put it securely against a ceiling joist in our garage . . twice it fell.The second time it fell and put 3 dents in the hood of my car . Enough is enough . . It is probably safe if you drill out the tubes and install a locking bolt and then `` safety wire '' it to the ceiling.But then again why buy this design if it 's unsafe without modification?I 'm just glad expensive bikes are tougher then car hoods ... edit
 Received product from Amazon without the critical suction cups that allow the pole to adhere to floor and ceiling . Without these cups , the rack will surely fall over . I 've seen the product in stores , so I know it works . Just make sure you get a complete product before installing .
 I really wanted this product to work . Its very well made - german engineering . The concept is great - nothing to drill in the walls.I read the other reviews , and understand why some like and some did n't like . I spent several hours over three days , and discovered that it depends on the surfaces you are installing it on -LRB- ceiling and floor -RRB- . If you are putting this on carpet , with a textured ceiling - something for it to grab onto - it works . If you are putting it on a smooth concrete floor -LRB- in your garage , for example -RRB- , or a smooth piece of wood -LRB- like in an unfinished ceiling in your garage -RRB- , the stand does n't grip tight enough and tends to move slightly . Under the weight of bikes , and with vibration from the garage door opener , it can fall over .
 THE SHORT
 Had this for 15 months and this is not very stable . Maybe due to the seasonal contraction and expansion in my garage , the spring tension in the pole has given way at least 3 times , twice the stand slipped off the ceiling joist stud on its own . But once it is installed , it is great but if you live in a zone where the temps in your garage varies greatly with the season , watch out !!!
 This fell on my car ... twice . The first time not much damage was done to the car probably because two bikes were mounted and the lower bike helped slow the fall . The 2nd time , after remounting in what I thought was a more secure way , it was a couple months later and there was only the top bike mounted ... much more damage was done to the car . Thanks Topeak for making a product that is probably going to cost me over $ 1000 easy .
 I liked this stand very much , and installed it in my garage about 1.5 years ago . The stand and bicycles came crashing down a couple of months back , putting a sharp dent in a car . The basic problem with this stand is that it relies on friction between the floor and ceiling to work . I 'm guessing that as the seasons passed , changes in the weather caused the ceiling to move a little , perhaps even give a little -LRB- this is despite the stand being installed right where a truss is -RRB- . Regardless of the cause , the net result is that over time , this stand will work itself loose , with potentially disastrous consequences.My conclusion ? Get yourself a stand that is bolted to the wall/ceiling , or else find someway to secure this stand to the same -- so nullifying the stand 's raison d'tre .
 This rack is highly unstable . It was holding two bikes in my garage , and fell down while I was away on vacation . Both bikes and the rack landed on the hood of my car , causing several dents and scratches .
 I installed this in my garage . It was mounted under a stud and secure at the time of installation . After 12 days it fell on my car and left dents and scratches . It caused $ 2,100 in damage to my car . I believe the vibration of the garage door opening and closing allowed the stand to become loose . I would not recommend this stand to anyone .
 I bought one for my team but it was slow - lost a minute or two every couple of days . I returned it and got another - same deal . Buy one if you do n't need it to be accurate and do n't mind resetting it a couple of time a week .
 Before we even set up this tent one of the poles had been crushed . After waiting on the phone for 30 min I was told I would have to pay $ 11 for replacements . WOW how SHADY is that
 When I purchased the tent I thought it had Mickey Mouse on it since that was the picture that was listed on the website . When I received the tent it had Winnie the Pooh on it . I wish it would have been more clear in the description and photo .
 It seems that everything that I purchase these days has serious flaws or is outright junk , and this treadmill is no exception . The only thing that it has going for it is sturdiness , but then such was the case with my previous Weslo treadmill . The difference is that the Weslo , in addition to being sturdy , was simple to use and not dependent upon malfunctioning or non-programmable electronic controls , it was mechanical and reliable . I wish that the same could be said for the Merit 730T Treadmill , but sadly it is a serious piece of junk that I wish that I had never laid eyes upon.The machine is loaded with a series of automatic electronically controlled programs that can take the user through various so-called fitness cycles that have been programmed into the control circuitry . The only thing that it will not do is what I purchased it to do , and that is to allow one to manually set it to a consistent speed and simply walk , walk at varying speeds , or to run if one so desires.On the left side of the control board one can select from a series of fitness programs and on the right side of the board are - supposed - manual controls that should allow one to select the duration of the walk and to select a sustained unwavering and unchanging speed throughout that duration . But , it does n't work that way . After setting the time and the speed the machine will , anywhere from the beginning of the walk to the middle part of the walk , suddenly and without warning accelerate briefly to a running speed and then just as quickly decelerate , only to repeat the process . This goes on for anywhere from five to seven minutes before the machine settles down to the speed that it has been set at . At first I thought that this was a circuitry malfunction , but then noticed that the control panel has a line painted upon the manual control section that exactly duplicates this seriously stupid up and down cycle , I suspect that this is to inform the user that the speed will not be consistent throughout the walk.I could gleefully take a sledge hammer to this damn thing , but since I paid in excess of seven hundred dollars that is n't an alternative . I write this so that those who might be contemplating a purchase of this treadmill will be forewarned
 I got this at the end of September used it for a week then had to have it serviced . That took a month to fix the problems . Been using now for over 6 months , now the buttons on my console are n't working . Trying to get a hold of tech support no luck yet .
 Elastic in wrists and waist way too tight . Material thin as tissue paper . Zipper flimsy . Pockets too shallow . I threw it away . Do not buy , worth maybe ten bucks .
 Cheap zipper on otherwise good coat . I used this jacket hunting and twice the zipper ` popped ' open in the middle . It 's a plastic zipper , not metal . Oh , and did n't like the pockets . They were lined with ` nit ' fabric that picks at dry skin etc. ... not a soft or deep pocket .
 The stakes are strong and light , but they have one flaw which is a problem on trips that are n't very cold . The end of the stake that pokes up out of the ground is very sharp , and if you kick it in the dark wearing sandals or barefoot , it will hurt and can really rip away a piece of flesh . This can be a big problem in the back country . It 's happened to us ! If you 're going someplace where for sure there will be no bare feet near the tents , these stakes are great . But summer meadows and river side campsites , or if you 're partying and likely to go out to pee barefoot . Watch out !

 Had to return this because it was way too small . Ordered similar item without the mock neck and it was true to size .
 I ordered 2 of these Under Armour Tees , I needed MENS Extra Large , Paragon sent me 2 YOUTH sizes in Medium . I called Paragon and they were sorry for the mix up and sent me a prepaid return Label . After they received my return they sent me another package with the same 2 , Youth sizes in Medium . I again called Paragon And the bottom line was that they do n't or never did have the size I needed . I was told they would send me a return label ... I 'M STILL WAITING . FOR A LABEL AND A REFUND . NEVER AGAIN .
 Okay , how can you go wrong with this product?It does not fit my aftermarket -LRB- Magpul -RRB- front sight , it does not fit my Bushmaster front sight , it does not fit my Colt front sight , it does not fit my Stag front sight and it does not fit my Sota front sight.The problem is that it is too large to fit between the left and right protective flange on front sights.What does it fit ? I guess I could keep buying guns in order to find out ... If you need a front sight tool UTG is no help at all .
 It will not work without a file you will need to adjust this to get it to almost work I just bought another from the gun store
 First use and of the prongs snapped off due to the alloy mixture being either way too hard or more likely far too soft .
 This chair has a major flaw . When you step on the bottom canvas foot rest to sit down the whole chair collapses . This chair is high so most children or small adults wanting to sit have to be picked up and placed in the chair . Since I bought it for face-painting it is useless to me . Picking up all those kids is too much work . I went back to my wooden directors chair which is extremely sturdy but heavy to carry .
 If I pay $ 20 + for an official MLB hat , the only logo want on the outside of my hat is my team 's . I ca n't believe '47 brand had the balls to put their own logo on the side of this hat . Ruins that hat for me . What a stupid decision and I ca n't believe MLB allows it .

 This bike cover is sufficient at first , but , after owning it for a while , I see that it has some major flaws . It does n't cover the wheels entirely , it does n't fit back into the zipper pouch once opened , and it tears like crazy after a while . I 've considered duct-taping the inside where all the holes are , but then I ask myself
 Ar first I really liked this cover as it fit my bike well . I ordered a second one when I bought a new bike from AMZN . It last about a year before it rotted and tore . For this price I think it should have lasted at least 2 years . I will not purchase another one , so if anyone has found a durable cover in this price range please let me know . Thanks .
 The basic gist of my experience is that I wish I had listened to other reviews highlighting that it only claims to be water RESISTANT , not waterPROOF . I keep my bike outside and wanted the protection from water that a tarp offers , but with the snug fit of this cover . It looks pretty , fit my bike well , but could barely be called water resistant.I 'd say this cover is probably great if you plan on keeping your bike on a porch , or if you live in a very dry climate , but otherwise you may be better off just using a tarp .
 Basically the cover is too short and does not cover the entire wheels of the bike properly . The material of the cover is also a lot thinner than I had imagined . It is almost paper thin and it feels very fragile and weak . I 'm not sure how long can this material can withstand the outdoor weather of sun and rain exposure . I 'd expected a higher quality product from Topeak , considering the amount paid for a mere sheet of fabric . And also , folding the cover in its bag is like mission impossible , so do n't even bother trying .
 After one year outside , the cover is in tatters . Might be good for indoor use , but it ca n't handle the rain , wind and sun .
 Nice design in terms of the fit of the cover over the bicycle . However , the VERY light weight of this cover can make it a little challenging to use in anything over a light breeze . It really blows all over the place.Worse , this cover only lasted one year of everyday use -LRB- in Southern California , plenty of sun , little rain and no snow -RRB- . The fabric has now reached a level of disintegration such that ordinary handling of the cover results in tearing . My cover is now a sieve.I expect significantly better longevity for the price we are asked to pay for this , particularly as we can purchase similar -LRB- if not more feature-filled -RRB- designs with much more durable fabric , for considerably less cash . I suppose for long-distance road bikers , the light weight would appeal , and this cover might be acceptable if used occasionally on road trips . But , this one is marketed for Mountain Bikes as well . `` The Sieve '' gets only one star from this rider ...
 The bike cover seems fairly well made but will not stay on the bike if there is any wind . There is no way to fasten it down . It blows off the bike and was of no use . Is only good in a controlled environment with no wind . Was not suitable for my use .
 After seeing a lot of complaints about the size , I still decided to try my luck with these . But I must say that the size is indeed problematic.I have a 2012 Specialized Sirrus hybrid in XL , which is more of a road bike , but I decided to get this mountain cover since from the specified measurements it seemed to be larger and fit my bike better . However , even the chain would n't be properly covered with this . It just was n't large enough , and perhaps my bike being XL worsened the problem.It might still work for smaller bikes if you want to try your own luck though .
 I must say , like LUCYPYE that mine basically rotted out all its strength in the sun after a year . I try to duct tape around the rips and it tears again around the tape . I am replacing it with the blackAvenir Nylon Bicycle Cover -LRB- Mountain Bike -RRB- cover for only $ 21 + free Prime shipping . That one should have rotted out even worse in the sun because it 's black , but mine is great after several years outside . I think the Mt. bike Avenir is more generous , because reviews said the road version was sized pretty small . Enjoy !
 This is a great bike cover if you own a really small frame bike with narrow width handlebars . I have five bikes and sadly this cover would not fit any of them . This is unfortunate inasmuch as Topeak makes quality bicycle assessories .
 This is n't a terrible bike cover , but it is expensive and comes with several caveats . First , I have a 17.5 '' MTB and it barely fits over it . The front portion only covers about 1/2 the front tire and it 's the same with the rear tire . If you 're hoping it will protect against anything other than dust , you 're kidding yourself . Second , since it is such a tight fit , it takes too long to fit over your bike . It 's like trying to fit 30 '' jeans on a 36 '' waist . Good luck with that . Finally , if you plan on putting any after market accessories on your bike , such as a fender , rack , or mirror -- you can forget about this cover . It barely fits a bike without any accessories . It 's worth about $ 12 , costs $ 30 , and does n't cover well at all . I actually bought an inexpensive motorcycle cover to fit over my MTB with accessories . Half the price of this and double the coverage . See review here
 Too small to cover all but the Tiniest Bicycles . Cheap Fabric - Do n't waste your money
 While this cover does fit well onto a full sized mountain or hybrid bike , even a light wind will blow the cover off the bike . The product really needs some kind of tie down or weight to keep in in place .
 I used this bike cover for a bike I store outdoors in the California sunshine . Did a nice job keeping it dry and relatively dust free . After 4 months though the fabric over the handlebars tore due to weakness in the sun bleached fabric . It eventually tore the length of the bike , rendering it mostly useless.Reccommedation
 First impression was terrible . It looks like its been tied behind a car and dragged for awile . I do n't know if its the color but the entire thing looks like it should after I 've owned it for several years . Second impression , after I opened it , was n't great either . It feels extremely flimsy . That is my biggest problem with it , it doesnt feel like it can handle much stress . The box itself is study enough , its the hinge . I 'm pretty sure it 's going to break . Ca n't say when or how , but if the lid twist for any reason this thing is done for . The top compartment is cool and useful . I 've only had it out three times now , -LRB- target shooting in the woods -RRB- and it has held up , but I would n't recommend it to anyone .
 Their small box is fine but this box is so ugly . It looks like somebody threw dirt in the plastic resin . I am not sure what they were going for a camo effect but whatever it did not work . It is has a little hinged compartment on top that is so small I could not visualize using it for anything . Really cuts down on the size of the box . Box hinges look flimsy . I usually like Plano products but this one is a rip off . Looks nothing like the photo . I have nothing good to say about this box . Worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon .
 While the light itself is very bright , and the enclosure looks pretty good , this product is quite delicate.When I first got the light , I was pretty careful about making sure the light was firmy attached in place . I was actually pretty paranoid about it . Before I would start riding , not only would I make sure the mount `` clicked '' , but I would tug it to make sure the light did n't move . About 2-3 days after I purchased my light , it slipped off the mount . I figured , okay , maybe that one time I did n't check for a click , even though I did tug at it to make sure it did n't move . Even though I was n't going very fast at all , as I was still in my work 's parking lot , the light bulb broke -LRB- in half ! -RRB- . I decided to purchase a new bulb , at $ 110 -LRB- ! -RRB- , since I could n't return the item at that point , and I already spent quite a bit on it.After a bit of inspection , I discovered that even though the mount clicks , there is a tab that has to be pulled out regardless ! It sort of sticks halfway between gripping the lamp , and not gripping anything . So , I got in the habit of pulling that tab out every time I went anywhere.Quite annoying , mind you!The new bulb maybe lasted for a month before it slipped off the mount again.I then decided to not purchase another delicate bulb and get a cheaper , much less fragile -LRB- but seemingly equally bright -RRB- LED light , the Cygolite Trion600 . So far , so good ! This light also has a mount that swivels , and has more dimming/flashing options.Please note that I have owned a few Planetbike lights before , and have NEVER had a problem with their mounts . It is entirely possible that I got a defective mount with this light . * sigh * I would definitely buy from PlanetBike again , I would stay away from this light .
 I love this light . It throws off mass quantities of lumens !! :-RRB- And the duration was great ... It would throw off light for 2 hours or more.However , the battery has really poor charge/discharge cycle limits ... After 6 months or so the battery life really degraded to the point that I can only get 20 minutes of light out of it . And in fairness to the manufacturer , they state in their literature that the battery is only good for 180 charge/discharge cycles . That 's 6 months of commuting . PLUS ... I ca n't figure out how to get a replacement battery . I 've never seen a time when Planet Bike has had them in stock.So ... if you want to use this thing for 6 months ... great ... that 's a pricey way to go but each of us has our threshold of financial pain ... . but if you want something that is going to last longer do not buy this product.I 'd buy another one in a heartbeat if they get the battery charge/discharge cycle count issue fixed .
 I 've had the Alias HID for about 9 months now , and I have to agree with much of B. Main 's review
 I was extremely disappointed in this product . First of all when I received the pedometer the battery was just about dead . None of the stores I went to had this battery in stock . Finally after 2 weeks of searching I found the battery , which cost me $ 4.99 . Now I wear the pedometer and I find it is not accurate at all . I walked at least 2 miles today and my pedometer shows .30 miles . I would not recommend this product .
 Just recceived it today . From the display screeen , I immediately realized that the battery was dead . The package back cover claimed `` 5-year , no-proof-of-purchase limitd warranty - free service for first year . $ 10 fee thereafter . ASSEMBLED IN TAIWAN -LRB- C -RRB- 2006 ACCUSPLIT `` On the product itself , the following words are printed there : `` ACCUSPLT EAGLE Activity Pedometer No-Proof-of-Purchase Limited Warranty -LRB- TM -RRB- For refurbish-repair-replacement service , return withday phone # -LRB- between 1/1/07 t 1/1/11 add $ 12 fee -RRB- . `` I guess this product must be assembled in 1/1/2006 , so ACCUSPLIT considered it has fulfilled its `` free servicce for first year '' by 1/1/2007 . After that date ACCUSPLIT would charge either $ 10 or $ 12 for the service and this is ACCUSPLIT so-called `` 5-YEAR , NO-PROOF-OF-PURCHASE WARRANTY '' ! But I just ordered it last week and received it today and it 's now 1/26/2010 -LRB- In other words , I 'll never get the `` free service for first year ! '' -RRB- and the battary has run out -LRB- I 'm not surprised since the battery has run more than four years according to the info provided by the company . -RRB- In short , this is the worst product and the worst service warranty I had ever seen . I 'd like to give this product 0 star if I could . Buyers beware !
 Well my son just opened the pedometer , goes to use it and wont display - has a rattling noise , my husband took it to work and it may be the battery but the package indicates the battery is good for up to 1800 hours , well ours wasnt working at all , so now we are out the price of a battery , I do hope that was the only problem . So far not so good
 I have an Accusplit pedometer which I 've used daily for a long time , & I love it . Bought this one for my husband and neither of us could ever get anywhere near an accurate step count with it . I returned it for a refund . He really likes to measure distance -- I only care about steps . Maybe that 's the difference . Or maybe we just got the odd lemon with this one . Do n't know . He decided to keep using his stop watch and forego the pedometer .
 I am a 68 year old granny who is quite active . I walk every day . My old pedometer only measured distance . I wanted to count my steps through this cold winter because I can not get outside each day . I could not get this pedometer to set . The buttons are very small and you have to keep pushing them ; once wo n't do . I went on the website for help and it shows the model but the intructions tell the incorrect color for the buttons . It is very confusing . I finally got it set . I called the 800 number and got told to leave a message . I would not buy this again .
 ACCUSPLIT Eagle AE1640M4 Step and Distance Pedometerthis is the first product i have brought from amazon that i did not like the description of product did not say how fragile the product is only reference was made on how small the buttons were i could have dealt with the small buttons if the product would have not fallen apart so easily the only good thing about this product was the little loop to attach to your belt loops i will have to buy another pedometer but will buy a much more sturdier one i would suggest that this product be overhauled and upgraded the
 I was really excited when I purchased this as I prefer a small , simple pedometer.And for the first month it was great.Then one day I put it on and realized there were no numbers showing up on the screen , just zeroes.So I got in touch with amazon and they exchanged it for me.BUT the new one came with no numbers.So I had to return and refund both.Too bad , because it was exactly what I was looking for and am now without any pedometer . = -LRB-
 I never had the pleasure of using this treadmill . I ordered it ... it took 3 weeks to get ... it came damaged ... I refused delivery ... then it took about 10 phone calls -LRB- to everywhere BUT the USA ! -RRB- to finally after 2 more weeks to get my refund . Every customer service person promised me a different thing -LRB- that was good until they hung up the phone with me -RRB- . They tell you afterwards that their policy is that they do n't refund until the item is returned to them . They also said the refund was up for dispute because they wanted to figure out whether they broke it or the delivery company -LRB- like that has anything to do with me getting MY money !! -RRB- . Buyer beware ... buy some inexpensive stuff here . . but anything that might tie up some of your money ... buy it in person so you can see the item first !!
 Ordered Horizon treadmill CT61 from Amazon , received in broken box with broken plastic pieces from all sides . I can not figure out what belongs were as its in pieces . When called Amazon Customer service , they told me to buy a new box and pack it up for pick-up which will be scheduled in 5-7 business days . Customer representative was very rude and just mean . Be aware to spend more time hustling with Amazon folks rather spending on treadmill .
 purchased this bag for my husband to use for his adult soccer league which meets once weekly . After using it for one season , the pockets ripped , leaving the bag useable , but all one compartment . disappointed in the quality of this bag . opt for a different Adidas bag .
 I was greatly anticipating The Drifter , but the quality of the video is basically horrible.It is way too over-saturated and the contrast was turned up to beyond max ; apparently Taylor Steele was trying to make a basic surf film into an art piece , but the quality really gets in the way of the story . Perhaps it 's just the DVD I havei ; perhaps it 's the way over-rated RED camera he used ... whatever , it 's nearly un-watchable . The sound quality is n't great either , with the volume going up and down , depending on the scene . And the story is not very exciting , with Rob Machado 's monotone voice droning on in the background giving it a depressing feel . He even walks like he 's depressed.We 're supposed to believe Rob 's trying to get away from it all ? The cell phone ringing in the background , with people trying to bug him . Too bad , he has to surf for a living ! The whole premise just does n't really work and to be honest , the surfing shots are nowhere near revolutionary either.So the bottom line is that you could easily pass on this one and not feel like you 're missing anything . I 'm very disappointed with the entire package , from the story to the video to the final production .
 Cool idea , but come on . I can have a camera follow me around and surf a little bit here and there . I do n't think anyone cares about the stuff between surfing and what `` you '' are really thinking ... lack of surfing and energy . I would not suggest this video , you have better things to do with yourself . Do a load of laundry instead and take a nap ... what a waste of time!Not trying to be negative , but this video is n't cheap and it sucks balls .
 Never used , you get what you pay for , my bad . Presently in service as a prop rod for a car that I am restoring.I would give it a zero if I could .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 Item not as pictured -- totally different style , and not appropriate for the person I bought it for -LRB- it was a gift -RRB- . Very disapointed .
 I just brought this ball to our game last night . After just few passes we put it aside . It is like playing with soccer ball . It 's heavy that hurts your forearms and fingers . When droped on the floor it stops bouncing much quicker then other balls we had -LRB- Molten and Tachikara -RRB- .
 Two very big problems with this computer are accuracy and settings . My wheel circumfrance is 2038mm . Using that circumfrence setting , according to the instructions I compared the GT Computer to my GPS . The result ... at exactly two miles by the GPS the GT indicated 3.38 miles . Of course the indicated speed was off -LRB- high -RRB- as well . I might have been able to eventually calibrate the computer using the GPS except for an even more frustrating problem . Whenever you attempt to reset the wheel circumfrance it automatically defaults to 2124 . So you can never recheck the number you set to confirm that you set it correctly and if/when you do correctly calibrate the computer you must write down the number in case you ever need to reset . Also , all other settings -LRB- such as clock -RRB- go to default settings . So you must reset everything anytime you change any setting . However , the clock is accurate ! The only thing I really like about this computer is the mount .
 I had gotten it for my husband but it was a big mistake . He is used to leathermans and apparently these do n't really lock . I remembered my Grandfather using them for a long time but then I remembered that was something he did n't like either . I would return it but then I would loose 45 % of what I had paid for it so I will just keep it in the stuff draw in the kitchen . .
 When I received the knife , one side of the seal tape was open.When took out the knife , just found one side with SIGNIFICANT SCRATCHES . Absolutely like an used one . It 's not a &#34; prestigious &#34; swiss army knife.Bad shopping experience !
 In January 7 Costs 30 dollars today costs 70 to $ 100 , what happened ? THIS PRICE LOSE INTEREST in this ARTICLE
 This item is very heavy = no one would want to carry it around in pants pocket or any where else . Items so hard to get out that I ca n't get all of them opened as I have problems with my aging hands .
 I go for the price of this one and actually gor 3 more to give as gifts which is a hit among teens .
 I returned the item because the web pix showed a built in pliers and the item received did not have it . The pix above is not the one that you had posted when I ordered.In any case I was happy with the return treatment and it gies me confidence in future purchases .
 i dont mean to go against all swiss army knives or anything but a couple of years ago i got a Victorinox knife and it was the biggest piece of crap i had ever owned . Literally 1 hour after i opened it , WITHOUT using it , the crappy plastic outer shell came off . it was being held together by extremely weak glue . I got a wenger later on and it worked PERFECTLY . so much better it was absurd . If you want a great reccomendation , go with a solid steel gerber knife . I got a gerber Winchester knife and it lasted me for three years . it was like 8 bucks i got at walmart . a victorinox costs like at least 20 and lasts 1 day ??? i think not . like i said ... go with a solid steel real folding knife , NOT SWISS , and make sure that it has a steel handle . If the blade wobbles , tighten it . Its that simple . But the way Victorinox makes it 's knives ... I will never buy one again .
 I selected this item because it was to be delivered with a second , smaller , pocket knife . The second knife was not delivered .
 Disappointed with product as surface was scratched upon receipt . Even though this is a warehouse sale item , it will be good to highlight actual product condition to consumer for more informed decision prior purchase . Hope Amazon Warehouse will improve on consumer communication .

 This stock has a great design but the material it is made of is pretty cheap , after 2 games it starts to wobble a lot , it appears that the plastic is is made of starts to loosen in the joints , making it unstable and unfit to be used with a sling since it can not support the weight of just the marker without the gas tank .
 I bought this as a gift for my son 's 8th birthday . It was his first pocketknife and he was so excited . Sadly the quality was not what we expected . After only 4 months of supervised use something inside the knife gave way and now there is a piece of metal sticking out of it and 4 tools/blades wo n't open at all . Is there any kind of product warranty?Added later : I finally got the tool opened . Looks like the metal piece that acts as a spring on the scissors broke . I was able to remove that part and can now open the other blades but the scissors no longer spring open .
 Ca n't believe Amazon itself selling used item marked as NEW . First of all , the little packaging was just simply taped at one end . Second , when I opened it , can see some dirts in it with too much lubricant oil .
 The knife is defective . I used it yesterday for the first time , to open a wine and the cockscrew ended up distorted and could not be put back . I have used many different swiss army knives , and this one does not look genuine . I 'm very surprised that this product is sold by Amazon LLC . Really poor quality , does n't worth a penny .
 I have bought this type of knife twice . First , I bought one that includes instruction and a small light . I think it is true and nice . So I bought two of this type of knife . However , they are totally different with the first one . They are in very simple box and do n't include instruction and small light . I do n't think thery are true swiss army knife . So I retrun the second two knifes back .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 The seller , Physical Chess , does not seem to keep their Amazon items updated . I ordered these gloves and a mask from this seller . It took them 5 days to inform me that they had canceled my order because they did not have the gloves -LRB- or mask -RRB- in stock in the size I ordered . Yet , as I write this review , that `` out-of-stock '' size is still listed on the Amazon listing!Another item I had ordered that same day , from a different seller , arrived a day before Physical Chess even informed me that they did not have these items . This has increased the time my son has to wait until any item arrive . -LRB- and he is SO excited to get gloves and a mask . -RRB- Update
 First , let me say that I ca n't speak to the quality of this product in terms of a fencing glove ... I bought it to use in a Halloween costume . I bought both a right and left glove , and was expecting them to be all-white , as shown . Unfortunately , the palm and underside of the fingers were a burgundy color , and they do not look at all like what I thought I was buying . Costumers beware !
 At a dept store you can buy a universal cleaning kit without the box for less than $ 8 and the quality is so much better . The bore mops look like a 5 year old trimmed them . The box is warped . The velvet tray is made of super thin plastic . Over all the shoddy workmanship of this product makes it a huge disappointment .
 I found out the hard way these bands do not work . I wore one on my ankle and one on my wrist . Went to a waterfall in Hawaii and got eaten alive . I think mosquitos thought it was a joke and decided to bite me a few extra times . I even had other kinds of repellants . The only one that seemed to work 1/2 way decent was the little keychain devices that emit a high pitched sonic sound . Just do n't drop them or the pitch gets louder .
 dony buy this it make you smell like buig spray and very irritant to your skin its a waste of money
 First of all , you send me a wrong item ... disappointed !!!! I order kaz/stinger Bugoff Wristband Multicolor kk4 instead you send me glow in the dark 3pcs wristband mosquito repellent . I have no time to return it , because my daughter need to bring the item to the Philippines to use . I asked her if the wristband is effective or ok , no mosquito bites ? She answered me NO ... NO ... Mommy it is NOT EFFECTIVE . I am wearing it one on my wrist and one on my ankle but still i have mosquito bites . Disappointed again . I do n't know because you send me a wrong item ok .
 Looks like I 'm not the only person who received the wrong item ! This person put a note in the box , part of which said that not to worry this one is cheaper . If I wanted this I 'd bought it off Ebay ! Do n't have time either to return as my daughter is traveling in three days ! I 'm gon na have to go out and shop for mosquito bands !
 Buyer beware , this is a youth hat . It 's tight on my 6 year old . The label on the hat states youth , but no where on the description does it state that . The description states that if you are a player or a coach and your team needs to have the `` pro team '' look that this is the hat for you . There is no way this hat would fit any coach , and the only player it would fit is a 4 or 5 year old playing t-ball . Very disappointed , as this was supposed to be part of a birthday present for my 12 year-old son . Aside from the misleading description , the hat itself is very nice and would be great if you have a little Ranger fan in your house .
 We ordered this toy box because we love the Phillies and wanted our little boy to have a fun place to store his toys . However , the bottom piece of wood for the toy box is n't cut correctly so the sides can not be attached properly unless my husband cuts the wood so it fits . It was supposed to be an easy assembly but now he has to play wood shop teacher to make the toy box assemble properly . Very frustrating .
 This toy chest is cute , but not sturdy . It never held together well until we used wood glue to glue the thing together . Any time it was bumped it required re-tightening . We bought the chest to store larger toys for our twin boys . After a year of use , the lid hinge broke off when the boys tried to close the chest when there was a toy sticking up too high . My boys are only 2 1/2 and not destructive , yet they managed to break the lid off this chest . I would recommend the chest to someone who was looking for something that looked nice but did not intend to use it .

 Just purchased this and already one of the zippers is broken . It 's a nice bag but useless with the mail pocket unuseable .
 thermarest matresses are great but expensive . this sack should be included . shame on them for being so selfish .
 I had a quilt made with my most treasured t-shirts , which is very lovely . To ensure that I stays lovely , I ordered this bag to store it in when it 's not in use.I received the bag today , pull it out of the shipping package and thought WTW am I supposed to do with this ? I folded the quilt as tightly as I could , but it would not go into the bag because it 's so small even though it 's described as Large.I even watched the video of another buyer before my final decision , but either he knows a trick that I have n't grasped or I been bamboozled!If you read this review and have some pointers about the best way to utilize , please respond . I 'm taking a long bus trip with some girlfriends and need something to carry and store my quilt . Or , if you have another suggestion of a bag , I 'm listening.I 'm puzzled !
 I got this because FeulBelt is so well known in the industry . Here is my breakdown : Pros : + The small pouch is small , but I was able to squeeze by iPhone 4 into it , so my Nike + could record my run . + Bottles are the right size to balance the load and not flop around too much . -LRB- compared to my 22oz single bottle belt which I hate . -RRB- + Good padding ; Light weight.Cons : - I am a big big , getting back into running , and this belt would just Velcro with the buckles at their max . 40 '' waist . Big boy could use it , but it was tight . - The bottles are a pain to put back in with one hand . I had to spin the belt around to the side to get it to work . Not like my other belts that they slide in easier . - Overall , the pouch is cramped ... my iPhone stretched the fabric to the max ... just like my waist did ; - -RRB- Overall - this is a good belt if you need water on the trail or road while running . For a smaller frame , it might do very well . I personally hate do mot like having belts on when I run . . so it was not as comfortable for me .
 This was a horrible product ! Not only were the bottles difficult to get out of their holders while I was running , but the entire belt broke in half -LRB- came unsewn -RRB- in the middle of a 14 mile run ! It was frustrating and left me very thirsty ! I am returning this product .
 I bought one of these Fuelbelts from a local running store last spring because my long runs were hitting the 10 + mile point and it was warming up so I needed to be able to take fluid with me . Fuelbelts run very small - I have a 26 inch waist and 32 inch hips and the Small was too tight so I ended up going with a Medium . The Medium fit just fine as long as I was n't actually moving . Once I started to run , it would shift until it was around my waist and completely loose . So the first 3 or 4 miles I 'd have to slow or stop to readjust the Fuelbelt . Very irritating . It would stay in place once I got sweaty enough . I have heard that many women have had the same problem with the Fuelbelt so I am wondering if it is made more for men . This spring and summer the Fuelbelt will be retired and I am going to try one of the hand held flasks . Hopefully I will have better luck that .
 I would not purchase this product again , it has ruined arrows and arrows have passed through the center of it
 I 'm a big proponent of using quality sunblock . I decided to give Solrx a try , hoping that it would be as good or better than my favorite sunblock , Aloe Gator . I applied it to my face before a bike ride last weekend , and once I started sweating it began running into my eyes . The sting was horrible . The bottle clearly states that it 's sweat proof . I do n't think so . I still use it for my arms , neck , legs , etc. , but I 'm sticking with Aloe Gator for my face . I wo n't buy it again .
 I bought several shirts in different colors in 2XL . However , their idea of 2XL was not mine . 2XL looked more like a large plus the cotton is thin so shrinkage would have made them a medium . Needless to say , the shirts were returned .

If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 The watch is beautiful , and I found it to be accurate . There are many negatives that I personally have
 I hate having to do reviews like this , but when a manufacturer earns it , well ... Several weeks ago I ordered the Suunto MC-2DLIN from Amazon -LRB- great service as always -RRB- for evaluation . I own a number of Suunto compasses and have used them in some pretty harsh environments -LRB- Middle East -RRB- and I 've always been impressed with the quality of the company 's products . Suunto is the ONLY brand of compass I 've owned where the needle capsule did not develop air bubbles . I ca n't say the same for some other well known brands , particularly Silva and Brunton.A relative told me he was interested in buying this compass for his son for use in Boy Scouts and asked my opinion . I told him I 'd buy one and check it out.Overall the compass is a well made example of a classic design and first impressions are very good . However , on close examination of the compass needle capsule it is clear that the alignment arrow in the base of the compass capsule and the parallel alignment marks/declination scale indicator are slightly offset . This indicates that the two scales are not concentric . To get them properly aligned you must set the declination scale at approximately 2 degrees east declination . This means that the compass capsule -LRB- which carries the needle and alignment arrow -RRB- is not set on the same center as the movable declination scale!This offset is easy to see if you place the compass on a piece of graph paper to check the alignment of all the scales.This amount of built-in error is simply too much for an instrument that is supposed to ` replace luck ' . I figured that my compass was just a single example of something that slipped through the QC checks at Suunto , so I arranged with Amazon for a replacement . When the replacement compass arrived I was very disappointed to see that this compass also has the same issue . I can only conclude that this ` error ' is built into the Suunto manufacturing process and that Suunto is shipping thousands of MC-2 compasses around the world with an extra 2 degrees of error built in.I have decided to keep this compass as an example to my students as to why you should always check your compasses at a known azimuth station -LRB- check with your county surveyor to see if there are any azimuth stations in your area -RRB- . The good news is that the adjustable declination scale allows you to adjust out this error.Sorry Suunto , but I simply can not recommend the MC-2D compass until you clean up your manufacturing and/or QC issues .
 Will only fit a paintball gun . Nothing else i have tried on airsoft and real guns . It has a very small rail point
 I bought this product and followed the directions to the letter . Sun , shade , or indoors this stuff never cured or hardened . All it did was leave a slimy residue on my board . This product is garbage . Do not buy it !!
 In a thick amount this product hardens up but the falls off . It has an oily residue which seems to prevent it from bonding to a surface . I ended up just taking my board to a repair shop .
 I used the Sun Cure Fiber Fill kit the first day of skim boarding at the beach . I have a skim board that is made of the same materials surf boards are . The curing time was correct from the box descriptions and since I wanted to make sure the bond was extra strong I waited all night before using it the next day . The material chunked off within 1-2 hours of riding . It did n't bond well and became sharp and dangerous .
 The formula has changed as of Feb 2011 -- my original review recommended the product but now it 's no longer good for the baby!Is now 30 % lanolin -LRB- original had 50 % -RRB- Now also contains Disodium EDTA -LRB- original did not have this chemical -RRB- You decide . My preliminary research indicates that Disodium EDTA is no good for babies !!!!!!!
 I have so many challenges in my life . Why does putting a water bottle on a bike have to be one of them ? Its got screws . Its got brackets . I keep looking at those and the instructions . ??? Well I 'll just run on down to the local Home Depot and get the latest dewalt drill . I hope it comes with drill bits . I guess I had to have a Schwinn bike . No holes are pre-drilled on my kids brand new bikes . This is so much fun just staring at this for hours !!! Much funner than riding lets say a bike or something .
 I bought this bottle for my Schwinn bike , assuming it would be easy to install . Aside from the fact that it did not include any instructions , the hardware included with the bottle holder was pretty useless . I used wire ties to mount the bottle holder and it works good .
 I bought this yesterday - no where does it tell you how to install it - I emailed Schwinn but have not heard back - How about a little instruction for people who do not know how to put on your product - even POP TARTS have instructions !!!!!
 This is a great water bottle for carrying around , but Schwinn does n't do much to help you install it on your bike . I 've called and emailed , but the company does n't return emails and does not offer online instructions for installation . Try another product - if only for the instructions !
 I bought my Schwinn bottle and cage at a local retail store . It did have minimal and somewhat ambiguous instructions . Come to find out , you have to have a Schwinn bicycle to use their bottle cage . That is totally ignorant . I assume they did this for ease of installation . However , they are losing sales of Schwinn accessories to non-Schwinn owners , not to mention losing money on the product returns which ca n't be resold.If they made a universally installable bottle cage , or at least an adaptor for other bikes , that would make a little sense . Having Schwinn accessories on non-Schwinn bikes is advertising in and of itself . The current design only creates ill-will among non-Schwinn owners . Nobody is going to go out and buy a Schwinn bicycle because the water bottle cage they just bought wo n't install on their bike .
 Unless you know how to read Schwinn 's mind , good luck figuring out how to install this piece of crap . They give no pictures or explanation and use words I 've never heard
 Schwinn does not include any instructions for installing it , and since I was not born knowing how to install bicycle water bottle cages ... I could not find a phone number on thier site , so I emailed . I have not heard back from them . I sure would like to get this taken care of before my trip!I guess I just spent $ 8 for nothing .
 If you have sensitive skin , be careful ! I tried it two nights ago and it felt great ! My back never felt better ! Unfortunately , I woke up with a severe rash on my back . This morning the rash spread to my entire back ! I am on a cream and steroids now to get rid of the mess . I learned my lesson - I hope you learn from me ! I know several people who use it and are just fine . If you decide to buy it , start with a tiny patch of skin to see how your skin reacts to it .
 This product was recommended to me but I do n't think it was what I really needed . It is probably a good product when used where it 's supposed to be used.Thank you .
 I ordered an item from The Gifted Horse on 11/30 , website stated 2 to 3 weeks for delivery . On 12/8 was told on the phone that was still the case . When I checked on 12/22 , store was closed for the holidays and would not reopen until 1/15 . Apparently not interested in selling items . Probably a part-time concern . Purchase from them only if you do n't need the item .
 It does not work . It is a waste of money so save your time and buy Icy Hot It works better .
 I have a bottle of DMSO & instantly there was an effect on the area & a taste in my mouth . On this product NOTHING happened
 I was looking for a full size croquet set that could be played indoors . This is a mini sized set . The quality is very nice -LRB- maybe not $ 70 nice -RRB- but not what I needed . The manufacturer 's website titles this item as mini but the Amazon site does not . I will be returning this item . Do n't waste shipping and handling money unless you want a conversation piece that plays on a tabletop .
 While this is a nice blanket , and will probably work for most people , it is NOT waterproof . It is water-resistant , and will most likely keep you dry from wet grass , but if you dump water into it , water will leak through to the other side .
 I purchased several of these blankets specifically because they are suppose to be waterproof . They are not ! The smallest amount of water will seep through .
 I do n't understand why they bring me used goods.On the web , products was shown new one.I already return it.how can I get my money what I spent for turning goods .
 Yes , I know it is cheap . Yes I know it contains a dangerous chemical-rubbing alcohol.But it also has the Brunton label which used to mean a good working compass.It worked for 24 hours , approximately . Now it points consistantly to West.It even says on it `` made in USA '' so I can not blame it on bad Chineese quality control .
 Basically you get what you pay for ! This devise is small and not accurate at all so it was a total disappointment !!!!
 When I opened this package , I immediately thought it looked like a $ 1 or $ 2 trinket I could have picked up at dollar store.I kept it for a day , decided it was nothing special , and told Amazon I wanted to return it.At that time , I was told by Amazon that I could not return the item because it contained hazardous materials that were against Amazon 's Shipping Policy , rendering it non-returnable . I was shocked , because this was ... just a compass ! I had to send a couple of emails back and forth with Amazon before being told that the liquid inside the compass is `` absolute ethyl alcohol '' - a hazardous item that they would not accept as a return . I am still interested to learn how Amazon managed to ship this in the first place , however.This item , I feel , is overpriced . Maybe not 1 Star , but this way someone will spot it among the 4 and 5 star reviews that exist for this item .
 This is not returnable to Amazon . Return policy indicates because it is a liquid filled compass . Be sure this item is what you want before committing .
 My son chose this `` soccer '' ball because he liked how it looked . We received this ball in the mail only to notice that it was really a basketball and not a soccer ball like the title shows .
 when I tried this outfit on my little man , to my surprise it fits small . Its not 12-24mos , its more like 6-12mos . The hat is too small too -LRB- and no , my son does not have a big head ! -RRB- I was very is appointed ! I really wanted him to wear it for Sunday games .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 Just got this reel today from Amazon for trout fishing , and I will be returning it tomorrow . First , the bail is very tough to close automatically . It takes a lot of strength to close it with the handle , and it feels like I am going to break it . I own 22 reels , and this is the toughest one to close . Second , there is a lot of wobble to the handle on the retrieve . Also , no matter how much you tighten it , it will come loose again . I own 6 Mitchell reels and this does n't even come close to the quality that they can produce .
 I have two Mitchell 300x & one 300xe reels and love them . Great reels with 100 % solid preformance . On the other hand I bought a 310ex expecting the same . Well , I spend more time waisting line 4lbs Mono , Floro , & Fireline . The line type I used did not make a differance on this reels proformance . I would get birds nest constantly . It will simply drive you nuts and take the pleasure out of your day on the water . I found it did not matter if I closed the bail with my hand or by turning the handle . -LRB- very stiff bail by the way -RRB- This is the worst Mitchell I ever owned . I purchased it for my new Ultra Lite last summer . I will never use this reel again . I exchanged it for a Shimano Sedona 1000 . I am not about to go into a new fishing season with the Mitchell 310ex . Absolutly the worst reel I ever owned .
 I put my lantern in the case for the first time , and the bottom did not fully latch . When I picked it up from the top handle , the bottom fell out after walking a few feet and the globe shattered .
 Received the first one without any bottom at all !!! Amazon was great in sending a replacement However its advertised to be able to store mantles and matches in a bottom storage compartment I like to keep everything together so I have reverted back to keeping the lantern funnel matches and mantels in the original cardboard box which everything fits great . Amazon has been great but this case just fits the lantern !!!!
 Although this item states it is intended for the model number of the lantern I was purchasing , it was not . The lantern was bigger than the container . Amazon quality control is dropping of significantly , Bezos better get back on top of his V.P. 's pretty quick .
 Well ... its better than nothing . But if your not paying attention to the lame plastic catchy thing that holds it together you will more than likely have a broken lantern when you pick it up . Would not buy again . Rick Garner
 They sent me the WRONG one and on top of MODEL NUMBERS THEY ARE COLOR CODED!WORSE was the process to return the item ! Website kept refusing to work , redirecting me . Calling took 15 minutes to get a person .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 I am highly disappointed in this toy . First , when changing it over from a sled to a wagon the pre drilled holes did n't match up . We had to redrill holes ourselves . Then the welds on the handle were in the wrong place and screw used to hold the wagon handle in place did n't work . We had to fix that too . Now one of the wheels keeps falling off because the locking nut is defective . I am so disappointed . These things are all fixable , but for the amount I paid for it , I would expect it to just be right . I do n't buy things wanting to redrill holes and find replacement bolts and nuts at the hardware store . I just want it to work .
 I was very unhappy when I opened the box and saw this product had been made in China . It said in the review it was made in Colorado . I was even more upset when I pulled out the sled and the wheels and handle were not in the box . I did like the way the sled looked and would have kept it if all the parts were included . My whole purpose of buying this product was so my son could pull my daughter down the isle in a wagon on my wedding day . Without wheels I had no wagon . Needless to say this item went right back for return .
 Iem arrived quickly and was as advertised , accept that item did n't reel like it was suppose to reel . The spool did n't go up and down to distribute the line evenly on the spool .
 As part of a class , 5 of us were given these to use . At least 3 of the 5 of us had repeated problems with a single press of the Start/Stop button acting like a double click -LRB- Stop - Start -RRB- so the watch kept running.It was possible , with practice , to get a true single click on the Start/Stop button .
 Bought this stopwatch for my running time and exercise but did not get any good results . The light does not work for nothing , the compass never worked . The alarm clock was so hard to program you needed a major degree in science to make it work . The stop watch bottoms were very sensitive so you had the risk of erasing or resetting your times before you had the chance to see how good your running time was .
 This stopwatch is incredibly cheap and poor quality . The buttons are loose and placed in an awkard way . When using one hand , you have to put pressure on the light button to counter the press of the start-stop button . I often blind people across from me just trying to use the chrono function . Spend $ 10 more and get a quality stopwatch .
 First off , I have been using sauna suits for years and from all my experience , they do not last more than a couple of months . Knowing this information prior , I know its just a matter of time before they tear , and im fine with that . I do not mind spending $ 10 or so every couple of months on a new sauna suit . With that said , I have never had a sauna suit tear 20 minutes into the first use.Obviously , once they tear they are useless as they no longer keep in the heat . You are better off using trash bags even though they do not work as well . They will save you the aggravation and the feeling of being had after dropping money on this item that goes straight into garbage after one use.I am not usually the type to write reviews , but this product has disappointed me to the point that writing a bad review was a must .
 I recieved this item i tried it once and it ripped from right thigh down to the right ankle . I have disabilities so I ca n't hardly run . I went on a 45 minute walk , I had my suit under some regular sweat pants once i got home the pants were ripped . I did n't bother returning them , it would cost me more for shipping than the item itelf . I recomment investing in a more expensive pair of sauna suits , make sure to check the quality of the seams .
 Good suit for women as advertised in the picture . Does not give the males the arm and leg room as other suits allow .
 I order this sauna suit on may 10 I received my purchase around the 20 I was glad to have finally found a sauna suit that my spouse could fit into so I thought . I got home from work the product came but it did n't look like a XX or XXX my spouse could n't fit the top or bottom it was just too darn small so I 'm thinking this ca n't be a XX or XXX , if this is the case I think bell should add extra vinyl to their suits or change the size because this is not the correct size , so I 'm looking for another sauna suit . Now I must say the Trim belt did fit and it was a XX-XXX
 I only got to wear the suit twice before the arm tore at the seam , and of course with a hole in the suit it does not work . I am a very disappointed customer . Yes , I know it was cheap but even cheap should have lasted more than 2 days.I stand corrected , every one makes mistakes . This company really stands by their product . As soon as I wrote the review , I was contacted and was sent a new suit . Now , I do n't know about the rest of you but where I am concerned , that is real service . I will take a company that stands by it 's product any day .
 I bought this product and used it twice . I was very careful in putting it on and taking it off . It ripped on the third time using it . I 'm buying a new one because it does make you sweat a lot , but I 'm disappointed on how easily it ripped .
 I purchased this suit and was very excited about its potential . I figured I would be safe using it while doing my walking dvd . The first time was great . I was very pleased with my purchase . The sweat poured off of me . Recommendation
 My son chose this `` soccer '' ball because he liked how it looked . We received this ball in the mail only to notice that it was really a basketball and not a soccer ball like the title shows .
 I have to agree with other reviews I 've seen about this item . The title `` Survival Kit '' is very misleading , but anyone with two brain cells to rub together could see it 's not a kit.What you get is three waterproof cards with assorted survival info/tips . The floating compass does work if floated in a glass of water but is little more than a gimmick . DO N'T trust this as a navigation aid use a real compass ! . The only saving grace of the kit is the Fresnel lens this can be used to focus the suns rays on your tinder to start your camp fire and too help read the tiny print on the cards . All of the above is housed in a plastic slip case with room on the back for your name , drug reactions/allergies and your blood group .
 This product claims that it is a survival kit but it is basicly a set of three cards with a useless `` foating compass '' and a magnafinig glass . this is the worst product ever !!!
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in .

 said x-large . very dissapointed in size . this by no means is x large , maybe x small . would get next size up

 ordered these after the other see-thru mounts I received lacked the right mounting screws . opened these and ... missing screws . there are suppposed to be 8 long and 4 short . Included were 9 ? long and 0 short . there is no way for the long to work on a Winchester 94 because the threads holes in the actual rifle are very shallow . Contacted the seller to get the right screws sent and they said they would get right on it ... TWO WEEKS later I received the screws-2 short and two long !? Unbelievable . So now I 'm left with cutting these very small screws off somehow since I replied to the last email they sent telling them of the problem and have gotten no reply . More frustrated than I can communicate . I do however realize how hard it is to count to eight and four and for the replacement it would be hard to see the difference between 1/4 and 1/2 inch . I have concluded therefore that they are using chimpanzees to sort screws .

 I looked for a bike that was n't made in China but in the USA , and sure enough -LRB- because I could n't find where it came from anywhere -RRB- when it came in it came from China.The bike arrived with some assembly required that took me 4 hours . Hope you have a good set of allen wrenches and know what you 're doing ? Forget the instructions book and throw it away , 'cause it 's a laugh!After assembly the brakes were rubbing and the 7 speed shimano gear kept making several clicking noises in low gear . I still ca n't quite get them adjusted . The worst of all was the handlebars . I felt that they were too wide and not that solid , and you felt as if they were turning or bending in your hands as you rode so that you could n't get a comfortable , solid ride . After a while riding the bike wore us out ! I rode bikes all my life , and with this one I found myself zig zagging . It is NOT comfortable!I do n't see what all these others who write here see in it ? For the price I expected something better made and far more comfortable than this . Now I 'm sorry I did n't spend the money on something we had our eye on in a bike shop and tried out first.My other bike comes in tomorrow . We 'll see .
 We ordered two of these supposedly better-quality game balls . On both of the balls , the leather was cut so poorly under the lacing that the lacing itself was crooked . The leather sat-up off the bladder creating what would appear to be air pockets or pimples under the leather . This condition was particularly bad on the stitching under the lacing . On one of the balls , other stitching aside from those under the lacing was also bad , and this area , too , had small bubble-like pimples . This ball would not even hold air .
 My son is a kicker and punter and the fit of the ball is very important . This ball has a loose fitting cover and has an odd shape from typical high school footballs .
 The long seams on this football were bumpy . The ends of the ball where the four pieces come together were not alligned , and the laces of the ball did not run straight . In my opinon this product should not have passed quality contol .

 Heirloom quality sled ? Keep looking . I ordered this for my son believing it could be used for generations . When you first take it out of the box it is breathtaking . Like looking at those old wood boats ! Wow ! However expectations drop fast from that point on . I found rust yes you read that right , rust in the back end right side of the runner where it is welded . I was immediately disappointed but figured hey it 'll rust out in the snow anyway . Perhaps because it 's recycled materials . -LRB- You can see I really wanted to love this sled . -RRB- Well looking at the nose , the wood had a hairline split . Still could be overlooked but years of use could cause that split to be serious later . -LRB- Now I 'm thinking I need to exchange this sled for another . -RRB- This was n't living up to its name as an heirloom quality sled . Well looking at the right front runner , there was some leftover welding material on the runner . It was obvious someone noticed this after the coating was on because some of it was peeled away and left deep grooves in the runner as well as slivers of metal sticking out of it , through the black ! An obvious cutting hazard for children and adults alike . I do n't believe the National Parenting Center would give its seal of approval if this sled was inspected . All these issues combined for the high price makes this unacceptable . 20 minutes after opening it I was printing out the return label . I 'll be ordering the Mountain Boy Classic Flyer for $ 129 . Another runner type sled made overseas unfortunately , but I really ca n't justify the high cost for the Royal Flyer with the poor quality I 've inspected . Hopefully it works out better otherwise , Mountain Boy has lost this snow enthusiast forever !

 My battery would die after one use , and I could not figure out why . I loaded the light with new batteries and set it on my kichen table . The light would turn on for no reason . I thought I was going crazy , so I asked my wife to confirm . Without a doubt , this light would turn on automatically after about 20 minutes of sitting idle . This is a low quality light and a waste of money .
 Bad new product . Ball is inferior . Inflates to 7-9 lbs not 13 . Cover is a plastic , made in china product . Sharpie autograph smears . Wilson blew it on this one !
 Not a good product in my view , I would n't recommend it . The Super Waist Toner is a better product , get it if you need a toner belt
 You got to be kidding right ~ !?? If you are an Intelligent Human Being , use common sense please ~ ! LOL You can not loose ONE body part by wearing this kind of gadget ! LOL ~ !!! You got to loose entire body fat mass by cardio work out , plus eat good . PERIOD . Gee , I could come up with TONS of silly Gadget like this to become a millionaire for silly consumers !! can not believe people actually spend a penny on these things ~ ! LMAO ~ !!! People are cute ~ !!
 It was n't my girth ... the rubber just had a flaw and just tore as I was putting on to hold my spine/stomach together.Too much trouble to pack and return .
 The ad for this product says that it is 1/4 '' think . That is NOT true ; the one I received is only 1/8th inch thick . Had I know that , I would not have purchased it.The good news is that it is 9 '' wide , while others are only 8 '' wide .
 The package arrived early which is the only good thing I can say about this product . The neoprene is so thin the first time you wear it , it is stretched to heck , and then the second you wear it , you can experience the neoprene splitting , and the velcro being wider than the stretched fabric , rubbing on your skin , which feels great!Although this item is cheap , you will know why it costs so little from the very first time you wear it . Avoid it like the plague folks .
 Bad quality , does not stretch at all , is very narrow , do not waist your money .
 Just received this football . It does not look at all like the picture . Plain black and red with a tiny Falcons logo on one side . It was going to be a present from Santa , but I think I 'll return it to his shop . : - -LRB-
 In the pictures , the falcons football was a really cool , detailed football , but i ended up getting a very plain football like the ravens one in the picture.so i returned it , ordered it again , hoping after talking to the people at amazon i would recieve the correct one , but no , got the same one .

 We found this item disappointing . The directions were n't very good and we were missing a piece . It 's fairly heavy -LRB- not easy to take up and down the stairs -RRB- , the child restraints are either too tight or they slip off , and my son -LRB- who 's 2 and in the 50 % - ile in height -RRB- is n't big enough to pedal . So much for ergonomics ...
 If you can fit a typical donut over your wrist , these are for you , but otherwise the are probably not going to fit . I have used Softone wrist weights for years , but they were double the size of these ones ... Amazon and Bell sports should more clearly label these , but I am not sure what to call them -- Dog wrist weights ... ??
 I am a small woman with very skinny hands and wrists -- could barely get these wrist weights on , even with much pulling and struggling . Very disappointed with product . They could use some more `` elasticity '' . I had to throw them out .
 These wrist weights start out very small and stretch out with time . But eventually , the knit fabric begins to ravel , and the little weighted gravel pieces begin to fall out . Not good !
 I had to have help from my football playing son to remove the one torture device I managed to get on . I do n't know why I did n't read the reviews first , I was in a hurry and just grabbed some wrist and ankle weights . I have officially learned my lesson.My wonderful husband has been trying to stretch them out for me , and the opening does look slightly larger . I am going to let him work on them a bit more before I risk it though . Who wants to try and get the blood pumping only to have it all get stuck in your hand ?
 I think of myself as having a large frame-size 10 , but I have small wrists ... apparently not small enough . These suckers will cut off your blood supply.Donating to someone-waste of money !
 Box totaly destroyed . looks like it was a return that was not reboxed properly . Light surface rust on parts of the frame . It functions so it was not worth the hassel of returning it .
 The shirt ran a little big ... and this merchant does not allow for returns or exchanges ... I will not purchase from again .
 I was hoping to get a pair for shadow boxing but these turned out to be really flimzy ... Not at all like gloves . They slip around your hands and you can not truly get a grip on it .
 It fits awekwardly . I feel like I waisted my money with this product . I do cardio kick boxing and the gloves feel uncomfortable and it feels like I 'm having to constantly re-adjust them and hold on to them . I have other gloves that are lighter but they are comfortable and dont feel the same way . I wish I had n't bought these .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 The large order came as a glove labeled M / / L and obviously were too small . I am 6 feet tall 180 and do not have abnormally large hands : -RRB-
 The USCG will no longer respond to 121.5 MHz EPIRBs , the satellites are no longer receiving the signal . You have to have a 406 MHz digital EPIRB now . This item is WORTHLESS . If you have one when the USCG boards you , they 'll take it away .
 as of 02/09 the class B epirbs will have a changed response regulation.you now must have 406 mhz device.check wikipedia/epirbs .
 It was in good condition when it got here but I 've had it for a couple of months now and the sun is causing it to fade . The lettering now looks like it has been through the wash a few too many times .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 The box claims that this pump is good to 100 psi . My tire pressure was just about 50 psi when the pump hose burst . This occurred on the first use , right out of the box.The frame of the pump was pretty flimsy ... any pressure not directly down caused it to collapse.Might as well use an asthma inhaler to pump up your tires ...
 We bought this for the office , and it broke after the second use . I would have returned it , but it had been a long time from the time we bought it .
 Granted , I 've been out of the cycling loop for decades , but the stuff Schwinn is allowing their name on is shocking.This `` pump '' is so flimsy that the frame bent the second time I pressed on it -LRB- I 'm only 180 lbs . and I was being careful -RRB- so I kept trying to pump my tire up to the recommended 90 psi with this squeaky , floppy thing and the gauge would n't go past 65 psi on either tire.Then , after about 40 seemingly useless pumps , something popped in the pump and it now does n't work at all.I 'm not going to blame China on stupefying lack of quality -LRB- even though over 50 % of the stuff I 've bought made there has been crappy -RRB- because , at the end of the production line , there should be an American Schwinn representative in charge of quality control ... where is it ?
 dont waste your money on this one . The gauge is just a cosmetic appendage . Its just crappy .
 i hate this pump ... i really do i wish i could give life to it so i could beat it up and kill it again ... wait its already dead ... pos pump didnt even pump any air out of this thing ... i hope i get my money back
 I pressed down on the pump lever , and it did not come back up by itself , in spite of the attached springs . Had to pull it up by hand . Furthermore , that first pump is the only one that actually pumped air . After that , no air . No pressure . Not even a hissing sound as if there were a leak in the apparatus.I am familiar with bicycle pumps of many styles . This one is a piece of junk .
 I ride a Schwinn , my pump was a Schwinn , I thought they could be friends.This was my mistake.This pump had it in for my bike . It would n't inflate past 45 PSI , and when I tried , the hose came loose from the pump . Because the nozzle would n't detach easily , I could n't get it out in time to keep air in my tire . Thanks for the flat tire , Schwinn pump . This is the flimsiest -LRB- see how it bends under 130 lbs of weight ! -RRB- , jumpiest -LRB- put enough pressure and it will leap frog from right under your foot and hit you in the ankle ! -RRB- , whiniest -LRB- * pump * SQUEEEEEEEE * pump * SQUEEEEEEEEE -RRB- , least reliable pump I have ever used . Keep this thing away from my bike .
 I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased this pump . This pump is designed to be used by families who will throw it into the back of the minivan to make themselves feel `` prepared '' on their once-an-odd-summer `` bike outings '' with the kids . That is to say , it is not designed to actually be used . My unit held out a little longer than that of other reviewers . I actually used it 2-3 times to switch out my regular tires for my all-weather snow tires , and it did indeed pump air into my tires . Of course , it required about 20 minutes of vIgorous pumping per tire . On my 4th use I heard a `` popping '' sound and I new this worthless hunk of metal had checked out . A wave of relief swept over me , as I knew that I would no longer have to struggle and fight to make this thing work . I bought a much better pump for a few bucks more and inflating my tires takes mere minutes.Do not purchase this unit .
 I purchased these socks based on the positive reviews , but my experience with them was very different.WrightSock Anti Blister Double Layer Coolmesh quarter socks are sized , which I usually love because my feet are small and `` one size fits all '' socks are generally too big and bulky for me . However , with these socks , I really dislike the sizing because they are not sized correctly . I wear a ladies size 5.5 -6 shoe , so I purchased these socks in the small size -LRB- advertized to fit ladies sizes 4-7 , so they should have fit me perfectly -RRB- . I washed before wearing , following the instructions . When I put the socks on for the first time they were really snug and seemed low , especially in the back . I should have paid more attention , but I went out for my run as usual . After 6 miles or so , the back of my ankle -LRB- right where a running shoe hits - above the heel , below the achilles tendon -RRB- was rubbed completely raw because these socks hot too low to offer adequate protection . By the time I finished my run my ankles and my toes -LRB- due to the tight fit -RRB- were blistered and bloody . Definitely not anti-blister for me , although they might have worked better in a size or two larger . I will not be wearing the socks again and am upset that I purchased them . For me , every other brand I have tried is better -LRB- and that includes cotton socks ! -RRB- I suggest trying SmartWool PhD running socks , Pearl Izumi Elite Wool Socks , Asics -LRB- especially Kayano -RRB- socks instead - they can be a little more expensive , but at least you do n't risk minor injuries by wearing them .
 I found these socks a little thin and flimsy for good work out socks , had wanted some with a little more stretch and ones that fit more snugly .
 Liked the product a lot until all 3 of them wore down and cracked and broke in half , Not a very durable product at all .
 Great set at first . The 30 and 40lb rings got very soft after about 2 weeks use . The red 50lb ring cracked after about 4 weeks use . They are all nearly useless after about 5 weeks :-LRB- .
 These are great except for one big problem , they have a strong latex odor . I bought the set and all of these have the same issue . They have been out of the bag for over a week and the odor has not decreased . The smell gets on your hands and I noticed it from a few feet away when seated at my desk and the item was on the floor . The scent is not really offensive , but FAR from ok if you 're in a professional setting .5 / 22/08 - After almost 2 months the odor has decreased somewhat . The scent still gets on my hands after use but it is no longer quite the issue from afar that it was .
 Ordered the three pack - arrived quickly . First off - no doubt these will improve hand strength . The problem is the design , execution and safety of the product . Design
 You can go to your local hardware store and purchase high grade stainless steel ADA hand rails for your marine application ranging from 12 '' to 48 '' rated at a load of 500lbs . Several styles , and configurations . 12 '' price starts at about $ 14.00 . Think creatively !! Marine products are just a product advertised for `` marine '' use .
 It was one of the bad ones with the paint and not a Great Eastern one . It is not what is pictured and I am mad because this the the third time this has happend . buy from Ebay .
 I used to have this same headband till it was misplaced , so I decided to buy a new one , I made a mistake by choosing ty 's toy box I guess . The package never arrived , and the tracking link was broken . So I emailed the company and while they say it usually takes less than 24 hours to get a responce , It took me 5 days for each email to be replyed on . This is a great toy , just make sure that the seller can actualy diliver , or youll be 20 $ down with no help in sight .
 never recieved the item , I inquired about it no responsevery dissappointed.I will never order here anymore .
 Pro . The watch looks as beautiful in person as the pictures , even more!Cons . Bezel top mark does not fall directly under the 12 o'clock mark , the seconds hand does not tick properly in top of each second marker , it does not tick evenly period on marker or off markers leaving me to wonder how accurate it would be , and this one royally tick me off seeing I bought the SS bracelet instead of the cheaper rubber one it 's so small I ca n't fit my hand trough it.I 'm willing to give it a try if I can get some extra links -LRB- gratuitous -RRB- from the manufacturer other wise I 'm sending it back to Amazon and get something else , will contact them tomorrow and post again later.Update 6/3/11 so back it went and got myself the similar model made by Deep Blue `` what a difference '' the bezel works right , the minute hand works right and $ 65 cheaper.Do yourself a favor and check into the Deep Blue Models The movement is better , rated at 1000 meter and they are cheaper .

 We bought this Go-Kart for my 8 yr old son . Since there is n't anything else out there on the market for his age range . We gave it to him Christmas morning . He went outside and rode it for maybe 30 min and it all of a sudden stopped working . Of course the manual does n't have any sort of section that says troubleshooting . So we thought maybe it was the circuit breaker that had to be reset . Went to reset it and you ca n't even see that there is a push button under all the plastic so we proceeded to take the back cover off to see the problem . So it was n't the circuit breaker but the battery wires has been sheered off right flush to the battery by the metal battery holder . There are a ton of wires under that cover that were all zipped in together but the problem was the way the manufacturer put the battery in facing that metal wall there was no room for the wires . If that go-kart goes over a bump , it knocks the wires against that metal plate and it wo n't be long before they completely get cut off . We took the battery back to the store we got it at and they gave me another battery out of another razor . We 're going attempt to put the battery in with the wires facing the other direction towards the motor and only hope the motor does n't get too hot and burn them . I had a very unhappy little boy on Christmas day . and it does suck that you ca n't buy extra batteries for this or that they ca n't make it last longer then 45 minutes . Also another negative is that it does n't have revearse . Its too heavy of a toy for my 8 yr old to be lifting it and pulling it so he can go forward all the time . I think the manufacturer needs to make some major adjustments .
 If you are unsure about purchasing this item , I urge you to please read some of the reviews on other Razor products . You will find numerous complaints about this company . After reading all the problems people have had with other Razor products and chargers , I ca n't believe they continue to sell their crappy products . We spent over a hundred bucks on a Razor Electric Scream Machine for my son last year for Christmas . He 's ridden it maybe 5 times since then , because the charger fails after a few uses . After tracking someone down at Razor -LRB- their customer service sucks as bad as their products -RRB- , they sent us a new charger . Used it once , then that quit on us . Tried to get our money back , but they said they will only reimburse for taking it to a repair shop . What a pain , what a disappointment , what a waste of money . Do n't expect them to stand behind any of their products . They do n't have anyone at their company to talk to when you call . You must leave a message , and wait for them to get around to calling you . By the way , the Electric Scream Machine is no longer on the market . They make their money selling their defective products , then pull them from the shelves knowing they 're defective , but wo n't refund a dime to their customers .
 I took a loss on this one . I bought two for both of my sons for Christmas and the both stopped working in less than six months . The factory warranty is no good . They are both sitting in my garage collecting dust . Do not but without purchasing additional warranty .
 Though my nine year old was thrilled when this item showed up 4 days ahead of schedule -LRB- guess it helps to live near a distribution center -RRB- , he is now extremely disappointed in the fact that he has had the go-kart for less than a week and the chain has already broken on it ... and that you can not find a replacement chain or parts ANYWHERE local ?!? He did not ride the kart excessively , nor was he rough on it at all . Simply was driving down the cul de sac and it quite moving ... find out the chain has come off , and the master link is missing . We have been to numerous places looking for a chain piece this size to fix it , but to no avail . Next step is to contact RAZOR and hope that they can get us what we need.VERY DISAPPOINTED >
 I ordered this for my 13 year old for Christmas last year . He did n't even get to ride it until the spring . two months after being able to ride it the throttle broke . because razor only has a 90 warranty they gave me hassle sending the part . not even 2 months after that the chain broke . I had to replace that twice . Now the go cart wo n't go more than maybe 2 mph . So , out of less than 12 months my son has been able to enjoy this extremely expensive gift , a total of maybe 4 months in between fixes . I would not recommend buying a razor product . So far we own 3 , and 2 of those 3 razors have lasted less than 12 months !!!
 I am sad to say that I am not very happy with this item . It is built well and looks nice , but it will not hold a charge for more than 15 minutes . My son was so happy to get the go-cart on Christmas morning ... only to be disappointed every time he tries to take it for a ride . We have the razor pocket rocket for our older son and it is wonderful . The charge lasts a few hours - a much better buy !!!
 We bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas . He rode it Christmas morning and we left town that day for NY . He rode it when we returned on the 31st . Rode it up the curb of our driveway and the chain broke ! Now i have to pay to have it fixed !!! Not designed very well , there is no cover over chain and it is low to ground .
 We purchased this for our 9y/o son on Christmas . The wheels were stuck and it did n't move . Very poor instructions . There was no one to call for help . Manuel was useless . VERY DISAPPOINTING ! I would not recommend .
 Disappointed . . My 7 yr old rode it on the sidewalk only . then suddenly stopped working . We think maybe a fuse or something . Have no idea about these things . Just in our gargage taking up space . .
 We were so disappointed with this product . The first order was received very timely , however it was inoperable , thanks to a broken module when it arrived . Quickly replaced , only to be a disppointement on grass and surges of power on concrete . Overall ... a flop .
 Bought Kart for 8yr old daughter . She loves it . Its fun to ride however it quit after 4 weeks . It appears the Electronic Control Module has failed . Its not the circuit breaker .
 Bought this for my 7 year old grandson . Unfortunatly it sat in the box for 60 days after I recieved it before my grandson came to visit . We assembled the go cart and he could hardly wait to get on and ride it . Well he road it up and down my driveway for a solid 20 minutes then put it on the charger while we had lunch . One hour later we returned for another round of fun , NOT ! . The cart would do nothing when the throttle was depressed . We put it back on the charger for another hour and the green light came on . `` Grampy it 's ready to go '' he screamed out . Well still no response from the throttle , just a clicking sound from under the battery cover.After and hour on the manufactures web site we finally found our clicking problem listed -LRB- what a supprise -RRB- along with about 4 possiable fixes . Grampy do you think you can fix it ? Will I be able to ride it agian before I go home ? After one hour of dismantling and diagnosing all the electrical components I disconnected the connector for the brake switch and WA-LA it ran again . This happened on a Saturday , no one to call at Amazon or the manufacturer so we were on our own . It seems I am still on my own , as the return period has passed and the manufacture wants $ 30.00 plus shipping for a new part for the `` new go cart '' that lasted 20 minutes and I have to install the part . Piece of crap , should have bought one local and paid a bit more & have some good customer service . Do n't buy a RAZOR from Amazon , buy local .
 I bought this for my son and he enjoys it greatly , unfortunately , it stopped working after 6 months and I do n't know where to send it to get it fixed . It does n't take it 's charge anymore so I am wondering if I need to get a new motor after 6 months for his go kart . This was great when it worked , but it did n't work for long .
 Please do not waste your money on any Razor items . The batteries will not work for long -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I bought this go cart for my son 's birthday , what a mistake that was.The first one was opened and I had to send it back to Amazon , which they did send me another right out.The second one lasted one day and then would not charge ever again!The go cart is still sitting in the garage with the box next to it!I wasted $ 200.00 + on this go cart and my son 's birthday was disappointing and a nightmare , he still talks of his go cart that is sitting in the garage with big disappointment.Amazon should have to replace this go cart again ! I got a 2nd dud and gave up . I really do want my money back however , this is entirely not our fault . 2 out of 2 bad , I cant say enough DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM ! YOU WILL BE VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED . I 'm still waiting on my refund for ours . $ 200.00 .
 I just got it yesterday , the right side of seat is broken after I opened the package , the seat belt is broken too after 3 minutes drive , my 7-year-old got injured badly . -LRB- It is really fast , more than 15 mph depends on driver weight -RRB- I wrote to Amazon , Customer Service ordered another one for , but he did n't let me know , they were forcing me to buy another one ... It 's ridiculous !!! Amazon made me so disappointed by poor customer service ! and Amazon does n't want to take any responsibility.The product seems sturdy , since it goes really fast , so the driver must wear seat belt when driving , but the included seat belt has very poor quality , not worth the money AT ALL ! . .
 I buy the Groundforce Electric Go Kart and less than 1 hour out of the box the rear axle breaks !! Unbelievable . So I call customer service . They request I fax in my UPC/proof of purchase and they will send me a new axle . Instead , they -LRB- somebody named Phil -RRB- send me two rear wheels . I call again , talk to another service rep. , re-fax my documentation and after a week-and you 're not going to believe this-they send me an electrical kit for for one of their scooters . So I call again . This time they are not receiving any audio on their customer service lines so I 'm shouting into the phone -LRB- three times I tried -RRB- and they hang up on me after 10 seconds or so ... each time ! Avoid these guys like the plague . They are the worst company I have ever done or at least tried to do business with ... they do not deserve your business .
 Assembled kart and then my nephew took it out for a ride . He ran over a PEBBLE and a chain snapped off of the kart and now it wo n't work.I 'm not sure if it was n't assembled correctly and that 's why the chain broke , but we ca n't even put it back on or anything ! I 'm trying to figure out what to do next .
 The go kart just wo n't hold a charge - whether I charge if for 1 hour or overnight . We live on a 9 house cul du sac and my son ca n't even go around the cul du sac before it runs out of power . He is very disappointed ! I am contacting Razor and hopefully they will know how to fix this problem .
 Fully charged , the gocart accelerated for 2 minutes , then slowed down , had a bad battery I guess , and this is why they sell for less . I just want a refund and to give them back their faulty gocart .
 We purchased it for my son 's birthday and charged the battery the night before his birthday so that he would be able to race on his big day . However , he was only able to use it for literally FOUR minutes before it would slow to a snail 's pace . I called the Razor company to see what could be done and they thought it was the battery pack which is on backorder -LRB- other 's must have this issue ?!? -RRB- and it would n't be in stock for about 2-3 WEEKS . It was a dud of a gift . I hope that it goes well once we receive the new battery . I also hear that the tires wear REALLY fast .
 I got this go kart for my son last Christmas . He loved it and used it every chance he could . After about 6 months the electronic controller broke , then it needed new batteries and the brake wore out . It 's really fun when it works but needs a lot of repairs .
 I bought this go cart in May 2005 . My kids did n't get to ride it for even an hour before the belt broke . An extra belt was stored in the cart so we replaced the broken one , adjusted the tension and let the kids ride again . Again , no more than an hour later , the belt broke again . I called Razor , and they sent a replacement belt which took over an hour to put on because you have to take the back wheel and axel apart . Two hours after fixing it , it broke again . Called Razor again , sent replacement belt , again . Changed belt AGAIN , BROKE AGAIN ! Called Razor a last time , and was told they would send one more belt but we would have to pay $ 5.00 for each belt after . Was told they could not take cart back.In my opinion , there was something wrong with the belt gear . So unless you have time and money to spend on this item , DO N'T BUY IT ! It 's sitting in our shed and has been since July .
 I purchased this for my 9 year old as an early birthday gift . We had been waiting for a battery powered go-kart for him for a long time so we were very excited to get this . Putting it together was a snap
 We purchased 2 of these little go carts for our girls . Neither of them are operable . Our first go cart 's chain broke and fell off on the 3rd use . The second go cart 's thumb throttle got stuck and almost killed my child during the first use . Razor 's management team WOULD NOT take my call . The phone associate only repeats like a broken record `` I 'M SORRY '' but the parts will take 3-4 weeks to arrive . They should be ashamed , selling products with shoddy workmanship and not offering any kind of compensation for their incompetence . I will never purchase another Razor product and recommend that no one else does either . The fact that no one seemed concerned with my daughters saftey and our overall satisfaction is unacceptable .
 We purchased this product for our 5 and 7 year-old sons . They loved them and rode constantly . Tons of fun ... until ... Fast forward three months and BOTH carts quit working within 2 weeks of one another . The lights light up , but they will not go . I suspect it is the speed controller , but I have been unable to get ahold of the company as of yet.Now I have two very disappointed little boys and what is looking like a lengthy warranty repair process.Right now I would have to say , `` steer clear . `` Update : We have now had the carts for a year . Total riding time has been MAYBE 2 months . The rest of the time they were laid-up waiting for parts -LRB- which apparently have to come across the ocean on a steamer -RRB- . The speed control is the problem and they have had to be replaced twice in a year -LRB- still waiting on the second one -RRB- . Razor told me that I would have to buy the parts . I laughed and told them no way . They reluctently agreed to cover under warranty.I would give this product zero stars if I could . The frame is solid , but the electronics are terrible . I plan on rewiring the cart and buying my own PWM -LRB- speed control -RRB- . I am tired of Razor 's `` sorry , those parts are on backorder '' routine.BUY ONLY AT THE RISK OF YOUR CHILD NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEIR COOL , NEW TOY !
 I purchased this and the mini chopper bike for my boys for Christmas 2004 . The chopper bike never worked right and the company gave me the run around . The go kart ran longer by months but the battery never stayed charged for more than 30 minutes . The belts have broken numerous times . My son would rather ride his power wheels than the mess with the go kart . Now it does not run at all . My 3 year old sits on it and pretends she is going somewhere . WHAT A WASTE ON MONEY AND A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT . To make matters worse the company does not stand behind thier product and continue to sell the hunks of JUNK !!!!
 I saw all these reviews about how this is n't for kids that are young . My son is 6 and rides this thing with no problem , its actually a little small for him . His legs are all cramped up . Makes me wonder if the other people here have very small children , or possibly I 'm raising a giant . The brake is getting scraped up and bent all the time since it sits close to the ground , its a pain to bend back and fix . The entire bottom of the cart is scraped up , but it does n't seem to affect the drivability.The battery life on this thing is amazing . My son drove this almost two miles on a single charge . Lots of fun , adults do n't fit well on it though.So , here 's an edit
 I received the Razor Ground Force electric go-kart on Friday . The assembly instructions included were for an older version of the Ground Force , so I downloaded the new instructions from their website . I attempted to assemble it , but the screw for the steering assembly could not be unscrewed . Razor 's tech support is not open on weekends , but I had two conversations with them on Monday.They finally concluded that my only solution was to take it to one of their `` certified '' repair facilities . I live in a major city but the closest one they could find is over 20 miles outside the city . I 'm returning it instead -- and you would n't believe how difficult it is to get it back in the packaging.I would not recommend buying this piece of junk . The instructions are wrong , tech support is unhelpful -LRB- and closed on weekends -RRB- , and the damn thing is n't built well.Worst of all , you 'll end up with unhappy kids .
 Razor Ground Force Electric Go-KartI bought this for my six year old son for Christmas as his big gift . He was very disappointed Christmas morning when the battery lasted less than 10 minutes . It was put together according to the directions -LRB- there were three separate sheets of instructions for initial battery charge time , one stating 6 hrs , another 8 , and the last 12 hours -RRB- We waited until we had a green light meaning fully charged . I figured it was something we did so I had my grandfather -LRB- an electrical engineer look at it -RRB- and my brother n law -LRB- auto mechanic for racecars -RRB- . Both believed it to be the battery . It is being sent back today . He was excited for those 10 minutes but not worth the sad look and the fun of sending it back !
 The hair on the fly whisk is nice and thick , the handle is a sturdy bamboo . However , the wrist strap is very flimsy and the tape that holds the hair to the bamboo unraveled the first time I used it . I had bought 2 planning on giving 1 as a gift . But the quality is not good enough for that . If it makes it through the summer , I will be amazed .
 This tent is not designed for the rain , instead of running off it collects on the top . If left unattended , it pools up until the poles bend and the entire this collapes unrepairable .
 I recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall ... it crashed down . The cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless . A waste of over three hundred dollars !
 I only got 4 openings out of this frame . It was difficult from the start and by the 4th time almost every one of the joints that did not have a support backet on both sides were bent . Unfortunately , I did not buy from Amazon and I 'm getting no response on my warranty .
 If you are simply looking for a quick set up craft tent that absolutely must come down each night and be packed away till the next craft show , well then this might be it . IT is definitely water proof , which is a blessing and a curse . The structure can not hold the weight of the water in a flash rain . The canopy being fully water proof POOLS this excess rain water in giant swags in the roof canopy that you have to push up on with a mop to empty the flow . So the one time we were not attending the tent , had it up over night so we could set up the next morning , a flash storm blew through , heavy rain . The rain become so heavy that the weight imploded the structure . -LRB- I have pictures if anyone is interested . -RRB- Ruined so much art stuff . Broke shelves in half , The pins from the structure actually bent in half ! It was just a heap of metal . Nothing could be saved but the fabric . Nothing . So read the warranty . You are not allowed to leave this tent up . This is NOT a professional grade tent . EXTREMELY disappointed as I 'd won a art grant to pay for it for my art shows . sad .
 In the Product features it says that it includes a roller bag and 4 pack sidewalls -LRB- 3 standard and 1 mid zip -RRB- BEWARE there are no sidewalls included . Amazon is selling something that it does n't really include . The ez-up is great but what I bought is n't what I got.Product FeaturesColor
 This was a defective/inferior product sold by a vendor who needs to have all amazon vendor privileges revoked . The product came in and did n't look right to begin with , the first day it was worn the letters started flaking and the first time it was washed they started peeling off completely . The vendor has ignored all contact attempts and has alot of feedback from other dissatisfied customers with similar issues . Amazon has now had to become involved and the issue still is not resolved . It is utterly amazing to me that this has taken so long to get resolved ; no one should have to wait this long or go through so much to get a defective item taken are of , this has been an ongoing issue since December 26th . I truly believe that in the interest of good customer service ; Amazon should look at and change there A-Z guarantee policies especially when there is more than one grievance on a vendor for the same issue -LRB- s -RRB- or very similar ones . My review rates both the product and Amazon 's handling of the situation at a one star and recommends drastic changes in the vendor 's privileges and Amazon 's policies .
 The cable is thick enough , which is good . But it is also very bad
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 I got 4 of these harnesses for a special olympics ski team I coach , and we 've gotten them from other places in the past . The harnesses are great , it 's the belts that are flimsy - the stitching around the `` D '' rings come apart .3 out of our 4 belts had this happen - if it were just 1 then I may be inclined to think it was a fluke , but 3 out of 4 ???? That 's just shoddy workmanship.We have since started to make our own , you can get most of the supplies at sewing shops and it 's a lot less expensive considering the quality!We had to have someone stitch up the 3 that were faulty and once that was done , they are great.Nice product , but should be stitched stronger .
 The ski tip clamps work well , if a bit tall . the belt and straps are serviceable , but do n't have any padding around the waist or additional straps besides the one that goes around the waist . No carrying pouch of any kind provided . Appears to be not more sophisticated than something one could put together at home with a few webbing straps and clips .
 I never wear this top after having purchased it . The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them . The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly . I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and , therefore , is n't very flattering . I think I 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon . Generally , I have been pleased with Adidas products , but this shirt did not work for me personally .
 After about a year , the whole white sticker with the logo began to peel off and was unable re-secure with glue . Have since found markers that are embossed or molded the loco .
 I purchased 6 of these -LRB- Not from Amazon however -RRB- .2 broke before I could shoot all 10 balls in the magazine.The other 4 broke soon after.The pump pushes a rod with teeth . The teeth ingage a gear to compress air.The teeth end up jumping off and/or striping the plastic gear.This is the maner in which all 6 broke .

 My first review becs i 'm VERY Unsatisfied.Only used this for 1 week and the bag that it came with ripped open and all the powder is out loose . Not a good product . I went back to Liquid Grip instead . Do n't get this ... i 'd give this negative 3 stars if i could . The only reason why i put 1 star is becs i ca n't post w/o any `` rating '' .
 I feel like the quality of the chalk substitute is great . It really helped me on weight lifting . Unfortunately the bag broke my first time using it so I spilled the whole bag in my pocket . That is the only reason I do n't like it . Especially since I bought it trying to be covert in my gym .
 Yes , this non-chalk ball works great . BUT - I was sent a bright pink ball . C'mon . Much different from the pictured black ball.Not appreciated .
 The mount did not fit my handle bar . If you have an oversized handle bar ; which seems to be the most common these days , do n't bother purchasing this product .
 Two things : - you do n't need to buy this if you get a `` road bike pod '' - it includes one - it 's a horrible design that does n't fit modern road bikes
 I have a stock Bianchi 2008 C2C road bike and it just does not/can not fit .
 Watch face dicolored . The watch band has been cut and readjusted . Battery was low and back light is very dim .
 This is the 3 rd defective Suunto product I have received over a 3 year period . The bezel of this watch was installed upside down . Accordingly , the names over each function button are wrong . When the manual says `` push the Select button '' you have to remember to push the button marked `` on/off '' instead . It is the same for all 4 buttons since they put the watch together backwards . If you buy this and have problems operating it compare the actual watch with the pictures of the watch in the manual . If it is reversed you have the same issue.Suunto used to produce high quality products that were long lasting . I have now had one Observer fail after several years use , another watch -LRB- a Core -RRB- was shipped with a broken altimeter -RRB- and now this Observer shipped constructed backwards . Also , the straps fail quickly and are expensive to replace . Over the years Suunto has shifted its production from Finland to China on most models . As this has happened the quality of the construction/function has gone down . One reason I purchased this last Observer was the statement that it is still `` made in Finland '' . If that is the case it is still a piece of junk . I have now learned not to purchase Suunto products .
 I bought this watch a little over 4 years ago because of its features and looks . It 's not as ridiculously bulky as most other watches with a barometer/altimeter , so you can wear it as your everyday watch without looking like a dork.At first I found the LCD display to be a little faint , but I got used to it . The time , backlight , stopwatch , alarms , thermometer , barometer , and altimeter work very well , but the compass -LRB- Suunto 's supposed strength -RRB- crapped out on me within the first year . It seemed to get stuck so that you could n't have the sensor go around the full 360 degrees to calibrate . The warranty is something lame like 30 days , so I just let it go.Just like everyone else has reported , the band broke every year and a half no matter how good I was to it . The replacements are expensive -LRB- ~ $ 30-50 -RRB- . Over the past few months , the display started to malfunction every now and then , but would come back to normal after a while . Recently it died for good - hence I 'm writing this review . Part of me thinks it may have lost its waterproofness because this happened at the beach and I always used to worry about the plastic battery cover that seems to belie the solidness of the stainless steel case . However , the glass never got steamed up so I guess I 'll never know.Anyway , I 'm disappointed that this $ 300 watch -LRB- $ 380 including replacement bands -RRB- only lasted 4 years . I give Suunto points for a nice design , but dock them some for poor workmanship .
 Amazon sent me a used , dirty , broken watch . There was no manual or any other documents inside the box . Completely unacceptable from Amazon .
 Almost from the beginning this so-called instrument has given me different elevation gain readings for the same hike with the readings varying as much as 50 % . When I called their so-called customer service I was treated with no concern , like I was some kind of idiot . In adddition this instrument is very complicated and the manual as well as very detailed and not easy to deal with . Their customer service person could use a basic course in `` how to treat people with dignity . '' Or find a job where she only deals with rocks and other inanimate objects . Finally I ended up talking with a supervisor and they replaced it . Less than xix months later the replacement also gave bogus elevation gain readings -- now off by 1000 % . I must now send my intrument in for them to check manually . However as the back of the so-called watch is plastic , not metal , it is impossible to get inside any longer . So much for a $ 200 + purchase . Into my junk drawer . A complete rip-off .
 The watch looks great and has all the features I wanted in a sleek size -LRB- for the features it has at least -RRB- . All the features seemed to work as advertised , though the temperature only works well when you are n't wearing the watch.I had two reasons for the low review . First , the user interface seems overly complicated . I rarely could figure out how to do anything other then switch screens on this watch without the manual . I 've owned other feature full watches before and this was the hardest to use . Second , the band sucks . The first two years I had it the band broke twice and it uses a custom band so you have to pay $ $ to get another one , just to have it break again . After the 2nd time it broke I threw it to the back of the drawer in digest . I will not put more money into it .
 I 've had my Observer since 2002 . It 's been with me from the depths of La Jolla Cove to the heights of Pike 's Peak . The functions are all very cool and it 's a great looking watch.HOWEVER
 Got this seat to replace schwinn stock seat . I think the stock seat was more comfortable ! Dont waste your money ! Im still searching for a comfortable alternative .
 I should 've listen to those comments below me . It 's very big and it 's kind of hard
 Bought this seat thinking the so called shock absorbers actually worked . Do n't waste your money .
 The Bell Max Comfort Bicycle Seat is illustrated from a rear view showing spring like coils that would seemingly indicated shock absorbing springs . This would be consistent with the name Max Comfort . Instead the coils are only hard materials with virtually no shock absorbing ability . This picture was extremely deceiving to me . In ordering this seat , keep in mind that it is not max comfort at all but a very stiff and hard seat .
 The features on this watch are fantastic . It is an excellent heart rate monitor , compass , alitmeter , and barometer . However the serial PC link is terrible and stops working frequently . I have had my X6HR for one month and it no longer connects to the PC -LRB- the main reason I bought this watch in the first place -RRB- . For some reason , Suunto still uses a serial connection , claiming on their website that this is the latest technology -LRB- more like the cheapest -RRB- . If you plan to use this watch for its PC data transfer function , be very cautious and keep an eye on the warranty . Also the Suunto Activity Manager software is terrible and crashes frequently . I have n't lost any data -LRB- yet -RRB- but its very annoying .
 I own this watch and I can not get the software to load on my PC without it crashing . It worked once while I was on XP but since upgrading to Vista it is a complete disaster.When it worked the software was hardly usable.While the T6 may be a good watch - the idea is to be able to use the downloaded data for your training program . The way the software works this is simply not practical.I can not in good conscience recommend this watch -LRB- due to the software -RRB- for anyone who want to manage their training data.There are better solutions out there one of which is cycleops for cyclists . I have no idea what to use for a runner may be one of the polar products.Suunto should be ashamed of the lousy software . I know a few people from Finland and they are a proud people but you would not know it from this piece of software . I hope Suunto reads this and will do something about it . Pity for such a nice watch to be hamstrung by junky software.BTW I downloaded the latest software v2 .20
 I wear my X6HR in a regular environment -LRB- office , home -RRB- , nothing near extreme condition . However , in less than a year , I foung the rubber band of the heart monitor is broken in many placed and the rubber became brittle with many hairline cracks . This is clearly a quality issue with the material used for the watch . In a trip to the Keys , FL , I found that the little rubber ring that holds the band of the watch in place broke in two piece much like what happed to the heart rate monitor band . The band itself also has many small cracks . I am sure the band will break in half sooner or later . The LCD on the watch also became fuzzy when I wear it around beaches . This is supposed to be a watch that you can bring to an expedition , yet it failed miserably in a everyday environment . If you are looking for a tough watch , look elsewhere . My Casio G-shock never gives me any headache that this watch gives .
 I owned an XL Glider for five years and loved it . I got rid of my XL because after four years it started to make so much noise that it became annoying . The Air Walker is not the same as a Gazelle or an XL in two major ways .1 . The legs are not independent of each other ; therefore , you are limited to one exercise . You are able to walk and run forward , but your gait will be limited because of the connection bar .2 . The Air Walker is not as substantial or as well built as the other gliders . If you go fast on the Walker , it bobs and lifts off the ground and the connection bar that limits your ability to do additional exercises becomes loose . The foot platforms feel flimsy and are uncomfortable . The platforms rest on bars that are about three inches thick . After a while , I felt as if I was standing directly on the bars . My feet hurt and I felt unstable.Some other factors that made me not appreciate the Air Walker are :1 . It was time consuming to put together . You need two people to put it together and it took us an hour because all of the pieces did n't fit well together .2 . The electronic monitoring system did n't work well and ate a set of batteries every time I used it . It got to be so expensive , that we just left the monitoring unit off all together.In conclusion , unless you have very limited space and/or a very limited budget , I would tell you to pass on the Air Walker and look into a Gazelle , XL Glider or even a treadmill . I paid about $ 60 with S&H ; for the Air Walker . I paid around $ 75 with S&H ; for my XL Glider five years ago . By the way , the Air Walker was quiet .
 I found these socks not to be any warmer than any other cotton socks . I was hoping they would have a thick bottom to my dismay they did not . They also slide a little off my feet leaving a loose fit . I 'm a size 11 . I was very disappionted with these .
 I would never buy this product again , the quality of the skate was very poor . The ball bearings are coming out of the skates .
 i am a 12 year old boy and my friends and i like to skate a lot so i thought i should get some good skates so i picked these out and they did not work out . the first day i used them my stopper fell of when i tried stopping and the wheels constently got stuck they did not work out so i go home greese em up now the wheels work a little more i try the next day and dident use the stopper and stopped by putting myskate down hard and i looked at my wheels a miniute later and they where sharded up listen if you want skates youll be better of using dora the explorer skates than these pieces of junk

 These skates are very comfortable ... but within ten minutes the stopper had busted . No wonder this item is no longer being sold . : -LRB-
 Is this a joke ???? I did not closed this purchase since the vendor was showing an image of a different product than the one he really is selling . I had to cancel everything and go elsewhere to get my wrist dive computerIt is my first bad experience and hope it will never happen againJuan M
 I bought this a few months ago , and have used it quite a bit . It has some problems :1 . The zippers go across the top of the pockets , and then go down the side . This makes things fall out of the pockets .2 . Unlike other mesh vests , this one has only one layer of mesh , so you ca n't access or store things between the layers of mesh . Mesh fishing vests should be made with two layers of mesh and then be provided with long access zipper .3 . There is not enough mesh and too much cloth , making it heavy and difficult to dry .4 . After a short while , the zipper on one of the pockets stopped working , leaving the pocket open and the things falling out .5 . There is very little storage space , compared to other vests of the same price.The design of this vest is very poor , with little consideration for the needs of folks like me who wear it . Also , the workmanship and materials are bad.Now I have to go to the trouble of figuring out how I send it back .
 Never got my vest !!! I was disappointed when I ordered this it was in stock and then weeks later I was told it did not ship do to out of stock !
 I own three different Suunto watches , I should have learned my lesson with the first . Suunto 's business model apparently is to sell `` high-end '' watches with pitifully low quality watch bands that last just beyond their short warranty period . The replacements are just as low quality as the first ones and just like the original complete watch , they cost you an arm and a leg.Now I have three Suunto 's sitting on my Desk with broken bands . The Suunto Core all Stainless -LRB- is n't quite all stainless it turns out , it has little crappy rubber links between the stainless ones that hold the band together . The rubber links easily break . After finally purchasing a watch strap tool , and swapping out the broken rubber link with one of the extras from sizing my watch , I soon discovered this was going to be a regular occurrence quickly went through all the extras . Now I 'm faced with purchasing the same faulty the replacement band which retails for $ 200 ! -- Really , for a watch band?My X6m all black SS band just broke in the middle of the rubber band and I ca n't even find a replacement -- Suunto direct tells me I have to find a replacement through their dealers , yet none of the dealers carry the strap . A similar strap but with silver colored stainless is $ 100 -- So hard to justify spending another $ 100 on a band that only lasted me 14 months . I 've also had similar problems with my X9i and its rechargeable battery can barely hold a charge for a full week now.That said , I have $ 1700 worth of Suunto watches sitting in heap on my desk and I 'm back to wearing a trusty old $ 30 Ironman watch that has lasted for 15 years with nothing more than the rare battery change .
 Love the Observer 's look and function - but the bands are terrible . Ive gone through at least 4 bands in the last 8 years . This most recent one only lasted about a year . It was enough for me to finally move on to a different watch company altogether . I reccommend other options - these bands are crap for anything over 10 bucks .
 My Suunto Observer is the BEST watch I have ever owned!However , the watch bands they make for it are terrible.These 2 bands are the 5th and 6th I have had to purchase in the 5 years I have owned the watch.For some reason , they have not figured out how to make the bands so that they will not quickly begin to crack and then come apart where the buckle is on them after about a year of use.I tried buying them from the Suunto site first.They , as usual , were not in stock there.Thank goodness Amazon keeps them .
 Suunto makes a great watch but the strap breaks about once a year . At $ 49.00 each to replace it 's close to highway robbery and makes an otherwise great watch undesireable .
 Suunto must make all their money on watchbands . This is the fourth one I 've replaced . They last about 12-18 months . Only the Suunto brand fits and is very expensive for two pieces of rubber .
 I bought my third replacement strap in four years . The plastic starts cracking after a year and on the most current one the metal pin that locks the buckle broke off after about a month , making the whole strap unusable . This is a faulty product that the manufacturer should have replaced long time ago . I advise against buying the Observer altogether because of the faulty strap .
 If this band was factory issue , which I do n't think it was , the quality has gone way down . This replacement was of such poor quality that I used the buckle and snaps from the band I was replacing . The band did n't fit the watch very easy , but I do n't think that was a quality issue with this band , as they are just difficultto replace.In closing , it was cheaper than others , but I think I know why now . I would not purchase this itemagain .
 Great watch - substandard band . Although it has been a problem for years Suunto has yet to devise an alternative or a modification to the strap that is more durable.Nearly $ 100 for a replacement strap , that under normal wear and tear lasts 2-years , is a little steep.Look at the reviews and respond to your customer 's requests Suunto !
 Buying a Suunto Explorer watch for over $ 300 is one thing but having to buy and set a replacement wrist band for this watch is painful . The original metal -LRB- which is in fact plastic covered with metal -RRB- did not last 3 years ! It costs around $ 100 to buy a replacement band and the first one I got did not open properly , I got a second one which simply broken at the closing pinSuunto Observer TT Wrist-Top Computer Watch with Altimeter , Barometer , and Compass -LRB- Titanium -RRB- level before I was finished mounting it . I 'll never buy again a watch where the wrist band is unique and so costly . I do n't use it anymore .
 It was very difficult to replace the original broken straps with the new ones . It took me about 1:30 hours using specialized tools . Besides that , the product material feels/weights different . I am not sure if that 's how it supposed to be .
 I have a metal case X6hr watch and is excellent . But the quality of the straps is inversely proportional . They are very expensive and have a very short useful life , specially if you do outdoor sports . Even the steel and titanium straps break . I hope someday the engineers that designed the watch could manufacture at least average-quality straps . In seven years using the watch I have purchased about five straps and they invariably break .
 Got the strap and it fits the watch - problem is that it was missing the pins !! Had to use the old pins from my old strap , but since this watch requires 1 extra pin , I 'm left with the watch waiting to get a pin from somewhere . No good .
 I love my watch ! But I have to buy a new band every year . They break in exactly the same place time after time . At this point I have spent about $ 200 on replacement bands -LRB- the cheapest ones only -RRB- -- each one lasts about a year or so . You look on the Suunto web site and find lots of people with the same problem . You have to wonder why they do not read the reviews and take some action to upgrade their product . Still I love my watch , but would probably have chosen a different one if I had know about the quality of the bands . I just hate spending 40 bucks on something that costs so little to manufacture - and is of poor quality . If the band would cost $ 10 - $ 15 to replace I would not be complaining -- the value is just not $ 40 .
 Just not sure how to inflate this ball . There were NO instructions or diagrams ????? 2 noses - 2 plugs - nothing on how other than what end to attach the pump and the hose . ??????
 I still havent been able to use the product because im still trying to get it to inflate - been at it for over 30 minutes now . Pump is awful and flimsy - dont buy
 Max-Rx , LLC is a worthless company ! I left feedback under seller feedback , but of course they get the last word . Hence my feedback here ! I left feedback stating how I never received my order and how they never returned my phone calls or emails , and they responded by saying I emailed them , confirming that I received the order which is why they will not issue a refund . Yeah ... sure ! I 'm going to ask for a refund on something I supposedly and previously confirmed that I received ?! C'mon people !! This company is led by a bunch of retards . Thank God Amazon has excellent customer service ... seeing as in how they took care of me when Max-Rx , LLC would n't ! They still have not responded to any of my emails or calls , but sure can take time to respond to my feedback on their profile to try and save face ?!? What a bunch of cowards ! I even asked to see the supposed email that was sent by me confirming I received the order . Nope ... nothing!So the ball may be great but I 'll never know ! As for the company , Max-Rx , LLC , I suggest you work on your customer service skills and perhaps learn how to tell the truth !
 I noticed it was deflating a little every day and after examining I noticed a tiny hole . I 've been doing typical exercises with it for about 2 months . Is that all the life I get out of the product?I have no issues with the company , I love the pearly color , and for a while the ball was great . Pump was very cheap , but it lasted me longer than the ball .
 I do not like this exercise ball . This ball has a sticky texture and not in a good way . Wherever it touches the wall , it takes off the paint . The paint sticks to ball and becomes one with it . You can not get it off . The wall needs painted because of the exercise ball . I do not recommend this item .
 I purchased this as a desk chair.I always kept it properly inflated and usually on it 's stand.After less than 200 hours of sitting , just sitting , no exercise , it burst with me on it.I tried to reach the manufacturer and got no response.I ordered another one , from a different manufacturer and will never order from this company again .
 My complaints about this ball : -- At full inflation , with the ball extremely firm , the diameter measured only 55cm , not the 65cm listed on the box . -- The plug could not be fully inserted . The end stuck out a quarter of an inch and would not go in further . -- There was an ugly black and green logo printed on the ball which was not shown in any photos . -- When fully inflated , the color/texture of the ball was uneven -- with drip marks visible and patches of varying thickness in the material creating a mottled look.I will be returning this product .
 This ball was small , it had a bad and horrible pump -LRB- hard to use -RRB- , low quality , ugly logo . We had to return it as it did not serve our purpose as a birthing ball
 If you want to leave your exercise ball out anywhere in your home this is a good color choice ! The pearly white looks decorative.P.S . I 'm noticing that someone else has mentioned a strong chemical smell coming from the ball . I , too , am sensitive to these smells . The first ball I ordered arrived in early January -LRB- and was given away as a gift -RRB- and did not have any problematic odors . A second ball which came more recently is very smelly . We 're putting it outside to air out and hope it will get better . The odor is quite strong -- ca n't be too `` green '' an item .
 I had to return this ball , when inflated to 65cm , it was still a gummy , soft plush ball that my body sunk 1/4 way into . Even when I added more air , it was still too soft . It felt as if it would only go firm if pumped to a diameter near explosion . The texture is shiny and sticky , which may be fine for exercise , but not comfortable for sitting .
 I bought this item for myself to work out . I expected it to be amazing for the price , but when I opened it and pumped it up I learned otherwise.The ball is the size it 's advertised as , BUT is way too squishy to work out on . I was expecting a firm work out ball but this one is near impossible to use unless you want it for seating . I would n't buy this again . My Walmart work out ball was 1/2 the price and better than this product . The packaging was nice but the product is awful .
 I received this item about two weeks ago , but have yet to put it to good use because of the strong chemical smell due to out/off gassing - particularly disturbing since I 'm hoping to use it as a birthing ball . I 've let it air out on the fire escape and in a small storage room ; the room took on the odor after a few days.I have n't been particularly sensitive to smell throughout my pregnancy , so I 'm reluctant to chalk it up to that . Regardless , I 'd warn anyone in small apartments or non-ventilated spaces away from this ball .
 Ok , I did n't expect to have details instructions on how to inflate the thing , but SOME instruction and a freaking stopper would have been nice ! I believe the product I received was used and returned and resold to me . Buyer beware !
 The first ball that we received leaked . After writing the company about the problems we 've had with the ball they are sending us a new one .
 I ordered this 65 cm ball and when it arrived , the box said 65 cm but the ball measures 55 cm . This seems to be a common problem with exercise balls in general , and I suppose one advantage is that this ball is direct from Amazon , so returning it and getting a replacement is relatively easy . Still , I looked into this issue before deciding on this ball , and this ball seemed to be pretty good in this regard , so I 'm frustrated .
 The ball seems durable -- however the pump does n't work well inflating the ball enough to be sturdy enough for exercising . We have tried many times to get the ball inflated more , it just does n't hold the air and the pump is not very efficient .
 The ball is workable , but is quite deformed , kind of like Jupiter bulging out at the equator , but not equally in all directions ...
 The product came incomplete and the customer support consists of a voicemail . I left a message and was n't called back .
 I did n't even realize it until now but I have the wrong item . The ball I recieved is blue and has a hand pump , not foot pump.I would like a price correction on my credit card.I suppose I did n't pay close attention when it arrived because I was in a rush . I am a birth doula and I needed it to take to the hospital for a soon-to-be-mother . I literally grabbed the ball out of the box when it arrived and drove to the hospital so she could use it during her labor.So , please ... a price adjustment ?
 This ball lasted about a week and half then started deflating . I tried pumping it up again , but then it lasted about two days and after that not even 2hours .
 The ball is made of a great material , but I called Max Fitness to find out how far to insert the plug , plus how to get it out without damaging the ball . I left a message explaining the situation and they never returned either call I made to them . It 's a good product , but I wish they would stand behind it by making a return phone call , or sending me some inflation information as I had requested . Lack of follow-up by a company is frustrating to me .
 I ordered this ball from Amazon and it 's not actually 65cm in diameter . Its actually 56cm -LRB- based on the measurements of circumference -RRB- . I plan to use this to sit on at my home desk , but its way too small . this has been a total waste of my time and money . i 'm angry that i even need to ship this garbage back to Amazon for a refund . they should be paying ME for this !
 This company provides lousy customer service . I originally ordered the ball with basically no problems at the time ; however , when I moved recently , the plastic `` pin '' got lost -LRB- that holds the air in -RRB- . I left two voice mails and sent two emails over a one month period , asking them if they sell replacements , and how can I buy another pin . But I 've received absolutely no reply from them , whatsoever.When you call their company , it 's one of those automatic , electronic voice mails without any business message , etc. . This does not bode well for customers if you have a problem order . The feeling I got was that there was no `` there '' there.Given this vendor 's complete lack of customer responsiveness , I DO NOT recommend buying from them . I suggest you order a different ball from another vendor .
 I was looking for an exercise ball to use as a desk chair , I tried a 65cm one and it was the appropriate height . When I received this ball and inflated it I noticed it was larger than I was expecting - when I measure it , it 's actually 75cm . It does n't work so well to sit on because it 's so large .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 We got this carrier to attach to my Giant Cypress . The included hardware does not work with the seat attachment on the Cypress , so I got a 1/4 '' bolt to use with the seat adjustment mechanism . However , then the frame was too thick to attach the bottom portion of the carrier to . At that point , I gave up , since I was pretty sure it would ruin the struts to make them fit . If your bike frame is thick and/or not round , you may want to think twice about this child carrier .
 I was n't looking for the cheapest option , but figured I 'd go with this model since it seemed to have about the same reviews as the $ 120 alternatives . Well , I was a shocked when I saw how flimsy the actual body of the carrier was . I 'd like to say it was sturdy when it was installed , except that the bottom mounts for the metal supports were so warped there was no way to mount the seat . You may think this is a rare occurrence , that is until you look at the non - ` New Classic ' model reviews -LRB- still listed as model 109459 -RRB- . Also , do n't bother if you have a quick-release seat on your bicycle . In fact , if you love or even remotely like the child you intend to use this with , do n't buy this product .
 I bought this carrier to mount to a new mountain bike with dual suspension . It does not fit it and is going back to the store . I am new to biking for recreation and no where in my Mongoose manual NOR the BELL manual did it say not to use it for this type of bike . I went to a specialty shop for advice . DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT unless you have a cruiser type bike ... there are no guidelines as to which bikes it will fit . I am going to have to decide on a center mounted seat or a trailer if I want the whole family to go for a ride together .
 I put this carrier on my bicycle , hoping to go for a nice ride with my almost 3 year old girl . She weighs about 30 pounds , far less than the 40 pounds the packaging says it will hold . After deciphering the instructions , and getting the seat on the bike , I put my daughter in the seat . Ok , so far so good . Then I got on the bike . I 'm 5 ' 9 180 pounds and she could n't sit there without hitting my butt/back as I rode . She lasted about 20 feet before she asked to get out because it was so uncomfortable . Nothing was adjustable , so I had to take it back off , and begin the search again for another carrier ... She was so disappointed ! : -LRB-
 I should have known better ! A cheap , flimsy piece of junk . My daughter is only 25 lbs but my heels and her toes keep crashing together with seat as far back as it will go . Returning this and saving some $ $ for a better carrier !
 I bought this to put on my women 's mountain bike so that when my husband and I go out on rides together with the 2 kids , I could put my 2 year in this , and he could use the double bike cart for our older son -LRB- who is n't old enough for a bike but too big for one of these -RRB- . I put it together myself and noticed after just step one -LRB- putting the bottom brackets on -RRB- that there was a problem ... the bars are completely warped and crooked . Well , I take that back . It was only one that was warped . I continued to put it together , then took it out to put on the bike ... and I just could n't make it work . I may have my husband try again later , but I will probably just take it back and wait until I can afford something better .
 I could n't get it to attach to either my GT or my wife 's Trek bike at the seat post . It does not work with either of those quick release seat adjustments . Wasted an afternoon fiddling with the install .
 It works . But it was not worth saving 30 bucks compared to some other options out there . I am handy and its hard to put togeather . My bike seat has a quick release and it requires a traditional seat tightening system . I had to go to the hardware store to jerry rig that connection with a pipe bracket and a Bolt and a nut . 3 dollars worth of stuff but still anoying and hard . Every part was hard . once all togeather it does work though . thanks mike
 After two days of trying to make it work , we are returning this . It does not fit on my husband 's mountain bike , my hybrid/town bike , or my mother 's cruiser.Nowhere on the box , the instructions , or the company 's website could I find a list of bicycle types that would work with this carrier . I went to a bicycle shop and was told the bolts provided to attach it to the bike are very large and not standard for any of the bikes he 'd seen . After reading reviews , other people have also had this issue . It would be very nice of BELL to provide a list of bicycle types that would fit this carrier , instead of the `` fits most bikes '' nonsense . It would have saved us a lot of time and hassle.If you decide to buy this carrier , I recommend that you contact the company first to find out if this will work for your bicycle type .
 We bought this from Walmart and tried to install it on my trek 7100 . But after a while we found that we couldnt fasten the seat to the seat post with the hardware provided . When we sent Bell a message on Facebook -LRB- because the link to contact them on their website was not working -RRB- , we got back a reply from them saying that this seat is not for bikes with suspension seat post .
 I just bought this for my beach cruiser and the attachments that join together behind the bike seat . . are flimsy and bend at the joint causing the seat to hit the back of the bike tire . And yes , I installed them correctly and used a wrench to tighten the nuts and bolts . Also my son is only 14mo old and his knees rub up against the back of the bike seat I sit on . . its so small , look at the photo of the kid in the child seat on the box he looks like he 's busting out of it . I spent 50 dollars so although cheaper than the latter still enough money to expect safety . I kept stopping and checking to make sure it was holding up . I will be taking it back for sure ! Please do not put your child in this .
 i got this home and half assembled before i realized i couldnt install it on the quick release seat post - then came on amazon to read reviews that said you COULD install on quick release . however , the quick release on my schwinn bikes is in the front of the seat post , not on the back . so the stupid metal arms have to straddle the seat post , which doesnt allow it to tighten at all . so NO , on MY quick release located on the front of the bike 's seatpost , i CAN NOT install this flimsy seat -LRB- and the metal bars that attach to the bottom of the seat didnt even fit , and the screws werent long enough to use the locking washers . unsafe !! -RRB- . i do have a 2nd bell seat that installs on a cargo bracket , which fit fine on my quick release bike , and isnt nearly as flimsy of seat material as this `` classic '' carrier . was hoping this bell product would be as good as my other one , but sadly the different price levels do reflect the quality of the product . hoping i can return this useless piece of junk .
 The product quality is good . We bought this product when we saw that our son met the age , and weight requirement . After an hour of installation , we learned that our son was too tall for it . We toughed it out , and after 5-10 mins of riding with him in the seat , we removed it . My son was kicking my bike pedals . Definitely not recommended for beach cruisers . The seat did survive a couple of falls down the stairs , and a 7 year old using it as a doll high-chair .
 My mom 's hybrid bike always gets flats - I installed the ` Stop Flats ' with big hopes of never having a flat again !! She got a flat 2 months later , riding probably 10 miles a week on city streets . And by the way , this is my 60 + mom , who leisurely rides - not an off roader.In any case , maybe I installed it wrong - but I did put in brand new tubes with these , so not very happy . Will probably try kevlar tires instead .
 Do n't buy this item . After only a summer of using this tube with small kids the bottom ripped out taking my 5 yr . Old out the bottom of the tube . Luckily , we were only going about 10 mph . But my daughter did get a burn from the fabric and of course it scared the heck out of her . Had we been going faster the results could have been tragic . It took me a half hour to stop shaking once I realized what had happened . I think this is mostly a matter of you get what you pay for . This may be fine for the pool but I would never use it behind a boat . From now on I will pay for the O'Brien brand , it 's worth the piece of mind .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .

I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 I bought one of these at Target and it NEVER worked right . It took many attempts to light , the flame adjustment did not work well . When it lit , it had a nice flame , but it might take forever for it to fire .
 For the price , you would expect this to last more than one round of golf !!! It ripped by the 10th hole , do not reccomend at all !
 This is a terrible golf glove . I bought 3 and 2 of them fell apart before I finished a round of golf . The coating crumbles and then the vents in the glove become holes . A glove should last longer than a round of golf !!!! Save your money on this one !!! They have a manufacturing problem !! Good news to report -- The company is a reputable company . When I contacted them about their glove , they indicated that the seller must not have stored the glove properly or the gloves were too old or seconds when I bought them . They felt this could have accounted for the problem with the glove . They replaced my defective gloves . I love the glove and would buy it again .
 I had ordered the dvd , paid for it , even contacted them about not recieving it , but they never sent it to me . So i am going to have to say to say its a lousy product .

 Item received was not what is pictured.Beware ; this is not SportDogs material , received Guardian Brand . The wire and flags are aftermarket and box did not contain all items listed in kit . I can not locate any description of the wire gage , so I 'm not sure what I received . Very , Very disappointed !
 Beware , this is not SportDogs materials . The wire and flags are aftermarket . Very dissappointed .
 This was a sad joke . First of all you do not get a set of two , you get one . Second , they are not night lights . They are a cheap little trinket that are clearly labeled musical novelty snowman . They play a piercing and tinny version of Jingle Bells and have a changing color light in them . They would be a hit at any dollar store . I sent them all back . Do n't buy !!
 This T-shirt , while still of Danskin 's always-wonderful quality -LRB- that 's why I gave it any stars -RRB- , is unfortunately not a good replacement for the # 3735 tees I used to purchase as my only nightshirts -- I loved the sturdy but lighter , loose and comfy , and very nice , high-quality 100 % cotton of that older `` model '' -- the fabric in this t-shirt is considerably heavier , and because it 's made with a bit of Spandex , it is n't light or cool -- it is -LRB- to me -RRB- stretchy and bulky and consequently does not have a nicely flowing shape any longer -- not attractive if one is disguising a little extra `` heft '' ... I was MOST disappointed to see these changes , and I dearly hope Danskin will consider re-introducing a plain 100 % cotton , cooler and lighter , good basic tee-shirt again .
 I purchased 12 of these balls for an outdoor glow tournament . They held their glow charge for roughly five minutes . We spent the rest of the night charging and rotating the balls in and out of games . It would have been nice for the manufacturer to share this information on the front side in the product specs . We would have still probably purchased the product and run the tournament but we could have been prepared for this issue instead of scrambling to keep the balls glowing for the tournament .
 The glow of my ball lasts for about 4 minutes and even then the lighting from it is way too dim to play volleyball at night with it . It works fine for daytime only
 I purchased the Mikasa VSG Glow in the Dark volleyball for an event we were having for a group of youth . We were doing a glow-in-the-dark volleyball night at our local church . We were in a basketball/volleyball gym that was completely dark , so it was an easy test for this volleyball . We had purchased glow sticks and had them taped to the floor for the outline of the volleyball court and also had them taped across the top and bottom of the net . It was a really cool sight and a lot of fun . With regards to the Mikasa volleyball , the quality of the ball is very nice , and it provides a nice soft hit unlike some balls that really hurt when you play . We charged it up in the sun for a long time but found that the longevity of the glow was extremely short . After only a couple of minutes the glow of the ball was too weak to make it very playable . Luckily , I had my son 's laser pointer with me . What I did after every other serve was to shine the laser pointer on the ball while the server spun it around . This only took a couple of seconds , but it made a bright glow pattern -LRB- tracks from the laser pen -RRB- on the ball that made it very visible in the dark gym . It was tedious , but it worked . Without the laser pen it would have been too difficult to play , and taking it out to charge in the light every couple of minutes would have been completely impractical . Get the ball , but get a laser pen . Then you 'll have a lot of fun !
 This is the second volleyball because the first one started to leak at the seams in less than 2 weeks . Another think I do n't like about the ball is that it glows for only 5 minutes . I was expecting it to glow at least 30 minutes so the 5 minutes is well under my expectations . The return procedures went flawlessly .
 We purchased this tetherball and after one or two uses by my 8 year old daughter - and it is broken already ! I am going to call or write in today to exchange !
 I LOVED this watch . I paid $ 99 for it . It looks great on my smaller wrist . Really a great looking sports watch . BUT , after one week , the second hand completely fell off and was dangling around in the face of the watch . Four days after that , the hour hand fell off . I am not hard on watches . I do n't work out much and I never took it in the water or hit it on anything . I thought it was probably just a fluke - a one-time defective watch . So , I ordered a second one , returning the first . It did the exact same thing after about 4 days . So disappointing ! Unfortunately , now I 'm afraid to order a 3rd watch or to even purchase any other Momentum brand watch ever again . I really loved this watch and have n't found another I like as well -LRB- as far as looks go -RRB- .
 I have had this watch about 2 years , but I had the same problem with the second hand falling off . The watch does n't work now because the second hand jams up the other hands .
 The first time I wore this watch in water -LRB- swimming in the Atlantic ocean -RRB- , the interior was all fogged up ; after about 3 months this went away . Then the crown -LRB- little stem where you change the time or date -RRB- fell off and I have no idea how to get it replaced . These are pieces of junk .

 I give it 2 stars because it 's useless for running but I use it for basketball when I just shoot around and sweat just a little.I would 've of gave it 1 star if I only used it for running . On a two mile run -LRB- normal sweating -RRB- , this wristband is more of a hindrance than an aid . I use two of them on one wrist since they 're small . Sweat does not dissipates or nor does it absorb on wristband rather it just accumulates and sits on the surface of wristband . When I try to wipe my forehead of sweat the wristband does not remove most of my sweat . In actuality I am trying to dry my forehead of sweat with more sweat . The previous wipe of sweat just sits and accumulates on the surface of the wristband . During the run the wristband uncomfortably overheats my wrists and this is during 60 degrees - but I do n't feel the heat during light basketball practices.I do n't like headbands ... yet that is . For running I have reverted to using one sheet of a good quality paper towel , works way better than this wristband.I love and use UA products almost everyday

 this is the worst thing in the world i don want to call it a vest the protection is terrible and if you get hit with a 370 or higher fps the plastic inside will break i got this thing with a gun but it is the same exact thing plz save the money buy something else
 I bought this watch in royal blue and in less than 60 days it stopped working . I took it for a battery change but that did not make it run.The jeweler said the battery was still good . Amazon would n't take it back since it was over 30 days . MY ADVICE - DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON MOMENTUM PRODUCTS . The site does n't accept zero stars .
 I tried and returned two of these , never kept the time past 1 day . Pityful example of time keeping .

 I loved these shorts they were comfortable and easy to wear ... however I have washed them many times and I ca n't get the sweat smell out of them , it seems to have clung to the fabric .
 This Arm guard does n't really protect your arm . It is basically a sock with no protection and the threads start unraveling soon after purchase . Unless you run a really cheap archery camp , this is n't worth wasting your money on .
 These arm guards are n't worth the money . They work only if you keep them stretched extremely tight . The threads started to unravel after the second use . There are many better products on the market .
 This cleaning kit is garbage . The cleaning patches and mops were covered in lint . The bottom of the `` wooden box '' is made out of slightly sturdier material than balsa wood . The adapter to connect the .22 attachments to the the thinner rod is to big to put into the .22 barrel . I was not going to scratch up the rifling by giving it a try . Also the brass brush for the .22 looked a little too sturdy for my taste -LRB- it was all rod and barely any bristles -RRB- . I used the .17 cleaning brush to give my .22 model 60 a basic cleaning as I did not want to damage my gun . Called the company and they are sending out replacement parts even though I do not see what having more of the same will do , but maybe they have newer/better version -LRB- fingers crossed -RRB- . Just spend the extra money and buy quality pieces separately and make your own cleaning kit .
 How would I rate this item ? Hmm . . somewhat useable , but overpriced . At $ 34 one would think they were getting a pretty good deal ; until you inspect the crummy spot welds on the flimsy sheet metal . Whatever you do , DO NOT use your foot to gain leverage with the scoop when digging . It will crumple . And after a few hours of digging and scooping , the welds popped loose . All of the digging took place in medium-packed sand . It would have lasted a fraction of the time in the hard-pack down by the water I 'm sure . If I had it to do all over again , I 'd either only use it to sift through the really powdery stuff or not use it at all . $ 34 was a pretty steep price to pay for this `` discard after use '' item.Looks like I got sifted on this one...-KS -
 fell apart its first time out . Bad welds that were already creaking and popping as soon as it came out the box .
 First of `` goody two shoes '' -LRB- I got the reference -RRB- The `` bicycle '' in question is not a women 's bike , and you would know that if you had a bloody clue about bikes beyond what you learned as a kid and what the morons at Walmart try to tell you.The only difference between the Men 's and women 's model in these cheap bicycle shaped objects is the color . It 's a unisex design to distinguish them they make the `` men 's '' a strong color like a red or a deep blue and the paint the women 's on a pink or pastel . That 's it . This `` bike '' is a toy at best the suspension is there for looks and the components are scaping the bottom of the barrel.After many years of selling and repairing bicycles to thousands of people , I 'm still blown away how many otherwise intelligent people think bicycles ARE toys and insist on buying them in big box stores like Wal-Mart and Toys R Us or worse yet the internet ! -LRB- Good luck getting a virtual test ride -RRB- They think the ONLY difference between bicycles from bike shops and mass merchants is PRICE ! Guess what ? It ai n't so.Unfortunately people mistakenly think bike shops only sell expensive bicycles to snobs and Lance Armstrong wannabees . The fact of the matter is that most bike shop customers are casual , recreational riders , many of whom had discovered that poor-fitting , uncomfortable , `` big box '' bikes do n't get ridden and do n't last.If you want a real value on a bike go to your local bike shop -LRB- Walmart , Target and any of the big box sporting goods stores are NOT BIKE SHOPS -RRB- there you will find bicycles that will last longer than the six months to a year -LRB- on the outside -RRB- that this boat anchor will , actual customer service that will help you find a bike that will fit your needs AND your body -LRB- The Mongoose is a one size fits nobody hence the low top tube -RRB- they will even offer service after the sale including at least one tune up which every bike needs after the first few dozen miles to account for cable stretch.Now I wo n't lie to you and tell you that the bike shop bikes will sell you `` full suspension '' for under $ 200 but I guarentee you that a bike bought there will be more comfortable , be properly assembled , and will last longer than anything like this turd .
 I ride this bike for a few weeks now . I have trouble shift the rear derialleur to the lowest gear . The rear derialleur does not match with the freewheel , it can not handle the 28 Tooth sprocket .
 I was getting ready to buy this mountain bike from Mongoose when I read the reviews . Ca n't believe they would advertise a men 's bike , then send a woman 's bike . And then they did n't want to accept responsibility for their error , and insisted the purchaser -LRB- below -RRB- pay a pricey return shipping fee . For that reason alone , I would never buy anything from this company . I suppose you could say that they `` cooked their Mongoose with me . ''

I thought this would be a great idea because of the pole ; but it 's very unstable and will frequently pop out of place , meaning you have to get out of the bivy to put it back in . The pole is held together with a small piece of velcro that is not perpendicular with the bivy pole and on the other side is a small hole for it .
 This was a sad joke . First of all you do not get a set of two , you get one . Second , they are not night lights . They are a cheap little trinket that are clearly labeled musical novelty snowman . They play a piercing and tinny version of Jingle Bells and have a changing color light in them . They would be a hit at any dollar store . I sent them all back . Do n't buy !!
 I was hoping it would not be made of potentially harmful material . Upon closer inspection of the packaging that the Sunshower comes in , it gives the disclaimer that the item is made of materials that have been found by the State of California to cause cancer.So , hey , it 's really your choice . I just returned mine in the mail as soon as I read that . But I do n't blame Stearns . All the portable showers are of the same PVC , no matter the brand.I think Kleen Kanteen needs to come up with a `` Kleen Shower , '' I 'd buy it !
 The Stearns SunShower 5 gallons I received is not like in the picture and description information of the advertisement . I purchased two and both are like the the 4 gallon or smaller style without the 1 inch carrying strap that can be put into the tube and hung up . The ability to hang the sunshower is impossible and carrying with the water weight starts tearing the plasic around the holding spot of the the SunShower on top . A totally different style shipped than I expected like from the picture . Does n't work well like the ones in the picture I had used before .
 I have n't had any luck with solar showers . They all seem to last for a couple of weeks and then start leaking . This one is no exception . You might as well buy two cheaper showers instead of one of these .
 I did not expect this top to be skin tight . The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit . It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of &#34; compression &#34; fit .
 Nice shirt but runs really small . I understand they are to be worn tight , but my 14 year old could n't get it over his head . Have to return it .
 The picture and description is of a shirt , what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top , open at the arm pits . Do n't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling .
 Great shirt in most respects , but way too small . I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son , who is 5 ft even , 115 lbs , and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it . I 'm exchanging it for the non-compression version .
 I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large . The shirt fit fantastic . I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large , different color . The shirt arrives on time , open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders ... . I contacted the vendor for an exchange . They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt . If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it ... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place . If you pass 30 days , there is a restocking fee of 20 % which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit . The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts . That just did not make sense . How are you to buy a product with `` floating '' sizes.So , I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee . There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering ... . only 1 chart for Under Armour . I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits , and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size , the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts '' just does n't fit ! '' . I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit , seemingly was ordered correctly , and then had to be mailed back .
 This is the first thing I 've ever gotten from under armour . Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective . After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling ... wishing for a refund , bad luck I guess .
 Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .
 This is the first time I 've had anything negative to say about Under Armour , and my complain is not really about the product , but the company , as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved , and they arrived as sleeveless , It was a birthday gift to my grandson , and he assured me it was OK . I went along with him , but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction , I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again , this was a plain and simple order , and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind , but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived , ibg1105
 thought the product worked great ... only problem had was first time was too small ... second was that not happy with cost to ship ... way overpriced
 I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $ 30 for it . It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it . When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle . The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew . Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings , which looks pretty girly . For a $ 30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it .

 This pedometer works great -- while it is able to stay clipped to your belt or waistband.The Bad
 For the price , you would expect this to last more than one round of golf !!! It ripped by the 10th hole , do not reccomend at all !
 This is a terrible golf glove . I bought 3 and 2 of them fell apart before I finished a round of golf . The coating crumbles and then the vents in the glove become holes . A glove should last longer than a round of golf !!!! Save your money on this one !!! They have a manufacturing problem !! Good news to report -- The company is a reputable company . When I contacted them about their glove , they indicated that the seller must not have stored the glove properly or the gloves were too old or seconds when I bought them . They felt this could have accounted for the problem with the glove . They replaced my defective gloves . I love the glove and would buy it again .
 I do n't know why I always keep going back to Under Armour - I 'm left largely unsatisfied with my purchases . To say it directly , the quality of their stuff just is n't all THAT great . At least not for the prices they charge . I got this for $ 12 , which is fine , but much like their compression gear , it RIDES UP and NEVER stays in place . Ever.I do n't have this problem nearly as much with other brands like Nike , Adidas , Reebok , and even stuff purchased at Walmart -LRB- Starter -RRB- and Target -LRB- Champion -RRB- . The material of UA 's products is too thick and smooth , so it 's constantly riding up on me when I 'm doing anything.Sorry , but UA seems to be more flash than substance , and that 's coming from someone who owns a hell of a lot of it .
 I 've only worn it two times before it started coming apart at the seam . Total waste of money . If I had gotten this at a local store , I would take it back . Not worth the hassle trying to send back to seller . Do n't buy .
 This skully is way too big for the average person . I am 6 ' 3 '' and 230 lbs . and it is still too big . The only way to make it fit better is to pull it down over the ears , which is not the way most people will want to wear it .
 I 'm not sure if the bike was broken in the process of deliver , or if it was broken before , but after about a month and a half of getting different new parts of the bike mailed to me I gave up on getting it fixed . However , the company FitnessQuest was wonderful . With no hassle , they mailed me a different bike . But it was a 475 instead and it has been so much better in every way . The design is soooo much better . My husband and I have loved it !
 We intitially rec 'd 4 after out of stock problems . The emblem breaks off after only a few weeks , very poor quality . Would n't buy again
 The Elliptical trainer is fun , like all the other trainers are out there . Except this one was constructed very poorly . They missed one of the weld seems by 1/2 inch and wo n't replace the part . They also would n't respond to my inquiries until I contacted the Better Business Bureau . For your own safety do n't by this .
 Through a gift exchange in our family , we ended up with three -LRB- 3 -RRB- of these cameras . After 10 hrs of trying to get them to work and multiple trips to the woods i still cant get one of the 3 to even opperate . They constantly freeze up and wont allow me to set them into picture mode . They are the most fusterating camera i have ever used . Not 1 , not 2 , but all three function poorly . I own a video buisness so electronics are second nature to me . I cant express my opinion enough DONT BUY !!! ALL 3 OF MINE ARE GETTING SENT BACK !! I hope this saves you some time and agony .
 I bought this camera to replace a film type Stealth that I had used to watch a watering hole on my property and find that although the pictures are very good -LRB- sharp and clear -RRB- the delay befroe shooting the picture is unaceptable . I have many pictures of the tails of animals that are leaving the area . The battery life is overstated as I have used two batteries in one month and only taken 45 pictures . If you intend to put this camera on the trail you might want to connect it to a golf cart battery in order to have it last for any length of time .
 I got one of these cameras for Christmas and was excited to see what type of animals were around my house . I put out some food -LRB- cord , seeds , cat food , fruits , etc. -RRB- and waited to see what I got . I got many pictures of deer but nothing else , I could tell that other animals were eating the food but i could not get any pictures so i decided to put up my night vision security camera to see what I was missing . In 3 nights I got videos of deer , skunks , cats , rabbits , and a fox . The camera got pictures of all the deer but nothing else even though I got video of larger skunks running around right where the Game Spy was aimed and still nothing . On another note the camera eats up batteries , The store brand 6v 's I have been using last about 5 days so I 'm switching to rechargeable . The positives of this camera would be that it produces clear pictures and is easy to set up .
 ok , got ta admit the price was cheap ... but why send me two left arms straps . oh not only did they send me two but they sent me a left strap upside down an the left label part marked out an placed a red `` R '' under it ... like i would n't notice it ... liked the price but having a strap upside down throws off the way its gon na set on ya . Very important to have them correct . Its usable but its not what i expected .
 As a Made-In-USA guy , I was hoping it was an authentic USMC/Army issue/surplus and would match my backpack . But it was made in China ... : -LRB-
 Great frame , however it comes with a seriously flawed kidney pad . Particularly the release buckle is the source of the problem . YOU WILL BREAK IT in the first few tries to open/close it.You will need to get aftermarket straps , the kidney for sure.other than that it 's great .1 star because it broke on the first try . In fact , me and my buddy got one each and we both broke the buckles INSTANTLY . when you get something and it breaks instantly , that 's a 1 star product .
 Do n't order this one . It 's unbelievably flimsy . I could bend it with my bare -LRB- girl -RRB- hands . Ugh . Sorry I bought it . Wish I 'd ordered something else !!!!
 Shoulder straps ... two different types , but did n't notice til they kept breaking . Had to use a snap link to keep it on , during a 22 mile trek no less . Frame itself is okay , hip pad not as thick/wide as a real one .
 I bought this watch as I liked the feature set . That said , I found it to be way too large for me -LRB- I 'm 6 foot tall , 170lbs so skinny -RRB- and on my wrist , just looked funny . I did end up with another Casio with the same feature set -LRB- Forester -RRB- that fit my wrist much better .
 As title says . There were kind of a `` water mark '' on the face of the watch , maybe a leak from the solar panel ? I did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch , no point paying shipping back and forth.Anyways the instructions were easy to understand , buttons on the side a little bit hard to push . Blue LED on red face looks bad , because of the dark face for the solar panel it is not easy to see . This watch is now sitting on my desk collecting dust , I am just waiting to see when the solar panel stop leaking and the watch fail .
 This item is much bigger in reality than the online picture lets on . It feels very heavy when you wear it . When I got it I had to have a jeweler resize it for me . I tried myself but it is more complicated than implied . I am not a happy camper at all . I have long been a fan on buying online but I guess you have to be careful when buying watches online . I never make online bad ratings but had to make an exception for this . Please , buyers beware .
 First off - these other reviews are fake . If they are truly unbreakable , why do they sell you so many?My first swing , SNAP !
 I ordered these tees as a gift for my father , who is an avid golfer.He did not like them . Too stiff.He threw them away .
 I purchased some of these Tees and I found that because they 're designed with most of the weight at the top I found myself loosing them because they take off right behind the ball .
 ... the stiff metal band in the middle , coupled with the hard plastic edge of the covering and the inability to set a fixed tension point -LRB- the design ends up tightening the fit more and more as you run -RRB- , render these bands extremely uncomfortable if worn around the ankles on bare skin , and not much better around the upper arm or -LRB- least uncomfortable -RRB- the wrist . I guess if you were wearing it over pants or a long-sleeved jacket it would be less of a problem.I bought this product hoping to use it with my Garmin footpod , but alas the band is actually too wide to fit the footpod 's slide-through belt loop casing , so I had to take a pair of utility scissors and trim a part of the band.Now I will have to try and find an ankle band made of neoprene or some other softer material with a velcro closure or some other means of adjusting the tightness of the fit . Oh well , the pitfalls of internet shopping -- not being able to try something on first before ordering .
 I wanted to buy reflective accessories for my kids who often play night games . Since this product is only reflective to 400 ft , I was concerned that it did not offer adequate protection . After doing some digging I found products for both people and pets that are night reflective up to 1,500 feet.Super Reflective `` Pop Bands '' Yellow Med -LRB- pair -RRB- - by VedanteNow I 'm assured that the kids and dog are going to be seen and not hit by a car !
 I bought these bands to wear when running at night in the winter . However , the velcro is not lined on the back and has sharp corners . I did n't even try them because I knew that they would snag my running tights all up . I returned them and will be buying more bands from Amphipod instead . These would work great when worn over pants while biking but ca n't be worn over delicate fabrics .
 This product is only reflective to 400 feet . Poor comparative value . Lot of better products available .
 These ankle bands are highly reflective , so I was looking forward to trying them . Unfortunately , if you wear shorts , the velcro scratches against your bare skin . I tried all sorts of variations
 I ordered this watch because I love the color purple . When it arrived , it seemed darker than the picture shown . I had a hard time making out the black watch hands on the purple background . I also had to squint to see the markings that replace the numbers . I am shipping it back .
 I bought a pair of these for me and my girlfriend , do yourself a favor and Buy the Reidell R3 's instead you will be much happier in the long run .
 The only thing these goggles managed to do was avoid pulling my eyes out of the sockets . It took about 30 minutes to put them together -LRB- a bad sign that they come with their own tool -RRB- , but the fit was never great and tended to leak . They come with an anti-fog solution that works for about 15 minutes . I used these about 20 times before the nose piece pulled loose from those tiny screws -- and of course , I 'd misplaced the little tool by that point . Expensive too . I guess it 's back to the raccoon look for me .
 Poorly made . Barely lasts a year and a half -LRB- ~ 6 months past warranty -RRB- . Will not buy again . This is in regards to the POLARIS PB4-60 , 3/4HP 115/230V BOOSTER PUMP .
 Ordered this product from A1 pool supply / web ware house / Amazon . Received pump promptly , about a week . When I wired the pump and turned it on it smoked , burned up . I immediately tried to contact the seller , they didnt have a direct phone or e-mail I had to go through Amazon and they would forward my e-mail . No reply for a couple days I tried again , no reply after a couple more days . Fianlly I talked with Amazon direct they asked me to wait one more week , so I did , still nothing . Talked with Amazon again they then contacted A1 pool supply then I got a quick e-mail response with phone number . I called no answer left message , a guy called back and left message , we did this twice I then left my cell nember and he never called back . Talked to Amazon and filled out a guarentee A to Z and they , Amazon , credited my account as for A1 pool supply ???? wont do business with them again . I guess all I can say is if the seller does not provide a return policy with contact information DO NOT do business with them . Once again Amazon was great .
 I had it for 2 weeks and it started to leak . I can not believe it . It was new out the box . I got it installed by a professorial now i have to go though the hassle to return it .
 i bought this pump `` TO REPLACE '' an existing one . pump comes factory set at 220 which i have . that mean 2 wires both hot and thats all you hook up with the ground of corse.i switched the pump out and after it ran for one day it had liquid in the cap with the capasitor . zodiac pool systems where this pump comes from , not made , said since i did the 2 wire switch over they dont have to warranty anything but out of the goodness of thier heart they would send the motor only and i have to switch the pump part over -LRB- i dont quilify to switch 2 wires that are the same current but i can swithch the pump -RRB- and it wont be covered by any warranty anymore and it could take 3 weeks to get . so for as much as this pump cost for one day in my case your on your own .
 Based on my experience with owning Polaris/Zodiac products , it 's products are simply UNREALIABLE . My Polaris ATV pool vacuum broke down after a 1.5 yr and needed complete overhaul/rebuild , which was n't worth the price . Now , this issue with one of the booster pump . Out of the two Booster pumps I purchased , one already broke down . Bought one for me , other for my brother 's pool . My brother 's booster pump already is making very loud noise after a month of use . Currently , I do n't know if that Booster pump will be taken care of by Polaris/Zodiac . Still getting the run around . Will update my review as the story goes .
 Very disappointed , I purchased a polaris PB4-60 booster pump on dec 7 2011 , it is now june 20 2012 and can not get them to honor 12 month warranty.I have emailed them all the information on the warranty several times and they refuse to help.I saved $ 3.35 buying the pump from them , I would have been better off buying the pump local
 The pump came in a correct but after 1 month running the impellor failed . Looks like the impellor was istalled improperly it was stripped this ended up costing me a service call a new impellor and shaft seal this was not great I will not be using you again for this type of purchase if I had bought local I could I returned unit
 The metal ring on the face plate which is displayed on the photo of the model is not present on the model which received . Thus , a fracture has occurred where the fitting screws into the flange of the plate , and subsequently a leak has developed . I 've placed a compression fitting on the flange , but a small leak still persist . Is there a face plate compatible for this model that has the metal ring on it ?
 Bought a Smooth Fitness 5.25 for $ 899 . on 4/2008 for my elderly parents in Texas . They are in their 70 's so it was n't like the machine was getting a workout . : -LRB- The treadmill was only 4 years 7 months old when it broke and I spent hours looking for a tech in the area to get it fixed . I finally called the company and they gave me two numbers to call ; one in Dallas -LRB- 9 hours away and another to a Tech that apparently had never heard of this brand -RRB- . The second Tech did go out to look at the treadmill -LRB- $ 105 charge -RRB- and told me it was going to be ANOTHER $ 420 -LRB- including parts -RRB- to fix . I definitely would not recommend this product or the company that sold it to me based on my experience with them . I did call the company and they offered to deduct $ 45 off the part -LRB- NO THANKS . -RRB- Buy one at Sears , that way if you need it fixed you will have someone in the area who knows their product . Good Luck !
 I purchased this watch for my husband as a Christmas gift . It arrived promptly and seemed very nice . My husband did not start to use the watch until a month ago . The leather strap broke off within a few days but the watch was still usable . About a week later the lid broke and is unrepairable . I contacted the company and their response was because it had been purchased almost 3 months ago they doubted they could do anything about . Actually the watch was used less than one month . Even if they doubt my word , it broke within 3 months of purchase . I am disappointed by the quality of the watch and the seller 's response .
 Tracey Staehle , along with her sister Bobbi and Josef Matthews -LRB- a kickboxing master -RRB- , take turns leading this yoga DVD . Even if you 're not a yoga person , this DVD has some good stretch moves.It is filmed outside in the fall , at a pool in Connecticut , against a rolling hills/wooded backdrop.What I liked about this DVD : -- the premixes , which are tailored to specific areas , e.g. runners , weight lifters etc. -- the scenery is pretty and relaxing -- the stretching . Like most people , I tend to skip stretching , so when I force myself to stretch , I always feel better . -- Josef . He 's a joy to watch . He 's a natural teacher , with impeccable form . He even has a sense of humor . -- the excellent form pointers . Although there can be too much of a good thing -LRB- see my comments below -RRB- . There were several issues with the DVD , which is why I rated it only 2 stars . -- the super-annoying black screen shots between each section . These 30 second shots had the name of the upcoming section , e.g. lunge series , prone series . They added nothing to the workout . What are you supposed to do for the 30 seconds while this was shown ? They broke the flow of the workout . -- The endless talking about form . Form pointers for poses are important , but after hearing them several times , they quickly get annoying . I can only do this DVD once every few months because of this . -- Tracey 's form in the standing poses is terrible . I do n't know if it was because she was several months ' pregnant and her balance was off or what . But it was jarring to hear Josef or Bobbi go on and on about correct form , only to have Tracey do everything they said NOT to do . For example , whenever her arms were over her head , they were bent and nowhere near her ears . For tree pose , her foot was against her other knee , which is exactly what Josef said not to do . To be fair , her form was fine during the sitting poses . -- The terrible sound quality . This was filmed outside , so getting even sound quality would have been tough . There is one section where Josef is talking about lotus pose and you ca n't hear a word he says . They should have re-dubbed that section . The whole production comes across as unprofessional and thrown together . -- The sense that this DVD was just thrown together . The DVD would have been better with just Josef leading , instead of switching between Bobbi , Tracey and Josef . I like to support up and coming instructors like Tracey , but she did n't add anything to this DVD . It was annoying to keep hearing comments about what modifications that pregnant women should make.I would say to save your money and use it for another yoga or stretching DVD . Or , rent this on Netflix first to see if it works for you .
 I should have known better - you get what you pay for . Knowing that I would likely only use this product a dozen times before my youngest child would out grow it , I thought I could get away `` very cheap '' . Unfortunately , this product exceeded my expectations , on the downside , of quality . I 'm not even sure that this thing would last through a year of use . In addition to the general poor quality -LRB- see other reviews -RRB- , the coaster hub did not work - the peddles would continue to turn if the child tried to coast . I attempted to get the manufacturer to send me a replacement hub , but after waiting 10 days , still did n't receive the shipment as promised . After calling again , they said another was `` on the way '' but would arrive after the Amazon `` last chance to return '' window . Decided that it was not worth the risk of dealing with a poor quality product AND lame customer service . I 'll spend another $ 100 and avoid any further hassle ...
 When I placed the order , there was a different picture than there is now . It was a navy blue with silver co-pilot bike . There was nothing to indicate other colors . When the bike was received it was all white , which did not match my bike . When I called the company , they said white was all that they had and that Amazon had the wrong picture on the web . I was upset because I felt that the picture was misleading and even though they tried to blame Amazon , they should 've known what they were selling on the web , so there is no excuse .
 Not a helpful review ? Uh . What ? Are you kidding me ? I 'm saving you money by pointing out the obviously bad design and manufacturing flaws in this piece of garbage and that 's not helpful ? Wow . Do you work for WeeRide or something?Positives : - it 's inexpensiveNegatives : - the allowed angle of attack -LRB- angle that it lets the trailer turn behind you -RRB- is very small . So small that when you are going slowly it will not allow the trailer to turn with the bike . This has the unfortunate effect of turning your seatpost . I 'm glad that I realized this on my bike with the aluminum seatpost . I 'm not glad that it happened - it could cause any number of horrible things to happen -LRB- seatpost or seat tube breaks and then what ? -RRB- . I corrected the problem by grinding off the stops that they had added on to various parts of the trailer to prevent turning `` too far '' . Now I see why they added them - under suboptimal conditions the trailer can turn upside-down now . Mind you , this has only happened while moving the bike and trailer around by hand -LRB- not while riding -RRB- but , hey , who knows ? Regardless , they covered up a design flaw with a crappy manufacturing band-aid . - the attachment to the seat post is poorly thought-out and poorly executed . The clamp on the seatpost is enormous and will chafe - there is no escaping it . The quick release for the trailer -LRB- hooks in to this attachment -RRB- is pretty pointless in how it is executed . I mean , sure , it 's a quick release in the sense that you flip it over like a wheel quick release but it 's not a quick release in that then you need to unscrew it . There are so many ways this could be done better that it is n't funny . The trailer part inserts into the bike part only the fit is tight to begin with and then if you ding the trailer part it will never go in . Again my grinder solved the problem -LRB- this time it did n't reveal any other flaws in doing so . Thankfully -RRB- . - the tire that comes with the bike is the cheapest quality vinyl -LRB- not rubber and holy cow does it ever stink of crappy vinyl ! -RRB- . One night ours just exploded . `` You over pressured it ! '' Oh , please ! I have pressure gauges ! It 's just cheap crap ! - the attachment point for the flag requires tightening in with 2 phillips screws . What ? Why ? Why not just have a little slot that you can stick it in ? - sure , the seat looks like a cheap piece of junk but it was n't until my child rode 50 miles on the trailer in one go that I knew how bad it was . My young child was describing perineal nerve damage from riding on this seat to me . Can you imagine ? I mean , seriously ? What is wrong with the manufacturer ? The CPSC -LRB- OSHA ? -RRB- should come down on them like a ton of bricks . - the `` quick release '' for the middle of the trailer -LRB- allows you to fold it in half -RRB- can not be adjusted such that it does not hit your child 's legs -LRB- and actually looks pretty dangerous in case of a fall -RRB- . It can not be tightened such that it feels tight . It does feature a safety latch that actually works -LRB- surprise -RRB- and is a real quick release and can be used quickly and simply -LRB- as opposed to the one for the connection to the bike -RRB- . It is not ergonomic to use and the whole folding assembly interferes with the proper riding of the trailer . - the seatpost quick release works ! Oof ! - the handlebars and stem are cheap junkIt 's poorly designed , poorly built and dangerous in both the short term -LRB- yanking your seatpost off and then what happens ? -RRB- and the long term -LRB- nerve damage is pretty hard to heal -RRB- . Save your money for a good trailer - you wo n't regret that you did .
 I bought this trailer about a year ago , and I wish I had bought the Adams Trail-A-Bike instead . The trouble began when we first attached it to my bike and found the hardware was too tight . We had to have our local bike shop actually fix it to install correctly . They suggested sending the entire thing back , but expensive return shipping really made that not an option . They said the factory had over tightened the screws to the point that the pieces which were supposed to swing free to enable you to turn corners did not swing at all.Now , a year later , I am finding that the height is not sufficient to make riding this thing safe . The photo shows it going very high , but that would only happen if you were seven feet tall . The bar which attaches does not sit high enough off of my tire , so that when I go up a hill the ride along piece hits my tires and makes them freeze up , causing us to come to a complete and sudden stop.I am shopping around now for a used Adams . Do n't buy this one if you are looking for a bargain like I was ! I should 've spent the extra money in the first place .
 We 've had this for over 3 years now , and have probably used the trailer for 300 miles . There were obvious problems from the start , but they have become more serious with more usage and with my kids getting bigger . The first problem is inexcusably poor construction , specifically , the hitch is not perfectly aligned with the rest of the bike , so the trailer leans to one side a couple of degrees . The second problem is that there is a lot of play in the two knuckle joints that allow the trailer to turn . This play makes it so the bike can flop back an forth a few degrees either way . Now that my oldest is 8 years old , her center of gravity is much higher than when we first got this , and it makes it a lot of work to keep the bike vertical . We went for a ride this morning , and it was bad enough to cause the trailer to jackknife and throw both of us on the ground.I 'm genuinely shocked that this has so many positive reviews . I suppose this trailer is fine if you 're just going to ride around the block with it once in a while , but it will not stand up to long term use . I 've looked around lately for used trailers with a sturdier hinge . I looked at a Schwinn trailer , and it appeared to have all the same flaws . My conclusion is that you ca n't trust anything that costs under $ 100 . When it comes to these trailers , you really have to spend the money on the name brand models , because all of the cheap knock-offs just are n't worth it .
 Do not buy this attachment for you and your child.I bought this and on our first trip on the bike path at the end of the path we went to turn around and then the bracket twisted on the seat post and the bike for my son tilted downward and that caused the frame that attaches both bikes to brake.Now if this had happened while riding and not at the end both of us could have ben seriously injured.Now on with the make of the frame it is aluminum with a wall thickness of .032 wich is about as thick as a credit card and notice the larger diameter to smaller diameter frame where both bikes attach and upon removing the paint there was weld where the frame broke and right at where large diameter goes to small diameter.Now dealing directly with the coustumer service there is a 6 month parts replacement warranty -LRB- yeah -RRB- emailed company they replied that i needed my receipt.Forwarded my receipt then after a week tried to call about replacement part was told that i was not in the computer and the person who emailed me back is the only one who can help me and that person was not in that day.Emailed again to the general coustumer email and am still waiting to here from them.I am also filing a report with amazon and sending back bike .
 I read all the reviews before I bought this product but chose to ignore them because it is cheap . We tried everything to tighten all connections but it just keeps on tilting to the left when my daughter was on . I 'm not sure if this is due to the design or I just got a defective one . The money I saved is not worth the hassle of assembly and disassembly we had to do to return this product .
 After reading the previous reviews , we decided to order two of these for our 4 and 5 year olds . They arrived promptly and were easy to assemble . Problem is ... I followed the instructions precisely but when I attached them to our adult bikes , they were both slewed to one side . No matter what I did , I could n't get them to sit straight up and down . I changed them around from my bike to my wife 's but neither one worked.What we wound up doing is sending them back and went to our local Bike Shop and bought 2 Trek trailers . They made sure the trailers fit and worked perfectly with our bikes.The only saving grace was Amazon ... There was absolutely no hassle with returning the merchandise , no questions asked . I have been a steady customer of Amazon for a number of years and this was the first time I had to return something . I was n't sure what would happen , but I was pleasantly suprised by the efficiency and quickness of the return process . My account was credited in no time . This type of service will keep me coming back and shopping with them for a long time . Beats driving to the Mall every time !
 We got this for our 4 year old so we could go on longer bike rides and he would n't get tired but it 's so awful we have never taken any further than up the street . First off the way it attaches to your bike is terrible . You attach a piece to your bike and then an attachment on the weeride is supposed to slip into the piece on your bike and you put a bolt through them but ours does not fit and it take forever to jam it in . pretty much every time you do manage to finally get it in it goes in way to far and gets stuck so you ca n't get the bolt through and have to struggle to get it back out again . SUPER frustrating !!! Second the bike like others have said leans to one side so bad it seems terribly dangerous . You ca n't even get it straight at all anymore even before my son gets on it . The entire metal bar is just not aligned right and as soon as our son gets on it and you start to ride it just keeps leaning more and more always to the same side . So not only is my poor son leaning the other way so he does n't feel like he about to fall over but it leans so bad it make steering difficult for my husband.We were so excited about this when we ordered it and since day one when it came in the mail and it was such a pain to attach we have grown to hate it . It was a waste of money and now we 'll probably throw it away since I would feel bad even giving it away to somebody else to have to deal with . We have the weeride kangaroo seat we use for our younger son and we love it , our older son used it when he was smaller to and they both have so much fun in it but their co-pilot trailer is just awful !
 I purchased this trail-a-bike at Academy Sports and recieved a unit without the attachment for the lead bicycle . After returning it for a second unit , it had the missing part except it was not removable as claimed . After working the unit , I could not reseat the saftey pin . The second unit was rendered unsafe/unusable . I plan to return it tomorrow and go with another brand .
 Poorly made . Our first trip out , the co-pilot began clanking after after 45 minutes of biking . We barely made it back home . We returned the product and were given a new one . The second one also broke within the first hour of riding . This time , however , it was extremely dangerous . The brakes locked up and almost threw my son off the bike . Since we were on vacation we brought the co-pilot to a bike shop and were told that a barring was broken , which would cost $ 40 to replace . DO N'T TRUST THIS POORLY MADE PRODUCT .
 For some reason , this thing always sits off keel , not perpendicular to the road . I 've tried to adjust and readjust , tighten and retighten , but nothing seems to help . In addition , the seat post attachment seems to pivot out of position fairly easily , making it easy to jackknife the trailer even when not turning . Last but not least , something went haywire with the axle during the middle of a ride and the wheel would no longer turn . We walked back to the car . Next day I took it to a shop where the guy was able to remove and reinstall the ring and hypothesized that it had n't been properly tightened at the factory . We 've had one too many mishaps with this thing and my daughter is now afraid to ride it , so I 'll be looking for a higher quality solution . Hopefully she is n't turned-off riding altogether . I really hoped this thing would at least be up for basic recreational riding , but not so . Maybe we just got a lemon ? In any case , I 'm done with it .
 My son rode maybe 2 miles on this bike , and from the beginning I had problems with him leaning to one side , almost falling off . By the end the bike started to shake a lot during the ride . We kept on tightening the bolts , but it never helped .
 This does look like a good construction and assembly was very easy . However , when we got it the critical swiwel section was stuck in both directions . The manufacture advised to return for replacement . So we did . Got from Amazon a replacement and the same problem . Had hard time getting a very old lady back on the phone and she resumed
 Having purchased and returned two units from a local retailer , I investigated more in-store displays as I encounter this bike . I have yet to find a unit that is NOT defective . The first bike I purchased and opened at home . I could not remove the quick release hitch assembly from the bike . In attempting to remove it I rendered the bike unusable as no one could re-insert the quick release holding bolt . I returned to the store . Not wanting to wait , checked , and it was not removable either . While visiting other stores , I have managed to find in-store displays that ALL exhibit the same stuck hitch and a clearance unit that was missing the hitch altogether . For now I have given up my search . I was interested in the price point , but in this case you truly get what you pay for . If you are looking to attach this semi-permanently , this still may work for you . If you are looking to transport this on a car rack or remove it often , I would advise you consider a more appropriately priced product.Update
 We were all set for our bike ride ... we made it about 1 mile , if that , and the WeeRide wheel froze up -- would n't budge ... we were stranded unless my daughter and I wanted to walk and drag the tire all the way home which would have ruined the tire and at that point I did n't know what was wrong so I decided against that . Fortunately a police man happened to be driving by and had to give us a ride home ... so much for the bikeride and picnic my daughter was soo excited about.Turned out , per our local bike repair shop , that there was a factory defect with the wheel . The sprocket on the wheel was cross threaded -- which relative to the cost of the bike , was a costly repair.Had to return the bike . My recommendation
 Our first one , the pedals/chain were defective and the pedals did not `` drive '' they chain , it just freewheeled backwards or forward . Sent back , got replacement . Replacement has been fine , we use it often.With our growing family , we ordered a second one . This is also defective ! The mount and bike-mounting holder do not fit together , it is impossible to take the CoPilot on and off , apparently a welding error or something . So we have to send this back to . Telephone customer service was helping only by saying , `` We ca n't help you with defective parts . Return to Amazon . `` So , one CoPilot has worked fine for 2 years for us , but 2 others have come and gone on the first day due to major , inoperable defects .
 We recently switched to this tagalong over a burley trailer for getting the kids to daycare -LRB- approx 3mi -RRB- . I must say that the tagalong is a lot easier and more fun than the trailer - my 5yr old says so too . That said , there are some things you should know before you buy this . Balance-wise , this is about the same as having a seat on the front fork . You 're fine as long as your child does n't start flinging themselves back and forth .1 -RRB- It 's heavy - about 25lbs .2 -RRB- You ca n't put it on if you 've got a rack on your bicycle -LRB- maybe obvious , but I did n't think about it -RRB- .3 -RRB- My daughter is 5 , and we had to take the reflector off in order to get the seat low enough for her to peddle . So think about the smaller version if you have a younger child .4 -RRB- The mounting bracket twists every time I back up -LRB- say to get the bicycle out of the garage -RRB- . And it is n't easy to twist back . I tried tightening it , and that just resulted in the entire seat turning .5 -RRB- There 's a quick release to take the tag along off . Getting it off is easy . Getting it back on is challenging - you have to pick up the whole thing in one hand -LRB- all 25lbs -RRB- to get the square peg lined up to go in the square hole . So do n't expect to get it on and off easily if you 're smaller .6 -RRB- The back fender rattles non-stop ; I 've been trying to crank it down and it still bangs against the gear cover.And an aside - on my 3rd ride -LRB- fortunately , no daughter on at the time -RRB- the wheel exploded . Literally . There 's now a 1 inch tear in the tire . So I may be feeling a bit cranky .
 We purchased this item because of the bargain price and we got what we paid for . The bike trailer did not trail straight behind our bike and we adjusted it many times . The hook up was n't the best either . We returned the item -LRB- with ease -RRB- and went with a Trek tag-a-long . The Trek is definately worth the extra money for it is a much better quality bike . The bike trailer is used by our 4 and 6 year old kids .
 I have n't had an opportunity to use it because the chain keeps slipping off the gears and I have n't been able to figure out the problem or fix it
 We were pleased with the price but very little else about this bike trailer . I have now said to my wife at least three times `` we should have bought the Trek . '' There are a number of more expensive products on the market and I recommend the reader go for one of those over this unit . This is several hundred dollars less than some others , but given the headaches we have had with it unless you are mechanical and know bicycles you should pass on this product.The first challenge we had was in assembly . The frame could not unfold because the metal flange that guides the two folding parts together was bent . It took 20 minutes to figure out it was not operator error and that there was in fact something wrong , and then I needed two heavy duty wrenches and the help of another adult to bend the piece back so the unit could be put together.The second challenge is that when in use the unit twists out of alignment with the parent bike and needs to be loosened and re-attached at the seat stem after each ride . If you do n't do this the child is offset from the parent 's bicycle making both bikes less stable . We did not fall over , but this was frustrating to my child . We solved this one by using a large hex wrench and loosening the horizontal hinge -LRB- just a quarter turn is all that was required -RRB- so that it is more flexible , but it took several rides to figure out what was wrong and how to fix it.The third and most troubling problem we had was that the chain fell off every time we used the bike . On one ride it fell off 4 times -LRB- requiring a stop and dirty hands for me each time -RRB- . I thought we would have to remove a link from the chain , but by loosening the back wheel and placing it all the way at the back of the range I got enough tension to keep the chain on.Our child is 4 , and the concept of a trailer is terrific . However the lack of attention to detail at the factory is so pronounced and so far below a reasonable standard that I would have to advise against this bike unless you are handy , know how to work on bikes and other mechanical products , and have a full set of tools handy.I hope this review is helpful to you .
 Purchased at local Sports Authority for $ 130 . Quality and finish are great , however , the 3-hinge design is horrible ! Not really sure why there needs to be 3 hinges since 2 hinges would suffice and be more stable for child . I had the same problem as a previous reviewer in that the child 's bike would be leaning while we are riding straight ! Yes , I understand you ca n't make tight turns/corners , but we were going straight . Granted , the extra hinge allows for greater mobility , but that is n't needed for a `` tandem '' . My son refuses to get on and my wife and I literally had to stop riding at least 10 times over the course of 7 miles to straighten the hinge - annoying . Yes , the bolts were tightened down ! However keep in mind , some seatposts are made of aluminum and you do n't want to bolt down in it TOO hard b/c it will crush it . We used 2 different brands while in CO on a family trip down the 10 mile CO Trail and those worked perfect b/c they were 2 hinge designs . Trust me , if you decide to buy this tandem , you 'll see what I 'm talking about . Tighten down the bolts all you want , but it will eventually happen b/c of the 3 hinge design flaw . It was the hinge closest to the child that swings left/right that just would n't stay straight ! If they got rid of that hinge then this tandem would be perfect ! Its very hard to describe unless you can see it visually . Regardless , we brought it back and I am now searching for something else .
 Overall still an acceptable deal for the money for us , but some problems that could be a bigger problem for the less mechanically-inclined : Two of the bolt holes on the mounting bracket were partly chromed over so that one bolt head was already stripped by the factory putting it in a little bit and another that would n't go in any further . Smaller diameter replacement bolts with separate nuts solved the problem . The bottom bracket is not quite right . From the factory it did n't turn easily or smoothly . Loosening it up helped a lot bit it took some effort to get it right . The pedals are cheap and do not turn as freely as I would like . Some of the other bolts are very difficult to adjust or turn at all . The unit is functioning well but it is not a high quality piece of equipment by any measure .
 We were very disappointed with this bike trailer . My husband -LRB- who has an engineering degree and is very mechanical -RRB- spent about 2 hours trying to get the hitch bolts to fit together properly . He filed and used a lot of WD40 . After finally getting the thing together , it worked okay , but I did n't think it was safe for our 6 year old . Very poor quality control and construction . Not worth the money ! We ended up returning it to Amazon.com . We plan to buy a different brand .
 This arrived at my house with a big hole in the box and missing the instructions , the pedals and the handlebar hardware . So I went through the effort of returning it to Amazon -LRB- since they would n't just ship the missing parts to me , no , I had to get an entire replacement . So in the replacement shipment the pedals and instructions were there , but still no hardware to attach the handlebar . So I had to go to my local bike shop and I 'm still waiting for them to receive the part , and it 's going to be like $ 50 for this solution . So now summer 's almost over and my kid has lost interest -LRB- at first he was so excited to ride it and now he just does n't care -RRB- . What a piece of garbage !
 This bike trailer is the worst piece of junk I have ever tried to make work -- and I have 3 kids so I have seen lots of pieces of junk . This one takes the prize for the worst design and worst implementation . Rating this as a 1 star is really doing a disservice to 1 star merchandise but 0 stars is apparently not an option.I was disappointed to find rust spots all over the handlebars when I unpacked the item but figured it was not a big deal -- just a cosmetic flaw.I was further disappointed that the trailer needs not 1 , not 2 , but 3 different sizes of hex wrenches to assemble -LRB- why ??!! -RRB- . And , of course , no tools are included in the package . But I have a set of hex wrenches so no big deal.I was still further disappointed to find that the mounting bracket that attaches the trailer to the bicycle could not be removed from the trailer . This means that once the trailer is attached to the bike , it 's not coming off -LRB- unless you want to remove the four bolts to take it off -RRB- . But I thought it unlikely that my wife would be riding without our youngest child . So no big deal.The final straw was when I discovered that the up/down hinge would not move at all . This makes the trailer completely unusable as it lifts the back tire of the bike off the ground . I tried to loosen the hinge bolt but it had been tightened WAY too tight . I ended up stripping the bolt on both sides trying to loosen the thing.I disassembled this piece of junk , put it back in the box , and am sending it back.Do yourself a favor -- do NOT order this garbage . There has to be a better model out there .
 Product arrived missing parts -LRB- making it unusable -RRB- and after 3 calls and faxing over proof of purchase over many weeks the company has yet to send the missing parts , despite being told each time they are sending them . Just keep getting the runaround . So far I have a piece of metal , plastic , and rubber that can only gather dust .
 We have a Folder 24 from Adam 's but did n't want to invest in another now that both children need tag-a-longs . Our oldest is 8 and she really only needs to ride with us for long/difficult bike rides so we did n't see the point ... thought we 'd get something cheaper for the few times she 'd need it ... bad idea ! This WeeRide trailer took over an hour to assemble for starters . The easy click together section was off and would n't click together . The seat would n't tighten , so it spun when she sat on it . The splash guard on the wheel was too loose and would n't tighten . Not a quality product at all.During our first 4 mile ride , the pedals feel off twice while riding ! The attachment to my husbands bike when sideways and she was riding on the side wall of the tire for most of the ride . And , the seat kept moving . So , we immediately packed it up and returned it to Amazon . Unfortunately Amazon does n't sell the larger Folder 24 from Adam 's -LRB- for ages 7 to 10 -RRB- , but we found one on eBay . We now have 2 . Do n't buy this , you get what you pay for , which is a big headache .
 Our daughter absolutely loves her `` new bike '' . She is too big for the bike seat and just not ready to master riding w/o training wheels.The quality is less to be desired . The chain rubs against the guard and everyone hears us coming when she is peddling . Whenever we turn , my bike seat turns with us ... kind of annoying but a small price to pay considering that we can once again enjoy family bike rides together .
 POSITIVES
 The area where the bike trailer clamps to the seat post can move and willnot return to the straight position . The adult bike seat can move too .
 Our experience with the WeeRide co-pilot was very disappointing . Our son was dumped off the bike once , and we found that a critical bolt almost came completely loose which could have caused serious injury during a ride . This review is long but before you buy this product I suggest you read the details of our experience ! Note
 Before I bought this item , I read all the reviews . I found all good reviews except one.I ignored the bad one with the wishful thinking that the customer got a bad piece.I faced exactly the same problem that the customer mentioned . I checkedthe design carefully , I found that there is nothing wrong with the piece . It is afundamental design problem . There are two clamps , one attach to the primary bike seat rod , and another on the rod that attach to the first . Both clamps can not be tightenedfirmly to prevent it from rotation . Due to the possibility of simultaneous rotations of theseclamps , the trailer can incline to a large extent . With a child riding on the trailer , it can trip over easily . This problem may not show up in first one or two rides . But witha few more rides , the friction in the clamps goes away , and they start rotating morefreely . In my opinion , this trailer should be recalled , as it is too dangerous to be on the road .
 A very short review since so much has already been written about this.It 's very heavy duty and sturdy and also a little clunky with all the elbows and screws and the underside of the frame was only a fraction above my rear tire so that I could not mount it without taking my rear carrier pack off.Here 's the real issue
 We have a two year old CO PILOT and our 40 lb 7 year old loves it . Because we live in a big city , she wo n't graduate to riding `` solo '' for a while , except around the block or in a park . She will get a couple more years use out of it . There are more expensive , perhaps lighter brands , but once you get a working Co Pilot it is a joy.But -- we have had TWO severe mechanical problems . Our very first Co Pilot , the pedals just `` free wheeled '' and did not drive the chain , so we returned it the same day and good working model . Now , two years later , we have just bought a second Co Pilot . The company says there is a `` new hitch design '' . Well , the hitch fits inside the sleeve or clamp - NOT . It arrived with the arm inside the sleeve -LRB- the bike mount -RRB- and it could just as well have been welded on . Whoever fit those two parts together must have been a Superman !! Eventually I got it off , but even with oil and effort it will not fit back inside the sleeve , to mount and use the bike . If the company provides a working hitch , where Part A and Part B actually fit together , I will update my review . If I do not get help , I will return the whole thing back in the big box to Amazon.Assembly is about 10 minutes -LRB- seat , pedals , handlebars , all simple . -RRB-
 We are very disappointed with this product . We purchased our first one for our daughter and on our first ride , the wheel kept locking up and we skidded to a stop . Got it to unlock , and continued locking several more times . Took it back to Dicks -LRB- where we bought it -RRB- and they exchanged for another one -LRB- same model -RRB- , and the second one is doing the same thing . We are now returning the SECOND one and will purchase a different brand . We called Instep , and they were NOT helpful at all as to how we can fix the wheel locking problem . We also took the second trailer to a bike shop today after trying it out today and kept locking ... they tried fixing it and looked at it without success . Would not recommend this brand at all ... . our daughter is so sad that we could n't complete our ride she was so excited for !!!
 Our 3 year old daughter LOVED this and we used it approx . 4 times . On the last ride with her on it , my husband was just pulling in our driveway and all I heard was crash and then crying . I saw her on the ground , the bike broken apart and my husband standing there in disbelief . The bike literally just broke apart at a place where it should have been welded ... maybe this was welded wrong , but needless to say - this thing is not safe ! Imagine if it broke apart when crossing a road , not in our driveway !!!! Completely dissatisfied !
 Wanted to like it for the price , however had two major issues with it.First the screw hole , for the bracket that attaches the bikes together , was not drilled fully on one of the four holes.Secondly the attachment for the handle bars , that is supposed to hold it vertically in place , would not work . Called the manufacturer to get a relacement and that one didnt work either.All in all it is seems like it would be a good product if it were tested before being packaged , but just did n't trust it to use so it went back .
 Paid for next day shipping , but the item was missing the seat post clamp . So I wasted my money on express shipping . The `` quick connect '' is not all that quick and appears to be over manufactured . When you turn your bike the knuckle is too rigid and turns your entire seat.The rest of the components are under built . Disappointed with this entire unit .
 We just got this today . So far it looks good , the only problem I have is that it looks like it had been a return
 Nothing good to say about this product . Cheap quality . I put it right back in the box where it belongs .
 We bought this for my daughter to learn how to ride a bike . When she got on it all she could do was lean to left or right on it . It was terrible . I thought maybe she was n't straightening up so I asked my son to hop on to show her how to do it the right way . He of course knows how to ride a bike . Well when he rode it it would lean to the left or right and he almost fell off of it . I do not recommend this item to anyone . Complete waste of money and they wont even take it back to refund our money . Buyer beware .
 Package arrived in a heavily damaged box held together with a roll of packing tape . Left pedal was missing from order . Product itself is well built and my daughter is eager to try it out . The 800 number for customer service at WeeRide does not answer and you can not leave a message . If I can get them to express me the pedal I will revisit this review because the product itself appears to be quite rugged .
 Bought this locally today on sale.Like some of the other reviewers , I was also unable to get the pivot points to pivot . I finally was able to get the up/down pivot screws loosened , which amazingly actually have nothing to do with whether or not the pieces will move . There 's simply not enough clearance between the two pieces to allow movement . Some spray lube finally got some up/down motion -LRB- if you try hard enough -RRB- , but attempting the same `` fix '' on the side-to-side pivot resulted in two stripped screw heads and a 6mm allen wrench that 's now a little worse for wear . Also , the instructions failed to mention the 5mm allen wrench needed for the four bolts that attach the mounting point to my bike 's seatpost.I gave the WeeRide two stars because it looks nice and seems sturdier than the $ 20-more expensive Schwinn we also just bought -LRB- but actually turns when we need it to -RRB- .
 During assembly of this bike trailer , it was clear that there was room for quality improvements : - four screws and bolts to attach it to the main bike instead of a quick release requires 5 to 10 minutes and you better carry the necessary tools on your ride . - Precision was lacking
 I found the trailer very difficult to attach to my bike . After attaching the collar to the seat column of my bike , it found it impossible to simply slide on the trailer - it was just too tight . In the end I had to use a hammer to bang the two together , and I probably will never be able to separate them again . I 'll probably have to remove the collar from my bike if I ever want to remove the trailer . Poor manufacture .
 I should have known when two of the screws were not the right size to send this back . Instead I replaced them at the hardware store and assumed all was well . I 've had two issues with the tandem since . The bracket that attaches to the adult bike seat post has come loose on us twice ... both times resulting in minor crashes in which the tandem , on even wide turns , essentially falls sidewasy halfway to the pavement . We 've learned that we can use the tandem only if we tighten the bracket before each and every outing . That , however , leads me to the second point ... my son is rightfully reluctant to go for a ride ... exactly the opposite of what this product should be about .
 I almost lost my boat on the highway with this rack . I have a 12 1/2 ' flat water kayak . I was driving through a storm with a lot of cross wind . In addition an 18 wheeler was coming in the opposite direction . It is a 2 lane highway . The combination of wind forces bent the forward hull raiser stand and partially freed the front of my kayak . It was displaced about 1 foot . I immediately pulled over . -LRB- No following traffic fortunately . -RRB- I bent the stand back and tied down the boat again.Now when I use this platform , it is still a little bent and I do n't have complete faith in it . I always make sure the tie downs are very tight , but the boat tends to wiggle more now.I 'm going to replace it with a Thule that allows the boat to lie flat in its horizontal plane .
 I received Master Holan 's dvd on `` American Taekwondo '' forms . I thought that he just did the traditional Chang Hon forms in a way that was not traditional . I now realize that the forms are awful . That was that dvd and not this one . A friend received this and I watched it with him . This is awful . I am not sure what `` American Taekwondo '' but it is not traditional TKD -LRB- either ITF or WTF nor is it anything connected with the founder of TKD in America , Master Jhoon Rhee -RRB- . There are things that are just outright wrong on this dvd . One would be better served in seeking out the TKD dvds put out by Panther -LRB- found on the Century site or any other TKD DVD -RRB- . Do not waste time or money on this . I tried to do a search on Master Holan to see about his training but came up empty .
 I bought this watch two days ago - it arrived yesterday . I had ordered it kind of for the temp sensor . Everything I read said it was highly accurate . When I tried it out , the sensor registered my house -LRB- its actually 71 degrees -RRB- as being 84 degrees . Outside registered as 82 degrees when in fact it was a balmy 69 degrees . So does highly accurate mean 13 degrees off?When I looked at the manual I discovered the problem . Evidently , I you are WEARING the watch it wo n't work . You have to TAKE IT OFF . Whats the point of having a watch that tells the temp when you have to keep on taking it off ? Are n't you supposed to WEAR a watch ?! You would thing Timex would say SOMETHING about this on the description from their website . But no they do n't . You have to dig through page after page of manual . Also , WatchZone 's policy of returns would cost me 15 dollars - a THIRD of what I payed ! Also , they have this policy that you ca n't send back a watch that you wore at all!The other features are crumby , like those from a cheap 20 dollar watch . It is hard to navigate and set the time . DO N'T BUY THIS !!!!!
 So disappointed . What a huge let down . Yes , it looks good , but that 's about it . I did n't know you had to take the watch off to get an acurate temperature reading . How bizzare . Timex only mentions that in the fine print ? When it 's on your wrist , the temperature is about 15-25 degrees above actual . Additionall , the Chrono does not store intervals -LRB- no memory -RRB- . So , while your out jogging , take a big chief tablet and a yellow # 2 with you so you can write down your mileage times . I 've always loved my Ironman 's , but this time I wanted to try something new . What a mistake . Should have stuck with the original . Big disappointment , even if it did n't cost that much .
 I received this item and as a walked up to my back door I noticed box was open on top . I put the table together and was not surprized that parts were missing . I think the quality of this product is cheap for the price . I returned it via the mail in the condition I received it in .
 I bought this item for a gift.I do n't know if it 's usual these days that watches come as this one did . Being brand new , one would expect as minimum , that the exterior dial had a snug fit mechanism or tight stepping when rotating . Instead , some extra adjustment must be done to put it in any degree aligned to the internal dial . This , of course reveals a cheap construction and lack of craftsmanship quality . I decided to give it a go for not having a spare item to give.But that 's not all . As I mentioned , I purchased this as a gift . Took it on a trip abroad and gave it personally . To my disappointment , the person whom I gave it to , asked if there was any other small package containing small parts or any . He later explained that the bracelet did n't fit . That it comes fully extended out of the box and still did n't fit . Of course , he was asking for extra links for the bracelet.Usually , when you buy a watch , the bracelet is OVERSIZED right off the box , with plenty of links to fit any hand and flexibility to remove any of them , adjust the bracelet 's locking mechanism so you can set it centered under the wrist if necessary.Of course , I wish I could return this item for total refund . That is not possible for the item is in another Country and it would be a waste of time and money . Still , I 'm considering giving it a shot.Don ' t buy this product and steer clear from this brand . I mean , how is it possible that it does n't come with extra links for the bracelet ? The cheapest of them all do ! . I feel insulted and ashamed . I could go as far as to recommending never to buy watches online but I have done it before , no issues whatsoever . I do n't want to think that Amazon sold me a watch from which bracelet 's links were removed or some sort of a refurbished item labeled as new . Sadly , that 's exactly what it looks and feels like .
 I debated on a one star . As a signaling device for communication , it might work well . As an attention getter , no . I seemed to work , but low in volume when I tested under good conditions ... i.e. not an emergency , but one time I did need to use it when i was having equalization issues and could not continue to descend . Maybe 15ft away when was able to get it out and sound ... nothing , no reaction . fortunately they eventually looked around , but i realized that this device does not really signal well for assistance .
 front breaks with deffect , can not be ajusted . quality did not meet expectations . without some personal adjustments would n't be able to use it .
 The bike rides okay but it takes a while to install . This could take a lot of time if you do n't have the experience and tools ... one of my pedals fell off after just two weeks and the inner screw thread is kinda washed already and can not be put back on .
 Item arrived with terrible instructions full of typos and referencing parts that are never identified in the initial diagram . The Left peddle did not want to initially screw in . The kick stand installation instructions do not give any true install instructions that can be deciphered unless you have built a bike before .
 I do n't normally write reviews but I felt this bike really needed an honest review . So , here 's my experience ... The price was reasonable and the bike arrived quickly . Although , I did n't know until a week later because UPS and my apartment complex failed to notify me.The packing was good . The bike stayed protected during travel even though the box was clearly beat up.Assembly was n't too bad . The product manual that comes with the bike is for a vary basic model Kent mountain bike and has none of the components on the GMC . SO , there are no directions for the disc brakes , derailers , shifters , kick stand , seat or suspension . All completely different . Luckily , with a little common sense you can still assemble the bike . The front disc brake needs to be connected once the front wheel is on . No big deal , except that the crimp on the end of the cable came off and left a nice frayed cable . I recrimped it . I also had to bend the kickstand to get it to an angle that would actually support the bike . Assembly done , I went for a ride the next day.P.s . Check the tightness on everything factory assembled . I found this out the hard way.Ride one . About 5 miles on a mildly hilly asphalt/cinder trail . I rode around the parking lot a little to check the basics and found the front derailer does n't like to shift from 1 to 2 . No biggie , that 's a little adjustment . Up the first hill , I stood up to get a little extra power but the front suspension was so soft that as I cranked down the fork would dip and twist the wheel almost dumping me . Second hill I stood up again for added power but took it easy as not to buckle the front suspension again . This time though , the cheap plastic peddle split right down the middle.The ride comfort was mediocre . The saddle was not as forgiving as it looks . The rear suspension is a little soft for my 6 ' 1 '' 205lb body but is supposedly adjustable to 600 + lbs . However , I do n't know how to do that because the bike comes with the wrong manual.Ride two . Relatively flat , through the neighborhood . New resin peddles installed . Ride was going fine until again I made the error of standing up to peddle . Again the front suspension could n't take it and the front wheel twisted and I went down . When I picked the bike back up , I found that the wheel was pointing one way and the handlebars another . Hence the reason for checking all the factory tightened parts.I took the bike home and popped the top off of one of the front shocks to see if there was a place to adjust the tension , as a local bike pro suggested , only to find that 50 % of the shock is just an illusion and several inches down inside the rusty tube was a tiny little screw that did n't look like it would do much . So , I grabbed a drink and sat down to right this review . And yes , the inside of the brand new bicycle 's suspension is rusty.I 'm not gon na give up on it just yet but my happiness with my new bike is rapidly disappearing .
 The quality of the paint has gone downhill . My last one was great -LRB- stolen -RRB- but this one gets several chips just looking at it . Now it is a few months and the seat is junk !
 Pros
 We purchased this bike based on the belief that the frame was indeed a 26 '' frame . Why do so many people not know the correct way to measure a bike ? This bike has a 21 '' frame . That is the measurement of the seat tube from the pedals to where the seat post enters the seat tube . THAT IS HOW YOU MEASURE FRAME SIZE ... not by tire size , top tube or the down tube . I am 6 ' 7 '' and even though this is a good looking bike , it is way too small and the inaccurate description caused for a complete waste of my time . Amazon did do their part in allowing us to return the item .
 product came quickly enough but box was damaged . plastic hub over rear sprocket was shattered but rest of contents seemed ok . after removing bike and starting to assemble , had all kinds of trouble . The front brake line was not connected to the handlebar . called kent and they said they usually pay to have a local bike shop assemble and tune up the bike when purchased over the net . how come i did ` nt get this service when i purchased through you . another problem is the tech dept of kent is only open until 3:30 eastern time . i have a problem with shifting into highest gear on the main sprocket and work during the day so i ca n't reach tech support when i get home . i need help with this problem and i 'm not paying a bike shop to do it.all in all i would not recomend buying a bike this way and would tell anybody that if asked . i think going to bike shop or sporting goods store would be better . if you have a problem you can talk to them and have it fixed .
 The bike looks great , it has a decent height ; nonetheless , the shiftings are horrendous , the bike is heavy and slow , if you can get this for 150 then go for it , but it should be used for sidewalks or perhaps 25 mph on the road . Do n't even think you can climb hills with this bike , it 's literally impossible . I bought this piece of crap for commute biking and I 'm starting to think it was all a huge mistake . Sigh , just stay away from this one if you are using as a transport vehicle for work or schools specially if there are hills in your town . One other thing do not expect to go more than 35 mph YOU CA N'T
 On my first test ride in the backyard a piece of string got caught in the rear derailer and the entire thing broke . I know it was n't the bikes fault that I had string in my backyard but I do n't feel like it should have broken the derailer , maybe gotten tangled up or something but snapped in half ? If the derailer ca n't even handle a piece of string imagine what else it could n't handle . I got a replacement part from the company but it turned out that that this derailer is about a million time more complicated than your average derailer and I could n't figure out how to install it . I took it to a bike shop and even the guy there was puzzled , he got it working but told me it was n't a hundred percent . The bike worked okay for awhile after that and eventually I gave it to my little brother who rode it for a year or two until it broke again and the bike shop said it would cost more than the bike was worth to fix it . We never even rode this bike off road , I ca n't begin to imagine how fast it would break if you punished it at all . Do n't buy this bike , you will be sorry .
 I got same problems like one guy , so i just copy his review and added couple lines . The bike that came out of the box , it NOT the same what was promises on a purchase .1 . All bike is felling a part .2 . Strong aluminum wheel set featuring V-shape rim profile and high-flange alloy hubs but the actual bike does not have this , but simple rims3 . Brake levers
 I only ride the bike probably 5 times due to the cold weather . The first problem is the front suspension become loosen and shakes when I brake . And not too long later . When I 'm on my way to the class , the plastic part of the right foot pedal broke .
 ok so this will update this as i progress but as of now its looking a little bit of a shoddy product . assembled it and knew id have to adjust the disc so thats fine . whats not fine is im pretty sure the rear derailleur system is bent because it hits the spokes when on the high gear . havent looked at it in detail so maybe i can adjust but we will see
 This is a great bike ; unfortunately I had to go through some loops to get the actual bike . The bike that came out of the box from Amazon had parts that did not match the description on the Amazon site -LSB- ... -RSB- Here are some of the discrepancies1 . Strong aluminum wheel set featuring V-shape rim profile and high-flange alloy hubs but the actual bike does not have this , but simple rims2 . Brake levers
 We bought this bike for our son for Christmas , and on his second ride the gears stopped functioning properly . So , we returned it in exchange for another hoping it was a fluke , but the replacement bike did the exact same thing . We ended up sending it back as well , and just getting a refund . Amazon is great about returns though !
 I bought the bike 2 weeks ago only use is oneNow is making squeaky sound I do n't want to spend more money to Repiar is .
 This is a low end product . It will work at least for a while if assembled correctly but it is heavy and uses bottom of the barrel components . Obviously not everyone can go out and buy a better bike so if this is what you can afford then go for it . But be realistic as well . A bike is something that you may have for years to come . A better bike is just that - better , as in easier to ride , maintain , and have fun with . I learned my lesson . Now I 'm saving a little while longer for a real bike .
 When I first purchased this product for my son he was enthusiastic . Once we got it home , assembled it , and started riding , the enthusiasim quickly wore off.The derailers shift very sloppily , Had to replace them in week 2 , the `` shock '' is a cheap spring that has little or no adjustment -LRB- replacement ~ $ 200.00 -RRB- , the handle bar neck -LRB- 2 bolt clasp -RRB- comes loose during every ride , replaced that neck in week 2 with a 4 bolt version , the front shocks started sticking in the 2nd week , I 'm looking for new ones -LRB- avg cost ~ $ 200.00 -RRB- . Save your money and buy a more high end bike that already has these quality components , otherwise you will be spending lots of time at your local bikestore upgrading like I am .
 but arrived with lot of scratches and the bike peddles r too delicate , with normal use of 1 hr it is ripped from sides , the gears r not aligned and the front tire rim wobbles slightly
 Poor quality , squeaks on welds , breaks barely work , speeds skip . The lever that controls the front speed is made of such a soft metal that each time you change speed it bends so you 'll never be able to adjust it . Very heavy bike .
 Cheap parts , some rough finish parts , poor quality manual no real guide to asemble the bike , no technical support at all , I end up returning the bike , the front shifter never worked properly , I had to accept 85 % of the value due to amazon regulation. : -LRB-
 This bike is not worth $ 300 but if you could get it for the $ 150 some reviewers got it for that 's a different story . It 's heavy and very slow . It seems like I 'm using all my energy and going 2 mph . I usually ride a road bike 100 miles per week so it 's not me . I would go for a hardtail columbia bike or something for $ 300 if I could do it over . The suspension just adds weight and soaks up all the pedaling power .
 I got this bike and when assembled correctly it nearly killed me . It fell apart and just was a nightmare in general .
 This bike is a joke . GMC makes vehicles , not bicycles . Do not waste your time . The cheap mechanical disc brakes on this bike are no more powerful than a standard rim brake , and will rub no matter what . Disc brakes are nice , but only when you upgrade to the hydraulic systems found on high end bicycles . The dual suspension shock system on this bicycle will only bob and cause you to be less efficient . The single wall wheels will buckle or bend if you ever hit a rock or curb . Go to a bicycle shop and ask for help finding a bike that will best suite you . Trust me , if you ask a mechanic at a bike shop what they think of GMC bicycles , they will laugh and tell you to look in another direction .
 1 . The Bike arrived within 4-5 days , however upon purchase it ` s stated 1 day special delivery offer .2 . The fork came with manufacturing defect -LRB- not very straight -RRB- .3 . After two circles of test-ride in backyard , bubble popped out of the tire -LRB- side -RRB- which appeared to be a cut behind the rim . New tire cost 50-90 $ . The bike itself is alright , med-weight , descent response , suspension works good.DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE , if you are looking for a good quality ride.My last purchase from Amazon , i had extremely disappointing experience .
 I had used this product every now and then for a couple of years . I went for a ride a month ago and was pedaling very hard when there was a malfunction with the gears and the chain and something broke . That gear no longer works on the bike . Because I was pedaling so hard , and all of the resistance in that gear suddenly disappeared , I was off balance and took a nasty spill . I was lucky and will only end up with a few scars.I am tall and weigh almost 200 lbs . So keep that in mind if you plan on buying this . I will most likely still use it , but only to cruise around slowly with my wife and kids . I do n't think this bike is very sturdy and I do n't recommend it .
 When I looked at the reviews this one had the best so I decided it was safe to get my bike from this seller . Yes my bike came in on time , but the packaging could have been a whole lot better . The frame of the bike was scratched because of inadequate packaging materials . During the 2 hours of putting my bike together I noticed that the threading on where you screw in the pedal was defective . I then took the bike for a ride and the pedal came off . I figured I could buy some extra things to make the bike possibly work but in the end I figured it was not worth the hassle when I was sent a defective product . I had to take the bike apart and then drop it off at a UPS store . When I sent the bike back I was supposed to get my money back immediately . I have yet to see my money come back . Overall I am very dissapointed .
 Images on the web look great . The reality is very different : First impression
 I received the bike with the wrong wheel , tires , and brake discs . The bike was not ride able due to the incorrect brake rotor size . Kent International who makes the bike would not rectify the situation . I had to box the bike back up and ship it back to Amazon .
 I am updating my original 4 star review of this bike and downgrading to 2 stars . After spending an additional -LSB- ... -RSB- and 4 trips to a competent bike shop that deals primarily in high-end racing bikes and MTBs to have the shifters and brakes tuned , retuned and tuned again , to the point of needing to replace cables , it 's obvious the componentry of this bike is of very poor quality . I am a firm believed that you get what you pay for , and this bike certainly proves that theory correct . Fortunately , I saved the box and was able to pack and ship it back to Amazon.com for a full refund . I replaced it with a Gary Fischer costing twice the price , but it 's worth it for no headaches.My fiance and I are avid road cyclists , but wanted MTBs to ride on the trails . After researching MTB 's , we decided on the GMC Topkick for her because it received decent customer reviews and offered the most in terms of features , such as alloy frame , dual-suspension and dual disc brakes . We found other MTB 's offering similar features , albeit brand name w / higher end componentry , costing -LSB- ... -RSB- . At -LSB- ... -RSB- w / free shipping from Amazon.com , the GMC Topkick , manufactured by Kent Bicycles , was too good a deal to pass up . As others reported , the included assembly instructions are n't helpful as they are generic and not specific to assembly of this bike . Since the bike comes 85 % assembled , it was n't too difficult to figure out where things go , and if you 're unsure of something , there are plenty of videos available on -LSB- ... -RSB- for reference . After I removed all of the packing material and tape , assembly took about 2.5 hours , which included removal of the knobby tires and replacing them w / more street worthy tires . It 's built like a tank , and at 38 lbs , it 's heavy , but at this price point , that was expected . To shave weight , we 'll lose the kickstand , reflectors and change the seat post and saddle for alloy and a racing saddle . The front forks ca n't be locked down and there 's more plastic on the bike than I 'd like to see . I rate the quality of the componentry on this bike as marginal , and not great , so I do n't expect my fiance will get more than a few years out of this bike without having to replace something major , up to and including the bike itself . All and all , for the dollars spent , I think it 's a good MTB for recreational road and light trail use .
 this bike is not made by GMC ! Do n't let the stickers fool you . This is a KENT bike using GM logos and trademarks under license . The bike is pretty good for a KENT but first when i got it there were many adjustments to be made . like the gears , middle and rear , and the brakes . The rear suspension sucks . I do n't mean its defective , just the type of it , i feel as if there was no rear suspension at all . I gave it 2 stars because its pretty good for a KENT and all the extra options were pretty nice to have . -LRB- after a lot of work and adjustments -RRB- for a GMC this is very bad . i am very annoyed with it . If you are looking for a high quality bike this is not a good choice
 The bicycle seat is comfortable however it does not wear well . As you continue to use it the material will tear and as time passes the foam will show through . The covering on the seat should be made of a more durable material
 We bought this table for its light weight and size . We knew it will not be sturdy but it is a lot weaker than expected . The top is made of cardboard . You can not place heavy dish on it . I wish it can be somewhat stronger and still be light .
 The Bike arrived half assembled . All the back tire and structure came ready . After I finished assembling the rest , I was able to see that the bike structure has a problem , the back tire is not correctly aligned with the aluminum structure , so I ca n't ride as the tire is stuck in the structure.I called Kent Customer Service and they said they ca n't do anything , they do n't have any place to recommend to take it for service to take a look , they just want me to return it . So after spending my time to put everything together I 'll have to disassembly , but in a box and send it back to amazon!It 's a horrible bike , and a horrible customer service support . I do not recommend to anyone !
 This is not a review of this bicycle in particular but of Kent Bicycles in general.This was supposed to be a great Christmas gift for my son . I will condense the story so not to bore anyone . Took bike out of the box and began minor assembly -LRB- petals , handle bar , front tire -RRB- no big deal except there was a missing nut for the front wheel -LRB- now a big deal as the weather is beautiful and my son wants his new bike -RRB- -LRB- who wouldnt !?!?! -RRB- . Wait a week . Received incorrect parts -LRB- seriously ???? -RRB- . Installed a matching nut from a friends old bike -LRB- problem solved -RRB- . We took the bike outside , aired-up the tires and let him go -LRB- HOOORAY !!! -RRB- . He rode approximately 50 ft and shifted down to 1st gear to climb back up a small hill and a horrible crunching sound was heard . The derailer -LRB- sp ? -RRB- -LRB- the thing that changes gears on the rear wheel -RRB- caught on the spokes an now is twisted sideways and is lodged in the spokes . Called the manufacturer again . They said they would be happy to replace the damaged parts . I 'm not a mechanic no do I intend to learn to be one . I can handle some assembly but if the factory ca n't handle proper derailer installation , what makes you think I can ????? I told them this was not acceptable and I would like to return this bike for a replacement . The person on the phone said someone would call me back `` right away '' . They have my phone number and address and they have made no attempt to contact me as of this note -LRB- I have waited a week -RRB- . To sum it up , DONT BUY THIS BIKE !!! - DONT BUY ANY `` KENT '' BIKE unless you 're a mechanic and do n't mind fixing manufacturing problems .
 I too bought this bike and have had problems with the chugging of gears . My husband had to adjust the brakes a lot so that they would n't rub on the tires . I 'm not impressed with the quality of this bike and am sending it back tomorrow . I will buy from Dicks sporting goods where I 'm sure the quality will be a lot better .
 The tubes of the bike tires were all bad and I purchased two of these bikes . Both bikes are brand new and yet I have to go to the store and replace all of the tubes on two brand new bikes . Not happy at all with this .
 This is not as the same in the photo ! it is a knock off . it is close to however because I own the seat in the picture . But dont be fooled about what they are selling you !
 ONLY 9 OUT OF THE 10 LED LIGHTS ARE WORKINGAND THE ON-OFF SWITCH FEELS LIKE IT 'S GOING TO FALL APART ANY DAY .
 I need to send this item back because there are black stains across the neckline of the jersey . Please contact me as to how to go about returning this item for a new one .
 When the scope came in the mail it WAS NOT factory sealed . Everything look good unitl I took the scope to the range where I found that it was broken . The elevation adjustments were broken and would not aline on sight.I am upset the most the scope was not factory sealed . My guess prob an open item at some point and or someone broke it and returned it broken .
 I purchased two of this sweaters due to their excellent price . I am 6 ' 2 , 250 pounds and I usually wear XL , due to a prior experience with Adidas -LRB- they are smaller than other brands -RRB- I ordered a XXXL because they did not have XXL and to my surprise they are like a regular size medium , I had to give them to my wife . They look nice but their sizing its way off .

 I bought a Timex Nutrition Manager and it worked great for about 2 weeks . During that time I bought two more as gifts for my dieting buddies . None of them worked longer than 2 weeks ! I even bought new batteries trying to get them to work . The concept is great , but they do n't work so it is worthless . What a disappointment . I had always liked Timex .
 I bought this nutrition calculator to replace another I had for a long time but recently lost . I was disappointed that the new one is more difficult to use . Additionally the product seems to be defective . Sometime when the buttons are pushed it works fine but at other times nothing happens . I bought a new battery soon after it arrived thinking this was the problem but that did not fix it . I think if the buttons worked correctly I would be more apt to spend the time learning how to use all the features but right now it is just gathering dust . Sharon Houghtling
 the picture of the nutrition manager looked very easy and doable . But after I received it and tried to set it up it broke and was totally unusable . I was very frustrated with it and threw it out . I do not recommend this item to anyone who wants to keep count of food calories .
 I received this product and it did n't work properly . I believe it came with a near dead battery , as that plastic thing they have was n't really in the right place . The off-on button does n't work , the display is very small , only shows half of what is on the screen . Then again , that may be due to the near-dead battery . Although low battery does not show up on the display anywhere . I did n't save the original packaging ... I mean , who can save that type of packaging when it takes a jack hammer to open up one of those stupid plastic sealed boxes ? My only hope is to maybe try to get another battery , if that does n't fix it , then it 's in the trash and a lesson learned .
 This product is a waste of time , confusing and not easily used.It was bought and passed around the family . I have found none that cared for it .
 Junk this worked about 1 hour I even hit reset and lost the LCD screen . This is a brand new battery . Save your money and a headace . I am returning this for a full refund . JUNKTimex Nutrition Manager
 Ordered 3 of them . Only 1 worked on arrival . The one that did work was a real chore to use . Back to a written log for me . Amazon was great about returning them for me .
 Believe the other reviews ... . this product does n't work ... . I decided to purchase just to try , it was defective out of the box - which was a shame b/c it looked nice and would 've been great had it worked ...
 cheaply made dont work half the time .
 Worked great for the first few games but within a month it was already ruined . I would recommend trying a different ball .
 What I received was an official `` adult '' size futsal ball even though the online description and invoice specified size 3 . This ball will not work for my U-10 team and I 'll have to place another order to get the size I need . Very frustrating . The ball itself looks like a nice ball for an older child or adult .
 Placed order for one ball and got another totally different looking one . Sent back and got replacement . Got the same one that was wrong the first time . Picture on website not matching the part number so kept getting wrong ball . Decided to go somewhere else to order . Never had issue before but the customer service was very helpful in trying to get me the right ball but when not able they made sure it was pulled from the web site so it would not happen again and had no problems refunding my money . Only giving two stars for excellent customer service .
 These glasses are made out of cheap plastic and did not fit my face.Essentially a piece of junk , at a ridiculace price .
 I was so excited , until I saw the box . Then I knew I was in trouble.Its about the size of a bottle cap for a 3000 gallon coke bottle.It 's large - ridiculously , unusably largeIt 's so large , it wo n't fit on my range top - I would need 6 burners with no controls.It 's not seasoned but I was ok with that until I realized I ca n't season it because it wo n't fit in my stove , which is too shallow.Too big to fit on my large Big Green Egg.I have a normal sized kitchen , normal sized appliancesPotential alternative uses include a small neighborhood pool or in winter a semi-portable ice skating rink .
 The first time we used it the pan developed a huge crack . It is now unuseable . We did follow the directions to `` season '' the pan by pre-heating and putting oil on it .
 The skillet looks like it is just what I was looking for , but it came `` Cracked '' . This was due to the fact that it was poorly packaged , it was simply put in a cardboard box , with NO foam , newspaper , or bubble wrap , to protect it during shipment . I notified Amazon , and they promptly replaced it , with another cracked skillet.If I could get one , without a crack in it , I would give it 5 stars .
 I measured everything correctly . Set it up exactly how the instructions directed -LRB- EVEN DID IT TWICE , just to be sure -RRB- . The thing came crashing down on my head after two pullups !! Called for assistance , but got none . Got rid of it already , i have a tower gym on the way . Really wanted this product to work , but to no avail .
 Having fully assembled my Creative Fitness Door Gym and placing it in the doorframe to my bedroom , I began to place weight upon it while gripping the thin foam horizontal grips provided . The cheap grips slid off the horizontal bars with almost no force . After sliding them back on and placing my weight onto the Door Gym again , The attachment point on the lower bars began to bend almost to the point of breaking . I weigh 155lbs . Hardly a weight that should cause issues with a Door Gym made to withstand years of pull ups and the full body weight of individuals . I am disappointed in the cheap materials used to construct the Creative Fitness Door Gym , as well as the poor design which allows the bars to nearly break when any weight is applied . Do n't buy this Door Gym . You will not be satisfied .
 One of the descriptive lines for this item states `` Breaks down and stores in case for easy travel '' . Maybe my box was missing something , but this product does not include a storage case and would certainly not be easy to travel with . I travel for business every week with only a carry on bag , and to me , if something is designed to be travel friendly , that would mean that the bar has to fit within a normal carry-on bag . This bar is fixed in width at about 32 '' , making it too large for any carry-on bag . I found another similar product online that has a two piece bar that clips together , which is actually designed for travel.Otherwise , the product appears to be well made and would probably serve its purpose well for a non-traveling individual . However , I say this without having actually tried the product as it did not fit my doorways , even though they have 3.5 '' trim.In summary , I would only recommend if you have standard doorways with smaller trim and do not intend to use the bar to travel with .
 I loved the concept and was trying to have a chin bar for my daughter without drilling into the house . But my older house has thicker door jams , and this did n't work for me . There should be some door specs that would have made it easier for me to know in advance that this would n't fit . For newer homes , it is probably a great idea .
 This item was very easy to assemble and looked like it would be easy and comfortable to use -- but it would n't fit the depth of my door . There are no depth specifications on the box or inside in the directions that say that this item will NOT FIT a door more than 6 '' deep . It just says it will fit most residential house doors . Luckily , it was not hard to assemble , or de-assemble , and I will just return it . But please , put all specifications in the item information !
 The design of this bar has changed from what is described and what is shown in the pictures . Instead of one continuous bar that spans from jamb/jamb , there is now a very weak splice in the middle - only 2 '' of overlap held together by only two tiny machine bolts that do n't even go through the tubing , so they only bite the thickness of one side of the tube - that is NOT going to hold a regular-size person for very long . They mention a 300 pound weight capacity in the product description ... . this thing was buckling under my 140lb wife ! Instead of padded bar ends , there are two hard pieces of plastic that will damage your mouldings . The top spanner is a flimsy plastic box -LRB- that did not even have the bolt holes punched through , i had to drill them myself - come to think of it , i guess you are lucky it is flimsy plastic then , eh ? -RRB- . The fasteners are a joke - not even long enough to go through the material and hold both the lock washers and the terribly machined acorn nuts they sent.Looking at the user-generated pictures , i am sure this was once a good product that earned all of those 4 and 5 star reviews . However , they are now shipping an inferior product that is nothing like what is shown or described . Stay away from this thing .
 Before ordering the Door Gym I confirmed the measurements of my doorway and trim met the requirements , which it did . The Door Gym construction was good , felt fairly sturdy , and the assembly was quick and simple . Although the Door Gym fit my doorway it would not stay in place and would keep sliding down the trim . The Door Gym needs some rubber pads on each side of the support bar to press against the trim when the user 's weight is applied to prevent downward slippage . The included chinsey `` safety hook '' is more of a joke then a safety feature . It would most certainly rip out overhead doorway trim when the bar slips downward . I am a solid 190 lbs which is well in the support range for the Door Gym . My door trim is hard maple and I noticed a slight crunching sound while pressure was being gradually applied to the Door Gym during my attempt to hang from the bar . That was enough to convince me to stop using the Door Gym because I did not want to crack my trim or my dry wall . I returned the Door Gym and found an insane deal on the Proform Fusion 1.5 Power Towerfor 135.99 -LRB- total -RRB- which is an absolutely awesome product . The Proform Tower is construction of SUPER STURDY steel , does n't flex and small enough to fit in a corner . I figured if I 'm going to be serious about pull-ups I may as well buy good equipment .
 I fell off and almost broke my back . Only will fit certain size door frames . I sent it back and seller was nice enough to give a refund . My recommendation is the -LSB- -LSB- ASIN : B004FLECVS Perfect Multi-Gym Pullup -RSB- instead . For the same price you get a pullup bar that seems to be much more sturdy , well made and will fit just about any wall size you have .
 - the thread on the screw lose . i could n't tighten and hang it at my door properly . - pretty bad quality .
 I have been bodybuilding and doing powerlifting for years . Trust me when I say this product is not stable and for its price , you are better investing another $ 20 or $ 40 to get a P90x chin up bar . You ca n't even do a wide grip pull up bar with it . For general fitness I would say this product is ok but for those who have specific goals , this is not something you want to spend $ 40 + + on .
 I was shipped something that was not the product as described . It was just a few flimsy pieces of metal bars that are easily bent .
 The odds of this product fitting your molding and jamb size are slim , yet they do n't tell you this before you buy it . Once you get the product and waste your time assembling it -LRB- btw , the screws are too short and the instructions are worthless -RRB- , you realize that the width of the door jamb and the molding has to be almost exact or else the product does not work and is dangerous . THEN , you are faced with putting this odd shaped thing back in the box which is difficult and paying the $ 20 to ship it back ! Or , if you are like me and probably many others , you just say forget it and throw it out .
 Assembled easy for me , but does not fit all doors . Doors in my house have a lip over them , and doors at my school it just did not fit . So if you find a door it fits its great , if not your screwed .
 This worked for a few weeks then broke and damaged my door and injured my shoulder . Not recommended .
 The weight of this product is so low . What metal at such low density could be stable . Not sure what the weight limit is .
 I could n't even assemble it , it comes with 4 screws , 2 of them were too short to fit and hold it together.Definitely i do n't recommend it.too much money for no value .
 I ca n't explain why I chose to buy this product despite some of the negative reviews ... I should have listened.Quality is very poor ; I 'm guessing , like other reviewers , that the original product might have been high quality but that it has since been substituted for something much cheaper.This product seems to be some sort of generic , non-brand name item . The box it arrived in was a white sealed box with no branding , just a black line drawing of the outline of the exercise and in plain type , `` 053 3 IN 1 DOOR WAY EXERCISER '' . The only other identifier was a bar code sticker applied on top of another bar code sticker that I could n't see , with `` Creative Fitness Door Gym New '' on it . -LRB- See my posted product photo -RRB- . On seeing this generic box I started to have doubts , which were n't helped by the fact that the box was glued shut . I suspected that once I opened the box the likelihood of being able to return this item in `` resellable '' condition was nil , since I had to tear the flaps to open the box.The only literature inside was again a no-name sheet of poorly printed instructions . -LRB- See posted photo -RRB- . Major issues with the product were : Flimsiness of the brace piece . As already mentioned by other reviewers , this is a hollow light plastic box.To add insult to injury the bolt holes were not drilled through -- I had to drill them myself.Then , the bolts you are supposed to use on this piece are SO short that they barely reach through the bar . I was unable to get the nuts to catch any thread if I used washers -LRB- per the instructions -RRB- . I had to do without the washers in order to get the nuts on at all.Another design issue was tightening the nuts on the bolts that attach the curved pieces to the pull up bar . Not sure if I can describe this adequately , but the bolt holes in the curved pieces are set down in `` dents '' so that the nut is below the rest of the surface of the bar . THis makes it difficult to get a tool to fit around the nut to tighten it . I used a wrench positioned vertically to grab the sides of the nut to turn it , but even this is kind of limited , and I was not entirely sure I was able to get the bolts tightened enough.Poor quality materials . Some bolts barely long enough to hold , as mentioned above . The 2 short bolts that join the 2 straight pieces of the main pull up bar require an allen key . The provided allen key did not fit in the holes ... I had to use another allen key that I had.The pull up bar is two pieces joined together rather than a single piece . I 'm only 115 lbs . I do n't think the bar would actually break under my weight ; however after doing a couple of pull ups I noticed that where the 2 bars joined -LRB- with 2 bolts about an inch apart -RRB- there was already a slight angle ... the joined bars were no longer straight.The original product photos show what look like soft foam on the ends of the pull up bar . The product I was shipped has hard rubber pieces , not foam , so be warned that these might mark your door frame.I am not going to go through the hassle of disassembling and repackaging/returning this item , but I would strongly recommend AGAINST buying this product . There look to be similarly-designed cantilever pull-up bars that would give you more value for the money .
 It took some time to figure out which screws to put where but I got it . But still the directions should be better . After assembling , I could n't get this thing to fit my door . I have crown molding around it . And even though they show that on the brochure ... it does n't fit . It 's all based on some device that you can shove into the seal of your door . Well it 's sealed ! Even if I could 've gotten it in ... it still does n't lay against the door . I was really looking forward to this but within minutes of receiving this and assembling it I was disassembling it , sending it back for a refund , and writing this review .
 Yes , the instructions are laughably minimal , but they did exist which was better than other bars , but honestly these are VERY SIMPLE to set up . That however is not the issue . My girlfriend myself and her roommate all started p90x at the same time . I got this bar and they bought theirs for less at a certain megastore that starts with a W and ends in an ALMART for less money . Putting them together , my bar had a lot more flex to it at the joints , which is not a big deal because when loaded it did n't really matter . Now I used this bar for about 2 workouts , for both pullups and a pushup bar and in doing so I managed to bend the main bar , crack one of the acorn nuts , and dent a support . Also , the lack of other grip positions sucks for p90x . I ended up having to weld this thing together to make it worth using at all , and really the difference in price between this and other amazon bars is not worth the pain in the butt . Cough up the extra 5 bucks , you 'll be glad you did .
 Did anyone else receive this item without instructions or bolts ? I just spent 30 min on the phone with amazon to fix this issue , and they are going to have me return the item and will ship me another one . I am annoyed as it took me over a week to get the item , now I will have to wait at least 2 more weeks just because there were no bolts with it . The box is undamaged and does n't look as if it had been opened before .
 Dont buy it . Can not assemble , can not use . waste of money .
 The Door Gym and other items like it need to have way more specific descriptions of their requirements . This product would probably work great if you had the right kind of molding . The molding in my house is too tall and too thick for this product to work . Also , the walls themselves and therefore the door frame is too thick for this to fit.The only requirement they tell you about is the width of the door . I have many doors fitting the width requirement , but none fitting the molding requirements . Lots of houses in New England have molding just like mine . In fact , I 'm hard pressed to think of anyone I know whose doors this would fit . I think you need to have doors that have only the simplest modern-looking cheap molding in order for the Door Gym to fit .
 I definitely messed up on buying this . This device is NOT padded where it goes over the door frame , and therefore , it will dent or scratch the door frame with every pull-up . I bought it to take it with me overseas , and will not have time to return it . Instead , I have to tie around it two thick wool socks , so as not to damage my bedroom door.Since then , I have seen similar brands for this device that run for $ 18 at TJ Max or Big 5 and they seem to be better designed to protect your door frame . Avoid this brand .
 In terms of practical use in blackout/emergency conditions , this lantern did n't work well for me . Although the radio is very good sound quality , the lantern is n't very bright to light a room in a blackout , and also only lasts for 6 minutes on a 1 minute crank . Since we were out of power all night , it got really tiring to crank every 5 minutes .
 For the price , you would expect this to last more than one round of golf !!! It ripped by the 10th hole , do not reccomend at all !
 This is a terrible golf glove . I bought 3 and 2 of them fell apart before I finished a round of golf . The coating crumbles and then the vents in the glove become holes . A glove should last longer than a round of golf !!!! Save your money on this one !!! They have a manufacturing problem !! Good news to report -- The company is a reputable company . When I contacted them about their glove , they indicated that the seller must not have stored the glove properly or the gloves were too old or seconds when I bought them . They felt this could have accounted for the problem with the glove . They replaced my defective gloves . I love the glove and would buy it again .
 This rack was very inexpensive which was great , but when it got to me two of the clips were pulled off . Also the mounting hardware is just two hooks that sit on screws , it 's just not enough support when trying to pull the cues out . I like how it looks and the price , but that 's really it .
 very flimsy . disappointed with Mizerak . they are ruining their own reputation . they could have charged another $ 5-10 and made it little sturdy . i will avoid buying Mizerak products again.the one i got must have been returned by someone . . they stain had chipped off from several places - eventhough it was supposely brand new .
 Box arrived opened and all hardware installation was NOT included in box , along with the instruction . It appears that the box was opened prior and hardware and instructions was taken from my box to send to another customer who had the same problem ? Other than that I think it may have been a nice pool room addition . Will return item .
 It broke the first time I tried to put a cue stick in the holder . Then the second one broke also . Very poor quality ! Would never buy again
 This product was ordered in time for a party in a new rec room and came delivered in a quick efficient way however there was no hardware supplied though the box says clearly that all hardware included . Unable to put together without having to go to the hardware store to get needed supplies .
 This product is just what I was looking for . I wanted a inexpensive rack to hold both balls and cues . It was easy to put together but mine was missing a couple screws . Only thing I did n't like was the way it hooks on the wall . It is hung with 2 cheap hooks . I would have preferred some sort of slot system for holding it more securely to the wall .
 We placed the order over a week ago but it says it still has not been shipped ? Please let me know why and when it is going to ship . . Thanks
 I purchased this watch with a black face . Visibility is a problem . The dials and hands tend to blend in with each other making telling time difficult . The watch is on the small side for a man 's watch so the date and subdials are tiny . Setting the alarm requires unscrewing the stem.The alarm may be useful as a reminder but is too soft to wake up an average sleeper .
 The tail bone cut out is way too wide - I am 5 ' 8 ' and around 130 - this is made more for a large trucker in my cheek 's opinion . Amazon , however , was very efficient and courteous in the return process .
 I ordered the Park & Sun TS-CL Classic Volleyball Set and actually got something similar to the spetrum 2000 . The net that is advertized is one of the best net sets on the market which is why I chose it . I wanted the advertized net because the guides to hold up the poles have handles instead of metal rings and are easier to manipulate . I thought the price was too good to be true and I was right . It was in fact the set with guides with metal rings . Deceptive . I could have bought this net at a lower price if it was indeed what I had wanted . Please be careful when choosing this one .

 We bought this same Screen Tent 4 or 5 years ago . It was great , but it finally had to be replaced because pine cones fell through the screening and squirrels had chewed through some of it . Then we bought a 2nd one last year and the strapping rotted in just a few months . Both tents were set up in the identical location . When I called the manufacturer , I was told that it was sun damage . Well , duh ! When I asked why the 1st tent NEVER rotted they did n't know . -LRB- I 'm guessing that they must have thought it should have rotted ! -RRB- We decided to take a chance and get a 3rd one because it fits perfectly at the campsite we rent every summer . If the new tent lasts like the 1st tent , I would give it 5 stars . If it does rot after a few months , I would give it 1 star .
 What I did not like
 This is a piece of garbage ... the screens were torn in multiple places right out of the box ... we needed it for the weekend so we stitched it up ... you get what you pay for ... and this is junk . . too much p.i.a to send it back ... beware !!
 i did n't order tent in oct. i bought one earlyer in the year , the order was doubled so i sent it back
 This item is without a doubt the worst waste of money in my life . I threw it into the trash . I rate it no stars .

 I ordered this screen arbor June 18 , 2009 to go around a kiddie pool for my child to protect against bugs and to provide shade.It was easy to assemble and looked nice.Not even two months later three of the ropes that tied down the tent to stakes needed replaced as they had snapped , one of the top panels has fallen apart -LRB- I am assuming the `` sun rot '' I have been reading about in other reviews -RRB- , and the corners where the metal pieces you tie the tie downs to are attached are coming apart from the tent.A poor quality waste of money !
 We bought two Texsport Westview Screen Arbors in May , 2010 and they lasted two months . The material has ripped at the top and continue to separate at the seams on both of the screen houses . It is a shame because they fit on our deck perfectly . I guess I should have paid more attention to the other reviews .
 Do not waste your time . The chemical smell and taste of the mouthpiece is enough to make you vomit ! I tried numerous ways to remove the smell and taste but nothing worked .
 This item came missing the middle screw piece . Worked great until the end broke on the second day of use . I really did not expect much so not an overwhelming disappointment , but it was still frustrating . Aside from the missing piece , it was shipped and delivered quickly . I would n't waste time on this item again though .
 The plastic stinks so bad that I do not dare expose myself to whatever toxic noxious chemicals were used to manufacture it . I tried running it through the dishwasher but the stink did not dissipate . It was manufactured in China so minimal quality control . Do not buy this product . It is unsafe and unusable .
 I am reluctant to use this product because it was manufactured in China and it smells and tastes very bad . With the dubious product safety standards in China , I hesitate to fill my lungs with whatever is in the plastic that this is made of .
 I would have loved the Ultrabreathe ASI7492 Compact Breathing Exerciser except it was used and wet with someone else 's saliva !
 Everything is ok with construction . It looks durable and seems it should work.The only problem is the smell . It really stinks . It has a very strong smell of technical rubber . Such a smell is ok for rubber sole , for rubber carpet etc. . But not for device which should be put in your mouth for breathing through .
 NOT 10 x 10 AT ALL ! Shy of 10 Feet on every side by 1 Foot ! Poles are flimsey!Green is not ONLY green-has two green and two white top panels.Really was looking for ALL green ! Misleading .
 The only thing this pool table cover does is cover the pool table . It is however , not strong enough to last any length of time if you take it off and put it on frequently . It rips very easily , so I give it 2 stars only because it does fit and covers the pool table nicely .
 At least it keeps the dust off.This cover tore on 2 of the corners , the first week of having it . I 'm not even sure what caused it . . but it 's not like there is much involved in putting the cover off and on . The material is just so thin , it split so easily .
 This table cover is made of a very thin green plastic . I am very dissapointed with this item , because it is called `` Deluxe '' , so it made me expect something made with a better material quality . On the other side , it fits ok on my 8 ' billiards table .
 This product would probably work well if you have no pets , but our cat completely tore this up within a couple of days .
 I am updating this review . It lasted about a year then started tearing . It is a cheap cover , so if that is your goal , it is perfect . I recently bought a nice leather one.For the money this cover does the job . Only thing I do n't care for is the color . It is a turquoise green and it kind of clashes with the green cloth of the table itself . I would have preferred a grey or black cover . It looks a little wrinkled also but smooths out a little with use .
 I just purchased this board on sale for 44.99 . not at all worth the purchase . board looks aged and faded . would not recommend .
 Purchased this Gyro towable new . Only has a 200 lb limit so fuller-sized people ca n't ride it without possible damage . We found it either an `` all or none '' spinner . It pulls straight without spinning . Around corners , it is hard to get it to start spinning , but once it does , it spins very fast and somewhat out of control . Scared my younger child -LRB- age 6 -RRB- so she wo n't ride it anymore . Also around 4.5 foot long , so taller people like myself have difficult time staying inside tube .

 Similar to another reviewer , there were stain runs and it really could have used a 2nd coat of stain . The left and right doors did not -LSB- visually -RSB- match up at all -LRB- nowhere near as nice as the image on this page -RRB- . I was ok with this though , since it was to be used in a garage and exterior looks were not too important -LRB- would not hang this one in a nice home gameroom -RRB- . Probably would have painted or restained it had I kept it.Received with a bent hinge -LRB- therefore one door would close correctly -RRB- . Paper included with it stated `` Do not return to store '' and said to call their consumer affairs dept. ... so I did . I called simply wanting to get a replacement hinge sent to me . I was immediately told that NO parts were available and I would have to send the entire cabinet back to Amazon . I went to the manufacture 's website , filled out an online `` Parts Request '' form requesting a replacement hinge and also followed that with an email to the company . I have received NO response from the company -LRB- after 2 weeks -RRB- . Finally I am shipping back to Amazon for credit -LRB- will NOT replace with an Accudart cabinet -RRB-
 ProsStain job was good . Joint construction looked good -LRB- although I 'm no expert -RRB- . Felt lining inside is a nice feature.ConsThe right door 's natural closed position was still open an inch . The hinges did not appear adjustable in order to fix this . Then I noticed the other door was a bit loose and tried to tighten the hinge screws , but they just spun in place . Minor , but even when I forced the right door closed , the mid-line did n't match up and looked sloppy . I realize these are defects/damages which may not be present in a replacement cabinet , but there were enough problems on this unit that I was convinced to spend a bit more for something of hopefully better quality.One more thing , they do n't show it in the picture , but there is a pretty large `` Accudart '' logo glued onto the front of the left door near the bottom .
 My husband bought this for me as a gift - the logo was glued on the front of cabinet totally upside down - and the stain had drips and it was a complete piece of junk . I would n't pay $ 2.00 for this . SHAMEFUL - made in China - go figure .
 The Bushnell Sentry 12-36 scope provides fair views at 12x in good light , but at higher power the eye relief diminishes rapidly and it becomes unusable to someone wearing glasses and difficult to use without glasses . I was looking for an easy to carry alternate for my 82mm Kowa scope . I intended to use it on a gunstock mount or monopod to get quick views of birds that were too far for my 10x binoculars . I did not find it suitable for this purpose . It comes with a very practical `` scope glove '' , a soft case , and a hard case worthy of a much better instrument . Perhaps Bushnell would have a better product if they had omitted the hard case and spent the money to provide better optics .
 Although it tells time well enough , and has features I want like luminous hands and date , I think this watch is overpriced and poorly designed . It has several annoying features , such as its thickness , almost 10mm . The hands are very skinny , and for some reason there is a triangle at 12 o'clock which I always mistake for the minute hand at first glance . The second hand is black which makes it hard to follow if you are timing something . I am looking for another watch , probably a Swiss Army or a Skagen , both at half the price or less .
 The dart board itself is fine . Although , the solid pine cabinet looks good on the site , the construction of it is of very poor quality . The back is akin to a a thick particle board , but is n't , and is stapled to the sides of the the cabinet . The top has pulled completely away from the cabinet . The box that the dart board was mailed in was sturdy and undamaged . I had n't opened it to inspect the purchase until it was opened by my husband on Christmas morning . I did n't see any reason to , as the box was completely intact . I was somewhat surprised to see that the dart board was not secured in anyway , by either some padding or tape to keep the doors from pulling away from the base of the cabinet . You guessed it . One side had completely pulled away from the base , hence the screws were stripped from one of the hinges . All in all , I would probably not recommend the product .
 Without rough use , the rubber has already started separating from the wooden paddle in a couple of weeks .
 I live in Central Texas and go through one of these floating chlorinators every 8-10 months . The lids shatter from the intense heat but the manufacturer does n't sell the lids by themselves . I 've seen these advertised as , `` Heavy Duty '' . Trust me , they are more like , `` Light Duty '' .
 I bought this to add to my USMC apparel -LRB- former active duty Marine , 1stMarDiv -RRB- and was disappointed to find the color was more of a mud brown than OD green . I returned the item - the first thing I 've returned in the 6 years I 've been a customer on Amazon . Rather than receive the full refund , I was deducted around $ 4.50 for a `` restocking fee . '' I thought I bought a piece of clothing , not a DSLR camera or HDTV . It may be less than five bucks , but I do n't understand the rationale behind a restocking fee for an item that most likely was re-folded due to item transport , put in a plastic bag and set on a shelf . I literally wore the item once for the duration of around ten minutes without leaving my home before realizing it was n't what I was hoping for . So , after spending $ 6 on shipping and then an additional $ 5 to ship it back , I get tacked on an additional fee that was essentially $ 15 dollars down the drain . I can at least take some solace in knowing I supported the United States Postal Service with this transaction , so I 've got that going for me ... which is nice.Not a good experience , but what can you do ?
 If you want a thermometer that looks good this is it . However , if you want it to provide you with an accurate temperature you 're out of luck .
 I 'm not real happy with my experience . The watch looks pretty nice , and I had another momentum watch I liked very much . This one , unfortunately , had the bad habit of its crown unscrewing . I would crank it down as tight as my fingers could get it , and low and behold , a few days later I would notice it had come completely unscrewed again . I should have warrantied it at this point , but I did n't get around to and of course it eventually ended up in the shower with an open crown . The watch came with a big warning card instructing me to `` check the crown every time the watch gets wet '' , which makes me wonder if this might be a common problem . I do n't think I should have to check my waterproof watch every time it gets wet . The stupid thing should just be waterproof .
 1 . Watch was not shipped from the vendor shown on Amazon - therefore I now have no idea who I actually bought the watch from , and have nobody to complain to or get a refund from .2 . Ad for watch said `` water resistant to 30 meters . '' In actual English , those words absolutely mean that the watch should withstand submersion to approximately 100 feet -LRB- 30 meters -RRB- underwater , which is approximately 4 atmospheres of water pressure . NOT ! When I complained to Amazon that the watch fogged up and stopped working when it got LIGHTLY SPLASHED while doing dishes , my complaint was forwarded to an entyirely different watch vendor , who proceeded to tell me that `` water resistant to 30 meters '' does not actually mean what the definition of those words says it means ; and that if I wanted a watch that would withstand submersion in water to a depth of even ONE INCH I have to buy one that says it is water resistant to 6 million meters or some bull-cra * like that . Total hype-job . Words have actual meanings , and they are not subject to be changed by some commercial enterprise who wishes to mislead its customers . But that 's what happened.BOTTOM LINE
 i have yet to receive my auto visor it says it was supposed to be in the package with the sunglasses but it never came i am very disappointed with the service i have received
 Purchase price and quality do n't line up ! -- we used these paddles for one event and there is already a big ding in the rubber part of ONE of the paddles . I was surprized because I did n't order the cheap brand -- as we wanted these paddles to last a long time . Unfortunately , that is not the case ... I was disappointed in the quality of this paddle for that reason -- otherwise it handles great and love the orange balls -LRB- easier to spot when they fly off the table onto the ground -RRB-
 These paddles do n't have cushion layers that you would normally expect . They hit the ball somewhat hard and loud . I would suggest looking for other products .
 Low price -- low quality . I love Stiga , but you get what you pay for .
 Of the dozens of shoe and leather care products I own , Urad is the worst . It is not a moisturizer or conditioner , and it is not a wax . It is more of a glue-like product that dries with an artificial hard shine . It does not condition because it has no oils . If you apply too much , the finish will be sticky and can not be wiped off . It discolors lighter colored leathers and makes them darker . Once you apply Urad , the leather no longer takes well to real conditioners and waxes . Not only that , it is more expensive than almost any other polish I own . Bottom line , get a real leather conditioner and a real polish.Good conditioners
 I ordered Clear several months ago and they sent me black . I did n't open the container until today and noticed the contents were black . I checked the container and the color is not written on the container . I remember my receipt from this company stated that I order 2 clear 200 ounces and now I 'm stuck with the black since I destroyed my receipt last month.Las Cruces , NM
 I bought this for one of my children but it is a bit heavy and too spongy , severly lacking speed . I also bought the Stiga Champion which is lighter and faster . I would spend $ 6 more and get a paddle which helps play instead of hindering it .
 This item just does n't work . Go to a store & try similar items . I paid $ 60 with free shipping . I 'm happier with a $ 5 sports watch from the store . The GPS might work in Iowa , but it will never give correct distance or speed . When I stop it picks up speed & stops 10 seconds later . You could guess better than this things works & thats if you get a signal . I not a mad customer just telling you that you 'll be mad at yourself for buying it .
 I used a prior bag from this manufacturer for many years . When the clasp started to go , I bought this new bag . The bag has a nice shape , good strap and buckle . However , the workmanship of this bag is most disappointing . One of the seams opened within days of use because it simply was not correctly sewn .
 This was purchased direct from Amazon . Although the product quality and shipping was good the color was wrong . A return was to much of a hassle so they gave me a 20 % credit . I was satisfied with the arrangement .
 I ordered 2 of these shirts assuming they would be green as pictured - nothing on the web site indicated it would come in another color . When I got them . . they were purple . These were for T-ball and did not match the team shirts . Called the customer service department to get the RAN number to do the return and got voicemail . Left a message explaining the situation and that I needed a RAN number to do the return . No one ever called back . I 'm Very disappointed all the way around .
 I consider myself very generous to give it 2 stars , it does n't even deserve 1 star . I did n't try her first hot combinations DVD . But I decided to buy that one . And then I decided to return it and tell everything I feel about it , so others would be careful . Overall , I am NOT wealthy to waste $ 27 into something that does n't satisfy me.Briefly , she offers very few moves , the combinations are not enough , No breakdown of the choreography , and useless stuff addedthe DVD consist of 4 sections , the first one is the 6 combinations
 la calidad de este modelo no me gusto primeros bolle que uso y se descolora y pela la montura si no fuera por los cristales diria que es una imitacion

 It is an all around good scope but is not easy to focus at all .
 the worst compony iv ever had too deal with they cancled my order two times then finaly got it rite .
 I have a small back yard , and my husband and I love to sit out there in the evening and chat , or read a book . Unfortunately that rest and relaxation has been taken over by mosquitoes ! I bought this product after reading some reviews and thought I 'd give it a try . Having multiple dogs , it was very important that whatever I put back there be safe for them , too.We sprayed the yard as directed , but noticed absolutely no decline in the number of blood sucking monsters lurking about . The seller did provide speedy delivery , and it arrived on time , unfortunately the product simply did nothing for our mosquito problem .
 Ordered watch for my wife . Watch was not running . Probably dead battery . It also looked like it had been worn for some period of time before . Requested replacement online , but no paid shipping label -- have to ship and insure yourself even though defective . Used the Amazon contact/call feature but because of the price , no one wants to deal with this . I was told to send the watch back using the label generated by Amazon that did not include postage or insurance and then call back to get reimbursed for the postage . They were n't sure whether Amazon would reimburse the shipping insurance . Save yourself the hassle and pay an extra $ 100 from a watch company . All that said , I have a TAG Calibre S and absolutely love it . Great watch .
 plassssstikThese glasses are very cheaply constructed . Being cheap and poorly made , they never fit correctly and we not adjustable in the way that better sunglasses are . Save your money and buy a nicer pair . I will not be purchasing another pair
 The fact that the sunglasses came much sooner than expected means nothing considering the quality of them . I unfortunately failed to read the reviews so purchasing these sunglasses was a mistake on my part , but the second I took them out of their case the right lens popped out and the frame was disconnected . I definitely agree with the other reviews that these are costume quality glasses and definitely not worth the price .
 These are cheap sunglasses . Fine for a costume but I could n't imagine wearing these for any period of time . Not very high on the quality chart
 The price is low but the quality is the lowest you can imagine.Military standard ? If the militaries start to wear those glasses then they 'll become all blind in a short time .
 HUGE lenses , and they 're made of plastic . But for the price ? Tough to beat for a one time use -LRB- costume -RRB- .
 The blade looked fine however , when I put it in my clippers it seemed dull it wouldnt hardly go through my dogs hair at all and they are Shih-tzu 's so it should it 's not like they have tough hair or something . . not very happy with blade
 It seems to do a good job at blending between the 2 blade and the 3 1/2 blade but i can never finish because its the only blade that I have that customers constantly complain about feeling like it pulls and yanks hair.Maybe i got a defective blade.But , I keep it oiled and cleaned.It strted pulling hair from day one .
 These blades got rusted in 2 months from purchase , I live in Panama the climate is pretty humid ... Previously I have used Oster blades without hassle ... these ones are not really worth the try .
 This will probably work great if I ever get the second screw out of it so that I can attach it to my clippers . This really should n't be that difficult , and at this point I 'm about to just throw it away and buy another one .
 Im a barber and use the blade every day . The blade is so sharp that it hurts the customers . It can even prick into the skin if pushed hard . Dont recommend to any other stylist .
 The blade did n't perform as expected . My dog is a Pomeranian with fairly long and dense hair and I expected to use this attachment clip to give a decent haircut without scalping him . I knew the clip that came with the Andis clipper I bought cut the hair very short and was looking for a somewhat longer cut . Unfortunately this clip did n't work on my dog 's hair at all . Ended up using the clip that came standard with the clipper unit -LRB- 3 mm -RRB- to do the job which scalped the dog . The kids were terrified !
 Another waste of money . This blade wo n't even get into the pets fur let alone clip it . It 's a Shih Tzu and his fur was only 2 '' long and the clipper blade would n't do a thing . Very disappointing but so are the clippers .
 These are not nearly as good as the ones you buy at petsmart . I 'd rather spend $ 5 more and get good quality than not get as many cuttings out of them . Im going back to pet smart.Seller did fine as far as shipping on time .
 The Andis company told me this was the one for me . But theirs was too expensive so i bought it from you . It did not fit my shaver . There was nothing we could do to get it to fit and actually shave the dog . Too sad . So , I 'm sure it works fine on the right machine .
 Well , this looks nothing like the review I wrote at the time I bought the reel . I used to be a big penn fan , but now I 'm sticking with shimano or maybe even branching out and trying some other brands . This reel is not all that smooth and does n't really cast that well for the price . It 's probably comparable to most $ 30-50 reels at best in my mind . The rest of the price is for the name , which it seems has become the selling point of these reels over the actual quality . The screw that holds the bail on this reel broke in half and the reel is basically worthless to me now unless I can find a way to get the broken off part out and feel like spending $ 5-10 on a new screw from Penn. . Already bought a $ 30 shimano to get me by for the time being and I 'm not sure it was n't at least an even trade . Disappointing product to carry the Penn name .
 The 420 Ssg spinfisher Graphite reel bar code 3132404203 is a reel with manufacturing problems . As manufactured it is missing part 95B Penn # 095B420 , which is a retaining plate , and 46B Penn # 046A420 , which is the retaining plate screw . Because these parts are missing the `` Rotor Cup Nut , '' comes loose such that thr entire rotor comes loose with first symptom of the problem being the bale does not function properly . Penn warranty person told me to bring it back to the store I purchased it from , yet this reel was part of a custom built rod set . I will try Locktite , if that does not work I will design a retainer plate , and worse case will be to epoxy # 38 , penn part number 038420G rotor cup nut to the # 19 0019 420 G pinion . I should have purchased a Shimano Stradic Ci4 , 1000 . Retailers should note these problems with this reel .
 The handle does not work . It does turn but it does n't move the spool , brand new reel right out of the box . Do n't buy it , avoid penn reels , their quality is going down the drain every new reel they make . Their new name is penny reels and fishing rods because that is what they are worth ...
 I though penn reels were made in USA . I have several and they are all made here . No more penn reels for me .
 I squeezed out all the product I could into a 2 ounce plastic bottle to be able to get through TSA screening . That it should do , BUT LESS than 2 ounces came out . See two photos on product page
 I am in MOSQUITO CENTRAL ... with West Nile Virus at the peak of its season & when I applied this , I was bitten at least 20 times in 10 minutes.I looked for a expiration date but there was not one.I am sure this is expired or it would have worked.This was a waste of money & now I have to pray those bites are not from infected mosquitos.West Nile is DEADLY !!!!
 Product worked well . No mosquito bites . Rubbed lightly on skin and clothing . Pump spray would probably work well also .
 The cocks broke after using them for about 10 minutes . Not worth the money .
 I bought these to play with my son , who has just turned eight . There were two problems :1 . In the picture it looks like the shuttles are different sizes , which I took as a good thing for you can then play in different humidity/wind conditions . However , all three shuttles were the same size .2 . All three shuttles are now broken and we have n't played with each one for more than 30 minutes . And imagine the power of our hits - I was playing with an 8-year old . I remember playing with yonex shuttles in a club , where full-grown men would pound the shuttles for a couple of hours.Don ' t buy these !
 I have always loved this pullover and used to buy this item every few years because I would literally wear them out . Now I understand why Kohls has discontinued selling this item though , because Columbia keeps making this item cheaper and cheaper . I recently bought two to replace the ones I had . They now cost more and the material is pretty much see-through -LRB- just hold it up to the light -RRB- . I have previous versions of this item and you can definitely see how much cheaper they 're being made . The thin fabric makes the collar look terrible and the item just sort of hangs on you . As well , a few washes pretty much destroy these `` new '' versions . Columbia please make these the way you used to even if they cost a few bucks more - your reputation is at stake !!

 bought this thermometer for a gift opened the package and it is broken or something - hoping for a smooth return
 I honestly thought this would be shadowboxing drills , it is not . Its just them talking about shadowboxing and trying to hock their products , was not worth the money at all . `` You can add dumbbells to shadowboxing or many of our other ringside products . '' ... wow , thanks , totally worth 15 bucks .
 I bought several of these mounts and installed them without problems UNTIL the other day . I was mounting one lower ring mount on my Savage 93 bolt gun until it tightend up -LRB- the screw did -RRB- but noticed the mount still was loose . The other mount did n't have that problem and tightend up properly . I switched off the mount with another one -LRB- same type -RRB- and it did tighten properly.Being curious , I bought a different set of rings -LRB- Leupold Rifleman series -RRB- from a local gun shop and tried them . Everything worked fine and I noticed that the Leupold rings were beefy compared to the wimpy Weaver ones . The small clip that tightens the ring to the rail is thin on the Weaver and heavy duty on the Leopolds . Hmmmm ... . Well I ditched all the Weaver ones and changed everything over to the Leupolds . I hear horror stories about bad scopes , inaccurate barrels , my gun not shooting consistantly straight , ect , and most of the time it 's a bad scope mount or improperly mounted scope . I ca n't trust these rings at all.Look at the picture of these rings and notice the thin rectangular piece of metal underneath the tighting screw . Then compare it to a Leupold `` Rifleman series '' ring and tell me which one do you want on your gun.Price difference is twice for the Leupold but $ 18.00 for the good one vs $ 9.00 for the cheap one should n't be a show stopper . Weaver does make higher end mounts but this line is marginal at best .
 They need modification or shimming to fit securely and not rattle around . The other problem I had with them is the fact that even though the package claims that they will fit a scope with a 40mm OBJ lens they did not allow enough clearance for my scope . Now I have to find another option for scope rings .
 Description states these rings will fit up to 40mm obj lens , this is n't even close to fitting my Barska AC10326 Red dot with a 25mm objective and 30mm tube . The rings are far too small .
 I ordered two badminton racquets and they arrived on time . However , when I opened the box , one of them was warped ; it was bent at an angle . I could n't straightened it . My friends and I still went ahead to play with the bent racquet but it was just silly . I should return it but the cost of shipping and the time to do this just does n't add up . In addition to that , the materials are cheap . You 're better off buying a kid 's badminton play set at the CVS drugstore for just 10 bucks !
 it looks nice but does n't feel right when using it , this is an amateur copy and only good for kid 's use . not recommended for serious players .
 These rackets are very similar to those you 'd find in a set of four with net / birdies etc. . I previously purchased a couple of Wilson rackets and was hoping to match the quality , while saving $ 3-4 each on these Halex rackets . I was mistaken and wish I 'd spent the extram money on the Wilson rackets . Shoddy quality - the head on one of the rackets has already become loose from the handle and the netting is very loose . Just looking for some decent quality rackets to play with in the yard . These are fine for that purpose , but overpriced .
 Bought for my Glock 39 . It slid all around and did not feel secure . I sent it back .

 We purchased this product to use on our deck for the summer . The package was complete , with everything we needed to assemble the arbor , but it would have been nice if everthing fit as expected . I always thought 10x13 was the same everywhere , but this 10x13 is only 10x12 .5 . We had a terrible time putting the framing together , and it was impossible to attach the plastic tarp to the frame , without figuring out our own way to secure it . Once secured , the framework bows in several places , and it looks terrible . We had such a terrible experience assembling this -LRB- although we 've put one up each summer for the past 8 years -RRB- , that we were not going to return it , and go through having to erect another . We are , however , keeping our fingers crossed that it makes it to September , like our other arbors have done in the past .
 This is an overpriced piece of junk . The canopy is less than two weeks old and the poles have started to rust . The directions to assemle are about useless . The guy ropes -LRB- STRING -RRB- and stakes are of no use . Please spend a few more dolars and buy a canopy from one of your local `` super '' stores . I have done this and I can now see the product and return it easily if I do not like it .
 It is a terrible tent . No real instruction and it does n't hold up at all . Very hard to put up and the fabric does n't fit the frame .
 After I opened the package , I realized that it 's NOT a brand new item . The metal tubes are rusted and the top has irregular pattern . Since it 's NOT easy to return , so I had no choice but keep it.I will not buy anything from Amazon.com again .
 I have two different Mark 3 's and they both do not fit the holster well at all . Had to loosen the trigger guard bolt all the way and I still have to jam the pistol into the holster . The opening where the trigger guard goes in is now completely out of shape .
 Do not be fooled . This belt is rubbish and was useless after one training session . Would barely serve as a decoration .
 The belt is very light weight and not a solid good belt for professionals . I would not buy this item again and have no use for it .

 look this gyro is o.k. but the powerball is better , and by powerball i mean the 250Hz powerball from rpm ltd. .
 If I 'm not mistaken the item in the picture is solid black . The glasses I received have a clear tint at the bottom which I was not happy with . Will be returning this item . They did fit nicely , but as I mentioned I wanted solid black all around not just on 3/4 of the shades .
 The glasses I received have a clear tint at the bottom which I 'm not satisfied with . I will be returning these back .
 this was a complete buyers remorse purchase . I have never had such thick greasy filmy glasses . do NOT buy these

 For the price this product is very disappointing . It is extremely thin and the quality of the print is less than stellar . It will likely go in the garbage after the first wind next fall . Do n't waste your money !
 This flag is the lowest-quality garden flag we 've ever had.The fabric is very thin -LRB- I can see through it -RRB- and has a paper-y feel to it . I 'm guessing it 's only going to last a couple of months.The design is bright , but it 's -LRB- a -RRB- printed , not appliqued and -LRB- b -RRB- on one side only.Finally , all of our other garden flags are 13 '' x 18 '' -- this one is 11 '' x 15 '' and it just looks small on our pole . Admittedly , it says the size in the description , I just did n't realize it was smaller than `` standard . `` This was a real disappointment . I 'm giving it two stars as the description is n't technically incorrect ; I just expected it to be of higher quality .

 Because you ca n't give negative stars , I 'll give this product one star . I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.I 'm glad this product was cheap , because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought . Everytime I swing on it , I feel it creak and wobble . I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser . I 've been useing it for a few months , and all its done is make me feel akward.Don ' t buy this product if your plus size . If your not plus size , go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing . If your are of plus size , order THE BEAN full body -LRB- I just did -RRB- .
 While the exercise itself is affective in targeting the lower ab area , it construction is less than sturdy . I weigh 165 lbs and managed to crack the machine in less than 2 mos , now residing in some garbage dump some where . If you looking to waste money than this is the machine for you .
