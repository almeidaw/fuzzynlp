 I am always a little sceptic about buying shoes online , but these fit great , are original , and look good ! I strongly recommend them .
 Got theses for My wife for a modeling job she had ... . She has tons of shoes that kill her feet and after shooting in for a few hours her feet were still feeling good ... . She is normally a 5.5 and She got a size 6 and they fit her just slightly loose . Shipping was fast and as expected
 The shoes arrived very quickly and the correct size . They are very comfortable despite being taller of a heel than I expected .
 I ordered a size 9-10 and the shoes I got were labeled size 10 . They were a little big , but I made them work . Super cute and fun shoe , my friends loved them .
 I really like those shoes , perfect for my Gothic Lolita 's outfit . Of course , they hurt after a few hours , but I already knew they would.Also , I usually need size 9 , and that 's the size I commanded those shoes , and they perfectly fit my feet , so do n't listen to people saying to buy one size higher . : -RRB-
 This shoe is a fun and flirty way to go out to the club or just for halloween , either way they are awesome .
 The shoes I got were the pink glitter ones . They were true to fit , perfect for my Halloween costume and very comfortable . I gave only 4 stars because they were a little stiff and the glitter caused some snags in my knee high stockings . Overall , highly recommended .
 MuCh more comfortable than they look . Everything old becomes new again . Platforms are in once more .
 very fast delivery , nice construction , duriable sole , nice sizing , very happy with my oder
 I love to go out and dress up with these shoes on ! They are pretty comfortable and fun !
 Perfect for many costumes and not all that uncomfortable . Very happy with the product and price !
 I 've been wearing these for ages . They 're super sexy , but the sizes are a little weird . I 'm an 8 1/2 , I have to get the 9 -LRB- they do n't carry half sizes -RRB- , and they 're a bit big . Great BANG for the buck though ; -RRB-
 I loved the shoes . Unfortunately they do n't have half sizes so mine did n't fit and I had to send them back , so if you ca n't decide just go with a bigger size .
 This is a great pair of shoes and also fun to wear with a lot of compliments .
 These shoes are to die for . I ordered them at 7pm and they were on my door step at 3pm the next day ! Great fast shipping and amazing quality for what I paid .
 I LOVE disco , and these shoes really do complement any outfit . I was afraid that they would be difficult to walk in but they really are n't ! I also read the reviews that if you are a half size to just order the next size up -LRB- since there are no half sizes for this shoe -RRB- but I ordered a 6 , I am a 6 1/2 and it fits snugly -LRB- which is how the shoe is supposed to be -RRB- . Great product , I will probably be buying another one of these in pink soon !
 I hate you guys , seriously ! No , not the product ! The shoes are absolutely wonderful . No , no , I hate the people who reviewed these shoes.Why ? The majority of the reviews say to order smaller than you normally would if you are a half size . And , well , I did just that and the shoes do not fit ! I repeat
 As a crossdresser , it is extremely hard for me to find nice heels in a womens 13.5 that do n't look like old lady shoes ! These are fantastic , comfortable , and very sleek looking !
 I ordered 2 pair of these one for my wife and the other pair for ME ! My wife was a sexy beer girl and I was a French Maid !! as a man who has never worn high heels these were very comfortable ! In fact my wife kept teasing me that if they fit so well I should do some housework in them while in my French Maid outfit ! So since I 'm not the kind to turn down a challenge I did !! Lol . We both had a big laugh!These are a great product !!
 I was worried that the shoes would be an ill fit . When they arrived I found my worries were for nothing because the shoes were true to size , not too snug or loose . The material is good , and the heel is strong ! You do n't have to worry about it snapping off if you have to do a lot of moving around -LRB- which happened to a pair of costume shoes I bought from a different seller ! -RRB- they hold up fine . Highly recommended to break in the shoes before the event you plan to wear them for though otherwise you 'll be sore all day . :-RRB- Also as other people have mentioned if you are a half size I would suggest ordering a size UP instead of DOWN .
 I originally got a matte-finish pair about four years ago from another website the name of which I ca n't even remember . I wore them constantly and after three years they were showing it . I searched Amazon and lo and behold these came up -- identical except for the finish -LRB- I did prefer matte but could n't find it here -RRB- . These are extremely easy to walk in because the platform means your foot is really not under stress , and the heel , while high , is sturdy . Every time I wear them , with is pretty much every day except on weekends , I get told how awesome they are . I even wear them to work . They are just the right mary jane look with the height to make them sexy . The only thing I do n't like is that the shiny finish means you have to be careful not to scuff them -- but I learned that the hard way with the old pair , so I am with these . I 've had them almost a year and only managed to get a small scuff on them , and like I said I wear them virtually daily . Oh yes -- I ordered my size , 7 , and they fit fine .
 it os very comfi . and good , i will never buy other kind.i gat it from amazon in relly goog deal . .
 it os very comfi . and good , i will never buy other kind.i gat it from amazon in relly goog deal . .
 Initially , I thought shoes were a little tight -LRB- hard -RRB- and not flexible . I put them on before the game , and before playing , I thought it would take some effort to break in . Maybe wear them around the house 2/3 times then decide to send back or work with them.Then , I put them on & practiced for an hour or two , and remembered that these may be the most comfortable softball shoe that I have worn over the last 5 - 10 years.This is my second or third pair of the same 3N2 shoes . I purchased from different companies . Shoes are soft , comfortable , flexible , with high top , -LRB- the way I like them for extra support -RRB- a little wide -LRB- good for me because I prefer the wide shoe -RRB- . On a scale of 1 - 10 , 1 being poor , and 10 best , I rate this product a 10 !
 When I got these shoes I thought they were great . I put them on and they had great room for the toes and also felt great on the feet . I got the green one and the green color looked alot better in person than on the website . I loved the color!The only thing I see wrong with these shoes is the paint or what ever it is starts to come off very quickly where your laces are in the middle . Another thing is on the back the thing that says 3N2 peels right off and does n't stay on . I do like the product but there needs to be something done about these problems !
 Great Boots , rugged and always cool looking.Double-H Men 's 12 ` Harness ' Motorcycle Boots - Black
 it os very comfi . and good , i will never buy other kind.i gat it from amazon in relly goog deal . .
 This shoes are very comfortable . I own the Melanzane color , really cool . Very soft leather and true size .
 I have just received this shoe and ca n't believe the softness of the leather , the comfort and the quality . If anyone has a wide foot and has trouble finding a shoe - this is the one ! For casual or dress - this shoe has style , class and comfort !!! I would recommend this shoe to everyone ! - you will not want to take them off !!!! They feel like slippers and they are very true to size . The leather is like soft butter !!!!
 I love these shoes . They are the PERFECT size heel and I wear them mostly to add some flare to my casual wardrobe . I thought they were going to be a muted maroon color but they are actually muted GRAPE . I fell in love with them even more one I saw the unexpected yet rich color . They look fab with cocoa brown pants , especially . They are more of a FALL shoe if you ask me . My sister-in-law bought them in gold and she looked amazing pairing them with leopard and khaki .
 I love these shoes . You can wear them with a skirt and they are so comfortable . you do n't even have to break them in .
 This pair of shoes are very comfortable . They are very good for young woman : -RRB-
 These are very cute sandals . They do n't look cheesy like some floral sandals can . They are also very comfortable .
 IMHO there are no better shoes for little feet out there than Stride Rite . These shoes are great , comfy and not at all clunky . . I also have the Baccio pair from stride rite -LRB- adorable -RRB- but they have laces and are more of a challenge.I have noticed that stride rite shoes seem to be wearing down in the sole fairly quickly . With my 2 year old this is n't too much of a problem since he barely wears a pair for six months before growing out of them but my 6yo is wearing his pair out fairly quickly
 I brought this item long time age . It is ture size.I am very satisfied . It 's looks pretty and comfortable .

 very fast delivery , nice construction , duriable sole , nice sizing , very happy with my oder
 I love to go out and dress up with these shoes on ! They are pretty comfortable and fun !
 Perfect for many costumes and not all that uncomfortable . Very happy with the product and price !
 I / always / wear a size ten in women 's shoes . Order online all the time and tens for perfectly . Not in this shoe , had to return for an 11 , but they are cute for dress up and very comfy with the tall platform .
 Arrived when expected , these shoes are just what I wanted ! They fit well and look great with my outfit . Seeing as it is slightly difficult to find nice shoes in my size -LRB- 12 -RRB- it was nice to find these . Will likely be ordering more of this brand for that reason .
 These shoes were exactly what I was looking for ! Well made . They were a little tight , but because of the material they stretched nicely .
 I bought these shoes for my 17 year old daughter . They were `` perfect '' for her Cosplay outfit as the Anime character `` Panty '' who she dressed as for the Anime Boston Convention . Her only complaint was they did n't `` breathe '' enough for foot comfort as she wore them & walked all around the convention center for hours . But she still loves them !
 I bought these as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine . We both wear the same size shoes so when they came in i immediately tried them on and they were very tight . I ordered a 7 and had to return them for an 8 and i 'm still witing for them to be returned . As far as the product i do not know for sure because i sent them right back but they seemed to be of good quality . So i rate it at 4 stars for the sizing issue .
 I love these shoes ! They added to my new years eve outfit . I 'm soo glad that I used amazon.com to find them . Took me a long time of looking to finally find these shoes and at a great price .
 i purchased the pink glitter heels . i was SO happy when i got them , they look really good and are VERY glittery !!! i got them for a halloween costume . i would recommend them for anyone that has pink in their costume . they are suprisingly comfortable and easy to walk in . WAY HOT !!!!!!!!!!!
 These are well made , very sturdy if you have problems with thin heels . They could use a bit of padding in the shoe , the inside is quite hard , would definitely recommend some gel inserts or such type thing .
 The Shoes were quite comfortable and stylish . They went well with the costume that i had to go with them .
 I bought mine in colored black I love the design and style very comfortable shoes . I recommend if you are going to buy this shoes buy the exactly size of your feet . I always ware size 7.5 shoes but my feet are size 7 . I bought this shoes on size 7 and It 's perfectly fit .
 was a little worried about the sizing but the one i ordered fit just fine.this is a wonderful and sexy shoe , and very easy to walk in . the chunky heel is very forgiving and easy to balance in . with the platform being as thick as it is , it makes the shoe like walking in a 2 to 2 1/2 inch heel . great for beginners just learning to walk in heels , and perfect for extended wear . very easy on the feet . have worn this shoe for 9-10 hours at a time with very little effort . great buy for the money . would and will be ordering more of these in different colors .
 this product was perfect and very comfortable to walk in . i was nervous at first with online purchases but i have not regretted the purchase and would recomment amazon to all my friens and loved ones
 These shoes are better than I expected . They are adorable and decent enough quality , considering the price . They are a little tight in the toe and I have narrow feet , or so I thought . I went up a size since I fall on a half size normally . I would HIGHLY recommend that others do the same to make the toe more comfortable . Otherwise , they are easy enough to walk in , very cute , and fairly comfortable .
 I am always a little sceptic about buying shoes online , but these fit great , are original , and look good ! I strongly recommend them .
 Great boots ! Very eye catching and the perfect match for my Fantasy Fest outfit !
 Like all Easy Spirit shoes , this pair was well-made . I had to return the pair because the shoe was too small . Although I wear a 6.5 in other Easy Spirit styles , this shoe was too short . You may want to order a half-size larger if you order this style .
 The shoes were perfect but my Mother needed a 9.5 N and the shoe came in as a 9N and I had to return it . It cost me $ 15.00 to return the shoe and I wanted the right size but I received the credit for the shoes only on my credit card but not for the shipping either way ! So I was n't happy and probably wo n't use this service again.Thanks , kathy
 My feet are hard to fit , but I find this shoe comfortable and it provides good support . I 'm glad it is still available .
 I used to buy these shoes 15 years ago -- their quality has not changed . Still a good fit & made very well .
 I wanted a pair of comfortable walking shoes to use on a trip . I frankly hate the clunky , chunky , clumsy Frankenstein-like clodhoppers that seem to be ubiquitous in every store I visited looking for a simple fashionable walking shoe.I did n't think `` fashionable '' and `` comfortable '' were mutually exclusive ! I finally found these Easy Spirit shoes , and they were exactly what I was looking for.Easy Spirit shoes are light , airy , comfortable and go perfectly with jeans or chinos . They are water-resistant as well , so I had no worries about wearing them in rainy weather either . Love 'em .
 These shoes are one of the most comfortable I have ever worn . They hold up very well . I have been buying them for years . It was great to find them on line because not every store carries them . I do n't know why .
 This is the third pair of Easy Spirit Motion shoes I 've bought . They are so comfortable and support my feet . I wear them to work and they look great with slacks . These shoes are very sturdy and well made as well as comfortable . I heard that Easy Spirit is discontinuing this style . I hope it is n't so !
 I have had several pair of these in the last 25 years or so . These are so comfy , no break in time required . I 'd like to see more fashion colors , though . I 'd love to have pairs in turquoise , bright yellow , orange , kelly green , hot pink , etc. . I wear these with slacks and tailored skirts , even certain dresses . They are very soft and comfy , durable , and make your foot look very small . I ca n't recommend them strongly enough to anyone who needs to be on thier feet a great deal , or who has foot problems , or who simply wants a sturdy-but-stylish walking shoe .
 My 94 year old Mom loves these shoes and they are almost impossible to find in the store . She as several colors of this style . Her feet are now smaller so we needed to adjust the size . Could not find them in regular stores . Mom loves the comforrable fit and they are safe for her to wear .
 I have worn Easy spirit Women 's shoes for years and they are really a good shoe.Gives good support and always fits well .
 Easy Spirit Women 's Motion Sport Lace UpThese are comfortable , casual shoes . They look dressier than most sport walking shoes and look good with better quality pants . However , I would not wear them to an exercise class .
 I have a difficult time finding shoes that will work for me . Most stores do not carry fashionable women 's shoes in wide widths . I am enjoying this pair of Easy Spirit Shoes in the color red . I would purchase these again without hesitation .
 Love the shoes . I have this shoe in 5 colors . When I wanted a third WHITE pair could not find them on line at J. C. Penney 's as I have in the past and could not find the white shoes on line at Easy Spirit . Amazon directed me to Shoemall.com where they had this shoe in about 18 different colors . Thank you Amazon !
 This is a wonderful shoe . I had a hard time finding it until I went to Amazon and there it was . They are so comfortable and I feel safe in them as there is good support .
 I love my Easy Spirit Women 's Motion Fitness Casual Crocs . My feet are grateful for the caressing of these shoes . I no longer need to hurry home as I have comfort for the day . Thank you !!
 I have used Easy Spirit when I show my dogs for several years . They are light weight and have good traction when moving my dog . I wore my last pair for several years until my new puppy chewed them .
 These are the most comfortable shoes ever made and they look very conservative . I have them in several colors because they look good with slacks or skirts . They hold up well with everyday use and are lightweight so they pack well . If you try one pair , you keep coming back to them for your basic wardrobe .
 I purchased these shoes to wear for casual wear with my jeans when I did not want to wear my regular walking shoes . They are cute , stylish and comfortable for everyday wear , not recommended for heavy walking .
 I have had over 10 pairs of easy spirit shoes and have these in two colours . I have high insteps , high arches and hammertoes ... and these are still comfortable . The support is not as good as in their running and training shoes , yet plenty good for walking long distances and taking public transport daily .
 I got this pair of Easy Spirit shoes to replace my previous pair of Easy Spirit lace-ups , which had been my favorite pair of casual shoes for the past 15-20 years -LRB- I know , hard to believe they lasted that long - Easy Spirit is a great brand ! -RRB- . My new brown leather lace-ups are well-made , stylish , and very comfortable . If you 're looking for sharp-looking shoes that are easy on the feet for long periods of wear , I 'd say go for these !
 I have bought Easy Spirit shoes for years , so I knew the quality of this product . I was not disappointed . Shoes arrived in reasonable time , in perfect condition . Color and size as requested . Only wish I could get some other colors at this GREAT rate !
 This is a great shoe for me . It is light weight yet supportive . It looks dressier than I expected , which I am very pleased about .
 I got these for my 93 year old mother who still walks for exercise . She has an extremely hard to find shoe size -LRB- 8 AAAA -RRB- and this is almost the only shoe made in that size any more so we are lucky to be able to buy it for her . She has these in several colors and finds them comfortable to wear every day , all day .
 Love these shoes - could not find them in ther stores in my area . They hae every color but white . Have a pair but they are really old and wanted a pair that looked nicer . The shoes are comfortable and they look a little more dressy than the normal tennis shoe . Paid a little more than the price at our stores but , they are worth the extra cost .
 I love Easy Spirit walking shoes . They are n't a sneaker and do n't look like one but that is what they feel like - very comfortable !
 I love these shoes . I work in a place that has a professional dress code and I ca n't wear sneakers or shower type shoes . Recently my company instituted a fitness/walking program of 10,000 steps a day . The floors in my building are hard stone/granite and can be slippery when the humidity is high , so I needed a shoe with a rubber sole , looked professional and gave support and comfort ... this shoe fit the ticket . The shoes are comfortable , very lightweight , well constructed and good value for my money . I would recommend them to anyone who walks or are on their feet a large percentage of the day.I 'm thinking of getting another pair in an alternative color . I have seen these shoes in various mail order catalogs for about $ 10.00 more than from Amazon -LRB- and the vendor -RRB- .
 I love these shoes . Have been wearing them for years and hope Easy Spirit does not EVER stop making them ! Great support for tired feet !
 I have a very narrow foot and I need shoes that I can put an orthotic in . Easy spirits work well for me . I love this color . It gives me a lift and I do n't feel quite as dowdy as usual !
 FOR ME , THE EASY SPIRT `` MOTION '' SHOE IS T_H_E PERFECT SHOE . I am unable to wear heels , -LRB- long story -RRB- -- but these shoes , which lace up as in any true oxford , have a streamlined look that many other oxford shoes today , burdened as they are with extra outside padding , do not . The result is , that this is indeed a SLIM , WALKING shoe , not a bulky sports shoe . It is as neat and pretty as any woman 's oxford shoe can be.This is a very , very comfortable shoe . It is not quite accurate to say it is like walking on air -- but it IS as comortable as a shoe can be , I believe , without going to the expense of custom-made shoes.When a shoe comes in many , many colours , you KNOW it has to be a GOOD shoe . Because so many people are buying it , the manufacturer can afford to branch out and make it in many different colours . For a very long time , I happily wore the WHITE color of this shoe , whilst my mom wore the WHEAT colour . We were both very happy with them!Then , I saw in a well-known catalogue , that they are available from the store associated with that catalogue , -LRB- on special order only -RRB- , in G O L D colour ! And not just a `` goldEN '' colour -- but a true , gold foil colour ! And at the same price as all the other colours ! All that `` special ordering '' the gold -LRB- foil -RRB- shoes , was to wait a few weeks longer.I have now worn the -LRB- shiny ! -RRB- gold -LRB- foil -RRB- colour of Easy Spirit `` Motion '' shoes for a few years . I have gotten several very nice complimnts on them as well ! And no wonder -- they look almost like golden-colour `` bronzedd '' baby shoes , or , are somewhat similar to the sheen in Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret 's flat pumps , in the famous `` double negative '' picture , by Marcus Adams -- taken in Buckingham Palace , with their mother , father , and corgi dog . The picture is in black and white , so I have no idea if the Princesses wore gold or silver pumps in it . But -- the foil-bright SHINE is the same ! In the words of the classic song ... '' Oh ... dem golden slippers ... ! ''
 A great fit . Comfortable . Easy care.Con
 This is the 3rd pair of Easy Spirit Walkers I 've owned ... and have worn out the first two ! The new ones carried me happily all over Boston on a recent vacation and not a single complaint ! These are the most attractive walking shoes I 've seen or worn
 Easy Spirit 's Motion Sport Lace Up shoes :1 . Provide all day comfortable -LRB- sometimes you forget you have them on -RRB- .2 . Come in great colors .3 . May resemble ` old lady ' shoes -LRB- not meaning to be offensive -RRB- . Yet they match just about anything you wear -LRB- casual or business -RRB- .4 . Last a very , very long time . I am still wearing several pairs I bought five-six years ago and have n't had a problem yet .5 . Come in a large variety of sizes .
 These shoes are extremely comfortable . I have several pairs in different colors and wear them all the time .
 I love these shoes ! I have bought several pairs in different colors . They are as comfortable as atheltic shoes but much more stylish . But beware -- they run small ! I normally wear a size 6.5 , but I have to order a size 7 with these .
 What a pleasure to walk all day in a stylish flat that also offers cushioning and good support and not have to wear clunky running shoes with skirts . I broke several bones in my right foot four years ago and ca n't wear heels . I also have narrow feet . Well , this is the first shoe I 've been able to wear all day and still feel stylish without breaking the bank . I bought them in every color , including metallic silver and gold ! A shoe for all seasons : -RRB-
 The shoes have cushion where needed which makes it a very comfortable shoe for walking . They are also very good when you have to be standing for a lenghth of time . I would recommend this shoe for people who have to be on their feet -LRB- working/standing -RRB- for a long period of time .
 I found these to be a perfect fit . They are very comfortable and great for those long shopping trips . Look very nice with both casual dress and jeans .
 Finding these shoes on Amazon were like winning the grand prize in a raffle.My mother is 91 yrs . old and sent me on a ride visiting Easy Spirit stores totry and locate these shoes in this particular color to replace an older pair.I did not find these in any store . I decided to check Amazon and was nicelysurprised to find them . She is so happy and they are comfortable.Best part is making your mother happy , thank you Amazon .
 I have worn Easy Spirit shoes for many years and find them comfortable and durable . I have had ongoing back problems , and find these shoes to help lessen back pain .
 Easy Spirit shoes of all types are unquestionably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn . I recently bought 5 different types of shoes and they are all fantastic . I have medical issues that make it difficult for me to wear shoes of any kind . Easy Spirit allows me to walk like I have n't for several years . Quality and comfort are fantastic .
 I purchased these for my mother and she was happy with the color and the size . Thank you very much .
 I always liked the Easy Spirit shoes.These are very comfortable and a good buy.I may order another pair in a different color.I would recommend them to anyone who wants a comfortable shoe .
 I have been wearing this style for years at work where I am always on my feet . I was unable to find them at the Easy Spirit outlet but got them here no problem
 I LIKE THESE SHOES THE STYLE AND WEAR IS VERY COMFORTING . THEY CAN BE DRESS DOWN AND UP IN WHAT EVER YOU WEAR .
 I have worn this style of Easy Spirit shoe for many years . I 'm so thankful that it has n't chaged . It 's stylish , yet very comfortable and gives my feet excellent support . I thoroughly recommend it .
 Having been an Easy Spirit fan for many years , I 'm always looking for less-than-full price shoes . These `` Motion '' have been a consistently good buy , a great value shoe that holds up well , comfortable , polishes like new , and never separates at the seams . I wear the newest ones for outings , the older ones for around the house , the oldest ones for the garden . But I always watch for when they go for less than full price ... because I know I will get great , consistent shoes .
 My order was processed and shipped in amazing time . Thanks so much for your 5 Star Service
 These are the most comfortable shoes if you are on your feet all day . They look good and fit so well .
 I love these shoes , well made , comfortable and nice looking . I expect them to last me a good long time .
 Like all Easy Spirit Shoes , these are great . Order arrived a few days after placing the order . High quality shoes at a great price .
 I know I wear these shoes more often than I should , there are days when I should probably wear dressier shoes , but I wear one of my pairs of Easy Spirit Motions Sport Lace-ups everyday because they are so comfortable . They seem quite durable too .
 The shoe runs narrow . The inside label says both &#34; B &#34; and &#34; D &#34; , B is printed on top of a line and D is printed underneath . I do n't know what that means , I ordered D width , but they seem to be a B width by appearance . HOWEVER , they are very comfortable anyway on my wide feet ! They are well-made and quite attractive , I can wear them with nice dresses/skirts . I am going to order more .
 OK . I have been wearing this style of shoes for decades . Decades ! You do n't go back time and again to buy a shoe that is n't comfortable , long wearing , and a good value.One reason I keep coming back to this style of shoe is it looks very nice and neat . It does n't look weird . So many shoes look just awful and I ca n't imagine how anyone could wear them . I call them chunky-clunks as they do n't look feminine in the least.These shoes come in many colors -LRB- I usually buy a neutral color -RRB- and everyone should be able to find a color they like . I 've worn them in the rain and have had no trouble with them -LRB- not talking about floods here . -RRB- All in all , I recommend this style of shoes .
 I brought this for my Mother . She loves the shoes . This is the only place I could get them . Her Christmas was made by receiving this product .
 it os very comfi . and good , i will never buy other kind.i gat it from amazon in relly goog deal . .
 Great boots ! Very eye catching and the perfect match for my Fantasy Fest outfit !
 Beautiful shoes , but way too narrow for my semi-wide feet . I had to return them .
 The only thing is that these shoes seem to run a little big and slip off my heals sometimes . Other than that they are adorable !!!!
 My son loves the sandles . He said they were very comfortable . He took them to college and its winter time .
 i lost the original pair i had , they were a gift.Very comfortable . I replaced them at Amazon . great price and they look good.you will not regret them
 nice for outdoor use , not everyday footwear . will buy another pair when necessary .
 This is a nice sandal that can be worn just about anywhere in the house.It is very comfortable . It is very light and durable . I use it after I shower and sometimesI forget I have them on . The price is affordable but well worth it .
 Thank you for the speedy and quality product that I gave to my Dad for Father 's Day . It was a great little present that made him very happy .
 these shoes are just fab ! i live in germany and am now the talk of the company , and to top it all off , they 're so comfy !
 Love them , just ca n't wear 'em . They run 1 size too small . I have the black size 9 . Yes , I Should have bought a 10 . What do I do now , try to swap someone ? Any suggestions ? Also , Is it me or do most boots run smaller now ? On the positive side , they have a great zipper that runs all the way down to the soul . The buttons are merely decorative . If you have a larger calf , I would n't go with this style . Attractive heels are 3 '' high with souls that are n't slippery . An affordable yet solid boot .
 I work in Quality assurance in a manufacturing facility . I work on a cement floor and I walk and stand all day on that cement floor . Athletic shoes , no matter what kind or brand did n't hold up and my feet hurt by the end of my 10 hour day at work . I found these because back less shoes or clogs are not allowed at work and the Crocs that I had where all backless or clogs . I love them and they are easy to clean .
 fast service , , great shoes . . -LRB- islander crocs -RRB- nice company to do bussiness with !! 15 out of 10 !! Thanks !
 This is a sharp-looking shoe at a great price . Very comfortable to use as an every-day shoe . Size seems to run a bit large , maybe go 1/2 size down from normal size . I would definately recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a a nice shoe at a friendly price .
 The leather upper is soft , shoe looks and feels great , you cant go wrong , STEAL of a deal !
 I purchased these for my husband at a steep discount . I would say they were definately a nice shoe , but they run a half of a size big .
 I bought these shoes in December of '07 for less than $ 25 , and more than four years later , after almost daily use , they are just now up for replacement . Sure , they are n't the best shoes out there , but I still ca n't believe how much use I got out of them . Definitely a worthwhile purchase .
 Great shoe for the price . Wore them several times in the ice and snow . Cleaned up very quickly and thoroughly from salt stains . Comfortable and looks good .
 Thanks a lot , the product arrived in a timely fashion and was in perfect condition . Unfortunately , it was a size too big for my boyfriend but we 'll get those Dr. Scholl 's inserts . Beautiful , sophisticated oxford , he is very happy .
 I paid around $ 20 i think . Damn good shows for that prices but not the normal kenneth cole quality . Still , I would buy again .
 For the price , this shoe has an excellent style if you like Oxford shoes . As for the comfort it is lacking . The heel is very thin with little padding inside the sole . It 's not a shoe for you if you need comfort .
 Good product for the price . This model is one of the cheaper ones but you ca n't beat the deal .
 I bought these for like $ 25 on a day they were on sale . I love them and they live up to the Kenneth Cole style . I wear them a lot with my suits for my work and are extremely comfortable and stylish . I actually found them to look better in person than they do in the photos .
 to tell you the truth I expect better , but what to expect for something so cheap , US$ 24.88 , the only problem is they are to heavy , the sole is to big but I would say it 's ok .
 these are not `` quality '' shoes but they 're great for bad weather . i bought a pair in black and brown for the winter . rubber soles and cheap so i dont care if they get ruined in the snow .
 As soon as I got these shoes I tried them on . I could not believe how comfortable they were . I was looking for a pair of good looking shoes for my part-time limo driving gig . The shoes are comfortable and keep my feet dry and warm . You ca n't beat the price , and I 'm probably going to get a couple more pairs just to avoid the stinky feet syndrome of using shoes day after day .
 They look like a $ 300 pair of shoes , they are comfortable , light , and great for daily wear . I am very happy with them . I did change out the laces though , they looked a little cheap .
 Unlisted from Kenneth Cole footwear combines youthful fashion trends at an affordable price . With different shoes for dress , work and leisure , Unlisted makes the most up-to-the minute styles for the fashion-loving shopper .
 I got these on sale and now they are one of my favorite shoes . So airy and light I forget I have them on . Good arch support and very comfortable . Very well made shoe . Get them before Amazon notices that they are giving them away !
 Love these boots and this is my second pair - paid $ 215 at a local retailer -LRB- stompers boots -RRB- but wanted a new second pair in a wider size - so this was a great deal but the shaft of the boots I got here did in fact have significant imperfections in the form of crease marks in the leather . But the marks were about where the boot would crease anyway so from that standpoint the boots are still a wonderful deal .
 I like this product a lot , that is why I keep buying it.I work on my feet all day , and this is the only boot I found that keep my feet from hurting after a long day at work.I have been using them for 2 years , and will continue to use them for as long as they sell them .
 Overall , I 'm very pleased with these boots . They fit good and feel comfortable . I 'm a size 11 womens and it 's hard to find shoes that will fit properly . They do squeak a little when you walk , so if you do n't mind that , then I recommend them .
 I purchased the white pair of the 157 wedge sandal . I found the leather to be very very soft and the styling quite nice . Note that you will need to go 1/2 size bigger . If you have a wide foot , be aware that you might not be able to put your feet through the front because the straps taper.If it matters ... these shoes are made in China . The bottoms are not leather ; they are plastic .
 i dont think ive ever had a shoe this amazing . i love shoes and fashion but i love being comfortable even more . this shoe is definitely the most comfortable heel i have ever worn . definitely . it 's gorgeous and well made and stylish ... AND comfortable ?! it 's like reeeeeeally comfortable ! amazing.i ordered a half size larger -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- b/c thats what the other reviewers had said to do ... mine is a tad loose . if i were to do it again i 'd get the 8 . my feet are pretty narrow though ... so i 'd still go a half size up if your tootsies are on the fatter side.what a shoe . this is my first `` one of 2 '' brand shoe and i 'm hooked .
 Exquisitely made , comfortable even for me -LRB- not used to wearing dress shoes most of the day . -RRB- Fits perfectly , and feminine and a beauty to look at , too .
 These are some very nice shoes . I love the blue and black ones . These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes . They are also very comfortable . If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price , get T-Macs !!!!!!!!!!!
 When someone says Tracy Mcgrady , what do you think about ? His signature T-MAC shoes -LRB- the originals -RRB- , The T-MAC 2 's ? I think about my T-MAC 3 's . I think that they look great , feel extremely confertable , and are great for playing basketball . The shiny exterior in not really made of real leather -LRB- synthetic leather -RRB- but it still breathes well , and the stripes add to the signature T-MAC shoes . the insides fell like wearing a pillow on your feet , but for the first few days it hurts really bad until you stretch the sole to fit your foot , and the back has a strecthy piece to fit your foot perfectly . another downside is that if you get them wet , they stay wet for a while . The bottoms herringbone design is specially formed to grip the floor with it 's best ability . The reason i give it a four is because they stay wet for a while , hurt your feet for the first few days -LRB- but then there REALLY COMFORTABLE -RRB- and after walk in them for a little the shell exterior bends to a funky design fitting your foot . I have to recommend these shoes to any basketball players though .
 These shoes are sweet . I also recommend the Garnet B-Ball Shoes .
 Bought a pair of these a couple months ago . The styling is n't too bad , but they fit my foot so nice I have since bought 4 more new pairs to have later , before they get discontinued everywhere .
 The new style of the T-macs . These are the best . They are very comfartable . I bought them the day they came out . If you are into black then buy them now . Because I know they are coming out in White and Blue so they will have the same pattern as last year . So if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid December . Otherwise this show is very comfy and better than last year .
 the t-mac 3 is a great shoe it looks so niceand is very comftorble . I have 2 pairs the white and the black becauce i like thoughs more then then the blue and red . And just let you guys now the black ones have better traction then the white.DA T-MAC 3s ARE DA BEST !

 I bought these shoes to wear to work , I need comfy shoes since I am on my feet for 6 + hours . They are good to my feet and fit well .
 these shoes are the best so comfrontable and very easy to walk in

 The shoes might not look comfortable in the pictures but it is comfortable on your feet . Sleek look !!
 This pair of shoes he said feels like bedroom shoes he says they are so comfortable . .
 They are super comfortable and very stylish , but -LRB- on me -RRB- they ran about 1/2 size too large . I was so sad to send these shoes back .

 Looking for a boot with tasteful proportions was difficult until I found these . They 're rugged yet stylish . The only downside is a lack of cushion .
 i got these boots last year and i ride in all temps my feet are always warm they are holding up great i am planing to buy more work america products

 Clarks are always comfortable , so I will not go on about that . This shoe is much better in person . I got a pair to wear with work pants and jeans . I am tall , so the bulky look of the shoe does not look too chuncky on me.This is a great price on a shoe that can be worn all day at work and be comfortable from start to finish .
 This shoe looks great and is comfortable as well as it looks like it can take a lot of running and playing outside .
 Another great Adidas shoe for my oldest ... wore them for over a year and they are still holding out but have gotten to small . Great deal and sweet style .

 This is the second pair of Carolina boots I have purchased in succession . I do not remember the model of last years pair but I paid about $ 30 more . I work in a metal fabrication shop and am pretty hard on boots . I expect and depend a pair of boots to last a full year as our company does provide a limited boot allowance . The sole on these boots wore as well as any pair I have owned . I have owned Caterpillar and Wolverine in the past . This pair -LRB- 8510 -RRB- took a few days to break in so I had to alternate with an old pair but once broken in I was very satisfied with the comfort . Eventually I put in some neoprene inserts to help with cushioning . I walk briskly and put on many miles in our large shop and I was happy with how the support held up . The only problem I had was the leather around the steel toe came apart earlier than last years pair and toward the end of the year I was concerned the toe would actually fall out . Keep in mine that working with steel and sheet metal is brutal on foot wear . I decided to move up a bit this year and just purchased the 1809 model and though early they broke in much easier . I intend to buy some Toe Guard or Gorilla Toe Guard to protect the toe . If it was n't for the toe leather falling apart I would have given it five stars
 These Boots are it ! I bought a pair -LRB- Non-steel toe -RRB- about 10 years ago for working around my hobby farm . I loved them , but when I tried to get another pair a couple years ago , I found out they were out of production . Tried several other brands/styles since then with poor results - I work on concrete floors all day now and need something that feels like a walking shoe , but can handle oil spills and such . So , a few months ago while about to buy yet another brand , I looked for these Carolina 's again , and much to my surprise , I found there are back !! I immediately bought a pair to see if they were the same . Not quite , but still better than any others I 've tried.PRO : Glove leather-ish soft.Very comfortable sole that is flexible , not stiff as steel , VERY MINIMAL break in period.Very sturdy lace hooks -LRB- better than my first pair -RRB- . CON : None yet .
 These are an excellent quality and comfortable work boot . I spend 9-12 hours a day wearing these and have never found them uncomfortable . They are by far the most comfortable work boot Ive worn .

 Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes . Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes , so I was pleased . I do have hammer toes , and got a few red spots on top of my toes , but I do n't know how I could have avoided that .
 I ordered these shoes , the price was great !!! I received them really fast and they fit perfect.It was a very positive online shopping experience .
 Softspots are my favorite shoes . These are super comfortable , fit well , and last a long time . So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work , and my feet never hurt . Bravo ! I highly recommend them .
 These are a nice pair of casual work shoes . Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks . They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer .
 Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years . The only thing I do n't like about them , they are not made in the UNITED STATES now . . I needed them or I would not have bought them . Hope they will give me the service the others did .
 This is a great shoe , though I find that it runs narrow . I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all . My right foot wentin with some effort . It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in . I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato
 this is a very stylish shoe . i guarantee you will get multiple compliments if you wear these . considering the size of heel , they are rather comfortable as well .

 very cute boots for toddlers . stylish and practical.gore-tex is a great technology to prevent soaking.I gave only 4 stars as they are rather difficult to put on
 These boots are so beautiful . They are extremely comfortable . They have a soft fuzzy lining ALL INSIDE THE BOOT . I have received so many compliments about them . They look a little St. Peppers Lonley Hearts Club Band , and that is soooo cooool ! They fit like a dream , and there is very little gapping around the calf . However , there is enough room to tuck in skinny jeans . I will be reaching for these boots a lot . Too bad summers coming up , I do n't want to put these boots away ! Buy them . There are so PERFECT !!!

 I love the shoes ! I had purchased a beige pair at Nordstrom about a month ago , but they did n't carry them in Black . A friend -LRB- who works at Amazon -RRB- told me about this website , so I went there to look for a black pair of the same shoes.My only bad experience with the process was ... the shoes were shipped to me requiring a signature . Which means , they postman left a slip on my door , and I had to go wait in line at the post office the next day for over 1/2 hour to pick up the shoes . Why should shoes require a signature?Otherwise , it was a good experience , and I would use this site again.Susan
 This shoe looks great and works well with jeans . It 's does n't feel too high due to the platform . I wish they had put even a small layer of cushioning - the insole is hard .
 Glad I got them . The price was good and they are nice and versatile .
 My husband brought me these shoes . they look great . the double shade in the front gives it a different look from the pictures . I loved the heels . i have never wore such high heels but it is very sturdy . Loved it .
 Extremely comfortable and great looking . However , the left side is more comfortable than the right . Nonetheless , it is a great shoe !!!
 Love these boots and this is my second pair - paid $ 215 at a local retailer -LRB- stompers boots -RRB- but wanted a new second pair in a wider size - so this was a great deal but the shaft of the boots I got here did in fact have significant imperfections in the form of crease marks in the leather . But the marks were about where the boot would crease anyway so from that standpoint the boots are still a wonderful deal .
 These shoes are comfortable , easy to put on/take out , versatile and feminine . My daughter and I both love them .

 I bought these shoes on another online site but I would like to write a review on Amazon as I am one of your customers . These fit very nice . They are very comfortable . I bought the orange color and wear it to work . I am looking for a size nine in the black and pink but cant find it sad . Ladys I encourage you to try it and you will not be disapointed .
 I walk most everyday . I had no problem with these shoes . There is plenty of room for my toes in the toe box . I laced them up tight and go .
 Nice shoe . Fit is roomy and comfortable . Tred has a nice grip for the icey weather but not too heavy for summer wear .
 I bought these shoes for my daughter as they seemed like something she would like , and like she did ! She wears them every day . The shoes are really of good quality and , at only around $ 19 , are a great buy . I would highly recommend them .

 Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes . Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes , so I was pleased . I do have hammer toes , and got a few red spots on top of my toes , but I do n't know how I could have avoided that .
 I ordered these shoes , the price was great !!! I received them really fast and they fit perfect.It was a very positive online shopping experience .
 Softspots are my favorite shoes . These are super comfortable , fit well , and last a long time . So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work , and my feet never hurt . Bravo ! I highly recommend them .
 These are a nice pair of casual work shoes . Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks . They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer .
 Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years . The only thing I do n't like about them , they are not made in the UNITED STATES now . . I needed them or I would not have bought them . Hope they will give me the service the others did .
 This is a great shoe , though I find that it runs narrow . I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all . My right foot wentin with some effort . It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in . I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato
 VERY nice shoe . These do seem to run about half of a size big , though . The brown pair has different shades of brown color -LRB- obviously intential -RRB- throughout the shoe . I like that they are not a solid color and I have had several compliments on them .
 I love the boot , the style , and ca n't beat the price . The wedge is very comfortable , and makes this boot more of a five - seven hour boot . It 's a bit narrow through the toe , but I have wide feet . True to size . I love the way it looks with jeans or skirt .
 I bought these shoes for my daughter as they seemed like something she would like , and like she did ! She wears them every day . The shoes are really of good quality and , at only around $ 19 , are a great buy . I would highly recommend them .
 The shoes are a mini version of what my husband has and my son was excited ! My two year old has a wide foot and this shoe fit him very nicely . He walked and ran around with them on before going to bed , so they must be comfortable . They are very dressy shoes ... perfect for the outfit he is wearing to a wedding !

 They are comfortable from the moment you put them on . Rugged outer sole . Great cushion and support . And for the price - wow . What a great deal .
 Just got these and so have only worn them around the house but I think I got a fabulous deal !! -LRB- I paid only $ 17 !! -RRB-
 Columbia Sportswear Women 's Trail Meister IV Trail Shoe is stylish shoes built to survive ... A good quality with a reasonable price .
 I really like these shoes . They are very well made and the fit is perfect .
 great walking sneaker , very comfortable , i purchased another one after wearing the first one for a week . now i have 2 pairs . wish they come in solid black
 These shows look and feel great ! Best pair of shoes I have ever bought for the price !
 A great bargain , the shoe was advertised elsewhere for over $ 70.00 . These shoes are great rock hoppers and walkers . They are more sturdy and cushioned than tennis shoes , have good arch support and make you feel like you are propelling your body forward vs. pulling it along . In my case , they needed no break-in period . Only complaint is that I wanted them in a different color but these work fine . They are more grey than sage -LRB- the photo depicts the color very well -RRB- and go with black , tan , etc. .
 Never had a `` breaking in '' period with this shoe . Comfortable walking around and hiking . Found the area at the ball of the foot a little wide , but I have some problems with my toes , so it was a good thing for me since it did n't scrunch my toes .
 I love Columbia shoes . This is a very ruged shoe . Could be used for any level of hiking venture .
 Shoe is great for street walking and trails . It has a stable non-skid base , comfortable padding , and great fit that is true to size -LRB- I am 8 in walking shoes , and size 8 of this shoe fits well -RRB- . They also Look good -- not too clunky - great for urban wilderness hiking ! ... and you ca n't beat the price .
 They 're super comfortable . I thought the color combination -LRB- sage/lemon -RRB- sounded a little `` fugly '' , but they are very good looking . I 'm extremely happy with these shoes .
 I love those shoes . It feels comfortable to wear and very light . I bought them in a good price . I strongly recommend this product to everyone .
 I have been wearing Columbia low hikers for years , and walk a few miles a day in them on dirt roads . I needed to replace my `` Razor Ridge '' hikers , so I got these . They feel great , and in my size they cost $ 48 less than at a certain other online shoe retailer -LRB- it starts with Z -RRB- . I plan to buy a second pair for next year because this price is so low.Interesting note
 I ordered 1 pair of these shoes . Amazon shipped them very quickly ! I put them on , and after adjusting the laces to where they fit my foot better , they were wonderful . As soon as I recieved them , and found how nice these shoes are , I ordered another pair in a different color . You can not beat this shoe for the amazing price !!!
 I bought these shoes under $ 20 and I have no complains at all . It 's well made and they are comfortable . They provide good support for walking , running and hiking . Definitely worth every penny and more !
 It is very comfortable and especially good to wear it during raining day . Since i do not wear raining boot at all . The price is also very low . It is good choice to buy it . But sometime it is hard to match clothes . In all , it is very all .
 One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own . The price at the time I purchased them was just unbeatable , you ca n't get them for that price anywhere else .
 I got it on sale for $ 20 . light weight , comfyI wear them to work every day , 5 days/wk , standing most of the time , still no pain , great padding!love the style/color !
 Have n't taken them out on the trails , but thought I would say they are very true to size . I always wear a 10 , but there was n't a 10 available , so I bought a 10.5 , and they are too long . I 'll keep them , cause I paid nothing for them , but length is just a bit too long . Width is comfy -- maybe a thicker sock ...
 I 've been running park trails in these shoes for a month now , so I ca n't promise they 'll live forever . But they do nicely on mixed and uneven terrain . They give a good amount of support without being to heavy , and the slightly widened sole does n't hang out so far that you feel like you 're wearing snowshoes . For under $ 30 , I 'm very satisfied .
 This is the second pair of Carolina boots I have purchased in succession . I do not remember the model of last years pair but I paid about $ 30 more . I work in a metal fabrication shop and am pretty hard on boots . I expect and depend a pair of boots to last a full year as our company does provide a limited boot allowance . The sole on these boots wore as well as any pair I have owned . I have owned Caterpillar and Wolverine in the past . This pair -LRB- 8510 -RRB- took a few days to break in so I had to alternate with an old pair but once broken in I was very satisfied with the comfort . Eventually I put in some neoprene inserts to help with cushioning . I walk briskly and put on many miles in our large shop and I was happy with how the support held up . The only problem I had was the leather around the steel toe came apart earlier than last years pair and toward the end of the year I was concerned the toe would actually fall out . Keep in mine that working with steel and sheet metal is brutal on foot wear . I decided to move up a bit this year and just purchased the 1809 model and though early they broke in much easier . I intend to buy some Toe Guard or Gorilla Toe Guard to protect the toe . If it was n't for the toe leather falling apart I would have given it five stars
 These Boots are it ! I bought a pair -LRB- Non-steel toe -RRB- about 10 years ago for working around my hobby farm . I loved them , but when I tried to get another pair a couple years ago , I found out they were out of production . Tried several other brands/styles since then with poor results - I work on concrete floors all day now and need something that feels like a walking shoe , but can handle oil spills and such . So , a few months ago while about to buy yet another brand , I looked for these Carolina 's again , and much to my surprise , I found there are back !! I immediately bought a pair to see if they were the same . Not quite , but still better than any others I 've tried.PRO : Glove leather-ish soft.Very comfortable sole that is flexible , not stiff as steel , VERY MINIMAL break in period.Very sturdy lace hooks -LRB- better than my first pair -RRB- . CON : None yet .
 These are an excellent quality and comfortable work boot . I spend 9-12 hours a day wearing these and have never found them uncomfortable . They are by far the most comfortable work boot Ive worn .
 Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes . Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes , so I was pleased . I do have hammer toes , and got a few red spots on top of my toes , but I do n't know how I could have avoided that .

 I love this boot ! They are cute , warm , and comfortable . After reading another happy customers review , I did decide to order a half size larger ... the boots do run small .
 Bought this boot for my move to Northwest Wyoming ... cold winters here !! Compact little boot , nice cushion , good detailing , very warm !! Lightweight and waterproof ... what more could a girl want from a winter boot !!
 I bought these boots to go to Idaho this Christmas . I was born and raised in TEXAS , so you KNOW this southern girl is not used to SNOW !!! I wore them on the plane and everything getting to Idaho . Well , they did not get the snow they had last year when we were there , but my toes sure were nice and comfy -LRB- unlike last year -RRB- . They kept my feet nice and warm , they are comfortable to wear and they are not heavy . I LOVE MY PURCHASE .
 These boots were purchased for a ski trip to Whistler Canada . I 'm not an avid skier but these boots kept my feet warm , were functional and comfortable , not bulky or stiff . I highly recommend these boots and brand for any winter outdoor activity .
 Love the boots . Very warm and thick . The boots are `` heavy '' but it 's just want you need in real bad snowy conditions that require good treads . They also fit very snug - but soft & comfortable with the interior padding .
 the tie up feature is nice and keeps the air out better than the zip ups . The wool lining at the top is comfortable as well .
 These boots are great , I work outside and they keep my feet dry and warm .
 I wish it would snow , already !! These are nice they seem to run a tad big so if your an in betweener like me then go with the smaller . Seem like they are good quality and hope to be able to put them to the test soon !
 Great value ! These boots fit perfect ; they 're warm ; and they are super cute ! Great purchase : -RRB-
 These boots are of average cost but they most certainly are n't the warmest i 've every purchased . I 'm in Afganistan and it 's still about 40 degrees and my feet are freezing . Now they stay dry but warm ... NOT !
 the shoes were perfect and my 15 month old twin granddaughters loved them . Julia spent the first wearing them and babbling to them . I would definantly purchase shoes this way again !

 This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn . I usually have to change my shoes three times a day when I am travelling , but I walked all over London and Paris , and never wanted to take these off ! They are light weight for packing , and feel like nothing on the foot .

 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country
 These shoes are very comfortable even wearing them for the first time . The make is slightly bigger than the actual size . I ordered a medium width which fits well though I thought I usually wear narrow width . I was going to order another pair in a different color but they were already sold out . It is a bargain -LSB- ... -RSB- . They go well with pants and would be OK with causal dresses .
 Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes . Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes , so I was pleased . I do have hammer toes , and got a few red spots on top of my toes , but I do n't know how I could have avoided that .
 I ordered these shoes , the price was great !!! I received them really fast and they fit perfect.It was a very positive online shopping experience .
 Softspots are my favorite shoes . These are super comfortable , fit well , and last a long time . So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work , and my feet never hurt . Bravo ! I highly recommend them .
 These are a nice pair of casual work shoes . Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks . They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer .
 Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years . The only thing I do n't like about them , they are not made in the UNITED STATES now . . I needed them or I would not have bought them . Hope they will give me the service the others did .
 This is a great shoe , though I find that it runs narrow . I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all . My right foot wentin with some effort . It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in . I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato
 These shoes work well as a combo for me . I work in an office but am often out in the rain in the `` bush '' . I waterproofed the leather and that keeps it looking good . There was a small thread that came loose , other than that pretty darn durable so far . I like the abrasion toe . Took a while to break them in and there is a seam inside the waterproof tongue that sometimes rubs the top of my foot but not too badly . The traction on slippery surfaces is fair , I 've seen better . As for buying again , yes , I probably would but only for the cosmetic reasons , there are better functioning shoes out there for trails and wet weather .
 These shoes are very comfortable ! There was no `` breaking in '' period . Once again , Rockport lives up to its name !

 Softspots are my favorite shoes . These are super comfortable , fit well , and last a long time . So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work , and my feet never hurt . Bravo ! I highly recommend them .
 These are a nice pair of casual work shoes . Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks . They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer .
 Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years . The only thing I do n't like about them , they are not made in the UNITED STATES now . . I needed them or I would not have bought them . Hope they will give me the service the others did .
 This is a great shoe , though I find that it runs narrow . I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all . My right foot wentin with some effort . It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in . I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato
 I have been wearing Columbia low hikers for years , and walk a few miles a day in them on dirt roads . I needed to replace my `` Razor Ridge '' hikers , so I got these . They feel great , and in my size they cost $ 48 less than at a certain other online shoe retailer -LRB- it starts with Z -RRB- . I plan to buy a second pair for next year because this price is so low.Interesting note
 I ordered 1 pair of these shoes . Amazon shipped them very quickly ! I put them on , and after adjusting the laces to where they fit my foot better , they were wonderful . As soon as I recieved them , and found how nice these shoes are , I ordered another pair in a different color . You can not beat this shoe for the amazing price !!!
 I bought these shoes under $ 20 and I have no complains at all . It 's well made and they are comfortable . They provide good support for walking , running and hiking . Definitely worth every penny and more !
 It is very comfortable and especially good to wear it during raining day . Since i do not wear raining boot at all . The price is also very low . It is good choice to buy it . But sometime it is hard to match clothes . In all , it is very all .
 One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own . The price at the time I purchased them was just unbeatable , you ca n't get them for that price anywhere else .
 I got it on sale for $ 20 . light weight , comfyI wear them to work every day , 5 days/wk , standing most of the time , still no pain , great padding!love the style/color !
 Have n't taken them out on the trails , but thought I would say they are very true to size . I always wear a 10 , but there was n't a 10 available , so I bought a 10.5 , and they are too long . I 'll keep them , cause I paid nothing for them , but length is just a bit too long . Width is comfy -- maybe a thicker sock ...
 I 've been running park trails in these shoes for a month now , so I ca n't promise they 'll live forever . But they do nicely on mixed and uneven terrain . They give a good amount of support without being to heavy , and the slightly widened sole does n't hang out so far that you feel like you 're wearing snowshoes . For under $ 30 , I 'm very satisfied .
 Columbia Sportswear Women 's Trail Meister IV Trail Shoe is stylish shoes built to survive ... A good quality with a reasonable price .
 I really like these shoes . They are very well made and the fit is perfect .
 great walking sneaker , very comfortable , i purchased another one after wearing the first one for a week . now i have 2 pairs . wish they come in solid black
 These shows look and feel great ! Best pair of shoes I have ever bought for the price !
 A great bargain , the shoe was advertised elsewhere for over $ 70.00 . These shoes are great rock hoppers and walkers . They are more sturdy and cushioned than tennis shoes , have good arch support and make you feel like you are propelling your body forward vs. pulling it along . In my case , they needed no break-in period . Only complaint is that I wanted them in a different color but these work fine . They are more grey than sage -LRB- the photo depicts the color very well -RRB- and go with black , tan , etc. .
 Never had a `` breaking in '' period with this shoe . Comfortable walking around and hiking . Found the area at the ball of the foot a little wide , but I have some problems with my toes , so it was a good thing for me since it did n't scrunch my toes .
 I love Columbia shoes . This is a very ruged shoe . Could be used for any level of hiking venture .
 Shoe is great for street walking and trails . It has a stable non-skid base , comfortable padding , and great fit that is true to size -LRB- I am 8 in walking shoes , and size 8 of this shoe fits well -RRB- . They also Look good -- not too clunky - great for urban wilderness hiking ! ... and you ca n't beat the price .
 They 're super comfortable . I thought the color combination -LRB- sage/lemon -RRB- sounded a little `` fugly '' , but they are very good looking . I 'm extremely happy with these shoes .
 I love those shoes . It feels comfortable to wear and very light . I bought them in a good price . I strongly recommend this product to everyone .
 They are comfortable from the moment you put them on . Rugged outer sole . Great cushion and support . And for the price - wow . What a great deal .
 Just got these and so have only worn them around the house but I think I got a fabulous deal !! -LRB- I paid only $ 17 !! -RRB-
 Love these boots and this is my second pair - paid $ 215 at a local retailer -LRB- stompers boots -RRB- but wanted a new second pair in a wider size - so this was a great deal but the shaft of the boots I got here did in fact have significant imperfections in the form of crease marks in the leather . But the marks were about where the boot would crease anyway so from that standpoint the boots are still a wonderful deal .

 I love the hidden heel . . very sleek design . the supple leather of the boots wore in well after a couple wears . Worn through several rainy days and they remained in great condition . Goes well with pencil skirts and dress pants . You can probably tuck them into jeans to look cute too .

 These sandals were bought for my twin toddlers . They are the perfect summer sandal . The sole is not too stiff so that their feet can have a more natural movement . Even after weeks of wear , the leather looks great ! I even considered buying them in larger sizes for next year !
 These shoes were perfect for my son during summer . They are easy to get on and stay on , and have great support for him to run around in . Very practical ...
 These shoes are comfortable and unique . They always get a glance or two whenever i wear them . I love them . I have the black and it goes with every thing from casual to evening . They look great with jeans ! I would recommend .
 I walk most everyday . I had no problem with these shoes . There is plenty of room for my toes in the toe box . I laced them up tight and go .
 Nice shoe . Fit is roomy and comfortable . Tred has a nice grip for the icey weather but not too heavy for summer wear .

 These shoes really deserve 5 stars , because they are so cute and comfortable , but they only get 4 because they really do n't hold up.I bought mine about 4 months ago and they are starting to loose their shape . They are still comfortable , but I am forced to wear them alot less because I do n't want them to look totally shabby . It is so sad because they are my favorite shoes in my closet !!! I have gotten so many compliments on them -LRB- the leopard print -RRB- and not just from girls either ... many -LRB- straight -RRB- men have commented how much they like them too . Ladies , how often do men compliment us on our shoes ? I would say probabaly never ... so it really stuck me when several of them commented about how much they liked them . I loved these shoes so much that I have been scouring the stores to find another ballet flat that has as much personality , but unfortunately there is n't much else out there to choose from that is comparable . I am tempted to purchase them again and maybe not wear them as much , but that $ 50 price tag is really making me think twice . If only they would last a little longer ...
 I absolutely love these flats . They are so cute and comfortable . I can honestly wear them for hours at a time and never get a blister on my heel , which I am prone to in other shoes . I have worn these pretty constantly for the last five months and love them .
 These flats are really cute , and they are really comfortable . The only problem with these shoes is that the material is n't that strong and in the front tip of the shoe , the material starts to wear off where you walk . Other than that , I absolutely love these shoes .
 Shipping took slightly long , but awesome that I had the tracking number so I can keep checking on the status of the shipment ! Packaging was neat and product was brand new . Thanks !
 By far , New Balance is the best sneaker manufacturer . I bought a pair of 715 sneakers 2 years ago , and they still fit great ! If you have slightly wide feet , you 'll appreciate the fit and style of these sneakers . Highly recommended .
 Yeay for New Balance . I have had these shoes for 4 years now and have worn them almost every day . They never faild me.Saddly , their undoing was an over zealous dryer which melted their souls!I am currently in the market for a new pair but am having dificulty finding a vendor who actually caries them ... P.S.I have norrow feet which these shoes fit just fine .
 I have had this pair of shoes for over a year and I love these shoes . They take a couple of wears to break in but after that they are great .
 I love these shoes.I ordered these shoes from another website for 135.00 and the strap broke and i sent them back and because the site would only take returns once . I decided not to reoder . When I saw these for under 40 . I had to have them and I bought two pair.Once you get use to the strap between the toes they are so comfortable and they look wonderful on my feet . You can dress them up or down and I even can run in these . YES
 Cute ! These run 1 size bigger than most shoes such as Stride rite/Gap/TCP / Gymboree . My daughter is an 11 in those but a 10 in the Lelli Kellys .
 The only problem 5.11 has with these boots is that they are incredibly durable and have prevented me from buying another pair for two years . I work in law enforcement and I am very tough on boots . I have worn these boots every day for two years and there is not a single place on the boot where any defects can be seen or felt . The bottom still has plenty of tread whereas other boots I have worn for 6 months have lost all tread on the outside . They are quiet , comfortable , easy to run in , light , have kept my feet dry in downpours , and most of all -- durable . I will continue to wear nothing but HRTs for as long as they are manufactured . Period .
 I originally bought these boots for riding my motorcycle.From this point of view , these have proven to be an excellent choice for motocyclistPROS : - Kevlar protection of vulnerable ankle bone in case of get-off/slide-Boot design is such that repeated use of shift lever does not damage boot-Light , yet well built-Comfortable on and off the bike-Waterproof in extended downpours when worn under waterproof riding pantsCONS : - Traditional lacing gets old when taking on and off , speed laces would be nice.-Not quick to get on or take off.These are excellent boots on any level . I bought them just for riding , but I find I wear them for everything from cutting the grass to casual wear on trips . You do n't want to wear them anywhere you might need to take them off or put them back on in a short time , because they do n't have any type of speed lacing . I have to unlace the top holes and completely loosen the laces all the way down to get them off . However , this means that once they are on , they are not coming off in an accident . They are also amazingly light and comfortable . They remind me of my dedicated running shoes . The liner is removable and my orthotics slide right in . However , even though I have custom made orthotics , I often do n't wear them because these boots are just so comfortable with the factory liner.I 've had these over a year and they are wearing very well . I have no doubt I 'll get a second pair when these wear out , which is probably still a couple of years off at this rate .
 I loved these boots but there was one thing that disapointed me . there are no eyelets for the laces . I have had my boots for about 8 months and although i do still wear them , a few months ago the lace holes wore out and the leather came apart so now there are a few places where the lace has nowhere to go through . other than that I love the boots , they are light and comfortable .
 Im a Flight Nurse , so I work in EMS . These boots were extremely comfortable from day one . They are my favorite boots Ive owned so far . Ive had Bates , Rockies , Oakleys ... these are the best . I think I would order 1/2 size smaller next time , there are a tad bit large , but my foot doesnt slip . Also , I meant to order side zippers , but these boots slip on and off very quickly so Im not slowed down in the middle of the night .
 I bought this boots 3 months ago . They are light weighted and easy to wear them for many hours , but few days ago i wore them in an exercise with the unit where i had to cover a distance of 40 miles of rocky trail carrying full combat equipment , the threads at the middle at the left side of the right side opened wide at the end of the exercise ... The good thing is the inner membrane is intact .
 These are not daily work boots but with extra kick when you need them the most . Whether you are in rain , snow or on desert these are the ones you really need . It can take the beating so its called Tactical !! There are many others that does the same thing but might be too pricy or cheaper but I like these and have n't had any problem lately . Chek it out you will not be disapointed

 Looking for a boot with tasteful proportions was difficult until I found these . They 're rugged yet stylish . The only downside is a lack of cushion .
 i got these boots last year and i ride in all temps my feet are always warm they are holding up great i am planing to buy more work america products

 I work in Quality assurance in a manufacturing facility . I work on a cement floor and I walk and stand all day on that cement floor . Athletic shoes , no matter what kind or brand did n't hold up and my feet hurt by the end of my 10 hour day at work . I found these because back less shoes or clogs are not allowed at work and the Crocs that I had where all backless or clogs . I love them and they are easy to clean .
 fast service , , great shoes . . -LRB- islander crocs -RRB- nice company to do bussiness with !! 15 out of 10 !! Thanks !

 These are a nice pair of casual work shoes . Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks . They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer .
 Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years . The only thing I do n't like about them , they are not made in the UNITED STATES now . . I needed them or I would not have bought them . Hope they will give me the service the others did .
 This is a great shoe , though I find that it runs narrow . I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all . My right foot wentin with some effort . It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in . I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato

 This freaggin shoe is a freaggin deal ... Ca n't go wrong with a freaggin deal like this . . Ca n't stress it enough . . Freaggin great pair of kicks
 Great shoes . I 'm a builder , on my feet a lot . Comfortable , sturdy . Have a pair for dress as well . Love 'em !
 Sperry Top-Siders are my husband 's favorites - they fit him comfortably - and he often can not find a comfortable shoe - so when I can find his size and the color he is looking for , we buy them . Regularly , in a size 10.5 Wide .
 This is a very sharp looking shoe . The quality is top shelf!It 's a very good boat shoe as well as a shoe you can wear when going out .
 I have purchased Sperry Deck Shoes for years . This is the first time I purchased the Billfish series . Not only was my purchase a great buy but one of the most comfortable deck shoes I have ever worn . I wear them almost daily and they still look like new . I love the feel and my feet are not sweating from the lack of air cirulation . GREAT Deck Shoe !!!!!
 Sperry Top-Sider Men 's Nautical Billfish 3-Eye Boat Shoe , The third pair in about 12 yrs . I wear the heck out of them and they wear great and are confortable . Highly recommend them
 the shoes were comfortable . good support , very nice quality with a good heavy feel . i bought wide and i am glad as they run narrow .
 My husband has been wearing this brand and style shoes for over twenty years . They are long lasting , comfortable , and functional . They 're not only great on the deck of a boat , but stylish with casual slacks or shorts . They are highly recommended .
 If you are considering buying docksiders , the Billfish model is the one to buy . I just bought my second pair , and they are terrific . The rubber soles and heels make them very comfortable to stand or walk in , unlike the basic docksider shoe with leather bottoms . They cost a little more , but are well worth it .
 My husband wears the daylights out of his Sperry boat shoes . This time I bought some that looked nice enough to wear out to dinner and use on the boat ... and he says they are super comfortable . Will buy another pair when these wear out .
 I 'm not a fan about purchasing shoes online . You really need to try them on . A number of years ago I was fitted for a pair of these by a real shoe salesman . This particular pair and size are perfect for my feet and I was very happy that they were still available . Mine are 10 years old and still in great shape but too slippery for use on my boat . I have a 3rd pair of Sperrys almost 20 years old that I wear around the house as slippers . All of them were made in China .
 I have a pair of these shoes that is 12 years old . I wear them daily and they are as comfortable as a warm kitten on the hearth . The seller price was 25 % less than any other site or local store .
 I needed a pair of boat shoes for a trip I would be taking on short notice . I needed quick and accurate delivery . I opted for 2-day delivery for a premimum charge . I paid the premium but the `` Check Delivery Status '' on the system did not reflect 2-day delivery . However , I did receive the shoes in 2 days . Might be a glitch in the system ... The shoes worked as advertised -LRB- no skid ; no marks -RRB- and are very sporty . I recommend getting your foot measured at a brick and mortar store to ensure proper fit . Price was competitive . I paid slightly more because of the quick delivery .
 I have n't found a better boat shoe . I do n't like the brands that have leather laces because they wo n't stay laced .
 Great fit . I might need to have my eyes checked but I thought the tan/beige would be a little bit lighter than the picture shows , but I was still very happy with the purchase . Came really quickly in the mail and was packaged in original box .
 I really like the Sperry Billfish . I think this is my fourth pair I like the style and they are very comfortable .
 I am a college student . This shoes are really good choice for a student . I can wear these at church , school , and parties . It has strong rubber bottom .
 My oldest grandson picked these out so I ordered for one of his Xmas gifts . They arrived and look exactly as he wanted.You ca n't beat the price !!! Another gift crossed off .
 I have owned several pairs of these shoes . They are very comfortable and these are no exception.Great pair of shoes .
 Have owned this style of Sperry top-sider over a number of years and found that they are top quality , comfortable and long lasting.This latest pair are great .
 Sperry makes a great , sturdy shoe . My husband loves it . We had been having trouble finding the color he wanted in his size and it was available on Amazon .
 My teenage son loves these shoes . This is his second pair and he wears them often . The Sperry Billfish costs a bit more then other Sperrys , but he prefers the style and fit of these .
 I really enjoy these shoes . I purchased them about midway through the fall semester and they have held up pretty well . As long as you do n't wear them when it is pouring down rain , and clean them off every now and then they will hold up for a long time . Granted they are a bit expensive , but if you take care of them they will be more than worth it .
 Sherry has been the best for years . Anyone who has ever walked a dock has seen them and I would guess most sailors have worn them .
 This was a replacement for a worn-out pair of the same shoe . The new pair seems to be as good as ever .
 The shoes were fine I bought them for a christmas gift but since they werre for a teenager I wanted him to try them before the holiday . They fit fine , we are pleased
 Put em on and keep em on . well except for sleeping maybe they are that comfortable . great looking , slip on and of
 They look great , fit great , and have become one of my go to pair of shoes to wear when I 'm going out .
 Great looking shoe with excellent quality for the price . The fit is true to size . This shoe is great for a dressy casual look .
 Bought these for my style-challenged boyfriend . They look SO good . The only complaint is the occassional squeek , which I think is hilarious ; the boyfriend does n't quite agree.Still , sans squeek , these are awesome . I have them in the women 's version too .
 I orderd these shoes for my stepson and he really likes them , they are made good and look good on . On the other hand I think they cost to much on this site . After I ordered them I noticed them in some local shoe stores for about $ 20.00 cheaper . All in all we are pleased with the product .
 Good shoe . Showed up in not really new condition even though they were still in the box . There were scuff marks on the leather . Anyways , not a big deal for boat shoes , good product , good company to buy from , cheap price . I am satisfied .
 These Sperry Top-Siders are great ! Sperry is a classic name and style in boat shoes . These are no exception . These shoes are incredibly comfortable . The light brown and beige colorway are perfect for summer .
 There is a world of choices when it comes to replacing one 's favorite , but aging , boat shoes . I looked at a number of manufacturers and models before deciding on the Sperry Billfish Deck shoe . I really like the look and feel of the shoe . Better yet , the comfort is great and exactly what you might expect from a Sperry . I am very happy with my purchase and the shoe seems to run true to size and width .
 I have been wearing Sperry Topsiders for 25 years . They all become part of you after you break them in but this is the most comfortable pair I have ever owned .
 The Sperry Billfish feels great although the pair took a few wearings to break-in the front width of the shoes . I would purchase again .
 My son had bought a pair almost exactly like this in a store for $ 100.00 , when I found these for $ 39.00 I was so excited . He loved them .
 These are great shoes to wear without socks , jump on your boat , and cruise around the suburbs .
 bought this online for the first time , usually buy at at a an expensive shoe store for appx $ 100. , great buy and service , shipping time was very quick
 The product I ordered was excellent , however the service was the worst I have ever experienced.I order this item on Dec 3 , 2007 , and was notified I would receive this in 3 to 4 business days . This I was notified that this item was on backorder and I would receive it on December 12th . This is a Christmas gift and I did not receive it till December 30th . I inquired on this item on several occasions and was always assured I would receive it before Christmas , and needless to say I did not.I will never order from this vendor again .
 This shoe is the MOST comfortable thing on the face of the earth . They fit just like I thought that they would but I will say that they do run about 1/2 size smaller than most shoes . I would suggest going into the store and trying on a pair prior to making the purchase . They fit nice and are exactly what I thought they would be .
 Most comfortable shoes ever ! I wear these for work and they are very comfortable , look great and I love them !
 i ordered from this company because they had 2x wide and sperry only had xw . had them sent to my son , but they sent an xw anyway , , , he is wearing them and trying to stretch them out . . i will go back to ordering from sperry in the future .
 Bought these for my son and he loves them . True to size . Would highly recommend . Great price for Sperry Topsider .
 Lots of copy cats out there but there 's nothing like the real Sperries . We were really happy to find them so reasonably priced .
 I got my shoes on time and they look great ! I wear a size 10 and was nervous about whether would be loose or tight but they were the perfect size . They are very comfortable and Sperry makes a great product so they should last . These would look great with any casual clothing and the price was reasonable as well .
 This is the spring and summer shoe you 'll want to wear ! The Sperry Top-Sider Billfish shoe is amazingly comfortable , and runs true to size !
 I have been using these with many outfits lately and they are very comfy and easy to slip on . They give a dressy look to any oufit . I only dislike that they can get dirty easily , but if your not out in the yard alot with these then they are perfect.I would recommend to all !
 I bought a pair of these shoes . Honestly , I 'm not yet sure how I feel about them . They are definitely starting to grow on me , though . When you first wear them , they take some breaking in and are pretty painful on the feet . Otherwise , I would totally recommend these !!!
 My 13-year-old son wanted these shoes , but I was hesitant to buy them because of the cost . I am glad I went ahead and bought them . He says they are VERY comfortable and wears them with his jeans . They look a bit dressier than tennis shoes .
 I love these shoes ! I originally had the Classic Sperry TopSiders with the two eyelets and they were good and all ... but they just did n't have much tread , wear , support , and the lace did n't tighten the back . These are exactly what I wanted . They 're stylish , very functional , and after breaking them in with socks they 're barefoot worthy . They will definitely not wear down as fast as my Sperry Classic 's did . So I 'll be happy !
 Continue to be the most comfortable shoes I 've owned . Never had a problem with them and will continue to purchase them for years to come .
 Great product with superb quality ! Who does n't like real leather ? Everything arrived as expected . The only thing I could suggest is more competitive pricing .
 I really like these shoes , but either they just do n't fit my foot correctly , or I just do n't care for their lack of comfort . I bought my girlfriend a pair of women 's , and she thinks they 're extremely comfortable , so I may have to look into getting a wider size . My feet usually fit in regular shoes and wides seem to be a bit loose , but these shoes must run a little narrow , so if you 're in the same boat-get a wider size
 I purchased these shoes for my husband for Fathers Day this year -LRB- 2012 -RRB- . He had mentioned , a couple of times , that he wondered if he would like this type of shoe . So far , he absolutely loves them ! He wears them all the time w / shorts , khaki pants , and blue jeans . He has said on several occasions that they are very comfortable and keep his feet cool . He likes that he does n't have to wear socks with them and his feet will still stay cool . Great shoes ! I can see we will be `` Sperry '' lovers for years to come .
 these are the best boat shoes so well made , even wet , non slip on deck or dock I have several pairs , and these have more support in sole and arch , good price too .
 It 's amazingly comfortable . It took about 2-3 days to break in the leather . The arch helps support my balance when walking and the shoes ventilate really well .
 I love these shoes and wear them everyday to everything that I possibly can . Because I wear them so much , they wear out in about a year but they are definitely worth the money spent and a staple in any weather .
 Dad loves his new boating shoes says they are super comfy and wears them all the time
 Comfortable , well made shoe that is great for everyday casual use.Availability in different widths is a big plus!Used for school ... popular with teens.A bit expensive ... hard to find sales on this popular shoe .
 this was a very good product the fit was good and it came in when it was supposed to all pricing was correct
 Nothing feels as good as the feel of a high quality leather casual shoe . I love these shoes . Plan to get several years of use of these great shoes .
 I love this shoe it is very comfortable and easy to pick up your foot i recommend this buy it now
 Beautiful mens shoe . I ordered these for my husband as an everyday I love you gift and they went over very well ! He loves them and has pretty much worn them daily since . They are a beautiful rich brown color that go great with everything . He says they are comfortable and likes the style . I like the three hole lace for him better that the other styles that only have two because he wears a size 11 it really helps break up the long look of the shoe . Some of them just look silly in the front and make a mens foot look like a long bill . These are much younger looking than the original style , but are still classy ! Great purchase and I know he will have them for a very long time .
 This shoes , for me are the best , for quality . Have all what I need . I recommend this reference . check it out . Regards !
 Sperry produces a quality shoe in the Billfish . Husband has ordered them for years and is always satisfied with the fit , quality , and comfort .
 I have owned a lot of boat shoes . The Sperry Billfish model is the best boat shoe in the market today . They are very comfortable . Many boat shoes have an athletic gym shoe type foot bed . The Billfish has a leather foot bed which I prefer . The sole of the shoe is also cushioned nicely for comfort . Cole Haan used to make a great boat shoe but it is no longer available .
 This is my fourth pair of these , the most comforetable shoe i have eveer worn . They arrived on time , in the origianl box , fit perfectly and fell like a glove on my foot .
 The items arrived on time and were exactly as advertised . We could not have been happier . My sone wears them most every day .
 These shoes were for my 16 year old son . He says they are very comfortable and he really likes them . I think they are made very sturdy and will hold up to his wear and tear .
 Shoes are hard to wear at first as with all leather shoes . They need to be broken in.Comfortable and stylish with jeans or kackis very versatile . I am really satisfied with this shoe , and quality . Would recommend.Shoe tends to run true to size .

 this was a very good product the fit was good and it came in when it was supposed to all pricing was correct
 Nothing feels as good as the feel of a high quality leather casual shoe . I love these shoes . Plan to get several years of use of these great shoes .
 I love this shoe it is very comfortable and easy to pick up your foot i recommend this buy it now
 Great fit . I might need to have my eyes checked but I thought the tan/beige would be a little bit lighter than the picture shows , but I was still very happy with the purchase . Came really quickly in the mail and was packaged in original box .
 I really like the Sperry Billfish . I think this is my fourth pair I like the style and they are very comfortable .
 I am a college student . This shoes are really good choice for a student . I can wear these at church , school , and parties . It has strong rubber bottom .

 Have owned this style of Sperry top-sider over a number of years and found that they are top quality , comfortable and long lasting.This latest pair are great .
 I have purchased Sperry Deck Shoes for years . This is the first time I purchased the Billfish series . Not only was my purchase a great buy but one of the most comfortable deck shoes I have ever worn . I wear them almost daily and they still look like new . I love the feel and my feet are not sweating from the lack of air cirulation . GREAT Deck Shoe !!!!!
 Sperry Top-Sider Men 's Nautical Billfish 3-Eye Boat Shoe , The third pair in about 12 yrs . I wear the heck out of them and they wear great and are confortable . Highly recommend them
 the shoes were comfortable . good support , very nice quality with a good heavy feel . i bought wide and i am glad as they run narrow .
 My husband has been wearing this brand and style shoes for over twenty years . They are long lasting , comfortable , and functional . They 're not only great on the deck of a boat , but stylish with casual slacks or shorts . They are highly recommended .
 If you are considering buying docksiders , the Billfish model is the one to buy . I just bought my second pair , and they are terrific . The rubber soles and heels make them very comfortable to stand or walk in , unlike the basic docksider shoe with leather bottoms . They cost a little more , but are well worth it .
 My husband wears the daylights out of his Sperry boat shoes . This time I bought some that looked nice enough to wear out to dinner and use on the boat ... and he says they are super comfortable . Will buy another pair when these wear out .
 I 'm not a fan about purchasing shoes online . You really need to try them on . A number of years ago I was fitted for a pair of these by a real shoe salesman . This particular pair and size are perfect for my feet and I was very happy that they were still available . Mine are 10 years old and still in great shape but too slippery for use on my boat . I have a 3rd pair of Sperrys almost 20 years old that I wear around the house as slippers . All of them were made in China .
 I have a pair of these shoes that is 12 years old . I wear them daily and they are as comfortable as a warm kitten on the hearth . The seller price was 25 % less than any other site or local store .
 I needed a pair of boat shoes for a trip I would be taking on short notice . I needed quick and accurate delivery . I opted for 2-day delivery for a premimum charge . I paid the premium but the `` Check Delivery Status '' on the system did not reflect 2-day delivery . However , I did receive the shoes in 2 days . Might be a glitch in the system ... The shoes worked as advertised -LRB- no skid ; no marks -RRB- and are very sporty . I recommend getting your foot measured at a brick and mortar store to ensure proper fit . Price was competitive . I paid slightly more because of the quick delivery .
 I have n't found a better boat shoe . I do n't like the brands that have leather laces because they wo n't stay laced .
 This freaggin shoe is a freaggin deal ... Ca n't go wrong with a freaggin deal like this . . Ca n't stress it enough . . Freaggin great pair of kicks
 Great shoes . I 'm a builder , on my feet a lot . Comfortable , sturdy . Have a pair for dress as well . Love 'em !
 Sperry Top-Siders are my husband 's favorites - they fit him comfortably - and he often can not find a comfortable shoe - so when I can find his size and the color he is looking for , we buy them . Regularly , in a size 10.5 Wide .
 This is a very sharp looking shoe . The quality is top shelf!It 's a very good boat shoe as well as a shoe you can wear when going out .
 I orderd these shoes for my stepson and he really likes them , they are made good and look good on . On the other hand I think they cost to much on this site . After I ordered them I noticed them in some local shoe stores for about $ 20.00 cheaper . All in all we are pleased with the product .
 Good shoe . Showed up in not really new condition even though they were still in the box . There were scuff marks on the leather . Anyways , not a big deal for boat shoes , good product , good company to buy from , cheap price . I am satisfied .
 These Sperry Top-Siders are great ! Sperry is a classic name and style in boat shoes . These are no exception . These shoes are incredibly comfortable . The light brown and beige colorway are perfect for summer .

 I have been wearing Sperry Topsiders for 25 years . They all become part of you after you break them in but this is the most comfortable pair I have ever owned .
 The Sperry Billfish feels great although the pair took a few wearings to break-in the front width of the shoes . I would purchase again .
 My son had bought a pair almost exactly like this in a store for $ 100.00 , when I found these for $ 39.00 I was so excited . He loved them .

 Sperry makes a great , sturdy shoe . My husband loves it . We had been having trouble finding the color he wanted in his size and it was available on Amazon .

 Sherry has been the best for years . Anyone who has ever walked a dock has seen them and I would guess most sailors have worn them .
 This was a replacement for a worn-out pair of the same shoe . The new pair seems to be as good as ever .
 The shoes were fine I bought them for a christmas gift but since they werre for a teenager I wanted him to try them before the holiday . They fit fine , we are pleased
 Put em on and keep em on . well except for sleeping maybe they are that comfortable . great looking , slip on and of
 They look great , fit great , and have become one of my go to pair of shoes to wear when I 'm going out .
 Great looking shoe with excellent quality for the price . The fit is true to size . This shoe is great for a dressy casual look .
 Bought these for my style-challenged boyfriend . They look SO good . The only complaint is the occassional squeek , which I think is hilarious ; the boyfriend does n't quite agree.Still , sans squeek , these are awesome . I have them in the women 's version too .
 This is a fantastic touch up for your car interior . Be sure to combine it with the deglaser to make sure the application works most successfully . This made my near pristine classic look tremendous .
 I bought this shoe dye to dye the white letters on my cars tires black . Before using this , I had not found a permanent solution to this issue that many people try change . After 2 coatings on the white letters with this dye , they never faded one bit . Warning , this will turn anything it comes in contact with permanently black , even your garage floor !
 I dyed my reins to match my horse harness and the color looks great . It was so easy to use and it was very inexpensive . Good buy !
 Last season I picked up a great deal on motorcycle boots , but there was one drawback . In order to get the ones in my size , I needed to purchase the ones that were BLUE and Black . I had wanted Black on Black , but they were sold out . Thanks to Fiebings Leather Dye , I now have the color that I wanted from the very start ! I used acetone nail polish remover to deglaze the boots and then gave them three nice coats of Fiebings Leather Dye . I used a stiff art brush that had a 1/2 '' bristle which allowed me to work the dye into the leather around the hard plastic protective areas that the boots are made with . I then finished them up with a layer of Kiwi black shoe polish and they look brand new ; and also as if they were Black all along .
 I got this for a couple of pairs of nubuck sandals that had too many colors going on , gave them a new chance at life . I will definately recommend this brand.I would of gave it 5 stars but they didnt sell any bigger containers then the 4oz .
 This was a 4 oz . bottle of Fiebing 's black leather dye . It did a good job on my leather suspenders . Shipping was prompt . This company is a good e ` trader .
 This is a very good product and I ordered it because I could not find it to purchase locally .
 This product meet the requirements of leatherworkers and hobbiest . It does a very good job with very little prodcut used .
 I dyed a favorite 35 year old black leather gym bag . The results were amazing . The bag actually looks better then brand new . Rich black color that did n't stiffen my leather bag . I am extremely particular with my favorites . This dye did its job very well .
 I wanted to change the color of some of my awesome danner boots . its works great , but wear gloves , lay down newspaper and do n't do it in the nude , the stuff is messy and gets everywhere .
 I inherited a gorgeous over-stuffed leather chair with matching ottoman that I absolutely love except it was white -LRB- translated - ugly ! -RRB- The white was so hideous I was about to give the chair away . I bought 2 bottles of the dark brown and went to town with the little dabber . It now looks fabulous . Nice warm , brown color -LRB- like it should have been to begin with -RRB- and I could n't be happier . My husband is happy , too , since I did n't buy another chair .
 This product is excellent . I used it to dye a tan holster . It covered perfectly , and dried without any streaking or color variations . The end result looks as good , or better , than the black ones from the manufacturer . I am really impressed with how well this works .
 Our kids had a fiddle concert which required them to be dressed in black leather boots . They had boots , one pair was brown and my daughter 's were pink . Instead of buying new boots , we took a chance on this product . We were pleasantly surprised at the outcome . I would n't say they were perfect , but again , very pleasantly surprised . It was good enough that no one caught on or noticed . I think , had the boots not been old and worn , they would have looked near perfect . I would buy this product again , but as one customer said , a little goes a long ways so I probably wo n't have too !
 This product worked better then advertised . I would recommend this product to anyone in need of leather dye . Nice to find honesty in advetising .
 i bought a vintage motorcycle that had a brown seat on it.i hated the color , but it would have cost me several hundred dollars to replace it.i came accross fiebings on the internet and thought i 's give it a shot.the transformation is amazing , you would never know that the seat used to be brown.it ai n't brown no more !! beautiful job . i wish i had before and after pictures .
 Works as it always has , been using it for over 20 years on my leathers . Just do not spill it on anything you do n't want colored .
 I am happy with this purchase . I salvaged several belts and two leather wallets with big bucks value . It is a great idea to salvage good leather .
 It arrived on time and was easy to use . The leather belt came out great . There was plenty left over
 Worked perfect on bags and boots . still have some left over . applied neatsfoot after dye dried both items feel and look new again .
 Had a belt I loved but they dye had come off in a number of places . This restored it to full black and looks like new . Easy to use .
 I had some old hand me down combat boots that had been worn and faded . Thought I 'd try this stuff to see if I could salvage them and was definitely impressed . This dye works great .
 I bought this to dye a pair of Chocolate Brown Ugg Byrons to Black -LRB- ugg does n't make this style in black -RRB- . I first used deglazer and then carefully and throughly applied 3 coats of this dye . End result = absolute success ! And I still have way more than half the bottle of dye left over for touchups and such I may need later . All in all , great product !
 I ca n't say enough about this product . I know it 's for leather . . but I 've used it for so many other things . It 's very black and stains . . -LRB- as it should ! -RRB- so be careful not to drip it on wood floors . . or get it on your hands . . it 'll take a day or two before it fades/washes off your skin . A little goes a long way . So far I 've used this product to darken shoes that started to fade , I 've also used it touch up black furniture , purses , and it gave me such a nice rich black color that I even used it to stain a bathroom cabinet to match a black medicine cabinet . I did n't even sand the cabinet ... it was a medium pecan colored brown . I just started painting it with the little swabby thing , did two coats and it looks great and is dry to the touch ! I would not recommend doing that for large projects . . but if you have a small piece of furniture that does n't get handled a lot and needs to be black . . it 's great in a pinch . I went on a kick and started darkening all the black shoes I could find in the house and touching up all the furniture . And then I ran out . . so i bought another bottle . This little bottle of black magic is fantastic .
 This brought my faded leather jacket back to life ! I also have a black leather couch that is extremely faded on one side from sun damage . My last apartment was on a high floor and I never closed the living room shades . Since I had such good luck on the jacket I figured I could n't make that side of the couch look any worse . It looks great ! I 'm going to redo the whole thing ! I used the deglazer first .
 I am in a business that relys on leather belts and leather containers on the belt . After getting in and out of a car to do your job , there are many factors that rub against your belt and slowly remove the luster and black hue of your belt.I have used Kiwi products that will last on a handcuff case for a week or so ... This product , so far , has lasted a few months . Far better than the Kiwi dye products available.If you are tyring to keep your leather black , this is the shiznit .
 It worked on an old Zenith Transoceanic radio case that was beyond dead - 60 years is old on a radio - and it looks like new .
 I easily converted a pair of brown shoes to a black pair . I did get some on my fingers but it came off OK after a few days .
 Great quality product , deep , non streaking , no run product . Dyed my shoes and they are perfect . Saved lots of money doing it myself and have lots of product left over .
 We have a camel/light brown leather sectional in our living room that we spent a fortune on about ten years ago , but after two rough kids -LRB- who still have growing to do -RRB- it 's faded and worn . Could n't bear to give it up -- both financially as well as emotionally , since I love it so much -- not to mention the fact that my kids are still too young to even think about a new piece they 'll just ruin with their normal chaos . : -RRB- After reading the reviews on here and other leather sites , decided to go for the Light Brown . Could n't decide between this and the next shade up -LRB- medium brown -RRB- but read that it 's best to go with the lighter shade . Now that I 've started , I could have absolutely gone even lighter -- these colors are very saturated and cover extremely well -- but I 'm super happy , even with it SLIGHTLY darker than it started.Spent a few hours redying part of our living room leather sectional and ran out of the 4oz bottle midway , so if you have a large area to cover you might want to consider buying more than one bottle . As a result of running out -LRB- and the fact that I forgot to begin with -RRB- , though , I took a comparison shot that , honestly , says it all : i47.tinypic.com / 349cgf9 . jpgLike other reviewers have said , be warned that it DOES stain everything , so take care to lay down towels , tarps , have plenty of rags , etc. . The light brown did stain my hands , but most of the obvious coloring came off with soap , water , and rubbing alcohol . What little is left just turned my hands a slightly yellowish tint -LRB- I was wearing gloves -- it saturated through them -RRB- . I used unscented baby wipes , like other reviewers have suggested , to prep . Also had a bottle of rubbing alcohol on hand -- it was n't suggested , but since these dyes are alcohol based I knew I would thin it out . Had a few spots where the coverage was too heavy -LRB- where the leather was n't as faded -RRB- so used some alcohol on a rag and rubbed lightly to thin it out so it graded from the old to the new nicely -LRB- I did n't dye the entire thing , just the faded parts -RRB- . If you have a faded leather piece -LRB- shoes , furniture , horse equipment , etc. -RRB- that you ca n't bear to let go of , I HIGHLY recommend Fiebing 's . Very old company , superior quality , super cheap price ... could n't possibly ask for more .
 I used kiwi leather dye for years , thinking &#34; oh , it 's the industry standard , so this is what I should use . &#34; Then I decided to try something new , and WOW does it make a difference ! The fiebings leather dye comes with a real applicator , which takes the mystery out of how much you 're applying . Kiwi comes in a weird bottle-tube thing , and you never know how much is going to come out of the tip . Fiebings , on the other hand , has a little brush applicator , like you would use if you were a real grownup ! -LRB- Seriously , this is not for kids , though . -RRB- It relies a bit more on the user being careful and cautious , using it with a little common sense . That being said , the dye itself seems deeper and more lustrous than Kiwi.One thing to keep in mind , though , is that before apply the dye , you want to deglaze the leather with -- yep , you guessed it
 I am a leatherworker by trade and after experimenting with a number of different brands I can say with confidence that Fiebings is my go-to when I need rich colors and deep , long lasting application . I have been using this product in a variety of colors and depending on application it will create a variety of designs , from a professional , solid color to a more faded use for an artistic look or if you want an organic , weathered effect . I like to experiment with other brands but if I ever intend to sell my products this is the dye I use on them .
 Insect repellant accidentally made a large area of spots on my high end espresso colored Bernhardt leather chair . I bought an expensive water based &#34; espresso &#34; dye over the net only to find it was several shades lighter . Then bought this dye in black and though it is alcohol based I mixed the two and tested the color on a swath the chair had beneath the seat . Finally I applied it to the chair with a fine sponge in several light layers a few hours apart . No pre cleaning the leather a?nd no conditioning or sealants since the spotting was on the side and not in a high use area . Literally came out perfect , you ca n't tell where it was done even if you know where it was done and inspect it . Very happy .
 I wanted to dye some khaki/tan knife sheaths . The material was nylon and this stuff worked like a charm . Dye came with a nice quality wool dauber for application . I let my projects dry for about 24 hours , and there were no issues . I 'd recommend using this stuff in a * very * well ventilated area .
 used it on my solo seat from natural brown to black , reapply after a few months and treat with mink oil to water proof really nice
 I have a leather jacket with an orange stripe running down the sleeves . I love the comfort of the jacket but did not love the orange . I thought I would try leather dye . To my amazement it completely dyed the leather black . There is no indication that it was ever orange . It matches the rest of the jacket . I am so happy I get to keep the jacket and did not have to pay for a new one . It 's so easy use too ! A 6 year old could do it .
 I turned white cowboy boots -LRB- bought for a wedding -RRB- into black ones ... this dye is good . Continue to use as touch up . My son uses thisdye for his work boots . We love it . We found our first bottle inan old shoe-maker 's shop who died . We ca n't believe it is still onthe market at Amazon ... shows to go you that good stuff continues to sell .
 This is the same dye I remember using in the USMC for my gear . Covers well . Remember to put a coat or two of Kiwi wax over the leather surface after using .
 I found Fiebings Leather Dye & Sealer 15 years ago . I used it on a leather piece of furniture that today still looks great . I ' v used the dye on other items with the same great results . I just used it on a coach white purse that I needed in black . It came out wonderful . No one realized I dyed it . I would recommend this product .
 Item was exactly as described by the seller . I am a former member of the military and ever since 2002 , I have not been able to find good quality Leather Dye . Most leather dyes come with a sponge type applicator that dries up after the third use and does not work anymore . This leather dye can be used until the last drop without the applicator becoming hard .
 I used this to die a armrest in a gm truck ! Worked great with little to no skill involved !
 Worked like a charm ... soaked in well and dried quickly ... hardly any stain on my hands when I tested the dry surface ... very water resistant .
 A little of this goes a long way , and is extremely effective . Be careful when using -- it is thin and just use a tiny drop at first because it will run on everything . Get set up with rags and newspaper on hand in case you use too much and it drips . I got the black to color white ice skates and the skating companies charge a lot to dye skates , I did it in about 5 minutes , using a mere few drops of this bottle !
 I was determined to wear a pair of comfortable shoes to a bridal luncheon , so I dyed a pair of shoes that really needed help . The result was just what I needed instead of buying a new pair of shoes and risking comfort . Hope to use the remainder on something else soon . Thanks for such good service .
 Beautiful mens shoe . I ordered these for my husband as an everyday I love you gift and they went over very well ! He loves them and has pretty much worn them daily since . They are a beautiful rich brown color that go great with everything . He says they are comfortable and likes the style . I like the three hole lace for him better that the other styles that only have two because he wears a size 11 it really helps break up the long look of the shoe . Some of them just look silly in the front and make a mens foot look like a long bill . These are much younger looking than the original style , but are still classy ! Great purchase and I know he will have them for a very long time .
 This shoes , for me are the best , for quality . Have all what I need . I recommend this reference . check it out . Regards !
 Sperry produces a quality shoe in the Billfish . Husband has ordered them for years and is always satisfied with the fit , quality , and comfort .
 I have owned a lot of boat shoes . The Sperry Billfish model is the best boat shoe in the market today . They are very comfortable . Many boat shoes have an athletic gym shoe type foot bed . The Billfish has a leather foot bed which I prefer . The sole of the shoe is also cushioned nicely for comfort . Cole Haan used to make a great boat shoe but it is no longer available .
 This is my fourth pair of these , the most comforetable shoe i have eveer worn . They arrived on time , in the origianl box , fit perfectly and fell like a glove on my foot .
 The items arrived on time and were exactly as advertised . We could not have been happier . My sone wears them most every day .
 These shoes were for my 16 year old son . He says they are very comfortable and he really likes them . I think they are made very sturdy and will hold up to his wear and tear .
 Shoes are hard to wear at first as with all leather shoes . They need to be broken in.Comfortable and stylish with jeans or kackis very versatile . I am really satisfied with this shoe , and quality . Would recommend.Shoe tends to run true to size .
 It 's amazingly comfortable . It took about 2-3 days to break in the leather . The arch helps support my balance when walking and the shoes ventilate really well .
 I love these shoes and wear them everyday to everything that I possibly can . Because I wear them so much , they wear out in about a year but they are definitely worth the money spent and a staple in any weather .
 Dad loves his new boating shoes says they are super comfy and wears them all the time
 Comfortable , well made shoe that is great for everyday casual use.Availability in different widths is a big plus!Used for school ... popular with teens.A bit expensive ... hard to find sales on this popular shoe .
 this was a very good product the fit was good and it came in when it was supposed to all pricing was correct
 Nothing feels as good as the feel of a high quality leather casual shoe . I love these shoes . Plan to get several years of use of these great shoes .
 I love this shoe it is very comfortable and easy to pick up your foot i recommend this buy it now
 I bought a pair of these shoes . Honestly , I 'm not yet sure how I feel about them . They are definitely starting to grow on me , though . When you first wear them , they take some breaking in and are pretty painful on the feet . Otherwise , I would totally recommend these !!!
 My 13-year-old son wanted these shoes , but I was hesitant to buy them because of the cost . I am glad I went ahead and bought them . He says they are VERY comfortable and wears them with his jeans . They look a bit dressier than tennis shoes .
 I love these shoes ! I originally had the Classic Sperry TopSiders with the two eyelets and they were good and all ... but they just did n't have much tread , wear , support , and the lace did n't tighten the back . These are exactly what I wanted . They 're stylish , very functional , and after breaking them in with socks they 're barefoot worthy . They will definitely not wear down as fast as my Sperry Classic 's did . So I 'll be happy !
 Continue to be the most comfortable shoes I 've owned . Never had a problem with them and will continue to purchase them for years to come .
 Great product with superb quality ! Who does n't like real leather ? Everything arrived as expected . The only thing I could suggest is more competitive pricing .
 I really like these shoes , but either they just do n't fit my foot correctly , or I just do n't care for their lack of comfort . I bought my girlfriend a pair of women 's , and she thinks they 're extremely comfortable , so I may have to look into getting a wider size . My feet usually fit in regular shoes and wides seem to be a bit loose , but these shoes must run a little narrow , so if you 're in the same boat-get a wider size
 I purchased these shoes for my husband for Fathers Day this year -LRB- 2012 -RRB- . He had mentioned , a couple of times , that he wondered if he would like this type of shoe . So far , he absolutely loves them ! He wears them all the time w / shorts , khaki pants , and blue jeans . He has said on several occasions that they are very comfortable and keep his feet cool . He likes that he does n't have to wear socks with them and his feet will still stay cool . Great shoes ! I can see we will be `` Sperry '' lovers for years to come .
 these are the best boat shoes so well made , even wet , non slip on deck or dock I have several pairs , and these have more support in sole and arch , good price too .
 This shoe is the MOST comfortable thing on the face of the earth . They fit just like I thought that they would but I will say that they do run about 1/2 size smaller than most shoes . I would suggest going into the store and trying on a pair prior to making the purchase . They fit nice and are exactly what I thought they would be .
 Most comfortable shoes ever ! I wear these for work and they are very comfortable , look great and I love them !
 i ordered from this company because they had 2x wide and sperry only had xw . had them sent to my son , but they sent an xw anyway , , , he is wearing them and trying to stretch them out . . i will go back to ordering from sperry in the future .
 Bought these for my son and he loves them . True to size . Would highly recommend . Great price for Sperry Topsider .
 Lots of copy cats out there but there 's nothing like the real Sperries . We were really happy to find them so reasonably priced .
 I got my shoes on time and they look great ! I wear a size 10 and was nervous about whether would be loose or tight but they were the perfect size . They are very comfortable and Sperry makes a great product so they should last . These would look great with any casual clothing and the price was reasonable as well .
 This is the spring and summer shoe you 'll want to wear ! The Sperry Top-Sider Billfish shoe is amazingly comfortable , and runs true to size !
 I have been using these with many outfits lately and they are very comfy and easy to slip on . They give a dressy look to any oufit . I only dislike that they can get dirty easily , but if your not out in the yard alot with these then they are perfect.I would recommend to all !
 I orderd these shoes for my stepson and he really likes them , they are made good and look good on . On the other hand I think they cost to much on this site . After I ordered them I noticed them in some local shoe stores for about $ 20.00 cheaper . All in all we are pleased with the product .
 Good shoe . Showed up in not really new condition even though they were still in the box . There were scuff marks on the leather . Anyways , not a big deal for boat shoes , good product , good company to buy from , cheap price . I am satisfied .
 These Sperry Top-Siders are great ! Sperry is a classic name and style in boat shoes . These are no exception . These shoes are incredibly comfortable . The light brown and beige colorway are perfect for summer .
 There is a world of choices when it comes to replacing one 's favorite , but aging , boat shoes . I looked at a number of manufacturers and models before deciding on the Sperry Billfish Deck shoe . I really like the look and feel of the shoe . Better yet , the comfort is great and exactly what you might expect from a Sperry . I am very happy with my purchase and the shoe seems to run true to size and width .
 I have been wearing Sperry Topsiders for 25 years . They all become part of you after you break them in but this is the most comfortable pair I have ever owned .
 The Sperry Billfish feels great although the pair took a few wearings to break-in the front width of the shoes . I would purchase again .
 My son had bought a pair almost exactly like this in a store for $ 100.00 , when I found these for $ 39.00 I was so excited . He loved them .
 These are great shoes to wear without socks , jump on your boat , and cruise around the suburbs .
 bought this online for the first time , usually buy at at a an expensive shoe store for appx $ 100. , great buy and service , shipping time was very quick
 The product I ordered was excellent , however the service was the worst I have ever experienced.I order this item on Dec 3 , 2007 , and was notified I would receive this in 3 to 4 business days . This I was notified that this item was on backorder and I would receive it on December 12th . This is a Christmas gift and I did not receive it till December 30th . I inquired on this item on several occasions and was always assured I would receive it before Christmas , and needless to say I did not.I will never order from this vendor again .
 Sperry makes a great , sturdy shoe . My husband loves it . We had been having trouble finding the color he wanted in his size and it was available on Amazon .
 My teenage son loves these shoes . This is his second pair and he wears them often . The Sperry Billfish costs a bit more then other Sperrys , but he prefers the style and fit of these .
 I really enjoy these shoes . I purchased them about midway through the fall semester and they have held up pretty well . As long as you do n't wear them when it is pouring down rain , and clean them off every now and then they will hold up for a long time . Granted they are a bit expensive , but if you take care of them they will be more than worth it .
 Sherry has been the best for years . Anyone who has ever walked a dock has seen them and I would guess most sailors have worn them .
 This was a replacement for a worn-out pair of the same shoe . The new pair seems to be as good as ever .
 The shoes were fine I bought them for a christmas gift but since they werre for a teenager I wanted him to try them before the holiday . They fit fine , we are pleased
 Put em on and keep em on . well except for sleeping maybe they are that comfortable . great looking , slip on and of
 They look great , fit great , and have become one of my go to pair of shoes to wear when I 'm going out .
 Great looking shoe with excellent quality for the price . The fit is true to size . This shoe is great for a dressy casual look .
 Bought these for my style-challenged boyfriend . They look SO good . The only complaint is the occassional squeek , which I think is hilarious ; the boyfriend does n't quite agree.Still , sans squeek , these are awesome . I have them in the women 's version too .
 Great fit . I might need to have my eyes checked but I thought the tan/beige would be a little bit lighter than the picture shows , but I was still very happy with the purchase . Came really quickly in the mail and was packaged in original box .
 I really like the Sperry Billfish . I think this is my fourth pair I like the style and they are very comfortable .
 I am a college student . This shoes are really good choice for a student . I can wear these at church , school , and parties . It has strong rubber bottom .
 My oldest grandson picked these out so I ordered for one of his Xmas gifts . They arrived and look exactly as he wanted.You ca n't beat the price !!! Another gift crossed off .
 I have owned several pairs of these shoes . They are very comfortable and these are no exception.Great pair of shoes .
 Have owned this style of Sperry top-sider over a number of years and found that they are top quality , comfortable and long lasting.This latest pair are great .
 I have purchased Sperry Deck Shoes for years . This is the first time I purchased the Billfish series . Not only was my purchase a great buy but one of the most comfortable deck shoes I have ever worn . I wear them almost daily and they still look like new . I love the feel and my feet are not sweating from the lack of air cirulation . GREAT Deck Shoe !!!!!
 Sperry Top-Sider Men 's Nautical Billfish 3-Eye Boat Shoe , The third pair in about 12 yrs . I wear the heck out of them and they wear great and are confortable . Highly recommend them
 the shoes were comfortable . good support , very nice quality with a good heavy feel . i bought wide and i am glad as they run narrow .
 My husband has been wearing this brand and style shoes for over twenty years . They are long lasting , comfortable , and functional . They 're not only great on the deck of a boat , but stylish with casual slacks or shorts . They are highly recommended .
 If you are considering buying docksiders , the Billfish model is the one to buy . I just bought my second pair , and they are terrific . The rubber soles and heels make them very comfortable to stand or walk in , unlike the basic docksider shoe with leather bottoms . They cost a little more , but are well worth it .
 My husband wears the daylights out of his Sperry boat shoes . This time I bought some that looked nice enough to wear out to dinner and use on the boat ... and he says they are super comfortable . Will buy another pair when these wear out .
 I 'm not a fan about purchasing shoes online . You really need to try them on . A number of years ago I was fitted for a pair of these by a real shoe salesman . This particular pair and size are perfect for my feet and I was very happy that they were still available . Mine are 10 years old and still in great shape but too slippery for use on my boat . I have a 3rd pair of Sperrys almost 20 years old that I wear around the house as slippers . All of them were made in China .
 I have a pair of these shoes that is 12 years old . I wear them daily and they are as comfortable as a warm kitten on the hearth . The seller price was 25 % less than any other site or local store .
 I needed a pair of boat shoes for a trip I would be taking on short notice . I needed quick and accurate delivery . I opted for 2-day delivery for a premimum charge . I paid the premium but the `` Check Delivery Status '' on the system did not reflect 2-day delivery . However , I did receive the shoes in 2 days . Might be a glitch in the system ... The shoes worked as advertised -LRB- no skid ; no marks -RRB- and are very sporty . I recommend getting your foot measured at a brick and mortar store to ensure proper fit . Price was competitive . I paid slightly more because of the quick delivery .
 I have n't found a better boat shoe . I do n't like the brands that have leather laces because they wo n't stay laced .
 This freaggin shoe is a freaggin deal ... Ca n't go wrong with a freaggin deal like this . . Ca n't stress it enough . . Freaggin great pair of kicks
 Great shoes . I 'm a builder , on my feet a lot . Comfortable , sturdy . Have a pair for dress as well . Love 'em !
 Sperry Top-Siders are my husband 's favorites - they fit him comfortably - and he often can not find a comfortable shoe - so when I can find his size and the color he is looking for , we buy them . Regularly , in a size 10.5 Wide .
 This is a very sharp looking shoe . The quality is top shelf!It 's a very good boat shoe as well as a shoe you can wear when going out .
 These shoes are well made and very comfortable . They have excellent cushioning and stability for running on pavement .
 I am not a great runner . I hate it and have used my brothers old running shoes because I never wanted to make the investment into a `` real '' pair of running shoes . I am glad I finally did ! I primarily run on the treadmill , 2-3 miles 3 or 4 days a week . I am 6 ' 5 '' and weigh around 230lbs . This shoe offers great support and cushion , best of both the worlds for me . Very comfortable .
 I 've enjoyed a few pairs of Brooks and have been quite statisfied . They are quite comfortable with excellent support . I ca n't get into the science of the shoes , but they work for me . Plus my previous pairs have held up very well . Who could ask for more ?
 I have been wearing Brooks Beast and now Trance for probably close to 10 years now . This is my third pair of Trance and they really work well for me .
 I weigh 220 lbs . and run about 100 miles per month . After 30 years of running , this is my favorite shoe .
 * Soft * Great for running * Well made * Price a little bit higher
 These shoes are quite comfortable but i 'm not as keen on the look of them as I thought I would have been when ordering them .
 I like this shoe ; it looks nice and is pretty well made . However , it needs more support in the sole . I would buy this shoe again for the price . It certainly makes a great running aroung town shoe , but not a decent work shoe if you 're on your feet any length of time .
 I orderd these shoes for my stepson and he really likes them , they are made good and look good on . On the other hand I think they cost to much on this site . After I ordered them I noticed them in some local shoe stores for about $ 20.00 cheaper . All in all we are pleased with the product .

I paid the premium but the `` Check Delivery Status '' on the system did not reflect 2-day delivery . However , I did receive the shoes in 2 days . Might be a glitch in the system ... The shoes worked as advertised -LRB- no skid ; no marks -RRB- and are very sporty . I recommend getting your foot measured at a brick and mortar store to ensure proper fit . Price was competitive . I paid slightly more because of the quick delivery .
 I have n't found a better boat shoe . I do n't like the brands that have leather laces because they wo n't stay laced .
 Great fit . I might need to have my eyes checked but I thought the tan/beige would be a little bit lighter than the picture shows , but I was still very happy with the purchase . Came really quickly in the mail and was packaged in original box .
 I really like the Sperry Billfish . I think this is my fourth pair I like the style and they are very comfortable .
 I am a college student . This shoes are really good choice for a student . I can wear these at church , school , and parties . It has strong rubber bottom .
 My oldest grandson picked these out so I ordered for one of his Xmas gifts . They arrived and look exactly as he wanted.You ca n't beat the price !!! Another gift crossed off .
 I have owned several pairs of these shoes . They are very comfortable and these are no exception.Great pair of shoes .
 Have owned this style of Sperry top-sider over a number of years and found that they are top quality , comfortable and long lasting.This latest pair are great .
 This freaggin shoe is a freaggin deal ... Ca n't go wrong with a freaggin deal like this . . Ca n't stress it enough . . Freaggin great pair of kicks
 Great shoes . I 'm a builder , on my feet a lot . Comfortable , sturdy . Have a pair for dress as well . Love 'em !
 Sperry Top-Siders are my husband 's favorites - they fit him comfortably - and he often can not find a comfortable shoe - so when I can find his size and the color he is looking for , we buy them . Regularly , in a size 10.5 Wide .
 This is a very sharp looking shoe . The quality is top shelf!It 's a very good boat shoe as well as a shoe you can wear when going out .
 It 's amazingly comfortable . It took about 2-3 days to break in the leather . The arch helps support my balance when walking and the shoes ventilate really well .
 I love these shoes and wear them everyday to everything that I possibly can . Because I wear them so much , they wear out in about a year but they are definitely worth the money spent and a staple in any weather .
 Dad loves his new boating shoes says they are super comfy and wears them all the time
 Comfortable , well made shoe that is great for everyday casual use.Availability in different widths is a big plus!Used for school ... popular with teens.A bit expensive ... hard to find sales on this popular shoe .
 this was a very good product the fit was good and it came in when it was supposed to all pricing was correct
 Nothing feels as good as the feel of a high quality leather casual shoe . I love these shoes . Plan to get several years of use of these great shoes .
 I love this shoe it is very comfortable and easy to pick up your foot i recommend this buy it now
 Beautiful mens shoe . I ordered these for my husband as an everyday I love you gift and they went over very well ! He loves them and has pretty much worn them daily since . They are a beautiful rich brown color that go great with everything . He says they are comfortable and likes the style . I like the three hole lace for him better that the other styles that only have two because he wears a size 11 it really helps break up the long look of the shoe . Some of them just look silly in the front and make a mens foot look like a long bill . These are much younger looking than the original style , but are still classy ! Great purchase and I know he will have them for a very long time .
 This shoes , for me are the best , for quality . Have all what I need . I recommend this reference . check it out . Regards !
 Sperry produces a quality shoe in the Billfish . Husband has ordered them for years and is always satisfied with the fit , quality , and comfort .
 I have owned a lot of boat shoes . The Sperry Billfish model is the best boat shoe in the market today . They are very comfortable . Many boat shoes have an athletic gym shoe type foot bed . The Billfish has a leather foot bed which I prefer . The sole of the shoe is also cushioned nicely for comfort . Cole Haan used to make a great boat shoe but it is no longer available .
 This is my fourth pair of these , the most comforetable shoe i have eveer worn . They arrived on time , in the origianl box , fit perfectly and fell like a glove on my foot .
 The items arrived on time and were exactly as advertised . We could not have been happier . My sone wears them most every day .
 These shoes were for my 16 year old son . He says they are very comfortable and he really likes them . I think they are made very sturdy and will hold up to his wear and tear .
 Shoes are hard to wear at first as with all leather shoes . They need to be broken in.Comfortable and stylish with jeans or kackis very versatile . I am really satisfied with this shoe , and quality . Would recommend.Shoe tends to run true to size .
 This shoe is the MOST comfortable thing on the face of the earth . They fit just like I thought that they would but I will say that they do run about 1/2 size smaller than most shoes . I would suggest going into the store and trying on a pair prior to making the purchase . They fit nice and are exactly what I thought they would be .
 Most comfortable shoes ever ! I wear these for work and they are very comfortable , look great and I love them !
 i ordered from this company because they had 2x wide and sperry only had xw . had them sent to my son , but they sent an xw anyway , , , he is wearing them and trying to stretch them out . . i will go back to ordering from sperry in the future .
 Bought these for my son and he loves them . True to size . Would highly recommend . Great price for Sperry Topsider .
 Lots of copy cats out there but there 's nothing like the real Sperries . We were really happy to find them so reasonably priced .
 I got my shoes on time and they look great ! I wear a size 10 and was nervous about whether would be loose or tight but they were the perfect size . They are very comfortable and Sperry makes a great product so they should last . These would look great with any casual clothing and the price was reasonable as well .
 This is the spring and summer shoe you 'll want to wear ! The Sperry Top-Sider Billfish shoe is amazingly comfortable , and runs true to size !
 I have been using these with many outfits lately and they are very comfy and easy to slip on . They give a dressy look to any oufit . I only dislike that they can get dirty easily , but if your not out in the yard alot with these then they are perfect.I would recommend to all !
 I bought a pair of these shoes . Honestly , I 'm not yet sure how I feel about them . They are definitely starting to grow on me , though . When you first wear them , they take some breaking in and are pretty painful on the feet . Otherwise , I would totally recommend these !!!
 My 13-year-old son wanted these shoes , but I was hesitant to buy them because of the cost . I am glad I went ahead and bought them . He says they are VERY comfortable and wears them with his jeans . They look a bit dressier than tennis shoes .
 I love these shoes ! I originally had the Classic Sperry TopSiders with the two eyelets and they were good and all ... but they just did n't have much tread , wear , support , and the lace did n't tighten the back . These are exactly what I wanted . They 're stylish , very functional , and after breaking them in with socks they 're barefoot worthy . They will definitely not wear down as fast as my Sperry Classic 's did . So I 'll be happy !
 Continue to be the most comfortable shoes I 've owned . Never had a problem with them and will continue to purchase them for years to come .
 Great product with superb quality ! Who does n't like real leather ? Everything arrived as expected . The only thing I could suggest is more competitive pricing .
 I really like these shoes , but either they just do n't fit my foot correctly , or I just do n't care for their lack of comfort . I bought my girlfriend a pair of women 's , and she thinks they 're extremely comfortable , so I may have to look into getting a wider size . My feet usually fit in regular shoes and wides seem to be a bit loose , but these shoes must run a little narrow , so if you 're in the same boat-get a wider size
 I purchased these shoes for my husband for Fathers Day this year -LRB- 2012 -RRB- . He had mentioned , a couple of times , that he wondered if he would like this type of shoe . So far , he absolutely loves them ! He wears them all the time w / shorts , khaki pants , and blue jeans . He has said on several occasions that they are very comfortable and keep his feet cool . He likes that he does n't have to wear socks with them and his feet will still stay cool . Great shoes ! I can see we will be `` Sperry '' lovers for years to come .
 these are the best boat shoes so well made , even wet , non slip on deck or dock I have several pairs , and these have more support in sole and arch , good price too .
 These Birkenstock sandals are wonderful . Love , love , love them ! I purchased this style for `` house shoes '' but can be worn outside too . They wash easily and last forever . Would definitely purchase many more Birkenstock styles but they are a little pricey .
 This is a great sandal for the beach or pool with the same benefits of all the Birkenstock shoes .
 Nice shoe . These are lighter than the regular Birkenstocks so that is nice . Perfect for backyard or pool !
 These are the warmest and most comfortable shoe I have ever worn . I love that I can slip them on and off in a jiffy ! I also love that they can be worn with nice jeans and a dressier sweater or I can be sloppy and wear them with ratty jeans and a hoodie ! The only thing that might be the tinniest issue is the strings ... they are cute and all but not functional . If you are buying these shoes ... DO NOT UNTIE THE BOW !!! You can never get it back the same and it keeps coming untied ... I know it is tempting , but just do n't do it !
 I LOVE THEM ... VERY VERY COMFORTABLE ... although i dont usually wear high heels but these are so easy to walk in them and VERY SEXY . Excellent Price too .
 I 'm not an advocate of expensive clothing/shoes , and I 'm a skeptic . Most of the time , I figure if clothing is expensive , it 's not because of the quality but because of the brand name it carries . That could n't be further from the truth in this case.At just under a hundred bucks on sale , these shoes appealed to me , having been unable to find a decent pair for work at around sixty dollars . I ordered them , had them in less than a week , and since , my feet have been enjoying the most comfortable pair of shoes I 've owned in years . And that 's without talking about the aesthetic value - this is a good looking shoe . It 's very well put together.Good looking , and incredibly comfortable . Maybe twenty bucks more than I 'd normally pay for a shoe , but they look like they 'll hold up for awhile , and to keep my feet comfortable for that time is well worth the extra dough .
 These shoes are fantastic . Very comfortable and stylish enough to wear with suits . Very high quality leather and stitching . Would definitely buy again .
 The crocs professionals are the perfect shoe for me as a baker . They are light , comfortable , vented but do n't have all the holes on top to get filled with flour . I have worn this style for several years now .
 Shoes arrived ahead of the predicted date . They look great and are very comfortable to wear . Break in time was about 2 hours
 These are some very nice shoes . I love the blue and black ones . These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes . They are also very comfortable . If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price , get T-Macs !!!!!!!!!!!
 When someone says Tracy Mcgrady , what do you think about ? His signature T-MAC shoes -LRB- the originals -RRB- , The T-MAC 2 's ? I think about my T-MAC 3 's . I think that they look great , feel extremely confertable , and are great for playing basketball . The shiny exterior in not really made of real leather -LRB- synthetic leather -RRB- but it still breathes well , and the stripes add to the signature T-MAC shoes . the insides fell like wearing a pillow on your feet , but for the first few days it hurts really bad until you stretch the sole to fit your foot , and the back has a strecthy piece to fit your foot perfectly . another downside is that if you get them wet , they stay wet for a while . The bottoms herringbone design is specially formed to grip the floor with it 's best ability . The reason i give it a four is because they stay wet for a while , hurt your feet for the first few days -LRB- but then there REALLY COMFORTABLE -RRB- and after walk in them for a little the shell exterior bends to a funky design fitting your foot . I have to recommend these shoes to any basketball players though .
 These shoes are sweet . I also recommend the Garnet B-Ball Shoes .
 Bought a pair of these a couple months ago . The styling is n't too bad , but they fit my foot so nice I have since bought 4 more new pairs to have later , before they get discontinued everywhere .
 The new style of the T-macs . These are the best . They are very comfartable . I bought them the day they came out . If you are into black then buy them now . Because I know they are coming out in White and Blue so they will have the same pattern as last year . So if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid December . Otherwise this show is very comfy and better than last year .
 the t-mac 3 is a great shoe it looks so niceand is very comftorble . I have 2 pairs the white and the black becauce i like thoughs more then then the blue and red . And just let you guys now the black ones have better traction then the white.DA T-MAC 3s ARE DA BEST !

 I wasnt really sure if I liked this shoe at first but after trying it on i realised just how comfortable and stylish this shoe is . This shoe is awesome for basketball and just walking around

 My second pair of this sandal . I can actually take long walks in these and my feet feel great , unlike any other sandal I have tried . The added bonus is that they are machine washable too.The slight downside is that they are just OK looking .
 These sandals are very true to width . I 'm a B/medium width and they fit very perfectly . I 'm a 7.5 but i ordered an 8M and it fits perfectly , almost a little small but it 's perfect so order at least half a size up.The shoe is very comfortable , offers great support so it 's good for walking if you live downtown and have to walk around to pretty much everywhere . Get these and take a break from your sneakers .

 Nahui Ollin Rosy Cheeks WristletI received the Rosy Cheeks wristlet as a Christmas gift , and love love love it!I used it New Year 's Eve , as I did n't want to carry a purse all night . -- The wristlet fit my cell phone , lipstick , credit cards , and card keys . And was way stylish !
 I gave this bag in black to my sister for Christmas . She loves it ! Great looking , lightweight , edgy look and environmentally and socially responsible ! What more could you ask for ? Try one of these out -- they 're sure to be a favorite ! I have to get one for myself .
 I bought this as a gift for my cousin to fit in with my eco-christmas gift theme this year . I was a bit skepitcal about it 's integrity since it is made out of candy wrappers but I was pleasantly suprised . It is very thick and durable and absolutly gorgeous . Also a very nice size . Plenty big for a coin puse , cell phone , keys , and a few makeup items . My cousin actually uses hers as her makeup bag .
 I love these bags , have one myself and decided to give one as a gift , that was very well received . I was very happy with the shipping time , it came faster than expected for standard shipping . My bag came with a cloth bag for storage , and this one did not , but the recipient wo n't know any better . Would buy again .
 I bought this for my friend for her Bday and she absolutely loves it . The bag seems very sturdy and durable , despite being made entirely of candy wrappers . When it arrived I actually considered keeping it for myself : S
 I love it . It 's well constructed and durable . Very usable . I only wish they had n't used the same bar code throughout . It 's not as visually interesting as it could have been . Regardless , friends love it .
 I love this wristlet . I 've bought several for gifts . I can fit my slim wallet , digital camera -LRB- or cell phone , not both -RRB- and lipstick .
 I gave my 3.5 year old daughter , whose favorite color is pink , a pair of these for Christmas . They are adorable and , as my daughter puts it , `` extra fancy . '' So far they seem comfortable , too .
 I bought this shoe for my husband for his birthday about two months ago and it is the most durable shoe I have seen in a while . The rubber grips on the bottom are so sturdy and the look , colour and feel of the shoe is worth every cent . He has no complaints .
 I am happy with this purchase . The shoes look better than the pictures.Shipping was quick and efficient .
 These boots are very comfy and warm , and they look very good . However , a few tiny details were off when they arrived.First , one of the boots had some big , very noticeable brown rubber strings -LRB- like cut rubber bands -RRB- hanging out near the actual drawstrings . I could n't figure out what purpose they served , and when I pulled very gently on one to see what it was even attached to , it came right off . I 'm assuming they were n't meant to be there as the other strings did the same and the other boot did n't even have them.Also , the edge of the fabric on the inside bottom of the boot , between your foot and the actual rubber sole , comes detached VERY easily , and though it does n't make the boot look any different from the outside , it can be uncomfortable to walk on at times . The first time I wore the boots this fabric was already coming up in one boot - I 've worn them a couple of times now and it 's coming up in both boots . If I was n't worried about the damage it might cause , I would rip this fabric completely out just so I would n't feel the unevenness where the edges have ripped up.The drawstrings untie themselves very easily and are very long , so they can get in the way of walking or drag on the floor unless you triple-knot them.Overall , they look very good and I 'm still happy I bought them - they just have a few minor details I 'd change .

 Good quality at a good price . Shoe did n't hurt my feet and broke in very easy
 Very warm and comfortable !! Inside and outside in VT snow storms ! Fit is true to size ! Sporto is EXCELLENT BRAND . I wear mine all day and night , everyday ! 1st pair I have had for 2yrs . This is the third pair / STLYE I have boughten . THE ONLY BRAND I WILL EVER BUY AGAIN !! Thank you SPORTO !
 I ditto the review of the person from VT. . This boot is not only stylish and practical , but comfortable as well . SPORTO please listen to customers who are not swayed by the latest fad and continue making this boot to the EXACT specifications .
 I live in New York and find the winters a little tough for my `` little tootsies '' . I moved here from California and never know my feet could get so cold . However , since I bought these North Face boots my feet have been warm , snug and happy ! Even on the coldest , snowiest days , trudging around in wet slush , my feet stay warm ! I am in awe ! I LOVE these boots!P.S . They run true to size

I could n't figure out what purpose they served , and when I pulled very gently on one to see what it was even attached to , it came right off . I 'm assuming they were n't meant to be there as the other strings did the same and the other boot did n't even have them.Also , the edge of the fabric on the inside bottom of the boot , between your foot and the actual rubber sole , comes detached VERY easily , and though it does n't make the boot look any different from the outside , it can be uncomfortable to walk on at times . The first time I wore the boots this fabric was already coming up in one boot - I 've worn them a couple of times now and it 's coming up in both boots . If I was n't worried about the damage it might cause , I would rip this fabric completely out just so I would n't feel the unevenness where the edges have ripped up.The drawstrings untie themselves very easily and are very long , so they can get in the way of walking or drag on the floor unless you triple-knot them.Overall , they look very good and I 'm still happy I bought them - they just have a few minor details I 'd change .
 The shoes are perfect to use with a suit at work .
 These shoes are beautiful ! My only problem is that I wear an 8 and these were a bit large . But I chose to keep them and `` stuff '' them -LRB- smile -RRB- . My next pair will be a 7 1/2 . Thumbs up !!!
 Relatively comfortable pumps and great looking - I can typically wear them all day without pain until about the end of the day when the toe pain kicks in a bit . they are suede , so the back of the heel gets that shiny look to it if you wear them driving , but that happens to all suede shoes . Overall a great shoe for the discounted price and very wearable

 I had seen these exact shoes at full price in a women 's clothing catalog known for its fashionable clothes . I like Kenneth Cole and nearly ordered them . When I browsed at Amazon for shoes I was very surprised when I saw the same shoes for 70 % less than I 'd seen them before . Beautiful shoes and very comfortable . Before I make quick decisions to buy full price , I 'll look to see what I find at Amazon !

 It 's a very comfortable shoe . It 's a great shoe at this price . The shoe looks good and is great for running .
 These shoes do exactly what I wanted them to do . They absorb a lot of shock when I go running so my joints do n't have to suffer . Usually I would stop running do to joint pain in my knees , but since I 've been using these shoes , I can run without pain in my knees . I recommend these shoes to any runner .
 Purchased this for my 15 year old son . He found this shoe online thru another website but it was not available in his size . He likes the color of the shoe and the way it fits.My son has very wide feet so shoes that fit well that he likes the style of are hard to find . His feet also tend to sweat so needs `` breathable '' shoes.We did have a problem with the shoe about 2 weeks after wearing the shoe one of the shoes the `` tongue '' separated completely from the other part of the shoe.The return period had just ended but the Amazon representative was very helpful . She sent out a new pair at no charge , we then shipped back the defective pair using a return label at no charge.Only problem we had was that we only found two retailers with this shoe and only one with this size , even in the reebok store online and at the store in person .
 These shoes are great , not too narrow , just wide enough for my feet , plus the cushions are good and its light . One of my favorite basketball shoes .

 GREAT shoes ... look even cuter on than in the picture ! they even come with an exra set of heel taps and screws . TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE
 These are really very cute . I get compliments every time I wear them . Like some have already mentioned , they do run a tad small .
 these are too cute ! plus they 're under $ 9 ! they 're really comfy and the charm/bow is just so stylish - but it does get annoying sometimes . . like when they fall between your toes and you have to shake it out :-LRB- oh well , they 're still cute lol
 I GOT A BLACK ONE.IT IS SUCH A DEAL : LESS THAN 9 BUCKS!IT LOOKS SO CUTE AND REALLY COMFORTABLE . .
 These are so hot . I got them in navy and ordering white and black ! they are very very comfortable and smooth . The bow and charm detail is so cute .
 Cute , cute shoes , but they seem to run a little small . I purchased a size 8 , and the heel of my foot is right at the edge of the shoe . They are quite comfortable , though .
 These are amazing girly slippers . My wife loved it and ordered an extra pair for future as well .
 Is the must have thong for this season . Thou the dangling charm at time gets in the way but still is walkable with the thong . I ve got it in black , white n pink . Even recommeded to my friends and family .
 They are very cute but the sticker logo did start to peel off very quickly . I like them especially for the price .
 got lots of compliments on my thong , great looking , little bit uncomfortable but i love them , thank you
 I bought these sandals 2 months ago and I love them . I wear them daily and I love the little height it gives me . The charms are still there and well attached . I was expecting them to eventually fall off but they have n't . I highly recommend these sandals .
 I really like the slipper except the dangling charm . I ended up taking out the charm since it 's was hurting me .
 The boots were very comfortable . They will be great for riding the motorcycle , insulated and waterproof and light . Great combination .
 Nine West can still manufacture a great shoe , these are a must have for everyone 's slingback collection . They are a bit tight at first , they need to be broken in . I have them in 4 colors.These slingbacks are so sexy - great with jeans , trousers , and skirts.NY Shoe Princess
 I bought these in black and I ca n't wait to wear them . These are perfect to wear to work with a suit or or a skirt and blouse . They are well made and true to size . In the picture the leather looks a little dull but , acutally there is a little sheen to them .
 A gorgeous shoe , great under-stated syle.I picked them up in black fabric and the orange patent . The black fabric is snazzy without being over-done , and it 's definitely an evening shoe . The orange patent is just plain WOW , and it will go with jeans and dresses.The shoes are a bit higher & steeper than I prefer , but I 'm keeping them anyway . If the shoes were at 2.5 '' , I 'd pick up one in every color ... including the bronze the other reviewer hates so much . I suspect the leather slingbacks truly do go from work to play.IMO , the eighty-dollar list price is way over-stated . Of course , that 's not the price you pay here ... but for a list of eighty , the shoes should be better made . I pick up other brands all the time in with a list price over eighty -LRB- paying at least 75 % off , of course -RRB- . The quality of Nine West is not in the class with joan & david , vaneli , sarto , and others . If you think you 're getting an eighty-dollar shoe , think again.Still , it 's a great value & an attractive shoe .
 I see that the previous review rated the item low because of the color . Mine are black and look great ! I got many compliments when I wore them for the first time and several girls in the office have been looking for them online . I am looking for another pair in red , but ca n't seem to find one.The shoes are very comfortable due to the hill height -LRB- not very high , but still make your legs look slim -RRB- and due to the design of slingback -LRB- your entire foot is not covered , which makes it easier for the foot to breath and move -RRB- .
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 This is my first pair of Clarks , so I can not compare them , but I really like my new shoes . They are firm and comfortable and offer plenty of support to my feet . The soles remind me of a good pair of walking shoes.And bonus , they do seem to be water proof .
 Very nice shade of brown , the quality leather is EXCELLENT ... I bought these for a male friend and he LOVED it ... recommneded

 I have been wearing these slippers while working in my home office for the past month , and with severe stretches of cold weather -LRB- between -5 F and +5 F -RRB- my feet have been comfortably warm . My old slippers , and shoes , just could not find a way to keep my feet warm . These Tamarac slippers are outstanding and it looks like they will last a long time , given the initial workout that I 've given them -LRB- wearing them outside on rough pavement , etc. -RRB- .
 I got these for my father . Florida can get cold for the elderly . The best tip though ... buy them in a bigger size !!
 I received these for Christmas . At first , I did not care for them as they pinched the tops of my feet . However , after wearing them for a few days they stretched nicely and now are extremely comfortable . They are very warm , also . Glad I got them after all !
 The boot slipper is good . Nevertheless , it was a little bit hard at first . Now that I 've used several days , they have soften . I guess this is what happens when you buy clothes online ... the problem is that you can not try them first .
 My husband wanted these high topper slippers and I could n't find them in any store this holiday season . Glad to see we could find them online . He loves them !
 These slippers are very comfortable . They are made very well and are just what they are described .
 These slippers are very comfortable and durable for the price . I compared them to at least 7 other pairs before purchasing them . They have a very durable anti-slip sole .
 they are VERY comfortable ... i ordered the wider size based on the other comments on this site ... i wear them all the time now at home
 Comfortable , warm and well made . I would recommend to anyone that would like to keep their ankles warm .
 They have been the perfect gift for my cold natured sweetie . He said they are very comfortable and warm ! Two big requirements for him !
 I had a previous pair of these slippers and they really were comfortable but wore out after two year so I got a replacement .
 Had to cut with scissors the front tongue where the sewing begins so that I could wear the slippers . The slippers are fine now .
 These are nice slippers and were received in a timely manner . However , even though I ordered these a size larger based on other reviews , they were still way too small . I returned them and reordered them two sizes larger . Return and reorder process was very easy . Other purchasers may want to consider ordering 2 sizes larger .
 It is important to order a size larger , I have large size 13 feet , and the size 14 slipper fitted me . I have been wearing the daily for about a week , and they mold to my feet , and fit better each day.I have used them outdoors for taking out garbage , and feeding birds etc , and they seem to stand up well to light rain , and humidity ... They do keep my feet warm , and -LRB- so far -RRB- not uncomfortably hot.So far I 'm happy and would recommend them . I took off one star for inaccurate sizing , make sure you buy one size bigger then your feet .
 The shoe is very comfortable , but is small and tight in the toe . I would recommend ordering a size up from what you typically wear , especially if you want to wear socks inside the shoe .
 I first ordered these slippers for Christmas 2010 as a gift for husband . He liked them so much that he wore them almost every day . Even though they are still in good shape -LRB- a plus -RRB- I ordered him another pair for Christmas 2011 in a slightly different color . He was thrilled to get them . My only issue is that the price for these went up almost 100 % from last year . But I still consider them a great buy .
 I have to say that I was a little skeptical about buying something I could n't try on first . But I was more than happy when I got them and tried them on for the first time . The fit was perfect . I like my slippers a little snug . They do stretch just a bit . I would suggest going up half a size from your normal shoe size if you would rather they be a little looser.The slippers themselves are comfortable and very warm ! Love the sole and the traction it gives . I do have just the slightest bit of slippage around the area of my heel though . -LRB- Not a design flaw just a narrow heel on my part -RRB- The color is exactly what I expected and shipping was quick . I recieved them just a couple of days after I put in my order.Overall I am very happy with the slilppers and everything else .
 I find these shoes to be very , very , comfortable . I received them in a prompt fashion and I would highly recommend them for warmth and comfort .
 These slippers are extremely comfortable and warm . You will not be disappointed . I would recommend you order 1 size larger than you would normally wear as a shoe . I strongly recommend this product .
 these are great . All winter my feet were freezing so cold that when I got into bed , My wife would scoot to the other side to escape the frigid aura emanating from my feet . I would go to sleep cold and wake up cold . Horrible . And then my slippers arrived and it was like spring had sprung . I practically live in these now and am wearing them at the time of this writing . I did order them a little big which I think was a good idea because they slip on easily , but do n't fall off . Exceptionally comfortable , incredibly warm .
 Very nice pair of slippers . I bought these to replace the ones my husband has been wearing for at least 3 years . They hold up very well . The soles are great ! - no slipping . The higher tops keep his ankles happy . Would definitely buy again .
 He is plagued with cold feet and did n't have any heavy duty slippers . These are definitely heavy duty . I do n't think that the all man-made materials were noted in the description , but they 're great just the same . I absolutely concur with the other reviewers-order 2 sizes up and in wide if possible ! The 13W fit his average 11s perfectly with socks and without a complaint about the cold .
 The products are made smaller than the spec . I bought size 9 even though I wear 8-1/2 shoes yet I have force them to put them on . They will keep your feet worm like they say . I suggest the other to buy at least a size larger .
 Husband really likes these shoes . He is normally a 9 1/2 , rarely a 10 . I purchased size 11 and they just fit . He says they are comfy and really keep his feet warm . I also bought size 14W for my size 13M son . He has large ankles and a high instep so the extra size larger and wider makes this shoe just fit really nicely for him . He also says this shoe keeps his feet warm on our chilly cabin floors . Inside the shoe , there is a little tag that states 100 per cent man made material , so I guess these are not shearling like I thought they were when I purchased them . Oh well , they still really like them .
 Taking other reviews into consideration , I ordered this one size larger than usual and it fit my EE wide foot sized dad just perfectly.High cut keeps even ankles nice and toasty warm without having to wear socks.High cut also means it 's not as easy to just slip on and off like normally cut house slippers , but unless you 're frequently taking them on and off , it 's not a big deal at all.Nice , solid soles make it fit and feel more like supportive house shoes , rather than sloppy , floppy house slippers .
 These were just want I wanted when I got themsuper soft and they fit just rightthe sole have rubber n them so you wo n't slip
 This was a replacement pair for a size 12 that seemed to run very small . This pair fits great and is very comfortable .
 I like me fuzzy slippersthese are a bit expensive and feel tight on the footthey are warm thoughthere are less expensive slippers from the same sellerprobably have the same tiny slot to put yer foot inmaybe they will stretch outwe 'll see they came in todaythey shipped first and arrived last
 I have been wearing these for about a week now . They keep my feet nice and warm . They have a good enough rubberized sole that I have felt comfortable walking outside with them . They go high enough to keep my ankle warm -LRB- which is one of the main reasons I picked this style out -RRB- . If they wear out too quickly , etc , I will update this review .
 Theses arrived on time , well shipped . Took the advice of other reviewes and ordered a size up . Good Idea ! They are comfortable wearing around the house .
 My son loves his new slippers - he 's been wanting a pair just like his dad 's . They fit him well and seem to be well constructed .
 Well constructed , tightly sewn , fur-lined . Keeps my feet warm and toasty in cold weather . Soles stick to icy surfaces good , limited slippage . Can be flattened somewhat to put in suitcases .
 I love these slippers so much , that I purchased an extra pair . I 've had these before & they are super comfy !
 My wife bought me these as gift when my old slippers got too ratty . I hate change but loved changing to these . They are warm and comfy . They are also good quality and will last many years .
 These slippers are very comfortable and warm . I 'm very happy to have bought them.My only &#34; problem &#34; is that even though they 're a size 16 , they felt smaller at first.All n ' all , I 'd recommend them .
 I ordered a men 's size 10 . I wear size 9 shoes . These seem a bit narrow , so double socks are not an option . They are warm , though .
 These slippers are exactly what I needed . They are very warm and durable . They have the solid sole I require for the times I need to step outside and do not want -LRB- or have time -RRB- to change footwear .
 The slippers were just what my husband needed . The price was very reasonable too . The service was flawless .
 My husband really enjoys these new slippers . He has very wide feet and the slippers could have been a little wider , but I 'm sure will stretch a little with use .
 The product arrived quickly and in good condition . They were a gift for a friend and since it is summer , he has n't really worn them yet . They fit well -LRB- he is a size 11 or so -RRB- and are comfortable .
 I 'm glad I read the reviews and ordered a larger size than I thought I would need . I normally wear size 12 , but after reading the reviews that all said they run small I ordered the largest size available at the time which was 13 W. I would have ordered a 14 but it was n't available at the time . 14 would have been perfect but these will do . ORDER LARGER THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED .
 They are nice and warn and can wear outside . But the fit a little too snug . They strech a little , so you need to buy larger sizes than what you wear ! Other than that I love them
 I am very satisfied with these slippers . Lightweight , warm , comfortable , and have good outdoor soles These slippers felt too tight in the toe area at first , but after a week of wearing them the fleece lining compacted . They need a break in period to know their size . Low price is a bonus . They appear sturdy but have had them only a week so can not judge durability .
 I do n't know how I missed all the warnings about how small these run but I did . I ordered size 9 's for my husband and he ended up giving them to our daughter who wears a women 's size 9 and they were even a tad tight at the top of her feet but will probably stretch in time . Very well made and very warm and comfy but not at all true to size . A bit narrow too . I have now ordered 11 's for my husband because he often wears socks with his slippers . I 'm hopeful they will be a good fit . Order at least one size up , perhaps two sizes if your feet are wide or if you like to wear socks with your slippers . Quality and comfort are 5 stars but fit gets only 1 .
 I have a finished basement than can get pretty cold so I went to look for something that was good and affordable . I got it in these slippers . The only reason I did n't rate it a 5 star is that the small pulling tab at back of one slipper ripped off the 2nd time I put them on . No biggie though .
 Great slippers . Good sole -- tough but flexible . Very warm , but breathable so feet stay snuggly and dry . Obviously designed for function -- not going to make a fashion statement here -- but look better than the photos suggest .
 I bought these slippers for my son for Christmas . He loves them ... says they 're warm & comfy . I love them because he can walk next door in them and have coffee with me .
 I received them several days earlier than the estimated time , that is really nice . I read the reviews and ordered an 11 size , I normally take a 10 or 10 1/2 , the size is just right , Thank You to those who suggested a larger size.I think these slippers are almost perfect , they are warm , they breath so my feet do n't sweat , they stay on my feet while walking around , and are made well enough to wear outside to feed the dog or get something out of the car , I 'm not sure though how they would be if walking through wet grass because of the outside material -LRB- maybe spraying then with some Scotch-Brite would work -RRB- , all in all I recommend these and will certainly order another pair when necessary.The free fast shipping is excellent too.Edit on this purchase
 Great warmth , comfort and quality ... IF you order 2 sizes larger than what you wear . These slippers are wayyyy small . Also order the `` W '' for wide . You will NEED it . I wear mens size 12 . Based on other reviews , I ordered size 13W . Wish I had ordered one size larger .
 very comfortable and keep my feet very warm . I would recommend this product to a friend . wow I am not sure what else to say to complete th amount of words .
 Positively order these a size to large . I wear size 12 shoes , as other reviewers suggested , I ordered size 13 . I could have even ordered 2 sizes but they 'll do , as they will stretch some . Very quick shipping , unlike some other items I have ordered . They are nice slippers , warm . . just nice .
 This is the same slipper given to me as a gift 2-3 years ago , and I wore the darn things out -LRB- very reasonable under the circumstances of use -RRB- . So , I ordered a replacement pair for myself because my old pair are wearing thin.Recommend ? Absolutely yes ... 100 % !!! They are fantastic for not just wearing around the house , but also for slipping outside to grab the mail , pull in the trash recycle bins , or just running to the car to get something I forgot.Just be sure to pick the right size and width , otherwise you 'll have slippers that are so tight-fitting that there is no air circulation , and then foot odor will be a problem.A + + + , two `` thumbs-up '' , 5 stars , or whatever rating system you have confidence in . I love 'em ! NOTE
 I looked high and low for this type of boot slipper . Deerfoams used to make them but apparently not anymore . When I wear sliipers I want them to keep my ankles warm too and these are perfect . I only gave four stars because within a month one of the pull straps broke . Otherwise I love them .
 I got these because they were the least expensive I could find of this type . I had previously paid -LSB- ... -RSB- for very comfortable boot slippers at Walmart , 3 pairs of them over the years , and if I got the chance to look again I 'd do so ... and stock up.I went a size larger as as most people suggested and , although they are a little big theyare OK . They are not as flexible as my earlier ones and they do have a tendency to fall hard on the floor almost like an actual shoe and not your typical slipper , but hopefully they will improve with wear .
 I concur with one the earlier reviews in that the boot slipper is excellent but watch the sizing . If you go 1 to 2 sizes above your regular size you will be good to go . Recommended .
 First off , I am a big fan of Matiko . I 've had these boots for a few years now and it still looks great . The color is great and so is the leather . I get many compliments every time I wear these boots . As for the comfort level , it 's a great pair to walk around in , but not for long distances . It is a definite keeper !
 I 'm a fan of Asics as it is , every shoe I own is one and so of course when i 'm looking for a new running shoe I would check for the Asics models . The people at the store said it was a good shoe and he would n't lie to me , he 's my friend , Erik Stanley , and plus if you know anything about distance runners then you would know him . Anyway back to the shoe . It runs great ! The support is nice and the arc is high enough for me also it weighs hardly anything ! I had shin splints for the entire track season and then going into Cross Country training and once I got these my shins started to feel better . I would recommend this shoe for anybody although I suggest you go to a local store or something to see how it fits and all because I do have a awkward foot ... by the way the shoe is a Neutral .
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition

 I wore these sandals from 7 am to 7 pm at a trade show - walked a million square feet in them ! They looked good and felt good all day . If they passed that test , a regular old day in the office will be no problem !
 Naturalizer Perth Slingback is a great shoe , very comfortable , the right height and the color was perfect .
 I love my Naturalizer Perth sandals so much that after I got them in white , I started searching everywher for more in other colors . I now have three pair of these , and they are the most comfortable shoe I own .
 These are my `` go to '' strappy shoes . For a quick trip to the store or a night out , I toss these on with anything and everything . The color is almost a neutral/nude , like a warm birch hue maybe . Because of this , they go with everything . I wear mine with skirts , dresses , jeans , ... I even wore them with a silk party dress for an evening wedding . They are as comfortable as tall platform strappy sandals could be . The platform itself is wood and natural . In the other colors , the wood is tinted slightly as to coordinate with the leather . I have them in red as well and it makes for a good combination .

 I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE SHOES I PURCHASED ON AMAZON.DOT . THEY ARE OF EXCELLENT QUALITY , AND VERY COMFORTABLE . PRICE WAS REASONABLE , AND DELIVERY GREAT .
 I have worn weekly since I received this shoe . Looks good and feels great .
 These shoes are really nice . They are becoming more comfortable , but the first time I wore them , they gave me blisters on both of my big toes -LRB- the leather is rather thick -RRB- . The second time , I wore them all day and it irritated my toes , but they were much more comfortable . Hopefully the leather will soften up over time !
 This shoe is extremely comfortable without looking clunky . I love Clarks shoes !
 I found the Clarks Womens Begga Slides to be very comfortable . They are good looking and can be worn to work as well as for more casual wear
 I have two pairs . One I bought through Beall 's via Amazon . Beall 's was fast and the price was great . I was very impressed with their quality and speed of service : -RRB- I did get marks on the side of my foot where the leather scraped against it . I also do n't like all of the space above my toes . My toes are sort of short but Clark has still left too much space.Nevertheless , I still enjoy wearing them .
 I bought these shoes in California only to come home to NC to have them stolen before I could wear them . Luckily , I found the exact same pair on amazon.com for less ! I absolutely love them and wear them everywhere .
 Comfortable Clark slides . I did order a half size smaller than I usually wear and they fit perfect . Best price around . That was my 3rd purchase of the same shoe . Your price was the best and shipped very fast .
 I looked at the same shoes at Belks on sale which were still more expensive than here . I got them quick plus they are good looking and wearing .
 These sandals are so nice , they can be worn either dressy or casual . I liked the low heel , and how comfortable they are.Only one thing I did n't like -- the small toenail gets caughtbetween the straps.But they 're beautiful and I 'll be wearing them for years to come .
 These Clarks are true to size , very comfortable . Cute enough for work and play . I get lots of compliments

 I am very happy with the M881 . It is lightweight , and very comfortable . Good support and stability .
 First of all , where do you get off , Amazon , inserting `` frustrated this time '' into my review ? AI-overdone !! I 'm an older , heavy , sedentary guy with always picky feet and now diabetes.Most of my life I 've been a 9eee or when I could get it , eeeE . My last 9eeee were Nike Monarchs - excellent cushioning !! But they seemed a bit short . Got these in 9.5 eeee and they are the Most comfortable shoes ever to just have on . Except for walking . Unless I 'm wearing the thickest of socks my feet tend to slide around inside a bit . Obviously I 'd be better off with a 9 , not a 9.5 - just a thought for anyone thinking of upsizing a notch . The toe room translates to a LOT of extra space.If only I could have the Monarch 's cushioning with the SL-2 Last of these 881s , I 'd be in shoe heaven .

 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 There cute but not great . There real thin and feel cheap but my daughter likes them . I do n't think they will last very long .
 I purchased these in a size 4 for my eight year old son . He wears them everyday . They 're lightweight and were comfortable right out of the box -LRB- no breaking in period -RRB- . The price is ridiculously low for a pair of leather Adidas shoes .
 Adidas are always true to size . I ordered the white satin with pink stripes-adorable !! They 're super lightweight . My fashionista 7 year old loves them . The price was way less than I could find anywhere else . I would have ordered the next size up if they had it .

 These boots are really comfortable and light . They feel like sneakers on my feet . I 've owned two pair and will probably buy another when I need them . The only drawback I 've found it that after much abuse the sole starts to fall apart , and I 'm talking about real abuse . The soles are very flexible and have great traction . I would recommend to anyone looking for light , comfortable boots .
 Fantastic boot ! Very light and comfortable . Not too hot . Does not feel like a safety boot . Great motorcycle boot , too !
 These kicks is tight . I was strollin ' down the block , and some female was all like , `` YO ! Those kicks is tight ! '' I was all like , `` What you know about these kicks ? I got ta show you wassup ! '' Then later on in the day , we hooked up . So this fresh gear is where its at .

 My husband loves Reebok Shoes.I gave him this pair for Father 's Day.He loved them !! The price was excellent!I will be looking on this site from now on when him or I need shoes !!
 I was really amazed from the pair of Reeboks I ordered online . I received the shoes within a very good time period and I really like how much the shoe fit without going to a store to try on a pair . That was very convenient for me .
 This it is one of the best products . I recommend it , I 'm very according with the purchase.Este es uno de los mejores productos . Lo recomiendo , estoy muy conforme con la compra

 Great boots ! Comfortable , stylish , great price !! I wear them everywhere .
 These are gorgeous suede boots . Very fashionable and an amazing deal . Highly recommended !
 Despite the skinny heel , these boots are well-balanced and very comfortable . They look fabulous , the shirring detail is beautiful .
 The ` leather ' does n't seems to be of the same quality as they have been since purchasing these for several years.Also the fit is different but still satisfied with the sneaker .
 I 've been looking for these great walking shoes forseveral years and could n't find them in the stores.And here they were on amazon . I may buy another pairin case they stop making them . They fit my feetperfectly with just the right amount of support and Iuse them on the treadmill and casually . Great buy !
 Comfortable from the moment I put them on . Plenty of toe room . My heel does slide alittle . I was not able to make them tight enough to prevent that .
 I bought these shoes for my mother and she loves them . I did n't realize she already had an old pair .
 Love these shoes , they tick all the boxes . I get a couple of pairs a year . Please do n't drop this style .
 I have worn this shoe for many years . It is the most comfortable walking shoe I have found . The only problem I have found with this shoe is that the sole at the heel wears out long before the shoe . I have have tried many other brands and styles and still like ES Romy best .
 these shoes fit my narrow foot perfectly . They are as described - best for light activities.I would highly recommend these shoes .
 I am a nurse and have been plagued with foot pain from long shifts of being on my feet . I had worn Easy Spirit walking shoes in the past and thought I would try another brand of walking shoes . I soon went back to the Easy Spirit Romy , I have a narrow foot and a high arch and they support my arch and since I have been wearing them exclusively I have had no more foot pain
 These are my work shoes and I bought them based on previous reviews . My feet have never troubled me , but the past two years or so they began to ache halfway through my day . I ordered these in a wide width and put cushions in them found at Wal-Mart . It has made such a big difference in the way my feet feel at the end of a long day ! I read on one review from a nurse that they are n't slippery when you walk on a wet floor and I disagree with that . I am just careful when walking on wet floors . I do adore these shoes -- they are very comfortable .
 I work in a construction office so sneakers are the norm . I 'd been struggling with minor knee problems and past experience let me know that changing my shoes from a `` shape up '' type sneaker might help since strain on the joint can be caused by alignment and shoes are often the culprit . So I went looking for a reasonably priced sneaker to wear at the office and decided on these after reading the reviews . I 'd also worn Easy Spirit pumps back when I needed to be in business wear , so I was confident about the manufacturer.I have to say , I absolutely love these shoes . Not only have they addressed the alignment problem with my knee and already started to provide some relief , but they were comfortable from the moment I put them on . They 're very lightweight , and although I do n't wear orthotic inserts , there 's plenty of room in the shoe if you need them . Which means there 's also plenty of room for say , a gel insole , if you 're on your feet all day and need even more cushioning , though there 's plenty in place already . I also need a wider shoe and although the C/D width looked a little narrow , it fit beautifully , so my wider foot feels good without looking like I 'm wearing the boxes instead of the shoes . I 'll be ordering several pair of these because as far as I 'm concerned they 're an exceptional fit and value .
 This sneaker is the most comfortabe , light-weight sneaker I have ever worn . There is great support for everyday wear and the lacing is easy to adjust for additional arch support .
 I cant believe i finally found a pair of shoes that work for me . These shoes are so soft on the feet , when working and walking on hard floors all day . My feet dont hurt after i get off of work . will be oredering more pairs . so happy with these shoes . thanks you easy spirit .
 I purchased these shoes for work and everyday as I like the Easy Spirit product line and they came in narrow . They fit well and are good for the work I do as I am on my feet and walking throughout the day taking care of patients . They also provide non-slip footing on wet surfaces .
 Have never been disappointed with Easy Spirit sneaks . Love the fact that they feel so comfortable the first time you put them on and every time after!I like the light blue highlight color even more in person . I have a wide foot and they fit perfect . Only sneaks I 'll wear !
 So glad to find this shoe on Amazon.com , and ON SALE ! I have ordered these shoes for several years and find them to be the most comfortable , long-lasting walking shoes one can buy ! I walk two miles daily for my fitness routine and they feel wonderful - nice soft thick soles , high toe box , overall comfort .
 I bought these sneakers and I have them for over 5 years now . They are just as good and comfortable as they were when I first bought them . Walking in these sneakers a mile a day walking my dog and not feeling the pins and needles is just OMG !! ... what a relief ! You feel like your walking on air . So that being said . I bought a second pair but in blue . It is always hard to find a sneaker comfortable enough for somebody who has a wide foot .
 Lots of room in the toe box and very supportive while also comfortable . Room for inserts which were neede cuz arch support not very high . Runs true to size ; I usually order athletic shoes a half size larger but not these .
 I ordered a pair of these about 1 year ago and they have been my main pair of shoes that I wear almost every day , they are THAT comfortable . It 's hard to find a comfortable pair of shoes for my wide foot that 's durable and not outrageously expensive , but Easy Spirit offers these in a wide width and it 's a very well-made sneaker.My first pair still have a lot of life left to them and I 'll continue to wear them for a while , but they have been worn so much that they do look well-used so I 'll keep them for running around outside and doing errands , and keep the nicer newer pair to wear to work every day.Very pleased with the price , selection , and quality of Easy Spirits shoes - I 'm happy to be a repeat customer !
 I 'VE USED EASY SPIRIT SHOES BEFORE AND ALWAYS BEEN SATISFIED . PURCHASING FROM AMAZON WAS EASY & THE PKG ARRIVED WITHIN A FEW DAYS .
 The shoes arrived soon after ordered . They fit as I expected and are of excellent quality .
 I am on my feet 4 to 8 hours for my job these shoes keep my feet from hurting . They are great !
 I really love these shoes . They are very comfortable and always look nice . This is my second pair . Thank you
 I 've been wearing these shoes for several years . I 'm a woodworker and stand on concrete all day , and these shoes give me great support . One of my feet has a large bone spur and I have bunions on both feet , and most shoes cause my feet to hurt . NOT THESE ! They tend to run a little large . I normally wear size 7 , but buy these in 6 1/2 . In the past I 've bought these shoes at Elder Beerman -LRB- Carson 's -RRB- . I checked their price and it was $ 26.00 higher per pair . When I saw the price on Amazon , I ordered 2 pairs . -LRB- plus free shipping and no sales tax -RRB- . I hope Easy Spirit never discontinues this shoe . LOVE THEM !
 I 'm on my third pair of these shoes , and I panic when I think I ca n't find more of them ! They are so comfortable on my narrow foot , and I would recommend them to anyone wanting a comfortable pair of walking shoes . Surprisingly , I wore them to my step-daughter 's , who is 750 miles away , and we found that we wore exactly the same pair of shoes !
 I use these for walking , the first day , they hurt my feet a bit -LRB- most shoes do until they get broken in -RRB- , but by the second and third day , I barely even knew they were on my feet . Sometimes I come home from walking and forget to take them off to put my flip flops on !
 Easy Spirit Woman 's Romy Sneaker is very light , comfortable and it support my ankle during long day walking at work .
 This is the first time I have ordered shoes online for myself as no two pairs have ever fit the same . After reading all the reviews on these I was glad i took the chance . Perfect fit and the width was great . Would not hesitate to order these again as since I have been wearing these have had no problems with legs hurting like i have with other sneakers .
 I have diabetes and I have not found a more comfortable shoe . I have tried other shoes including diabetic ones and they do not beat the comfort that these have , I feel like I 'm walking on a cushion . I absolutely love them !!
 These shoes were the 1st I 've purchased in a long time . My feet are short and wide . These fit the bill and are comfortable for long walks .
 I could not ask for a better fit.just my size and wide enough . Very nice style and colors the shoe came on time .
 I 've always loved Easy Spirit shoes , and have looked many times to find a pair that fit . My feet have grown over the years to a size 10 . However , most 10 's now do n't fit . So looking for a 10 1/2 is a tiresome search . Shoe manufacturers seem to think that if a 10 is too small , how about an 11 ? Size 11 shoes are like `` boats '' on me . I needed a 10 1/2 . Finally , while doing a search once again , I ran across Easy Spirit Romy sneakers in my size . 10 1/2 medium is a perfect fit , and I love them . When I get a little extra cash , I 'll probably order another pair so I have them handy when my others get beat up . It 's always nice to have a clean , good-looking pair of tennies on hand . Thanks , Amazon and Easy Spirit , you made my day .
 It is so hard to find shoes in Wide Width to begin with much less comfortable . Well I hit the jackpot with these ! These sneakers are cushioned , light weight , roomy toe box and nice looking ! If they had these in another color I would buy them too ! My ankles and feet swell quickly but I found that when I walk in these sneakers , that does not happen . I highly recommend these sneakers .
 I received the sneaks on time when promised . The fit was as promised , true to size and width . They look great , are quite comfortable , and no problems after wearing them several times . I 'd get them again .
 lightweight and roomy . Very comfortable shoe . Would hightly recommend to walking enthusiasts . Also a stylish looking shoe and can be worn casually .
 Got these sneakers for Mom as a Mother 's Day gift . Easy Spirit makes great sneakers . An absolut must have for comfort and style . I wear Easy Spirit as well , these shoes are very and absolutely comfortable . I would highly recommend buying for men women or kids .
 I LOVE these shoes !! I bought a pair when they first came out and liked them so well , I have been buying and wearing them ever since . They last longer , look better and are much more comfortable that any other sneaker I have ever had . They come in a wide range of sizes , which works well for me as I have small feet . If you have never tried this shoe , you are really missing out !!
 This is my third -LRB- possibly fourth ? -RRB- pair of ES Romy 's and they are , by far , the MOST comfortable walking shoe I 've ever worn . Each pair has held up remarkably well and never felt `` broken down '' - even tho the soles clearly indicated otherwise . I highly recommend them .
 This is the second pair of these shoes I have owned . The first pair is still going strong after a couple years . They have a few scuffs , but are still acceptable casual footwear . I get lots of compliments on the new ones . I work somedays 12 + hours in a busy doctors office seeing 100 people a day . These shoes have never hurt my feet , and I am over 50 yrs old .
 I purchase these shoes for my 81 year old mother . It is n't easy to find her size and width . We were very pleased with service hope you can help us again .
 I love these tennis shoes . This is my third pair and they are Easy to walk in and I think they are terrific .
 These shoes are very comfortable and nice looking . They run a bit large . My shoe size is a 7 however with these 6 1/2 fit comfortably .
 I bought these shoes for my mother for her birthday because she LOVES them ! True comfort . Upsetting that you ca n't find them in Macy 's any longer .
 Love it very comfy ? My wife runs in it daily she loves it and she had bought another pair since .
 I received these sneakers right before headed out for a 5 mile walk . I opened the box at the walking track at the lake . I felt positive from the reviews on these walking/running sneakers on Amazon , and was not dissappointed . I felt like I was walking on air , or in bedroom slippers . I love , love , them and will only buy Easy Spirit for now on . They are lightweight , nice looking and comfortable . One tip for women , measure your foot like suggested and buy the right size , not what you `` wish '' your shoe size was . You can not go wrong with these sneakers ! Walk on Ladies !!
 I usually do n't stick to one brand of shoe . I was having problems with my feet -LRB- stress injuries -RRB- , so I tried Easy Spirit 's Romy Sneaker . The shoe was very supportive and gave me the `` cush '' that I needed for my Zumba classes . I later injured my Achilles through a fall and I continued to use Romy . I like the fact that it comes in different widths which accommodated my orthotic in support of my surgery . It has been a year since my surgery and I have been back to Zumba for 6 months . Love these shoes . My feet are happy .
 I alway 's buy Easy Spirit sneakers.I love the Easy Spirit Women 's Romy Sneakers that i bought.I only wear sneaker 's . I had hip replacement two years ago . I do not take any chances wearing anything but sneaker 's ... Easy Spirit sneakers , from the moment you put them on your feet , they fit great.I truly love them !!! Through the years i have bought other brands of sneaker 's ... no other sneaker 's can come close ... Thank You Easy Spirit !!! I bought them from Amazon and as alway 's the customer service is fantastic.Delivery was right on time as always ... Thank You Amazon !!
 I love these sneakers . They are totally consistent . They 're the only shoes I can order , put on and walk 3 - 5 miles without even feeling like I have on New Shoes !!! These are no different ! A real pleasure !
 I have bought this shoe at departments store for years . It was wonderful to be able to just order it on line . It is comfortable , very durable and gives great support for walking .
 Love them . . No need to break in.These sneakers are so comfortable.I will not buy any other brand.I use them for everyday , walking , and working out .
 Good product , lasts long , light weight , this is about the 4th pair I 've bought in a few years . I do a lot of walking up and down hills with my dog.The package was promptly sent . Thankyou .
 I ordered these sneakers in June 2010 . Since I also put arch supports in them I got a half size bigger than I usually take . Lots of cushioned support and light weight too . . If they come in black I would order another pair for the winter .
 I have been a nurse for 28 years . These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had . I have tried others but always come back to the best . They are long lasting , and clean up easily . I would recommend them to anyone who has to spend hours on their feet .
 This not the first time I have bought these shoes , they are fabulous especially if you have a high arch .
 Shipping was speedy . Packing was good . I 'm entirely satisfied . Easy Spirit shoes ca n't be beat !
 I love Easy Spirit shoes , expecially the Level 1 tennis shoe like Romy . I have Fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy and this is one shoe that not only feels comfortable on my foot , but it does n't put pressure spots on the foot while walking . The Level 1 Romy is the only closed sneaker I can wear comfortably . I would recomment is for anyone with sensitive feet .
 These are everything they claim to be , comfortable , supportive and easy to wear right out of the box .
 THIS IS MY THIRD PAIR OF THESE IF YOU HAVE WIDE FEET THESE ARE GREAT I USE THESE FOR EVERYDAY & WALKING THERE ARE ONLY TWO PLACES I CAN FIND THESE
 I have wide feet . They are true to size . I can even sleep in them . I walk and stand sometimes 12 hrs . This shoe is light weight and comfortable . I highly recommend this shoe to anyone that has had a problem in the past finding all day comfortable shoes.Shipping was good and they arrived just as pictured and stated . I am exceptionally happy with my purchase .
 This is the third pair of Easy Spirit Romys I have owned -LRB- wore the first two pairs out -RRB- . They are great for everyday use as well for long walks . They are light weight , so very comfortbale and look great . Would rate as probably the best all around sneaker .
 I have been having problems with my feet lately and it has been hard to find comfortable sneakers . I have a bunion starting and it can be painful . My Reebok 's were aggrevating this everyday when I walk for thirty minutes on my lunchbreak . I have a wide foot and need a shoe to accomodate this . I saw these Easy Spirit Romy 's and thought I would try them . I purchased an 8 Wide and have never owned such such a comfortable shoe . I have just purchased a second pair so that I can have a backup when my first pair wear out . I also compared prices and these are over $ 50 everywhere else I looked .
 I bought these for work . I am a nurse in an outpatient surgery center . I spend 8 full hours on my feet and these shoes are great ! They are comfortable , supportive and non slip even on wet floors . I would recommend these to anyone .
 These are the only shoes that I can fast walk in . I walk 5 miles a day . After a while other shoes tend to rub my feet . The Romy have plenty of room , a thick cushioning and are very well made . I love them . I wore the last pair I had for 1 year and hated to throw them away because they were still comfortable . but I figured that after a year it was time to get a new pair . You ca n't go wrong with these shoes .
 Love them !!!! I am Extremely satisfied with this pair of Sneakers !!
 For about 9 months out of each year , I walk/dance behind a lawnmower for anywhere from 5-8 hours a week . I enjoy being outside , it 's good exercise , I get to listen to great music and I get my property mowed . For years , when I 've needed new yard shoes , I 've gone to Walmart and gotten the cheapest I could find . After all , they 're for YARDWORK , right ? I was n't going to be on a public jogging trail where people could actually SEE me ! Then , each time I spent hours behind the mower , I came inside and my feet were killing me - and killing me for HOURS later . So , I bought inserts and gelsoles and all sorts of crap , thinking that was the problem . Finally , the light bulb went on
 I have forefoot pain and this is a perfect shoe ... very cushioning and the wide width is great . You can even wiggle your toes in them . I did have to order a 1/2 size larger than I usually wear because on this shoe the big toe hit the tip .
 I love this shoe because it is lightweight , fits very true to size and goes with everything . I like to be comfortable and look stylish and this shoe fits the bill . It 's very low profile and easy to clean - just wipe with a little soap and water . I wear them just about everywhere and definitely recommend this shoe if you are looking for a wide width . My foot is average in wide width and this is one of the few shoes I 've found that fit my foot perfectly . I wear athletic socks with this shoe and can be on my feet all day with no problems . This is my second pair of Easy Spirit Romy 's .
 My foot size is 11 AAA . Since I have a hard time finding athletic shoes in a triple A , I tried the AA . If I tighten the shoe strings really tight my heel does not slip . The shoe is actually comfortable when walking in them . Toward the end of the day though I have to loosen the shoe strings alittle because the top of my foot starts to hurt due to walking all day in the shoe . A very pretty shoe that looks really cool on the foot !
 These shoes are very comfortable . I only use them for exercising -LRB- mostly walking on a treadmill -RRB- . I had been experiencing foot , ankle , and shin pain during and after exercising , but once I switched to these shoes , that pain stopped . I am very pleased with this purchase !
 I have been wearing these sneakers for years , plenty of walking and playing tennis . Absolute comfort and nice looking ... love them ... hope they never stop making these !! Prices vary on-line .
 Most comfortable walking shoe . I have purchased this shoe for the past several years and would not consider anything else
 Easy Spirit discontinued my favorite shoe . A lovely customer service representative who works for Easy Spirit spoke with me via phone and offered five other shoes I might like . This shoe seems to be an excellent choice for me even having one new feature that makes it better than the previous favorite . The two choices of the final openings for the laces give me a tighter fit in the heel section .
 Great for walking on treadmill . Really comfortable . True to size . Would buy again . Makes my workout easier . Bought two pair .
 I have never ordered shoes before , and I was a little nervous that they might now work . They arrived right on time , are a perfect fit and very comfortable.I appreciate Amazon.Thank you
 As always , these shoes fit as expected and are very comfortable . Great shoe for the price . Can not beat the price .
 Love , Love ! they are so comfortable ! I have bad arches and theses sneakers are so good on my feet ! And my order came fast ! well worth it !
 They fit very nicely and feel great ! If they wear well -LRB- too soon to tell -RRB- they will be the ones I order over & over again !
 I love the shoes they are exactly what I was looking for , great Christmas gift !! They had the best price on the internet , as I did alot of research on these shoes . I will shop with them again !!!
 I really like these shoes , because they are real leather and it is hard to find sneaker made out of real leather anymore . They are very comfortable .
 This shoe is probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn . I can wear it all day long , with no discomfort . I normally have some problems with my back and feet ... not the case with these shoes . I wear a wide shoe , and this is just great . Lots of room in the toe box , no rubbing anywhere
 In April I went looking for a new walking shoe to wear in Italy . I have major problems with my feet and ankle and needed something comfortable . After trying on just about every shoe in each of the stores , I bought these shoes at the mall . When I decided to get another pair , I could not find them . I finally found them on Amazone and bought two pair . They are the most comfortable shoe for me and I 'm now thinking of purchasing a few more pairs for the future . -LRB- Jerry 's wife -RRB-
 After looking for a long time , I came across these shoes at a price that was reasonable . Lots of cushioning on the bottom , which is what I was looking for . I use these primarily for walking or working out at the gym . They are comfortable , and true to size . I like them very much . I would recommend them .
 I was able to buy this shoe at a great bargain . I loved them the moment I put them on . That is saying tons because I have a large bunion on one foot and a history of plantar fasciitis in both feet . I was able to buy wide enough for my duck feet .
 I love , love , love these shoes ! They fit perfectly and have lots of cushioned support . Excellent for walking or any other type of excercise .
 I bought these tennis shoes for a trip to Disney World , which requires major walking ! Needless to say , they did not disappoint and my feet were so comfortable the entire 11 days ! Highly recommend ; one of the most comfortable tennis shoes I have ever worn .
 I had been looking for Easy Spirit leather walkers to replace ones which I have worn and washed for nearly 8 years . I could n't find them in the stores . Finally I found the ones I needed on Amazon . They are true to size and last a long time . I had bought another label here on Amazon and did n't really like them , but kept them because I could n't find the Easy Spirit I truly wanted . Now I am finally satisfied . Good work , Amazon !!
 This is an extremely comfortable shoe . I 've been wearing them for years now . Love them !! Only problem is that they are getting hard to find ...
 I have worn these shoes for several years . Unfortunately Easy Spirit has apparently discontinued this model so I am buying them from the secondary market . These shoes are the most comfortable things I 've had on my feet ... Even better than my slippers !!!!!
 I 'm not one to order shoes or sneakers from the internet since I usually have to try them first . I have high arches & somewhat wide feet which makes shoe buying a chore . I 'm a pediatric nurse working 12 + hours a day so my feet , knees & back really feel the aches by the end of the day . After researching online different shoes & sneakers , I decided to give these sneakers a try . I was tired of crocs which while I find them comfortable , tend to `` catch '' at times that I 've had to stop myself from falling . This sneakers are very comfortable ! I really like that I feel light on my feet and have a spring in my step ! -LRB- Corny I know , but true -RRB- Give these sneakers a try . You wo n't be disappointed .
 One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I 've ever had . I work on concrete all day and these shoes perform likechampions ! True to size , plenty wide -LRB- wide width -RRB- very comfortable and supportive .
 These are the most comfiest shoes I 've ever worn . I 've had a pair for the last 6 months and they are still in great shape , but I bought a second pair to use for running . They are extremely light yet supportive .
 If you have a narrow foot there are just certain companies where you can buy narrow sizes ... I am very pleased I have been able to purchase these on line and they are long lasting with a good arch support .
 These walking shoes are soooo comfortable . I bought my first pair elsewhere and just loved them . So when I located them on Amazon , I bought 2 more colors . They have wiggle room in the toe area which I really like and the instep is like a cushion , and they look really nice . Wonderful to walk in . Oh and the price is great . Definitely would recommend these and would definitely order again . Hopefully they do not stop making this style .
 I have now owned 5 pairs of this shoe . They feel like heaven the first time you put them on . I have been very hard on them and they hold up very well . I usually keep one pair as my good sneakers and retire my older pair for yard work .
 This sneaker not only looks classy , but it is truly comfortable . I do alot of walking and enjoy the romy fit . My Feet are Happy Feet !
 I brought this shoe because easy spirit mules are always comfortable to me . I needed som walking shoes that were wide enough not to hurt my toes which have a lot artheritis . These are comfortable and I am able to wear them all day long . Love this shoe
 I would buy these shoes again in a heartbeat . These shoes are so comfortable and durable . Very stylish .
 These are so comfortable , like wearing slippers ! Lots of support . Bought them from Amazon just before vacation , and did n't have any problems with blisters , nor sore feet from breaking in . There was no breaking in , period . Awesome sneaker . Fit true to size .
 I received the shoes within 3 days of placing my order . I knew they would be just right , and they are . I can wear them all day in COMFORT . I basicly only wear Easy Spirit shoes . Altho ' some are a little too large but with mini socks they are good to go . Will be ordering another pair as soon as I know if I will be on welfare or get my SS check . Politians , you know . Anyway , love Romy !
 Just received my new Romy 's . LOVE this shoe - this must be my 10th pair . So many great things about this shoe . First , it is very comfortable . I have small bunions on both big toes and the toebox is the perfect width for comfort . Not so wide as to be sloppy and not so narrow as to be too tight . Just right . Secondly , the shoe is amply cushioned/padded in all the right places . I have never gotten a blister when wearing this shoe . I wear it every day and walk/run on my treadmill for 30-45 minutes . Do n't know how it would hold up for heavy running . The arch support is also excellent . Last , but not least these shoes are extremely affordable . They compare very favorably to other more expensive shoes I have had . I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone who needs a pair of comfy , affordable shoes .
 I honestly have to say I do n't like to purchase shoes over the internet , due to not being able to try them on , however , this was a winner ! I am on my feet for 6-8 hours a day on a concrete floor , and these shoes feel like bedroom slippers to me . I have Red Wing & Reebok , but honestly these are the most comfortable .
 I have wide , hard to fit feet and these shoes are great ! Nice and roomy and very comfortable .
 I love these shoes . They are so comfortable . I have several pairs . Delivery service has also been great . Thank you !
 I purchased these shoes for my mother and she absolutely loves them . She is a mall walker and they support her feet very well .
 These sneakers are a great fit , true to size . I put them on and completed 50 minutes of cardo on my treadmill . Walk , fast walk , trot and sprint . Good buy for the money .
 I have been wearing this version of Easy Spirit for many years . They are ligh weight and sturdy and are comfortable from the first day until the last . They hold up after lots of washings in my machine . Hard to find WW shoes and these are one of my very best foavorites .
 The shoe did not fit . Although the size was as ordered is was too large for my foot . Quality was good .
 These shoes are very light and comfortable and fit very well . I walk a lot and they will be enjoyed !
 The shoes fit me perfectly . I can put these on without breaking them in . I wear these while performing aerobics and will recommend these to my aerobics class mates.They -LRB- shoes -RRB- are very comfortable .
 they are the most comfortable sneakers for me . i would recomend them to anyone who wears sneakers most of the day .
 These shoes are so extremely comfortable . They are like walking on pillows . I love them . I would definitely recommended them to other women wanting to buy new sneakers .
 I have always enjoyed wearing Easy Sirit Romy Sneakers , they are the only shoes of this type I can wear .
 The easy spirits are the only shoes I can be comfortable at work . I have had numerous foot and ankle surgeries and I have to have somthing comfy

 I purchased these for my wife for Christmas . She has puchased this same shoe previously and has liked them . One of the main attraction is the wider widths . She has been unable to find them locally in the wider width so ordering them worked well .
 They are so comfortable and I love the cushioning . I have neuropathy and these are the only closed toe shoes I can wear . Good support ... wore them today at Walmart in Springville , Utah .
 These are the most comfortable sneakers . I have orthodics in them and it works well !! Please do n't stop making them .
 This is the best shoe I 've found for comfort regarding my plantar fasciitis . They provide excellent arch support too . I throw them in the washer and air dry them . This is my fourth pair .
 These are the first shoes that I can wear right out of the box and walk 2 miles without back , knee or foot pain . They also do not cause blisters or any other foot discomfort . Highly recommended .
 I have always bought a sport running shoe , but when I was having pain in my heel , I needed a comfortable walking shoe , and these have been great .
 These are the most comfortable sneaker i ever had , the padded in the insole is wonderful this is my second pair.Will order them again
 One word
 When I tried on these shoes , I honestly thought to myself , it 's like stepping on a cloud ! I tried on a couple pairs of other shoes just to make sure , but they did n't even come close to the comfort of these Romy sneakers . I have wide feet and slight bunions , so finding shoes that fit has always been difficult . The wide size in these shoes are actually wide ! And they have good cushiony support which was also important to me since I recently had some problems with my heel , around the achilles tendon , and my podiatrist said good supportive shoes would help . I 've had these for a couple months now and I still love them . I prefer to go barefoot or wear sandals around the house -LRB- I 'm a stay at home mom , up and down and on my feet a lot -RRB- , but I do notice less ache in my feet when I wear these shoes for at least part of the day .
 I am flat-footed plus I had a club foot when born and therefore have some issues when buying shoes . When the Easy Spirits were first advertised I thought I would purchase a pair to see if they really are what they advertise . They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever purchased . If you are going on a long walk-run , shopping or on vacation , etc. and on your feet for an extended period of time then this is the shoe for you . My feet get tired and hurt after a period of time in my other shoes but this one I can wear all day and my feet and legs do not bother me . If you are looking for support then I would definitely recommend this shoe . I have , however , tried some of the other Easy Spirits and they do not fit my feet like this one so make sure you try the various styles on before purchasing because each person 's feet are so different . But as far as the Easy Spirits I do n't think you can go wrong when buying this brand of shoe . Remember your feet are your support and you want to be comfortable or the rest of your body aches from the result of shoes that do not give you the support you need . Another plus with Easy Spirit shoes is the price . They are the best price for the quality .
 I have a difficult time finding shoes narrow enough for my feet . Few shoe manufacturers seem to cater to narrow feet . Easy Spirit has not forget those of us with narrow feet and manufacturers a comfortable and sturdy shoe . The shipping was fast and provided a hassel free method to return the shoe if I needed to .
 I 've received so many compliments on this athletic shoe ! Not only does it feel great , it looks great ! Buy one ! You 'll be happy you did !
 This is truly the most comfortable pair of sneakers I have ever owned ! Order early for the best color selection .
 This is my first pair of Easy Spirit 's , having bounced around from many other brands . I find these lightweight and comfy . I have worn them a few times and so far , so good !
 This is the most comfortable walking/running shoe I have ever purchased . The fit is perfect and they wear really well .
 I already own a pair of these Easy Spirit sneakers , so when they began to show some wear from constant usage , what better Christmas present for myself than these super comfy Easy Spirit sneakers !
 True to the size in the fit of the shoes and very comfortable . I look forward to taking my daily walks in them
 Like this shoe . It 's my third pair . Recommend it for comfort and support . HFC Why are you requiring me to say 6 more words ?
 These are the best sneakers I have ever bought . . WOW ... They are perfect . I wear them all day long . They do n't sweat my feet they do n't ache my feet and they are so comfortable ... I am very happy with Easy Spirit . If you wear sneakers all day long buy these you will very happy . VERY !!
 I have always been a Reebok fan for athletic shoes . Lately though , they have been lacking the old styling and support I had come to expect . I read all the reviews on these Easy Spirit shoes and decided to take a chance on them . SOOOOOOOOOO glad I did ! They are true to size , feel spectacular - lots of padding and support esp . for walking extended periods and the quality is there in the stitching as well . Give them a try and you will not be disappointed . Highly recommend for Treadmill use .
 This product was will worth the money . I have ordered the same shoes from other companies and paid alot more .
 These shoes seem very good quality . However , they are a bit hot , because they do n't breathe . And they are n't the most comfortable shoes ever .
 This is my 5th time purchasing these sneakers . They are the most comfortable sneakers and I am going to hate when they stop making them .
 This is the only sneaker I have found that works for me . I broke my foot a few years ago and have a very hard time finding a shoe that is comfortable . I am on my feet all day and never have any discomfort with these shoes .
 I really love this walking shoes . I read many good reviews about the Easy Spirit Romy Sneakers and I was really hoping they 'd work for me as well . I am very satisfied with the shoes . They are comfortable , and my feet get a lot of support . I really recommend them . Of course , the price and the two days free shipping for Prime members were good too ; -RRB-
 This is the third pair of these sneakers for me . I like the looks of the white and navy trim and it is a very comfortable walking shoe and also goes nicely with everything especially navy jeans . They have worn very well and been an excellent all around sneaker . I wear a size 7 in most shoes but found the extra half size in these to be a better overall fit for me . I think you will be pleased with the quality of this shoe .
 Ordered these for my mom at her request . She bought a pair YEARS ago and they finally wore out . She walks two miles daily and loves these shoes . She normally wears a 7.5 but is a 7M in this sneaker .
 Love these shoes . . No break in needed . Comfortable from the time I put them on . Like how they match mostly anything I might wear .
 I originally saw these on zappos and figured since they were Easy Spirit they would be more comfortable than my current nikes , which I regret buying . I bought a size 9 there but the shoe was a little big so I sent it back and was hoping to buy an 8.5 , but for a supposedly huge selection of shoes they have a limited amount of sizes . I started shopping around for the shoe and found Amazon had them . And they were $ 15 cheaper and in my size ! They arrived 2 days ahead of scheduled which was very nice . I tried them on and my feet practically sighed in relief and comfort . I am so glad I bought these ! Now I am enjoying my new shoes and considering buying another pair before they dissapear .
 I bought a pair of these Easy Spirit shoes at a brick and mortar store in June , 2011 and they were so comfortable I wore them all the time . When it was time to buy a new pair of tennies I wanted the same shoe and I found them on Amazon . I could n't be happier ... these shoes are extremely comfortable ; they have a good amount of cushion on the sole and tongue , and they fit snugly even though I have narrow feet . Plus , I really like the way they look with the green lace loops and the navy stripe on the sides .
 It is hard to find sneakers for a narrow foot . These are lightweight and super comfortable . Based on reviews read before purchase , I ordered a half size larger than normal , the fit is perfect . I would buy again . Previous to these I had a pair of Saucony sneakers , which were very comfortable . These are lighter weight and sharper looking !
 The only sneaker that I 've tried that doesnt have to be broken in to enjoy ! I fell in love with these sneakers the first time I tried them on and discovered how comfortable they are . I worn them till I couldnt wear them anymore , yes they can get ragged when worn everyday ! lolI went back to the website to order another pair and they were on back order only to be pushed back again so I tried Amazon and not only were they cheaper as in $ 20.00 cheaper but they were in stock ! They arrived quick but this time I 'm not wearing them everyday like I did before , yes I want them to last a bit longer than my first pair , lol!I highly recommend these to everyone , so please do not hesitate to order , you wont regret this purchase !
 This is my third pair of Easy Spirit Women 's Romy white , leather sneaker . It is comfortable the minute you put it on , gives good support and looks cool too . Being retired and living in the country , this is my shoe of choice almost every day ! Ordered it from Amazon and got it quickly too !
 I 've worn ES Romy shoes for years . They do n't wear out , just worn-in . That is , after a few years , the bounce is gone . That 's when you know to replace your shoes , especially if you walk/run in them , to avoid damaging your feet . So , I am glad that ES still makes the Romy , because I 've tried their other makes , & they do n't fit me as well as the Romy .
 I HAVE WORN OUT AT LEAST 4 PAIRS OF THESE WALKING . TTHEY ARE SUPPORTIVE AND CUSHIONED AND NICE LOOKINGFOR VERY REASONABLE PRICE .
 I have wide feet -LRB- E width -RRB- and they 've been sensitive ever since I had plantar fasciitis a few years ago . I do n't have time or energy to search a dozen shoe stores for good quality shoes in my size , so it 's really wonderful to be able to order them online . The Romy shoes I received a couple of weeks ago fit perfectly and are very comfortable - no squeezing my toes , no pressure points . My feet actually do n't hurt after wearing them all day , even after quite a bit of walking . I 've already ordered another pair , and am going to try another Easy Spirit style .
 Have been wearing sneakers for 60 + years and this is the first pair that was comfortable right out of the box ! Wore out one pair / 2-3 years of wearing and so pleased to find them still available . Roomy toe area , no heel rub . Have arthritis in low back and this sneaker makes long -LRB- 4 + mile -RRB- walks much less painful . I toss them in washer/cold water and hang to dry ... look like new every time .
 I have worn Easy Spirit shoes for over 10 years . I have found I can always depend on pure comfort , without a `` breaking in '' period when I wear a new pair of Easy Spirit Athletic shoes . I walk between 55-65 miles per month and will wear nothing but Easy Spirit !
 Theses sneakers were just what I was looking for . Leather with good support . I wear them every other day . They are roomy enough for thick socks and comfortable when walking on mall concrete floors . The price was right , less expensive than they would be in a store and free shipping . The only thing that bothers me about them is the laces . They tend to come untied easily . They may be too silky and slide out of the tie .
 I am a nurse in a med-surg hospital , and am on my feet for at least 12 hrs . a day and need comfortable shoes ! I have found that these are the most comfortable shoes I own ! I have purchased more expensive shoes and end up wearing my old Easy Spirits ! They are light and have good sole support !
 These kicks is tight . I was strollin ' down the block , and some female was all like , `` YO ! Those kicks is tight ! '' I was all like , `` What you know about these kicks ? I got ta show you wassup ! '' Then later on in the day , we hooked up . So this fresh gear is where its at .
 Today I recieved my World Insutries Shoes . They are awesome . I just got back in from skating with them on ... WOW . They are very comfortable . Worth every penny .
 I was amazed at the level of comfort these shoes offer . They 're great for a day of walking around sightseeing and shopping . I plan on buying another pair .
 It took a bit of adjusting to get used to the additional soft footbed but once I got the straps right , these are incredibally comfortable ; in addition , they look a bit heavier than conventional Birks , but the looks go away as soon as you wear them . It feels as though there is additional arch support , not just additional footbed , as I can walk continuously and feel great . I would highly recommend these .
 This is my first pair of Birks , and I love em . They fit my feat to perfection and you ca n't beat the price here . Well worth the money as they should last for years to come . I did n't find it at amazon , but I bought the Birk shoe care kit for $ 20 elsewhere .
 This sandel even though is marked as narrow fits more like a regular . Otherwise the product is fine .
 I am purchasing another pair of these . I used them when I went to Spain and this is all I wore . It was very comfortable to walk in them over extended periods of time . They take about 2 weeks to get use to , but they are amazing .
 birkenstock samdals were shipped immediatly and received right on time and in perfect condition . very happy with product and service .
 I have a wide foot and sometimes have trouble finding comfortable shoes . These shoes are incredibly comfortable and great to walk in .
 These sandals are quite comfortable once you get the correct size figured out . The conversion chart did n't work so well for me and I had to return 1 pair and order a larger size . It 's just one of those things where the European conversion does n't always translate well , especially if your feet are n't entirely symmetrical . The sandals are quite comfortable and soft . The only drawback is I feel I should have opted for the sandals without the heel strap . I like to be able to slip in and out of sandals quickly . Although the strap is comfortable and holds the sandals on quite securely , the leather is still hard enough that I have to give quite a tug to release the strap and I spend more time than I would prefer `` slipping in and out '' of these . As a result , I still wear my crocs a lot . It 's not just laziness , I had spinal surgery so it 's harder for me to bend over like that . :-LRB- I think I will order another pair of these , only without the strap . Again , these are VERY nice and if you do n't mind spending a couple seconds with the strap , get these !
 I bought this sandal after I broke my toe , and I wanted a sandal with toe protection , and I was n't disappointed . This sandal is really comfortable . It has great arch support and a nicely coushioned sole , and it is both cute and functional . Looks great with shorts , capris and pants , but a little too `` clunky '' for skirts . Very sporty .
 Great Sandal . I wanted something that could go to the beach , in the water and on short hiking trails . It fit the bill and was perfect for our Maui vacation . After a week of much use , they still look like new and are attractive and very comfortable as well . A purchase well made and prompt delivery .
 I picked up a pair of these ` ugly shoes ' for $ 10 at an off-season sale 2 years ago . They have turned out to be the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn in my life . In fact , these are the only flipflop I have ever been able to wear and the nice thing is that they do n't LOOK like flipflops . I reached for these sandals again today -- and it 's below freezing outside ! -- so I am online now -- hunting MORE -- just in case I actually wear mine out .
 The comfort and support these sandals give are unlike any flip-flop I 've ever tried . They feel much like a full hiking sandal with the heel strap unfastened -- which is how I wear full sandals , anyway . Traction is great . They feel good wet , and are also quick-drying -- soggy sandals are a pet peeve of mine , which is why I usually bring an extra all-rubber sandal for water activities -LRB- sacrificing support -RRB- when traveling . No need for that now.A great bonus is how they fit my feet perfectly . I 've tried other Keen footwear and I 've had problems finding a good fit . The big toe protector is usually too small for me - not good since I frequently get ingrown nails . No such complaints with the Waimea . I also think they look pretty cool , and can be used as all-around casual footwear -LRB- I find some Keen sport sandals and shoes to be pretty ugly and purely utilitarian -RRB- . I 'm very happy I found these sandals .
 I got the `` pumice '' color which is a pretty light gray with blue details , not stiped like the black sandal shown . Protection for the big toe , comfortable to wear immediately . Machine washable . I am very happy with these sandals .
 The Keen Waimea is , according to a Keen spokesman , is the newest iteration of the Keen Antigua . It is also the single greatest sandal ever fashioned by the hands of men , women , or the gods . There is a popular myth spreading among wearers of the Antigua/Waimea that it was actually the sandal of choice of many important historical figures , including Plato , Homer , Pythagoras , Nefertiti , Alexander the Great , Buddha , Jesus , -LRB- recent research also points to Muhammad as a fan -RRB- , Mary Queen of Scots , William Wordsworth , James Dean , the bulk of the undefeated 1973 Miami Dolphins defensive crew , and Stephen Biko.I have owned a pair of Antugua 's for nearly three years now and they 're still in wearable condition . This after backpacking across West Africa with a nearly 40 pound bag for three weeks , through the streets of Mopti , the cliffs of the Bandiaga Escarpment , across the sahel , to Elmina Slave Castle , the largest waterfall in West Africa , and a delicious ice cream shop in Bobo Dialasou.Keen says these are just a Spring/Summer shoe , but they 're off their rockers not selling this shoe year round . Whoever came up with the no-stub toe protector clearly deserves a MacArthur Genius Grant and an enthusiastic pat on the back . And the cushioning and durability of these shoes leaves absolutely zilch to be desired.You 'd be insane to buy any other sandal if you actually intend to spend a lot of time wearing them . Get your & * % ^ together and buy a pair of Antigua/Waimea 's .
 Today I recieved my World Insutries Shoes . They are awesome . I just got back in from skating with them on ... WOW . They are very comfortable . Worth every penny .
 These kicks is tight . I was strollin ' down the block , and some female was all like , `` YO ! Those kicks is tight ! '' I was all like , `` What you know about these kicks ? I got ta show you wassup ! '' Then later on in the day , we hooked up . So this fresh gear is where its at .
 item arrived on time size was bigger than my wife needed but my daughter was able to use them so we will keep them anf i bought something else for the wife
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- .

The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter .

 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition

 I really like these shoes ! I just bought them at a local retail store and was looking on here to see if I could find them cheaper . I 've always loved Asics running shoes because they are so comfortable on my feet . But the main problem with my old Asics is they 're dorky looking for casual wear . These new casual style of Asics fit my feet like my old shoes and actually look great too ! They are very lightweight and almost feel like I 'm not even wearing shoes . Unlike running shoes , these are very thin and offer very little little support . Lots of shoes make my feet look big , but these make my feet look sleek . Workmanship appears good but I do n't think they will last as long as other shoes because they are so thin . Normally I would n't pay $ 70 for casual shoes but I did this time because these are so comfortable and good-looking . If you like Asics running shoes but want something better looking , I highly recommend these shoes!Update 10-2009Well I 've had these shoes over 5 years now and they are still in good shape . Granted I do n't wear them on a daily basis any more but I was really surprised how well they held up given how thin they are . Hope I can find another pair once these finally do break down ...
 The shoes might not look comfortable in the pictures but it is comfortable on your feet . Sleek look !!
 This pair of shoes he said feels like bedroom shoes he says they are so comfortable . .
 My little guy loves these shoes . Although the lights on one of them do n't work like they are suppost to . He loves them
 I 've always loved the wide toe box on Saucony shoes but went from a motion control -LRB- too rigid -RRB- to this for the perfect balance -LRB- stability & cushion -RRB- . Have used these in all kinds of weather -LRB- snow , rain-they dry out fast , road , trail -RRB- and have always felt I was on sure footing . Not too bouncy or rigid and they 've worn well although the mesh uppers by toe area wear out fastest . I also have shin splints -LRB- chronic problem -RRB- and these have been great at limiting the stress to my shins . I recommend these for high mileage runners -LRB- they are a bit luggy for sprints -RRB- .
 My knees were killing me and my toes were ate up with blisters and black toenails -LRB- gross I know , but you long distance runners know what I mean -RRB- . My shoe guy put me in this shoe and voila , no more blisters and no more sore knees -LRB- well , it was n't quite voila as my knees took a little while to adjust to the change in mechanics and heal up and the toes are still healing , but it was plenty quick for all that -RRB- . Anyway , I 'm in heaven . I did n't realize I was an overpronater , well I thought I was , but did n't realize how much a shoe could help . Also , these shoes are a little small -LRB- as are all running shoes -RRB- so size up a little to avoid the toes thing . I 've run 3 half marathons and 2 marathons in these in less than two months . Hurray for no more sore knees . The 15 miler and half marathon right before that in the old shoes were terrible . I 've saved those old ones for short trail runs in the mud . Btw , my shoe guy recommended inserts for these as he says the ones that come with the shoe wear out really quick .

 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 These shoes are one of a very few I have been able to wear all day without a break-in period .
 These are great looking shoes that are very comfortable to wear . For the price , you just ca n't beat them . They can be worn in the office or in a more casual setting . They are so good , I am ordering a second pair .
 The shoes are excellent and very comfortable . I have been using them for a week since they arrived and they fit like a pair of gloves .
 I bought these shoes , mainly for work . They look good with jeans , and I was getting tired of the adolescent look of my Vans . They 're comfortable to wear , they have a soft sole that does n't make hardly any sound when you 're walking , even on hard floors . I do n't know why I like that , but maybe you do too !
 I have an extra wide foot and a job that requiresme to be on my feet a good deal . These shoes havebeen remarkable . Like wearing slippers .
 These shoes were on sale and were a good buy ! Comfortable and good looking I 'm pleased with the purchase .
 The leather is soft . Materials are high quality . Craftsmanship is perfect . The bottom is like sport shoes , but the top is like dress shoes . I can wear it with jeans , khaki or even slack pants . But the best of all is that I can walk all day long at work without hurting my feet .
 Those pair of shoes are so comfortable , i just need one of this kind to care my feet .
 What else to say ? Good value for this decent brand . Comfortable and true to size . Flawless delivery , too .
 Good quality , but not true to size :--LRB- My husband usually wear sise 11W , but this item - Clarks Men 's Portland Oxford , Black Leather , 11 W - bigger ...
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a
 Tremendo zapato Clarks entrega rapida buen precio comodo y de buen material se recomienda el producto saludos desde Venezuela ...
 There was absolutely no complaints involving this product.The quality is top of the line!Now this product was shipped way to the Caribbean , it came wonderfully packaged and intact.I would suggest this product to anyone who 's looking to invest in great quality at and affordable prices .
 este producto esta bien en la condiciones esperadas , entrega por el vendedor a tiempo , sin ning&uacute;n problema segun lo requerido gracias , lo recomiendo .
 This pair of shoes is very comfortable and met my expectations . The photos however does not show exactly how the shoe looks and feel .
 Why oh why did they discontinue this shoe . What a great basic shoe for everyday . I replaced it with a J&M shoe which i got a great deal on because i work with them on some things and it is a good shoe but not exactly what i liked like this one is .
 Excellent fit , no breaking in , just put on a go . They are like walking on pillows , ca n't wait to but another pair of Clark 's .
 I ordered this as a replacement for a pair I wore out . It took me several years to go through the first pair . These feel good but may not be as sturdy as my old ones . I 'm going to give them a few miles test walk then may go up to the 5 stars .
 Im on my feet all day on concret floors . The shoes carks are like walking on air ... I would buy them again for my next pair of shoes in the furture ... Eric Philadelphia Prison
 I am very happy !! i do n't have any problem , everything is okey , i recommend , i got this item at time
 I was looking for a strong pair of shoes that would be worth investing in . Look no further . I trusted the ` Clarks ' brand and i was duly rewarded . This shoe is waterproof to an amazing extent . It also has nice stitches on it that hold it together very well unlike other shoes which use glue . the insides are made for comfort and really take good care of your feet on long working / active days ... I can attest to that , I 'm a high school teacher .
 They are so comfortable that they feel like tennis shoes to me . The actual color is darker than what they appear online .
 I have had these shoes for about a year now & they have been wonderful . Very comfortable & despite heavy use , they have held up well . Great if you do a lot of walking .
 I grew up wearing Clarks shoes . And had forgotten how comfortable they actually are . Well , i received my shoes today , put them on , and was immediately reminded . These shoes are terrific ! Amazon should have a category for people who are thoroughly satisfied with any given product . For anyone looking for total comfortability and style , you can not -LRB- repeat , CAN NOT ! -RRB- go wrong with these shoes . I was so satisfied , i purchased another pair -LRB- different kind though -RRB- . Amazon gets props for such a speedy delivery.Tarikh Bandele .
 Shoes arrived quickly . Bought husband 's regular size and they fit very well . Sturdy , strong leather . Very good arch support . Good heel height , very comfortable . Would buy them again .
 I have been wearing this for quiet sometime now . About 4 + yrs . . on and off It felt like tennis shoes from day one and still is.I always wanted to buy an ECCO Men 's Track II . I had tried the Ecco -LRB- my firend 's -RRB- but to tell the truth , these shoes are even better . I have worn it to showel snow and in hot sun . They are the best shoes so far I ever had . Good to see that it is still in the market without any design change . If at all the current pair wears out , without wasting time I will repeat the purchase : -RRB-
 I meant to try these on for a few minutes , but had them on for an hour because I kept forgetting to take them off . Usually I ca n't wait to take off a pair of new shoes . I 'm impressed .
 These shoes are nice to wear , leather is supple and appears to be good construction . Although I wish it was made in the U.S.A. it is made in vietnam . The sole comfort on your feet is not the best , ok i guess but i think dockers are more comfort . Perhaps it has to do with the outer rubber sole ? These have a sort of V design tread which is kinda weird to have as far as everyday shoe . More flat designs are more comfortable . Improvements Needed
 This is the second pair of these shoe I have bought . I bought these because the first pair felt comfortable all day . I stand and walk about 75 % of the day . These shoe maybe just a little heavier than some walking shoes but you will enjoy them .
 VERY COMFORTABLE , GOOD LOOK , AND WARM SHOES , RECOMMEND , MOSTLY FOR THE PRICE . FIT TO SIZE . IT IS VERY GOOD!THANKS .
 These business casual shoes do n't scuff even if you drag your feet , and are very light and comfortable . I would buy them again !
 I purchased this pair of Clark 's shoes for a two week vacation through Eastern Europe . They were a very good choice indeed . They were low impact and really comfortable due to the high quality insoles , medium grade leather and great construction . This pair of shoes took me from Prag in the Czech Republic , Minsk Belarus , Riga Latvia , Kiev Ukraine and then to Milan Italy . I have only one reservation about this shoe . They squeek like rubber duckies due to the soft plastic like inserts under your heals . This is a top notch stylish product . Do n't pass them up.Alan Light
 Estoy muy contento con mis nuevos zapatos . Estoy ansioso por las nuevas rebajas de Clarks
 I had this shoe for 2 years and are very comfortable.Wore them for Beach , play and lot of things.Now colour is slowly coming out . I can polish and wear them again .
 I 've been buying the same Oxford shoe for years . If you want a good walking shoe that is comfortable and looks good the Portland Oxford is the one you want . I wear the heals out after a year but I walk about 7 miles a day in all types of weather -LRB- rain , snow ... etc -RRB- . The only thing I do n't like is they are made in Vietnam , I wish they made them in the USA .
 It is comfortable , great for outdoor . But it is a little biger than its size . And overall the shoe is quite heavy .
 My husband has been very pleased with these shoes .
 we recently brought these shoes from amazon and they are great comfortable shoes to wear . The postage and packing was good as well and arrived about the time they said they would . will definitely buy agagin
 This is a good conservative shoe for wearing to work . The leather is soft and the stitching is consistent . The tab in the back makes it easy to pull the shoes on if you have n't loosened the shoelaces totally . So far there are no visible scuffs after about 10 wears .
 I bought these Portland shoes in brown because they look classier than the other pair I was considering , the Rockport World Tour , which look okay in black but does n't cut it in brown for anything much more than casual dress . But since I do own the Rockport 's in black and chocolate nubuck , I can make some comparisons to the Clark 's . The Rockport 's are lighter and slightly more comfortable thanks to the softer leather and cushier sole . However despite their firmer sole the Clark 's are still very comfortable in their own right , and I experience no problems even after hours of walking , it 's just that the Rockport 's are like walking on a cloud versus the firmer feel of the Portland . Another difference is the removable insole - the Rockport 's is thin and cheap versus the Clark 's thicker and more supportive unit . Though I had to replace it with my custom orthotic -LRB- which has less padding -RRB- , I suspect that if you have normal feet , leaving the stock insole in place would go a long way to countering the hard sole.Despite the sport-stripe loop at the heel of the Portland , the shoe is classy enough to be worn with anything less than a suit , whereas the Rockport 's are slightly more casual . So , if you favour class go with the Clark 's ; if you want comfort above all go with the Rockports .
 The shoes were just what i was looking for i think clark has stopped making that model shoe received the shoes in a couple of days great service
 I am addicted to Clarks shoes . I was looking for a strong pair of shoes that would be worth the money . Look no further , this pair is durable and really care for my foot . The shoes is very comfortable specially when wearing it for long hours , and they fit my foot perfectly.Another thing , is the price . I got this shoes after paying a visit to my local `` Clarks '' labeled store to find the same shoes on display for approx 170 $ in Dubai !! And that was it for me . I managed to get the shoes shipped to me and the total cost -LRB- including shipping -RRB- was less than half the price of my local store .
 This is the second pair I 've ordered , and that in itself should say something . I 'm on my feet almost all day four days each week , and a car accident left me with a bad back . Together , these two things could be a disaster , but the shoes have made all the difference . They 're comfortable and supportive , they cushion your feet against the hardest surface , and they actually look pretty good . I 'll buy a third pair when the time comes if they keep making the shoes this well !
 First shoes i ever ordered online and i 'm happy with the purchase . Shoes are very comfortable , not stiff leather . I 'm just happy to find the shoes that fit my personal style and my size !
 My husband says these are comfortable , but is a little less enthusiastic about them than the other Clark 's I 've bought him . I purchased three pairs of Clarks at the same time , all on sale , and the other two fit better while this pair ran a little large . He wears them , but not very often , because they feel too big .
 Very comfortable . Light weight , water resistant . I ordered the extra wide . It 's a bit wider than the normal W size . I should order the regular one instead . Overall , it 's very good .
 I got this as a gift for my husband . Everyday he comes home talking about how comfortable these shoes are .
 These are very comfortable shoes , hold up well to the snow here in Wyoming . Somehow , the seam that goes around the upper border of the toe box makes them look a little cheap . Otherwise , these are really very comfortable . I can wear these for 14 - 16 hours in a day and my knees and feet are not aching at the end of the day so I am willing to accept however they look for that reason alone .
 Bought these for walking trade shows and work days , but good for casual evenings too.Very comfortable and nice looking .
 Suffering from real foot pain due to years of working on my feet . Tried &#34; Rockports &#34; which were n't bad , but would regularly cause blistering or hot spots . These shoes are probably the best I 've worn for comfort . I bought a brown and black pair and wearing them daily to work has completely eliminated the sharp pains I 'd occasionally get in my feet . The manufacturer seems to use high quality material both inside and out . I think you will be pleased with these shoes if you work in a professional environment but need that extra support for long hours on your feet . Great buy !
 excelentes zapatos , lo recomiendo 100 % , son muy comodos , la compra se realizo sin problemas y el envio fue inmediato no duden en comprarlo
 Excelente producto y por eso es la calificacion que le otorgo al vendedor y tambien fue entregado en el tiempo estipulado . Los recomiendo 100 %
 This is my clarks 's shoe.I like it , it 's fit for my foot and comfortable.it 's worth to buy it.I think that i &#34; ll buy it next time .
 I THINK THAT THIS IS LEGEND AND IT IS VERY COMFORTABLEI LIKE IT AND ITS VERY NICE THANK FOR ALL
 They are much lighter than they look which was a surprise and a good one . They are very comfortable . I looked and looked and could not find any shoes like this . The Chukas were too heavy and bulky .
 I bought tbese for my dad who is suffering with severely swollen feet and legs . He has been to several stores trying to find a pair that are wide enough and has not had much luck . I got these in the extra wide size and he is just thrilled to have a pair that actually fit and look good .
 excellent craftsmanship
 This is an excellent pair of shoes that will last . The sole -LRB- heel section -RRB- of my current pair is about half worn -LRB- but still very wearable -RRB- , but get this , this is after 7 years of almost daily wear , including long walks along the Vegas strip in various types of terrain . If I do n't look at the shoe bottom , my current pair is still looking new , since this pair of shoe is easy to keep looking new with only simple occasional maintenance -LRB- I clean and polish with some brown oil only once every few months -RRB- . It is also very stain resistant , as on a couple of occasions I got it dirty with a few scratches and I thought the shoe is now looking worn , but after cleaning and polish , they turn beautiful again and the scratches disappeared . I was amazed ! I even went out and bought a 2nd pair for future replacement , as I 'm very picky about my shoes . If you want a pair of shoes that looks descent and will last , then you should n't go wrong with this .
 I bought these shoes for my husband because he goes through shoes so quickly . He had a pair of these several years ago that he would still be wearing except our pomeranian chewed them up . Most shoes we buy him , even expensive name brands , seem to fall apart after just a few months . These shoes however last for years and are really comfortable . They are definitely worth the price .
 My husband has had a pair of these shoes in the past and really liked them . They size well , wear well , and are comfortable from Day one . Amazon outdid themselves with their pricing and very quick delivery ; ahead of schedule . Paperwork was enclosed in case there needed to be a return , but these were absolutely what was described and what my husband ordered . We would use them again !
 Previously purchased this same Clark 's Portland Oxford model several years ago . They were getting a little worn so I purchased this new pair . Hope that when the new pair gets worn out Clark will still have this model available . Its comfortable and well made . It is great value for the money .
 This shoes is beautifull , very comfortable , very flexible , leather genuine.Me encanta este zapato , es muy comodo , muy flexible y puro cuero de verdad.Clarks = Confortable
 I bought almost the exact same Clark 's shoe years ago , It lasted forever until the outside soles finally wore down . The upper body is still ok.Its comfortable and sturdy with a good fit . Good price as well .
 Cowboy boots do not fit the bottom of my foot , the shoe platform and insoles do on these shoes . So I wear them to do cowboy chores in and they have taken the abuse of work boots . More comfortable than any boots . Cowboys say the fit of the shoes to the hoof is very important.Sore hooves , no horse . Same with our feet!It 's all about COMFORT and DURABILITY .
 these shoes are very comfortable , the quality is excellent , the size was perfect and the shipping was very fast , I am very pleased and would definitely go back to trust this brand
 Clarks shoes are the best , stylish , comfortable , fashionable , for any occasion . used for all types of terrain and climate . my husband prefers all the features mentioned above . I recommend it . thank you very much

 fue una buena esperencia de haber echo negocio con ustedes y espero que sigamos haciendo negocio , el producto es bueno la talle fue exacta tonto que lo seguire comprando
 That shoos one of the best I buy ever high quality almost I have it more than 24monthe and stile in good shape .
 Comfortable . lives up to the reviews although probably the plainest -LRB- ugly -RRB- Clarks I have ever bought . And good value . If you just want a comfortable pair of shoes to walk in these will do it . I have had problems in my feet and frankly Clarks walking shoes mean that do n't have to spend money on orthopedic shoes .
 I like them . They are a little dorky looking but perfect for work . Very comfortable and great price , i recieved them on the earliest possible date , which was great !
 I love these shoes ! First , they are comfortable . I stand for most of the day , and the souls of these shoes are made perfectly , such that I can stand without leg aches . They are also comfortable when you are walking . The second great thing about these shoes is that they look good . They are in that range between casual and dress shoes . You would not wear them with a suit , but they are great with a pair of pressed slacks and a dress shirt . Finally , they last . The shoes are well made and do n't fall apart . The other thing I love about these shoes is that they come in Narrow . I have a narrow foot , and it is very hard to find narrow shoes . This is the best pair of shoes I have been able to find that come in narrow .
 Very well made and seem durable . I would like to inform those of you with flat feet that the portland oxford has a very high arch support insert . I 'm 100 % flat and these shoes are impossible to wear with the inserts that are provided . I replaced them with a set of the leading tennis shoe inserts and now it 's the perfect shoe !!! I 'll probably order the black in the near future .
 Excellent shoes , very confortable and they look good . Exactly what you would expect from clarks . Would recomend them to anyone looking for a light and confortable everyday shoe .
 I must admit , that I do n't have that many shoes , but have more than I need . I 've had these over a year now and do n't use them as much as I wanted to , because they are not the best looking -LRB- or probably not my favorite ones -RRB- . However , they do not look bad at all -LRB- they are just not trendy , but hey
 I live and work in New York City , which is a walking city . I work for a non-profit at the United Nations , so I need a shoe that is comfortable and appropriate for work at the United Nations . This is my new favorite shoe . It fits well . I got a 10 N. Most shoes no longer come in narrow sizes , so it is a real treat to have a shoe that actually fits my feet . It is comfortable , durable and looks great . Could n't ask for more . I 've tried many shoes looking for the perfect shoe for me . I 've had this pair for over a month and I 've found my perfect shoe for both walking and business .
 First time I tried on Clarks . Very nice looking shoe . Extremely comfortable right out of the box . Soft leather , padding below the ankles very soft . Only problem was the sizing is generous . Have to return the shoes but ordered one half size smaller . Liked them to much not to try again .
 Well made comfort shoesLike - Thick soft leather . Does not require wearing in - Very comfortable . Fits like a glove on day one - rubber sole has very good grip - leather is breathable - non leather material around collar makes it very comfortable for long walks . Good design . - leather is darker than pic . makes it suitable for business casual . Looks very good with jeansDislike - rubber on the heel has a very very slight hardness to it if you tend to land hard on your heel when you walk . Suspect because of the extra thick rubber padding at the heel for added durability - front design of shoe is a little flat and old school - retro `` grandpa shoes '' ; -0 ConclusionThis shoe runs half size big I think . Typical Clarks . I purposely bought my usual size so that I can add in an extra insole . It fits perfectly even with the insole.One of the most comfortable shoes I 've ever bought . Great Clarks design and quality .
 I received the shoes that fit what I saw in the picture when I decided to buy them . for which I am happy with my product and I recommend buying it !
 A great pair of shoes . The most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned
 Man , these shoes are comfortable , right out of the box . Similar shoes I have tried poach my feet ; these are comfortable after 8 hours on the job . I got really annoyed trying to find a wide shoe at all the usual places . `` These run wide '' they 'd say . I do n't need something that `` runs wide '' pal , I need a wide shoe . As a bonus , I found a place called Resole America that refurbishes Clarks , and have a had a pair of Clarks loafers resoled twice . There is n't a stitch out of place on them after five years . Great product .
 I received this shoe from UPS and very happy with it . This shoe was well made and comfortable . Only one thing that it made in china , so how long does It last I really do n't know . I will very happy if it made in england ... never , so sad .
 It iw a very good product i hope i has more less prices to make big market every where as it is very compfort , some of my friend will buy soon.thanks
 I have been wearing these Clark 's Portland Oxfords almost every day year round for the past 3 or so years and they seem to last forever . I recently bought a new pair only because of concerns that the style might be discontinued some day when they do finally wear out . Unlike many things being sold today , Clarks brand although a little pricey , are well worth the extra few dollars as they last forever and are extremely comfortable too .
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 It took a bit of adjusting to get used to the additional soft footbed but once I got the straps right , these are incredibally comfortable ; in addition , they look a bit heavier than conventional Birks , but the looks go away as soon as you wear them . It feels as though there is additional arch support , not just additional footbed , as I can walk continuously and feel great . I would highly recommend these .
 This is my first pair of Birks , and I love em . They fit my feat to perfection and you ca n't beat the price here . Well worth the money as they should last for years to come . I did n't find it at amazon , but I bought the Birk shoe care kit for $ 20 elsewhere .
 This sandel even though is marked as narrow fits more like a regular . Otherwise the product is fine .
 I am purchasing another pair of these . I used them when I went to Spain and this is all I wore . It was very comfortable to walk in them over extended periods of time . They take about 2 weeks to get use to , but they are amazing .
 birkenstock samdals were shipped immediatly and received right on time and in perfect condition . very happy with product and service .
 I have a wide foot and sometimes have trouble finding comfortable shoes . These shoes are incredibly comfortable and great to walk in .
 These sandals are quite comfortable once you get the correct size figured out . The conversion chart did n't work so well for me and I had to return 1 pair and order a larger size . It 's just one of those things where the European conversion does n't always translate well , especially if your feet are n't entirely symmetrical . The sandals are quite comfortable and soft . The only drawback is I feel I should have opted for the sandals without the heel strap . I like to be able to slip in and out of sandals quickly . Although the strap is comfortable and holds the sandals on quite securely , the leather is still hard enough that I have to give quite a tug to release the strap and I spend more time than I would prefer `` slipping in and out '' of these . As a result , I still wear my crocs a lot . It 's not just laziness , I had spinal surgery so it 's harder for me to bend over like that . :-LRB- I think I will order another pair of these , only without the strap . Again , these are VERY nice and if you do n't mind spending a couple seconds with the strap , get these !
 These kicks is tight . I was strollin ' down the block , and some female was all like , `` YO ! Those kicks is tight ! '' I was all like , `` What you know about these kicks ? I got ta show you wassup ! '' Then later on in the day , we hooked up . So this fresh gear is where its at .
 I bought these shoes for a two week trip to Italy where I knew I would be doing a lot of walking on uneven streets . I put them on my first day there and never took them off , that 's how comfortable they were . The leather was super soft and the rubber bottoms absorbed the shock of walking . Also they are very stylish and went with a variety of outfits . I would definately recommend them
 I wore these sandals from 7 am to 7 pm at a trade show - walked a million square feet in them ! They looked good and felt good all day . If they passed that test , a regular old day in the office will be no problem !
 Naturalizer Perth Slingback is a great shoe , very comfortable , the right height and the color was perfect .
 I love my Naturalizer Perth sandals so much that after I got them in white , I started searching everywher for more in other colors . I now have three pair of these , and they are the most comfortable shoe I own .
 These are my `` go to '' strappy shoes . For a quick trip to the store or a night out , I toss these on with anything and everything . The color is almost a neutral/nude , like a warm birch hue maybe . Because of this , they go with everything . I wear mine with skirts , dresses , jeans , ... I even wore them with a silk party dress for an evening wedding . They are as comfortable as tall platform strappy sandals could be . The platform itself is wood and natural . In the other colors , the wood is tinted slightly as to coordinate with the leather . I have them in red as well and it makes for a good combination .
 I really like these shoes ! I just bought them at a local retail store and was looking on here to see if I could find them cheaper . I 've always loved Asics running shoes because they are so comfortable on my feet . But the main problem with my old Asics is they 're dorky looking for casual wear . These new casual style of Asics fit my feet like my old shoes and actually look great too ! They are very lightweight and almost feel like I 'm not even wearing shoes . Unlike running shoes , these are very thin and offer very little little support . Lots of shoes make my feet look big , but these make my feet look sleek . Workmanship appears good but I do n't think they will last as long as other shoes because they are so thin . Normally I would n't pay $ 70 for casual shoes but I did this time because these are so comfortable and good-looking . If you like Asics running shoes but want something better looking , I highly recommend these shoes!Update 10-2009Well I 've had these shoes over 5 years now and they are still in good shape . Granted I do n't wear them on a daily basis any more but I was really surprised how well they held up given how thin they are . Hope I can find another pair once these finally do break down ...
 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country

 I own three KAVU bags , I get compliments on every one of them ! This is my favorite . It can become a large bag for unexpected carries or fold over for a larger purse . My iPhone actually FITS into the phone holder , big plus when you do not have to search for your ringing phone . I can bring diapers , wipes , cups and snacks for my 3 toddlers !
 I got this bag in a very timely manner and it was what it was described to be . I had no problems with delivery or payment .
 I really like the flexibility of this bag . For those days when I 'm traveling light I can cinch it down to a messenger style and for those other days I can just leave it uncinched and put a ton of stuff into it . The shoulder strap is very comfortable . However , the pink sketch color picks up dirt very easily and I do n't think I overly abuse the bag . The care instructions say to spot clean but doing so does not remove all the dirt . Also , after less than three months of use there is a tiny rip that has formed on the bottom of the bag . For looks and functionality I give this bag 5 stars but for endurance and maintenance I give it 1 star .
 These are super cute , but definitly not the height I am used to , but still comfy , just took some getting used to ...

 This is a wonderful bag for carrying around supplies for a project or two . It 's easy to see all your stuff and it stays very organized . Nice suede like material , too . Highly recommend .
 I bought this for scrapbooking . It fits EVERYTHING i need to take with me to crops plus a couple of extra things if i need them . Great accent piece to my mutlti chocolate dot creative options rolling tote and project tote . Other croppers are green with envy .

 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 The shoes arrived in a jiffy and were all that I 'd hoped they would be ... a little wider than those of my youth -LRB- because that 's the way I 'd ordered them -RRB- , still lightweight and comfortable , and with solid arch support . They 're good walkers without being bulky . They 're trim summer oxfords that do n't overpower the look of an outfit . I got a stony-beach scuff on one toe , so I washed it . It washed and dried nicely , but the toe is n't pristine anymore , so , I guess I 'll polish these sneaks just as I did in the '60s .
 When I was growing up , my Floridian grandmother only wore one kind of shoe that I can remember
 I love this shoe . It is the same style that I had twenty years ago . The shoe is light weight , comfortable , and durable . I would highly recommend them because you would not want to wear any other tennis shoe.Sincerely , csh
 SCREW WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING ! I purchased these and they came within 3 days . They are VERY comfortable , light , goes with anything you wear , and they are cheap . I bought some from Payless and these are WAAAAAAAAAY better : -RRB-
 This is probably my 10th pair of these sneakers . I wear them to death . Not fancy ... comfortable ... goes with all casual clothing and very `` smart '' looking . Very Audrey Hepburn .
 I originally ordered the wrong size . Amazon arranged an exchange and I am enjoying the sneakers . I always have a good experience with Amazon .
 I had forgotten how much I loved my `` sneakers '' back in the day when I routinely wore Keds . Now I am in love with them all over again . Great shoes !
 I was needing these shoes in a hurry and I was n't disappointed . Thanks for the great service and the condition of the package when it arrived was excellent .
 These shoes were just as I expected . They do seem to run about a half size small , though . They do seem well made . Thanks !
 I wore Keds as a child and loved them . I got these to wear with a poodle skirt because I could n't find any saddle oxoford shoes to suit me . I am looking forward to wearing my new Keds .
 The shoes came earlier than expected and were in good shape . They were brand new and in the box and the size was correct .
 I love the sneakers . They are better quality than the ones at Payless , and a good price too .
 Keds is known for quality and this show will not let you down . The only negative is that I purchased extra wide and it was no different than the medium width . There was nothing that allowed for my Mother 's wider foot to fit into .
 MY wifes all time favorite shoes and this is the place to buy them and you can save a lot of money from these people .
 These sneakers are very comfortable and I am very pleased with the look and price . I would highly recommend for a casual flat everyday shoe .
 THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS TOP-NOTCH , SAME AS THE SNEAKERS ! I HAVE BEEN BUYING THEM FOR YEARS AND WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE WHO LIKES COMFORT AND A GOOD PRICE .
 My new keds are so awesome ! They look exactly like the picture . I am so happy that I got these . They are comfy and stylish , and when they wear out , I will buy from amazon !
 These are cute , they stay tied , and there 's just enough slip to use these babies on a dance floor without having to spring for full suede bottoms . They also hold up well when you throw them into a huge dance bag and accidentally crush them in the trunk of your car .
 These are cute keds . My daughter has size 11 feet so it is hard to find shoes to fit her . These were just what she was looking for
 I love Keds and they 're always true to size , so nice to know I can order them here . I 'll likely order more .
 I gave these KED Sneakers a 5 Star rating because they are everything I expected and more ! Thrilled to pieces !
 I got just the right shoes I have been looking for they fit fine and look nice.Thank You
 The shoe was exactly what I was looking for and the price was better than on Keds own web site .
 These are extremely good sneakers ! I bought a brand new pair of black womens Keds Champion sneakers at a Sal . Army store I frequent quite a bit for only 4 dollars . These are great basic shoes . An older relative saw them and said they wore them during jr. high school in the 1950s as part of their gym uniform . I prefer these classic everyday shoes over something with more padding and more modern . These are very flexable shoes , the laces are better than other brands . These sell for around $ 30 generally . For that price I feel that makes them one of the most affordable shoes on the market . If you like old school Converse , Jack Purcell , Vans then I think you 'll be very happy to own these classic shoes . A lot of the skateboard companies make copies of these and classic Vans . Just go with the originals ! If I could afforf it I 'd own 10 pairs but am thinking about buy 2 more pair right now . The other styles Keds now makes look great as well . If you happen to go to thrift stores check out the womens footwear . I find lots of Keds there and scored another new pair for $ 5 about 2 weeks after finding these.These shoes feel right and work well for all activities . No downsides to these that I can see . 5 stars !!
 I am so happy with my keds . They 're my new go-to shows . I ordered a 7.5 -LRB- I normally wear somewhere between a 7 and 8 -RRB- and while they fit , I think I would order a 7 if I were to purchase another pair . Stock up on no-show socks when you order them and enjoy !
 Just what I expected and arrived in a timely manner . I have narrow feet and the B width fit pretty good , so you may want to keep that in mind if you have wide feet .
 I love these shoes - I wear them every day ! They fit great and shape to your foot . They are pretty basic shoes - no fills . They go great with jeans , especially the navy keds.Super comfortableEasy to cleanVery trendy - great qualityOnly problem - I have been wearing them almost every day for several months and they are starting to show wear around the toes .
 I searched all over for red sneakers , and boy , was RED hard to find ! Did n't find them in any store , so was very pleased to find them online . Amazon had the best price of any online location . Sneakers are very cute and comfy -- as Keds always are . Fit true to size . Very happy with my purchase .
 These Keds are hard to find anymore . They are the only shoe my diabetic mom can wear with comfort . She can go all day with these on and her feet are so sensitive .
 As far as I 'm concerned , this shoe is perfect . I bought the black with white laces . I can wear it every day , it 's cute , it 's comfortable , and it 's inexpensive . It goes great with capris , boot cut jeans , skinny jeans , and slimfit pants . You can wear them with or without socks , but I prefer the liners -LRB- no shows -RRB- with these . I 'll admit that I 'm newer to the Keds brand as an adult and so I ca n't comment on how much more comfortable they used to be `` back in the day . '' I wore this brand as a kid and to me they feel exactly the same as they once did . I 've probably become pickier in my older age and I still find these to have adequate support though they are quite thin . I had been buying Vans brand shoes that look very similar to these for years , but was getting tired of paying $ 50 for them . I do n't know how long these will last , but seeing as they are inexpensive , I wo n't mind if I only get a year or so out of them . One more quick note
 I have worn Keds sneakers for over 50 years . The quality is superb & the comfort is wonderful , whether wearing with socks or not . Highly recommend .
 I have worn Keds for over 50 years and I love them . The last pair I had had something different about the instep that was n't as comfortable as usual but his pair is wonderful ! I like them because they 're not bulky like a lot of the sneakers out there now !
 I grew up in keds , they have always been my favorite . Same great quality as always . Keep up the great work .
 Im 18 and these shoes are the style and there comfortable also . This brand has been around for a long time and there shoes are the best
 I need to change shoe size from 6N to 6M . You have no place to make a change . Other than that I like the on line ordering.George
 Love the sneaker and it fits well and worth the money . It is comfortable and great for the summer when you are out walking for leasure .
 They are the one pair of shoes you ca n't go wrong with . Wear them with shorts or jeans , always looks great !
 I 've purchased the navy blue keds size 9 . I usually have size 9.5 and that 's what I should 've ordered ; they 're a little tight . They work though and I love them ! They 're a cute light shoe that laces up so perfect for running around in the summer . Remember to wear socks with these because they will last longer and you wo n't get blisters on your heel like I did . I plan on ordering more .
 I can always get my narrow in width size - and the clean lines are perfect for all my casual needs . Mainly , though the size and width is perfect for me .
 My teenager picked these out . she loves them enough to wear them at least 2x a week and says they are comfortable . I like that they do n't show dirt .
 I love my new red keds !!! They arrived right on time and are perfectly amazing !! Thanks to the great price I even ordered another color !
 Love them , easy purchase , easy return -LRB- ran longer than I expected -RRB- I usually need a 7 or 7.5 but needed a 6.5 in this . Quick turn around on purchase .
 great shoe at a great price , classic shoe that goes well with just about any outfit , fits snug so may want to size up
 they were great while they lasted -LRB-
 A great sneaker . Good quality , as always . A present for my granddaughter . I 'm sure she 'll be delighted . . Best price I could find .
 OUTSTANDING ! it 's a happy day when my mom can actually find a shoe to fit her comfortably and at such a low price . She loves the color and comfort . Fast , excellent shipping .
 The fit is perfect.I also ordered the exact same pair in black . The Black and Navy are so similar in color , I really only needed to order the black . The color is exactly as pictured.Prompt arrival .
 These shoes are exactly what I wanted ! I needed a comfortable , light weight shoe for vacation and I came across these Keds and I am happy about my purchase . Super fast shipping , and a beautiful product .
 So far , good for my daughter . Comfort on the feet , no issues , just love the Endless Style , like other brand name shoes for women . She 's enjoying them . Happy Holidays .
 The brand `` Keds '' speaks for itself . But I got it at a great price and came in just a few days . Like the fact they come in different widths .
 My wife love these shoes . Thank you very much.They look good , and fit perfect.I would buy these again . Do you have more colors ?
 I have one of every color - like beige best - goes everywhere - little pricey for my pocketbook but they come in my size and width so I guess I will continue to buy them
 I like this shoe . It is simple and gives you a clean look ! somewhat stiff in the beginning . Made out of cotton and does get dirty , but for the price . . I like them alot !
 These are great to throw on for shopping or running errands . No complaints . They have improved the sole since the last time I purchased them .
 After always wearing athletic shoes , I finally returned to my beloved Keds . They are just what I needed to wear with jeans and shorts to avoid the messy , clunky look of my big feet in athletic shoes . I really like the graphic color because it is so neutral that I think will not shoe dirt as much as white ones do .
 These are classic black gym shoes . We needed plain black gym shoes for the school play . These shoes were perfect .
 They are just right for my flat narrow feet , i will be wearing these shoes all summer -- they go with evrything.Elaine
 these are really just what I wanted - classic and clean lines , Unfortunately too small , although I ordered my usual size 9 medium . so I had to return them .
 I received these shoes quickly after my purchase and they fit the description and picture and were exactly what I wanted . They fit well and look great .
 Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado . Muchas gracias . Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.Saludos desde Venezuela
 I 've grown up wearing Keds . Mostly the white canvas Champion Sneaker . It 's always been my go-to shoe . They have become rather expensive in the stores these days . Being retired I do n't have extra disposable cash so I watch for good sales . Amazon always has good sales and good sellers . I got my Keds economically and I have happy feet . Thanks to Keds and Amazon .
 I ordered these in a wide width because the regular ones always seem to make my feet hurt . They are comfortable .
 i have a pair of light pink keds that i 've had for 10 + years . when my 17 year old daughter said keds are cool again , i decided to get a pair of red . buying from amazon i saved a bunch , and they still fit and look the same quality as my originals . i love them !
 I was so happy to receive it on the day it camebecause my other sneakers was worn out becauseit was torn , and I finally put my other sneakers inthe trash because I finally got this new sneakersto wear .
 I ordered these for my mom . She has always wore these even when she was a waitress . Both pairs she wares all the time . Shipping time was excellent !
 I wear these all the time ! I really like that they came with the yellow and white laces . They have become a total staple in my wardrobe . Comfortable , cute , and versatile .
 Wife had liiked for these particular sneakers for months . the 4.5 size was imposible to find in stores . We will increase our purchases on the internet and especially at Amezon in the future
 I love these shoes . Very cute , simple , classic style . The graphite color is very versatile -LRB- comes with white laces if you do n't dig the yellow -RRB- . Some arch support for comfort and good structure to the shoe . I would n't run a marathon in these shoes , but they are perfect on the weekends or vacation , when you be doing a good amount of walking but still want to look cute .
 Keds are good quality and very comortable . These will last a long time . They have good width and arch support .
 I 've been eyeing the graphite colored Keds for awhile now and I am not disappointed that I finally bought them!I am normally a size 9 to 9.5 in shoes , and because of the loose fit from a previous pair of size 9.5 Keds , I went with a size 9 . So they fit perfectly . I 've worn them walking around the city a few times and have had no pressure points/no blisters/no sore spots . That 's the ultimate test for me -- comfort in walking . Well , they definitely passed the test .
 My wife said she was n't able to find Keds anymore so I looked on Amazon and there they were . Got a pair and they were just like the ones she had thought were discontinued . THe frist pair we got had a smudge on the heel . Amazon made the return easy and new pair arrived in a day . They were perfect ! My wife is happy being able to find the Keds and I am happy with Amazon 's great service .
 I just purchased my old stand-by , traditional Keds from Amazon . Loved the price -LRB- $ 20 cheaper than the Keds site -RRB- and they arrived at my home within 3 days . My feet are happy to be in their old comfortable standards . Thanks
 I love my keds . In fact they are better then my converses . Best decision I 've bought online . The price was a little high but worth it
 I love these shoes ! This color goes great with any outfit , and is great for any season ! They are a must have shoe :-RRB- . Like all keds , I typically order a half size smaller .
 Comfortable!Love it ! Looks great with skinny jeans . DId n't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand . . oh wells . Love it ! looks so clean and cute .
 THE KEDS SHOES WERE GREAT . THE GIRLS LOVE THEM AND THEY ARRIVED WHEN SAID.WOULD ORDER THEM AGAIN AND PROBABLY WILL .
 Love these leather oxfords ! I have worn them continually every day since I got them 3 months ago and they show no wear and tear even gardening , no dirt sticks to the leather although I washed the laces . They have no insoles but are comfy as is , flat shoes as what was described . I cant find them locally so viola here on Amazon ! Keds company is perfect if the shoe is the wrong size or color re
 These little tennis shoes are the most constant think on the market today . They are ALWAY comfortable , they machine wash up great ! I could walked for days in them because they are so light . I LOVE MY KEDS !!
 I absolutely love these Keds , I bought them for recruitment and thought I 'd never wear them again . I normally buy Vans but did n't want to spend that much for shoes I did n't want . I was very wrong ! Love these , wear them all the time and intend on buying more Keds !
 The quality and the outlook is good , but it 's kind of longer at the tip of the shoes and make it loose when I walk .
 I wear a 10 and it is hard to find shoes and sneakers that fit . I ordered a 10W -LRB- wide -RRB- and they fit perfectly . They fit so well that I feel they were made especially for me.The canvas is great and seems very durable . They are very comfortable and easy to walk in , especially compared to my old clunky sneakers . I will buy KEDS from now on.I also bought the same shoe in white leather -LRB- 10W -RRB- and that sneaker runs a little larger . I can slip into the white leather sneakers if I 'm not wearing socks , but I can not do that with the black canvas one.NOTE
 I wore my old black ones out and the navy were a great deal -LRB- under $ 20 -RRB- . Super comfortable , exactly what I expected .
 I had to break into these shoes before they got comfortable , but shipping was fast and it 's a great price for the quality of the shoes . I 've never had Keds before so idk if it 's quality has gotten better or worse , but you get what you paid for .
 Great item , it is excelent for gift or any event you made , i totaly recommend it , i just love it .
 I never know , when buying shoes over the internet , if they size will be right . These shoes are true to size , good quality , and fit perfectly !
 dice que soy muy c&oacute;modas , ellas es de pie ancho y se las compre a la medida , creo que por eso las valora como excelentes .
 these sneakers are perfect to use for an exercise class or at the gym . they are lightweight and very comfortable
 I loved absolutely everything about my pair of Keds - excellent throwback to my elementary school years - however , they were a tish too narrow for my big flippers so they had to be returned unfortunately.The yellow laces definitely gave the graphite color a pop that made the Keds cute and fun . I might hafta order this in a wider size ... : D
 I have no idea what everyone is talking about when they say that these are poor quality . They appear to be the same exact keds that you would buy in any store . I 'm not sure if the other reviewers received a different shoe , or just are n't familiar with ked 's . Also , the sizes are the same as normal ked 's . I regret listening to the reviewers who said that they run small . I ordered a half a size up from what I normally wear , and they 're too loose . I 'll keep them anyway because they 're so inexpensive , but I wish I had n't listened . Probably unrelated , but I ordered these on friday at 8pm and chose one day shipping and they arrived saturday morning at 9:48 . Excellent shipping .
 I 've always wanted to wear Keds , and now I finally can ! I have wide feet , so they have always been to tight width wise . I 'm so glad I was able to find them in wide width . Love the low rise of the shoe , love the look . The only thing I would change is making the inside a bit softer , and maybe more support . But I still love them !
 I love love love these shoes ! I have wide feet , and sometimes it 's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet , but these shoes are so perfect ! I think I will buy a pair in every color now !
 I love Keds tennis shoes . Denim is very hard to find and I 'm thankful Amazon is so easy to shop . No muss , no fuss . Just find the product and someone brings it to your door . I must say , though , that there should never be s & h charges on anything . Bank rates and credit card rates are getting too difficult to live with without having to considering s & h.
 This is the only way to shop !! The shoes were great , they fit , and we had them in a couple of days !! I could not find these red Keds in any stores near us so I went to Amazon and found them in seconds . We had them so quick-I was shocked !!! Thanks Amazon !!
 I was hoping to order these in 10 1/2 , but that appeared to not be an option . I have a difficult time with many shoe manufacturers not offering my size . I use extra inner soles & that helps , but I wish my size was available .
 The quality does n't look as good as I hoped - you can see the glue and a space where the base is attached . I bought these looking for something that might hold up a little better than the cheaper canvas shoes I usually buy at Target - hopefully they will last a little longer otherwise they may not be worth the price . On the other hand they fit just right and are very soft and comfy on my feet . I like the color and the lining and stitching look pretty good .
 The size fits perfectly , the color is exactly like the picture , and above all it 's super super cute.Makes me want to purchase another color !
 I 've been wearing Keds champion sneakers for years and years . Would not consider buying anything else ! Thanks to Keds for a great product .
 Sure , Keds are n't made like they were back in the day , but for the price you really ca n't complain . I got these to wear casually since I did n't want to shell out double the amount for similar shoes , and I love them ! There 's no arch support , but that 's nothing some insoles ca n't solve . After a few months of wear -LSB- even to dances and the gym -RSB- , my Keds still look pretty new . However , beware people with wider feet ! These shoes are a but narrow in the toe area .
 Keds have always been good sneakers . These seem to have lived up to that . Since they are white , they did not wash well but I discovered if you dry them in the dryer , the streaks that show up when you air dry them disappear .
 These are great run around shoes and camping . Light weight so you ` renot logged down on short hikes . Don.t show dirt and i , ve washd them in the past . I wear 8.5 N andthese shoes fit pefectly . Nice navy lighter than shown but not toolight . Avazoncame through again for me . Jakjaneus
 I love my new keds , Ive never owned a pair , only heard about them/seen them . I have worn them off and on for the last 4 months and have to say them feel awesome and look great with just about everything !
 Searched local stores , this shoe and no where to be found . Ordered on Amazon , and it is exactly what I wanted . I am extremely pleased .
 SALUDOS , LAS KEDS WOMEN 'S CHAMPION BASIC OXFORD SNEAKER , SE LAS TRAJE PARA MI ESPOSA , Y QUEDO MUY COMPLACIDA Y AGRADECIDA , POR QUE LAS ZAPATILLAS RESULTARON SER MUY COMODAS Y A LA VEZ ELEGANTES , POR LO TANTO SE LAS RECOMIENDO , BYE .
 el articulo me encanta . . me parecen demasiado lindos ... y me llegaron en perfecto estado ! muchas gracias por sus servicios !!
 Anyone that wear Keds knows that they are great shoes . Got these for my wife and she likes them . Great looking shoes that offer solid support for you feet .
 I have been wearing KEDs for over 50 years , love them . They were exactly what I odered , no problems
 I ordered my Keds here because they were available in the size AND color I wanted - which never happens elsewhere . It 's hard to find shoes I like that fit my feet because I wear a smallish size and have really deep insteps . But here , I was able to get exactly what I needed - 7 extra wide , red . I 'm rocking them with all my favorite outfits and I will definitely be back when I want more .
 i love my sneakers . i have to say that one of the things i like is i can wash them and i have never had the problem of the front of the insole coming apart
 So comfy and goes with any outfit . Great for everyday wear and you look cool too . I literally wear them everyday .
 product received as was ofered . no problems with it and satisfaded with the order . also came on time as expected .
 Love them have been wearing Keds for yearsand they never let me down . My 10yr old daughter also loves hers .
 i love these . if you are getting them , get your EXACT size . really comfy . GETTING MORE . happy buyer , and more to purchase !
 Best fit I have had for these shoes would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a soft play shoe . .
 These shoes are cute and convenient . I pair them with jeans to do chores like grocery shopping , or when I go to the movies . They do n't really have arch support so I wo n't be wearing them for long walks.They do fit a little differently and are narrow , but it works for my feet . I would not recommend these shoes to people with wide feet or who plan to use them all day , everyday .
 I have had these shoes for probably 5 years . They are still fully functional . I have owned Vans for that length of time and they have worn out in the first 2 years but Keds are extremely good quality . I have bought different colors but they never fail me . They are comfy for walking . Although , I have found out if you are walking long distances that they might strain your feet By long distance I mean a couple of miles . But overall , I love them and they are definitely worth the price .
 a lot longer than i thought they would be . but a nine would be to small . but they are nice . just wish they were n't so long .
 The Keds sneaker met my expectation . It is comfortable and is of good quality . I 'm very happy with the fit and overall comfort .
 My grandaughter is so pleased and happy with her shoes . They are awesome as she wanted . The article came on time for a day she has to used . Good service , excellent pruchase
 Purchased these for my 75 year old sister who had been looking and looking for some navy keds . She loves them .
 Great quality for the money . Hate the heaviness of most tennis shoes , these are light weight and good support without making my feet feel heavy
 Worn keds my whole life . Still love them . This is my daughters second pair of black . Think it 's so cool that as a teenager she wears them .
 Wonderful product , great quality ! I just ca n't say enough about how much we love them ! If you are on the fence about getting these , do it , you will not be disappointed !
 I love these shoes . Because of my knees I need a shoe that is totally flat and Keds fit the bill . I like the black/black style because it looks less like a tennis shoe . They wear very well and clean up easily .
 These cute , white Keds are perfect with so many outfits . Their slender sillouette adds a feminine touch to jeans , shorts , capris and summer skirts . They are comfortable for walking around town and give a much simpler profile than most sneakers these days .
 I am a fan of Keds and have several pairs of Keds shoes on different colors . They are true size and fit my feet very well . I wear them every morning for exercise and got much compliance . Highly recommend them for active women .
 I love these shoes ! And after you get them broken in -LRB- takes a little while -RRB- , they are adorable and comfy ! But they are definitely not for people with wide feet . They seem to run a little narrower than shoes I normally buy . But they 're fantastic shoes nonetheless !
 Keds is a classic and never goes out of style . It is always hard to find my size , 12W , but I found it here with no problem . Would recomment to everyone !
 I ordered the wrong size shoe and talk about ease and no worry return and order of correct size . I know no matter what I order from AMAZON.COM my transaction will be easy and I will be completely satisfied . I like that since I hate shopping . Amazon.com makes it easy to shop and the prices can not be beat . I will use Amazon.com for everything I need . I also feel safe using a credit card online knowing Amazon.com protects my information .
 These Keds are everything the seller described . Size runs true to form , they are extremely comfortable and look great !
 These white Keds -- the same wonderful shoe I wore all through my childhood summers -- are still a great value . They are lightweight , easy-care and comfortable . Every girl and woman should have a pair in her wardrobe .
 This is exactly what I was looking for . I have looked in all the local department stores around where I live and I have n't been able to find any , or if I do find Keds shoes , they do n't have this style in my size . I will definitely order again when this pair wears out .
 These little sneakers , as I call them , are just like bedroom slippers ! Wonderful purchase price and service.ThanksS . Wells
 these are just like they have always been . comfy , good looking and long lasting .
 i like them a lot , but there not likethe old school keds , with the terryinside . were can i find some orange colored keds ?
 I really like the Keds sneakers . . I ordered Navy and they look black . I would order again but in another color .
 The Keds Champion style has been around a long time . I have worn it many times throughout my life . I wanted denim , so I ordered these . The denim is somewhat difficult to find . Not everyone carries it . One drawback I noticed . It has been years since I have worn this style and it is not as supportive as some other Keds styles . However , I am sure I will enjoy it . A comfortable shoe with almost no break-in needed .
 Love these shoes , they 're so comfortable ! I 'm kind of inclined to order one in each color ;-RRB- One thing that should be noted - these have no arch support so if that 's important to you bear that in mind when ordering .
 Love these shoes ! Have been wearing them all my life and still think they are the best ! Great price and super fast shipping ! Could n't , t be happier !
 I wear Ked sneakers always and I was over joyed to find this show at such a low price . It is just as expected , great quality and reliable shoe !
 Keds Shoes are worth the money , i will buy again as long as the price does not go up , excellent
 I love this product and I received it in a very timely manner . I have absolutely no complaints except maybe it 's my fault I got white keds because now they are pretty dirty haha but I knew that would happen . I recommend everyone get a pair of shoes like these ! And from this site . Just wish there was free shipping ...
 Pros : Came BEFORE they said it was going to be deliveredQuality is greatCons : Beware of the size you get ... I got the 8.5 A and I did n't realized A meant narrow and when I say narrow , I mean VERY NARROW ! Thank god my feet are very narrow or they would be too small!Great product overall ! -LRB- :
 I received a different color from what I ordered , but I like them . Ca n't go wrong with Keds !
 the keds fit perfectly . Usually I am leary about ordering shoes without trying them on , however these fit well and I am pleased with them
 I love anything denim . these sneakers are great with jeans . They feel a little big but not unwearable . thanks
 I love my new Keds sneakers . I have lots of colors to wear with different outfits to work . Getting ready to order acouple more pairs . I recommend using Amazon highly ! Never have had a problem with them .
 I wouldnt go as far as to say they were a fashion statement but I love these sneakers for daily walks during lunch . I used to get disouraged from walking until I found these and realized that my feet actually dont have to be soar after I walk , I just needed sneakers that fit well for me . I also bring them when I go shopping for extended periods like mall shopping . the looks are deceiving , they are nicely made
 These sneakers are great . Super comfortable and fit really well , esp . considering they were bought online ... Keds are well made I think , and they were delivered to my door in a short time . . a little pricey , but well worth it
 I purchased these for my daughter . We actually had a hard time finding these in any store where we live . Delivery was timely and item was as described .
 Quick delivery brought my much needed white keds to me . I had my old pair for 7 years and they were falling apart . These are my favorites and I love the new keds logo showing on the side of the shoe rather than on the back . Very cool for keds ! What else can I say , for 40 years + , keds classics have been there . I could n't wait as a 7th grader back in the & * $ @ 's for my first pair and ditching those orthopedic white oxfords saddle shoes ! Oh happy day ! Been wearing them ever since . Now they come in a rainbow of colors -LRB- and new styles , too -RRB- but the white keds will always be a classic in my wardrobe !
 These shoes have always been my favorite standby for summer . They have been around for years and I always have a pair or two in my closet .
 This is a great shoe for lindy hop ! It seems all the girls in East Coast swing use Keds shoes . I was having a problem because I have wide feet . I could not find wide width Keds in the local stores around my town . I was worried about the fit , so I tried my size on at the store of the med width , just to get an idea of the length to make sure I order the right size . I have worn them to several dances and they work and feel great . There is no need to get suede put on the bottom of these , they spin just fine on the dance floor . I am very happy with these shoes !
 I purchased blk/blk and absolutely love it ! I got 8W becasue I have wide feet but when I received it was bit too wide . I 'm going to get regular instead of wide next time I purchase my second pair .
 These Keds are a classic ! Our school has uniforms , so they look great with any solid pants or with shorts . They 're also really comfortable to wear without having an overly athletic feel . Love them ! And , they come in a million different colours , haha .
 I was delighted to find out that Keds still makes the sneakers I bought as a kid . I just wore out the last pair I had -- I purchased extras at least twenty years ago , so have n't had to look for new till now . Well , almost the same sneaker ... These do n't seem to be made to the same last as the old models ; they are n't quite as good a fit , but are still pretty comfortable , and the sole is still flexible and light weight . The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement , I think , if it holds up to wear . The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone . I 'm sorry about that , as it gave them a more streamlined appearance . But unless these new Champions do n't wear well , I will definitely look for more when I wear out these two pairs a decade from now .
 If you 're looking for a lightweight , casual , hang-around-in shoe , this is a perfect choice . It is comfortable and can be spot-cleaned . Machine washing is not recommended .
 First , Keds are usually around $ 45.00 and finding them here for less was amazing !! I was on the hunt for a pair of comfortable shoes to walk around a college campus , since at times I have to get from A to B in a matter of seconds . I wanted a pair of shoes that were not only comfortable but cute and casual as well . I ordered the size that I am , an 8.5 in N -LRB- narrow/slim fit -RRB- they fit perfectly to the dot ! I LOVE them , much better choice than buying an off brand of the canvas shoes and know that they might not last as long pr have the best quality in them . I got them in the navy color , perhaps now i 'll get them in red or white soon ! These are a perfect buy , very comfy , very casual chic ; -RRB-
 I got these for running around cleaning my house and running errands -LRB- my new lace up shoes for anyone follows flylady :P -RRB- . They fit well and are very comfortable . I also really like the red color : -RRB-
 Arrived quickly and just as pictured . Got the grey with yellow laces and they are true to size and exactly what I expected . Very pleased !
 Bought these for my daughter to play Tracy in a high school production of Hairspray set in the 60 's . Great classic style and fit and perfect for a lot of dancing !
 Leads ; still love them after all these years ! Wore them as a kid and they still feel great ! Yay Keds
 I got these for my daughter for her work shoes , she loves them . They hold up nicely , she works for Donatos and they have held up nice .
 I am very pleased with this product . would definitely recommend to any one who asks me about it . Ellen Levitt
 I was looking for this ones at the stores , no luck , and also , this one has a very good price !!
 Total satisfaction , works perfectly , everything ok , this product its ok , and it can be recommended for others users without doubt
 very cheap for Keds , fits excellent , got it really fast in two days , i just love them they ar very confortable and looks well with everything . Totally worth it : -RRB-
 Love these boat shoes . A + + + + + for comfort in the front toes and back heel . Hope they sell other colors . Nice construction .
 Love the black lower edge color . I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day . The past keds fit a little better . Wonderful shoes otherwise .
 I am always a size 6 in footwear , but get a 6.5 for sneakers -LRB- Converse , Vans -RRB- . I bought the navy Keds in size 6 -LRB- M -RRB- , medium width , and it 's a little too narrow . However , going up to 6.5 would result in the shoes being too long . I wo n't be able to wear these without socks in the summer , so I 'm going to invest in a pair of insoles when summer comes . I agree with previous reviewers that these shoes run narrow and long . After having them on my feet for some time with thin socks , they have stretched slightly in width . The quality is pretty good , comparable to canvas Converse and Vans . I bought Keds to wear around on campus since I wanted something less bulky than Converse All-stars and a bit more feminine than Vans Lo Pros . Overall , I 'm satisfied with my purchase and might buy another pair in the future .
 LOVE these . Got them in grey with yellow laces - LOVE this color combo . They are true to size , comfy with or without socks -LRB- thin socks -RRB- , and clean very easy . I use oxyclean spray and/or put them in the washer and they come out squeaky clean . So glad I got these !
 The sneakers arrived timely . I have loved Keds since I was a kid and it 's nice to be able to get them so easily .
 Are so little and pretty -LRB- 6M :p -RRB- . The size are just right and the color is nice . All that I was expected .
 I previously had the same Keds sneaker . Liked them . Ordered a medium width , not a wide width . Had to return them .
 This style of Keds are cute enough to wear with summer dresses and maxi skirts . They provide more arch support than ballet flats and are good for lots of walking .
 Product arrived as promised and in good condition . Great shoes for around the house without the weight of the heavy athletic shoes .
 This sneakers are just great ! They are true size . I am very pleased with my purchase .
 I got these Keds black canvas sneakers for my Mom for Christmas . She totally loved them !! Said they fit great and were very comfortable . Black canvas is hard to find in the stores ~ especially in such a small size ~ so I was delighted to find them online . Package arrived on time and in great condition . I highly recommend this product and vendor .
 The Ked Champion is what I hoped it would be and I was/am very satisfied .
 The price was right , appreciated free shipping ... received the product 10 days after the suggested delivery ... purchased for a gift , and it arrived the day I needed it ... was worried it would not arrive
 I 'm very happy with this purchase . I love my new navy Keds ! They came quickly and fit great !
 The shoes were great , but I have such a small feet they were too big . Sorry I had to return them .
 Just bought several NEW Keds in White , Black , Navy , Bright Blue and Red to replace the OLD Keds that I bought 20 years ago ! And my `` old '' Keds are still for perfect for yard shoes , knock around shoes etc ! My new Keds in White and Black are of leather and how comfortable and easy care they are ! The Bright Blue , Red and Navy Blue are canvas and washable . All are just wonderful and looking forward to another 20 years service . Since I was a kid , I have lived in Keds sneakers for the comfort , looks and the fact that they last and last and last . They are all worth every penny that I paid for them . Thanks Keds , hope you never change !
 My sister in law only wear these shoes . I could n't find them in a department store , so I decided to check Amazon . I was so elated when I found them and in her hard to find size . I thought that I would n't get them in time for Christmas , but they arrived just as promised . My sister in law LOVED them and I was extemely satisfied !
 I never really thought of myself as someone who has wide feet until I received my keds . I still love the damn shoe so I 've kept them and broken them in to fit my foot . They 're good looking shoes and are very comfortable -LRB- once broken in -RRB- !
 I have been wearing Keds Champion for over 65 years . It is hard to find sneakers that come in narrow widths .
 Have been wearing Keds for years . Had to go to a larger size because I need thicker insoles . They 're great !
 I love to wear my keds . The price , the quality and having them available was why I chose them , Its had to find keds this time of year . I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size , just leather not canvas material . Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found .
 I have major problems finding size 9-1/2 medium in any shoe so I was pleased to find these at Fusion through Amazon . They are great , the fit is correct and very comfortable . Not much one can say about canvas tennis shoes but they are nice quality and more important , as I said before a good true fit .
 Keds is one shoe I can always depend on for the best fit , color , style and comfort . Washable , and wearable right out of the box , I loved Keds as a kid and even more as an adult
 I used to have a keds as a kid and I was n't sure whether I would want a shoe that I had during my childhood . I do n't regret anything about these shoes , they are just as comfortable as I remembered them .
 Product arrived quickly , with great packaging . The color was exactly as pictured . The fit is execellent with more arch support than I expected . The shoes appear to be well made without any visible defects . I will probably order a second pair in another color as I am very pleased with these . They are just what I was looking for .
 These are some of my favorite shoes
 At first I ordered an 8.5 and they were too big but i was nervous about exchanging them cause i did n't want to get charged twice . but i went for it anyways to try to get an 8 and they fit perfectly and I got refunded on the shipping of the previous pair that did n't fit -LRB- and obviously did n't have to pay for the shoes again cause it was an exchange with the same vender -RRB- . bottom line
 The Keds are fine . I have had them for a few days now and they are great . No complaints at all .
 The shoes are nice but not in the way I expected . I should have ordered them a bid larger and much wider .
 My mother has long , narrow feet and has had difficulty finding a good fit . This was convenient and a perfect fit . She 's delighted -- and so am I.
 I really like these shoes ! I just bought them at a local retail store and was looking on here to see if I could find them cheaper . I 've always loved Asics running shoes because they are so comfortable on my feet . But the main problem with my old Asics is they 're dorky looking for casual wear . These new casual style of Asics fit my feet like my old shoes and actually look great too ! They are very lightweight and almost feel like I 'm not even wearing shoes . Unlike running shoes , these are very thin and offer very little little support . Lots of shoes make my feet look big , but these make my feet look sleek . Workmanship appears good but I do n't think they will last as long as other shoes because they are so thin . Normally I would n't pay $ 70 for casual shoes but I did this time because these are so comfortable and good-looking . If you like Asics running shoes but want something better looking , I highly recommend these shoes!Update 10-2009Well I 've had these shoes over 5 years now and they are still in good shape . Granted I do n't wear them on a daily basis any more but I was really surprised how well they held up given how thin they are . Hope I can find another pair once these finally do break down ...
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 I am on my feet 12 or more hours a day . Cement floors and high activity have destroyed multiple sets of shoes . I have bough some brands and totaled them in 3-4 months . The only thing showing wear is the finish . The toes are scuffed up from crawling and moving around working on equipment . If there is work to be done I am all over it . My shoes better be prepared to take it all . These Wolverines are comfortable and solidly built.When I do finally give them more then they can handle , I will be buying another set to replace them . I would love a more durable toe area for lasting beauty but I do n't want to give up the comfort that these shoes offer to my hard working feet .
 Second pair that i have purchased for working a 12 hour shift . Boots are steel toed , rated for 600 volts , and light and flexible . Feel like regular boots . I even wear them on my days off sometimes as they are a good looking shoe . Company purchases 1 pair of safety shoes per year , and after 16 years i have gone through many different brands of safety shoes . These are the best . No leg fatigue or foot pain . They come in wide size , but normal size fits fine . I enjoy the added safety of the 600 volts rating as i work around high voltage constantly .
 My first pair of Wolverine boots . I have read nothing but good reviews , so I tried a pair . These are the most comfortable boots I have ever had . I use these 10 -12 hrs a day on concrete , gravel , slanted surfaces , etc. and these are sturdy and look nice . Almost like walking on air ! Uppers made in Dominican Republic , assembled in the USA . I will never buy cheap Chinese -LRB- communist -RRB- made boots again .
 Very comfortable . I 'm on my feet 10 hrs . a day on concreet floors and these are the best I ever found .
 These are great boots , I do n't go to stores anymore . I just order these every year as they are very comfortable from day one .
 This boot is Great!I work 12 hour shifts , Very comfortable and keep feet dry . Soft leather make break in time easy . Have looked at other boots and feel this is the best boot for the buck . Sears use to sell this boot off the shelf and no longer do , witch left me looking on the web . Amazon had the best price and best policy for returns . Thank You Amazon !
 I just picked up a pair of these boots and on the first use they felt great even after being in them all day . They also look good too . Great job Wolverine !
 These shoes are very comfortable even wearing them for the first time . The make is slightly bigger than the actual size . I ordered a medium width which fits well though I thought I usually wear narrow width . I was going to order another pair in a different color but they were already sold out . It is a bargain -LSB- ... -RSB- . They go well with pants and would be OK with causal dresses .
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 I love this shoe . It 's dressy , but casual enough for every day summer wear , and it 's comfortable for walking around every day . I bought one years ago at a retail store , then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and could n't find anything else that came close . I found these here , and ordered the same ones I had before , and am very happy about it . Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6 !
 Very nice shoe it would be great if this style came in more colors . Shoes are comfortable and sturdy , great for walking .
 I ordered the Mimosa sandal in 7E Camel . It is true to size and comfortable . I love the style , looks dressy even as a low heel . The footpad inside is man-made material , but with stockings it is comfortable . Too bad the footpad is n't microfiber or something like that .
 very comfortable shoe . I have worn these for many years & have many colors . Good with casual or dressy . I was so happy I found the black again . For a long time they were n't available .
 This is a perfect sandal for dress or casual . I needed a navy pair to wear when I am working conferences and these are great . They are comfortable and look very neat with dresses or suits .
 This LifeStride shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had - I like it so much I have it in three different colors . Even after wearing it all day my feet are feeling great . You ca n't go wrong with this shoe .
 I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart . They were so very comfortable , and worked well with different types of outfits , including shorts and capris . The only problem , -LRB- which other people have mentioned -RRB- , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum
 I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that . But , once on , they are the most moldable , soft , well fitting and supportive sandals I have . I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily . Another complaint is that they are so hard to find ! I have several pairs and will keep looking ...
 I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect . They arrived on time and the fit was exact . Will certainly order from the manufacturer again .
 I previously owned a pair of these sandals -LRB- over 5 years ago -RRB- which I really liked , but for some reason they no longer fit confortably . I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels , but more casual , loose fitting shoes . My new sandals fit beautifully . I can wear them all day long in complete comfort . I 'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too .
 I do not ususally order shoes but I was very pleased with this purchase and Peltz Shoes . The shoes were shipped immediatley and I received them within 3 days . Would purchase from them again . Thanks
 This is my second pair , in as many years . Comfortable , nice hieght and affordable .
 I have these sandals in five different colors . They are incredibly comfortable yet stylish , and can be worn with slacks or skirts for work or play . Although they are not leather , they look and feel just like it . Great for fashion-minded vegans or those looking for a comfortable , inexpensive sandal .
 Very comfortable and cute shoe . I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size . I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look .
 I bought four pair of these in different colors . They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you 've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies ! ;--RRB- I have long , narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well . I am absolutely delighted with them .
 Very cute flat shoe . If your feet tend to swell however I would order a wide width . Other than that the shoe looks great with jeans or capri pants !
 I love these Life Stride Sandals . Can be worn when dressed up or casual . Very comfortable . Planning on purchasing more in several colors .
 I love these shoes and have them in blue , white and black . I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts . fit true to size .
 I love these sandals and am unhappy that they are discontinued . If there are any out there in size 8 give me an email !
 I bought these shoes to wear to a wedding ... they were so comfortable I could have danced all night and nearly did !! Thank you !!
 I bought this shoe in mimosa and navy . I need the wide width . The sizing was very true.I am very satisfied with this shoe and highly recommend to anyone needing the wider widths.N.Mayo

 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country

 I bought this sandal after I broke my toe , and I wanted a sandal with toe protection , and I was n't disappointed . This sandal is really comfortable . It has great arch support and a nicely coushioned sole , and it is both cute and functional . Looks great with shorts , capris and pants , but a little too `` clunky '' for skirts . Very sporty .
 Great Sandal . I wanted something that could go to the beach , in the water and on short hiking trails . It fit the bill and was perfect for our Maui vacation . After a week of much use , they still look like new and are attractive and very comfortable as well . A purchase well made and prompt delivery .
 I picked up a pair of these ` ugly shoes ' for $ 10 at an off-season sale 2 years ago . They have turned out to be the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn in my life . In fact , these are the only flipflop I have ever been able to wear and the nice thing is that they do n't LOOK like flipflops . I reached for these sandals again today -- and it 's below freezing outside ! -- so I am online now -- hunting MORE -- just in case I actually wear mine out .
 The comfort and support these sandals give are unlike any flip-flop I 've ever tried . They feel much like a full hiking sandal with the heel strap unfastened -- which is how I wear full sandals , anyway . Traction is great . They feel good wet , and are also quick-drying -- soggy sandals are a pet peeve of mine , which is why I usually bring an extra all-rubber sandal for water activities -LRB- sacrificing support -RRB- when traveling . No need for that now.A great bonus is how they fit my feet perfectly . I 've tried other Keen footwear and I 've had problems finding a good fit . The big toe protector is usually too small for me - not good since I frequently get ingrown nails . No such complaints with the Waimea . I also think they look pretty cool , and can be used as all-around casual footwear -LRB- I find some Keen sport sandals and shoes to be pretty ugly and purely utilitarian -RRB- . I 'm very happy I found these sandals .
 I got the `` pumice '' color which is a pretty light gray with blue details , not stiped like the black sandal shown . Protection for the big toe , comfortable to wear immediately . Machine washable . I am very happy with these sandals .
 The Keen Waimea is , according to a Keen spokesman , is the newest iteration of the Keen Antigua . It is also the single greatest sandal ever fashioned by the hands of men , women , or the gods . There is a popular myth spreading among wearers of the Antigua/Waimea that it was actually the sandal of choice of many important historical figures , including Plato , Homer , Pythagoras , Nefertiti , Alexander the Great , Buddha , Jesus , -LRB- recent research also points to Muhammad as a fan -RRB- , Mary Queen of Scots , William Wordsworth , James Dean , the bulk of the undefeated 1973 Miami Dolphins defensive crew , and Stephen Biko.I have owned a pair of Antugua 's for nearly three years now and they 're still in wearable condition . This after backpacking across West Africa with a nearly 40 pound bag for three weeks , through the streets of Mopti , the cliffs of the Bandiaga Escarpment , across the sahel , to Elmina Slave Castle , the largest waterfall in West Africa , and a delicious ice cream shop in Bobo Dialasou.Keen says these are just a Spring/Summer shoe , but they 're off their rockers not selling this shoe year round . Whoever came up with the no-stub toe protector clearly deserves a MacArthur Genius Grant and an enthusiastic pat on the back . And the cushioning and durability of these shoes leaves absolutely zilch to be desired.You 'd be insane to buy any other sandal if you actually intend to spend a lot of time wearing them . Get your & * % ^ together and buy a pair of Antigua/Waimea 's .
 I am on my feet 12 or more hours a day . Cement floors and high activity have destroyed multiple sets of shoes . I have bough some brands and totaled them in 3-4 months . The only thing showing wear is the finish . The toes are scuffed up from crawling and moving around working on equipment . If there is work to be done I am all over it . My shoes better be prepared to take it all . These Wolverines are comfortable and solidly built.When I do finally give them more then they can handle , I will be buying another set to replace them . I would love a more durable toe area for lasting beauty but I do n't want to give up the comfort that these shoes offer to my hard working feet .
 Second pair that i have purchased for working a 12 hour shift . Boots are steel toed , rated for 600 volts , and light and flexible . Feel like regular boots . I even wear them on my days off sometimes as they are a good looking shoe . Company purchases 1 pair of safety shoes per year , and after 16 years i have gone through many different brands of safety shoes . These are the best . No leg fatigue or foot pain . They come in wide size , but normal size fits fine . I enjoy the added safety of the 600 volts rating as i work around high voltage constantly .
 My first pair of Wolverine boots . I have read nothing but good reviews , so I tried a pair . These are the most comfortable boots I have ever had . I use these 10 -12 hrs a day on concrete , gravel , slanted surfaces , etc. and these are sturdy and look nice . Almost like walking on air ! Uppers made in Dominican Republic , assembled in the USA . I will never buy cheap Chinese -LRB- communist -RRB- made boots again .
 Very comfortable . I 'm on my feet 10 hrs . a day on concreet floors and these are the best I ever found .
 These are great boots , I do n't go to stores anymore . I just order these every year as they are very comfortable from day one .
 This boot is Great!I work 12 hour shifts , Very comfortable and keep feet dry . Soft leather make break in time easy . Have looked at other boots and feel this is the best boot for the buck . Sears use to sell this boot off the shelf and no longer do , witch left me looking on the web . Amazon had the best price and best policy for returns . Thank You Amazon !
 I just picked up a pair of these boots and on the first use they felt great even after being in them all day . They also look good too . Great job Wolverine !
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country
 Good shoes with one issue . My son loves them -LRB- as I think all Croc wearers love their crocs -RRB- . The collegiate colors and emblem are really fun , BUT the `` M '' on the heel strap is wearing off already , so that is a bummer .
 item arrived on time size was bigger than my wife needed but my daughter was able to use them so we will keep them anf i bought something else for the wife
 These shoes are very comfortable even wearing them for the first time . The make is slightly bigger than the actual size . I ordered a medium width which fits well though I thought I usually wear narrow width . I was going to order another pair in a different color but they were already sold out . It is a bargain -LSB- ... -RSB- . They go well with pants and would be OK with causal dresses .
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last
 So I went to my local outlet today and got these shoes . I LOVE them . The only reason I did n't give them a 5 star rating is because they are NOT true to size . I had to buy one half size larger than normal . They have these great nubby things on the bottom that flex when you walk . It 's like wearing massaging gel insoles on the outside ! They are so comfy . If you are into the new low profile shoes , these are perfect . They are a bit snug through the widest part of my feet and that concerned me . But after wearing them all day , it 's a good snug - like my feet are being nicely cradled . These are my new shopping shoes !
 These shoes are great , not too narrow , just wide enough for my feet , plus the cushions are good and its light . One of my favorite basketball shoes .
 I love this shoe . It 's dressy , but casual enough for every day summer wear , and it 's comfortable for walking around every day . I bought one years ago at a retail store , then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and could n't find anything else that came close . I found these here , and ordered the same ones I had before , and am very happy about it . Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6 !
 Very nice shoe it would be great if this style came in more colors . Shoes are comfortable and sturdy , great for walking .
 I ordered the Mimosa sandal in 7E Camel . It is true to size and comfortable . I love the style , looks dressy even as a low heel . The footpad inside is man-made material , but with stockings it is comfortable . Too bad the footpad is n't microfiber or something like that .
 very comfortable shoe . I have worn these for many years & have many colors . Good with casual or dressy . I was so happy I found the black again . For a long time they were n't available .
 This is a perfect sandal for dress or casual . I needed a navy pair to wear when I am working conferences and these are great . They are comfortable and look very neat with dresses or suits .
 This LifeStride shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had - I like it so much I have it in three different colors . Even after wearing it all day my feet are feeling great . You ca n't go wrong with this shoe .
 I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart . They were so very comfortable , and worked well with different types of outfits , including shorts and capris . The only problem , -LRB- which other people have mentioned -RRB- , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum
 I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that . But , once on , they are the most moldable , soft , well fitting and supportive sandals I have . I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily . Another complaint is that they are so hard to find ! I have several pairs and will keep looking ...
 I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect . They arrived on time and the fit was exact . Will certainly order from the manufacturer again .
 I previously owned a pair of these sandals -LRB- over 5 years ago -RRB- which I really liked , but for some reason they no longer fit confortably . I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels , but more casual , loose fitting shoes . My new sandals fit beautifully . I can wear them all day long in complete comfort . I 'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too .
 I do not ususally order shoes but I was very pleased with this purchase and Peltz Shoes . The shoes were shipped immediatley and I received them within 3 days . Would purchase from them again . Thanks
 This is my second pair , in as many years . Comfortable , nice hieght and affordable .
 I have these sandals in five different colors . They are incredibly comfortable yet stylish , and can be worn with slacks or skirts for work or play . Although they are not leather , they look and feel just like it . Great for fashion-minded vegans or those looking for a comfortable , inexpensive sandal .
 Very comfortable and cute shoe . I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size . I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look .
 I bought four pair of these in different colors . They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you 've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies ! ;--RRB- I have long , narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well . I am absolutely delighted with them .
 Very cute flat shoe . If your feet tend to swell however I would order a wide width . Other than that the shoe looks great with jeans or capri pants !
 I love these Life Stride Sandals . Can be worn when dressed up or casual . Very comfortable . Planning on purchasing more in several colors .
 I love these shoes and have them in blue , white and black . I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts . fit true to size .
 I love these sandals and am unhappy that they are discontinued . If there are any out there in size 8 give me an email !
 I bought these shoes to wear to a wedding ... they were so comfortable I could have danced all night and nearly did !! Thank you !!
 I bought this shoe in mimosa and navy . I need the wide width . The sizing was very true.I am very satisfied with this shoe and highly recommend to anyone needing the wider widths.N.Mayo

 I received these shoes in 3 days using the free shipping , which really surprised me and worked out perfect since they came in time for my first game . Shoes fit good -LRB- I wear 11 normally , and these were 11 and fit snug -RRB- . They were light and I was able to move around great , and even shot well with them . My only fear is that the synthetic will pull away from the bottom , but wo n't know until I get more use out of them . So far though , they are great !
 These indoor cleats tend to run a little on the narrow side , and I had to order about 1/2 size up . They are average in terms of durability and would have been more comfortable and flexible if they were leather like the higher-end Adidas boots , but the price was right . I would not recommend using them anywhere but on a padded indoor turf , as they have almost no padding themselves .

 My daugther already have this sneaker that I purchase for her three years ago to play volleyball and she love them , we when all over the stores to buy a new pair but we did not find them anywhere . I check in the computer and for my surprise I find them here . Now my daugther is a happy player.Thank YouMrs Capote
 The shoe is very comfortable to walk in , looks good and priced right.It is a challenge buying footwear online but with your excellent guide to size etc , things worked out perfectly.Many thanks for the prompt serviceCheersLoryn Potroz

 Very comfortable . I 'm on my feet 10 hrs . a day on concreet floors and these are the best I ever found .
 These are great boots , I do n't go to stores anymore . I just order these every year as they are very comfortable from day one .
 This boot is Great!I work 12 hour shifts , Very comfortable and keep feet dry . Soft leather make break in time easy . Have looked at other boots and feel this is the best boot for the buck . Sears use to sell this boot off the shelf and no longer do , witch left me looking on the web . Amazon had the best price and best policy for returns . Thank You Amazon !
 I just picked up a pair of these boots and on the first use they felt great even after being in them all day . They also look good too . Great job Wolverine !
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last
 An elegant shoe with some lovely metallic details . Do n't usually wear heels these high , but overall they 're super comfortable . Size runs a little big , but nothing an insert wo n't fix !
 Do n't get me wrong - this shoe could almost stand at 5 stars on the style factor alone ! What a seriously beautiful shoe - it should come with a warning label for sizzle.With a classic pointed-toe pump design , AK has provided the best of menswear wing-tip tailoring in smooth leather against a suede base . The heel is on the high side for me , but it 's perfectly proportioned with the rest of the shoe , and complements the pointed toe and wingtip accents.My only complaint is with my own wide feet - story of my life . I can get away with the medium width by moving up a 1/2 size , but these would be absolutely perfect if they came in wide withs . Wide ladies , you may need to put up with a snug fit around the midsole and toe-box , but if you can live with it -LRB- as so many of us do -RRB- , what a way to go !
 I bought these shoes in black and wore them for the first time today with a simple black skirt and blouse for the office . For the first wearing , they were very comfortable and really good to look at . I am definitely pleased with the quality and value !
 These are nice shoes . Be aware -- they are pointier than they seem on this picture
 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country
 Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes . Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes , so I was pleased . I do have hammer toes , and got a few red spots on top of my toes , but I do n't know how I could have avoided that .
 I ordered these shoes , the price was great !!! I received them really fast and they fit perfect.It was a very positive online shopping experience .
 Softspots are my favorite shoes . These are super comfortable , fit well , and last a long time . So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work , and my feet never hurt . Bravo ! I highly recommend them .
 These are a nice pair of casual work shoes . Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks . They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer .
 Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years . The only thing I do n't like about them , they are not made in the UNITED STATES now . . I needed them or I would not have bought them . Hope they will give me the service the others did .
 This is a great shoe , though I find that it runs narrow . I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all . My right foot wentin with some effort . It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in . I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato
 These are the most comfortable and cute shoes ever . I have a pair in brown and a pair in camo . Love them !

 I GOT THESE FOR MY MOM AND SHE LOVES THEM . CLAIMS THAT THEY ARE SUPER COMFY AND THE PERFECT SLIP ON TO WEAR ON THE GO !

 I 've had a pair of these boots for 8 years and they are utterly the most comfortable boots i 've ever had . I 've worked in them , climbed mountains in them , worn them to fires , etc. . They finally gave up the ghost and suffered severe sole separation this summer during a hike in the sierra nevada , but they had a good long life . Great traction , endlessly comfy .

 My daugther already have this sneaker that I purchase for her three years ago to play volleyball and she love them , we when all over the stores to buy a new pair but we did not find them anywhere . I check in the computer and for my surprise I find them here . Now my daugther is a happy player.Thank YouMrs Capote
 The shoe is very comfortable to walk in , looks good and priced right.It is a challenge buying footwear online but with your excellent guide to size etc , things worked out perfectly.Many thanks for the prompt serviceCheersLoryn Potroz

 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 This is the second pair , I have owned , and these are very good boots . You do n't have to break them in . The fit is superior .
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .
 Super comfortable . Great support ; the special sole and heel pads cushion each step and ease the shock to the musculoskeletal system . The foot is surrounded by breathable fabric on top of a generous amount of padding . This model is also good looking enough to wear in casual non-work situations . - A world away from the $ 49.95 discount-store work boots !
 I have been wearing wolverine durashock boots for over ten years . You can not get a more comfortable and durable boot .

 They are comfortable and appear to be good quality . They run small though . I wear a men 's size 10.5 but ordered these in size 12 because I like to wear them a little big . The size 12 fit perfectly just past my heel . If I had ordered a 10.5 they would have been too small .
 Great purchase of Stride Rite dress shoes . Shoes received in perfect condition and at a great price .

 Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years . The only thing I do n't like about them , they are not made in the UNITED STATES now . . I needed them or I would not have bought them . Hope they will give me the service the others did .
 This is a great shoe , though I find that it runs narrow . I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all . My right foot wentin with some effort . It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in . I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato
 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .
 Super comfortable . Great support ; the special sole and heel pads cushion each step and ease the shock to the musculoskeletal system . The foot is surrounded by breathable fabric on top of a generous amount of padding . This model is also good looking enough to wear in casual non-work situations . - A world away from the $ 49.95 discount-store work boots !
 I have been wearing wolverine durashock boots for over ten years . You can not get a more comfortable and durable boot .
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes . Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes , so I was pleased . I do have hammer toes , and got a few red spots on top of my toes , but I do n't know how I could have avoided that .
 I ordered these shoes , the price was great !!! I received them really fast and they fit perfect.It was a very positive online shopping experience .

 Love these shoes . My DD has wide feet so she wears a lite of stride rite . She has been wearing these every day for the last couple months and they are holding up very well . She is not gentle on shoes . They fit her wide feet nicely .
 My dd is 8 but needs a closed toe for the playground and at school , not an easy task . It 's hard finding closed toe sandals for older girls so I was thrilled to find these . They are comfortable and meet school regulations and look cute with her summer outfits and dresses .
 Stride Rite 's sizing chart -LRB- from their website -RRB- helped us pick the perfect size and the sandal is so cute . My daughter loves the velcro fastener and the sandal will go with everything .
 My daughter is 14 months old , she loved her sandals from the first time she wore them . Finding shoes for children this young is not an easy task
 These shoes are my 2 yo daughter 's favorites AND they go with everything ! With socks or without , dress , jeans , shorts , or capris , no problem . And they give her toes a little protection from sidewalk scrapes . Well made , great shoes .
 My toddler wore these shoes all summer and they held up really well ! I 'm saving them for my next daughter .
 I bought these shoes for my 20 month old . She loves them ! She especially likes the fact that she can put them on and taken them off herself since they are velcro . I like the fact that they are genuine leather and not cheap plastic . The sparkly sequins sewn on the top are a very nice touch also . I could n't see the detail in the photo , but the pink design is kind of sparkly . Very cute shoes !
 My daughter loves her sandals . They are cute and match everything . They are high quality , with a thick cushiony sole and extra padding in the heel strap . Has held up very well to several months of constant wear .
 My 2 & 1/2 year old daughter has a really wide foot . We purchased this shoe in a wide from the store , but it was n't wide enough . It was easier to order the same size but in an extra-wide without having to rush out to the original store of purchase to exchange . She loves her sandals . They are very cute and comfortable . They are easy for her to put on by herself with the velcro closure . Because she likes to run and play , I thought protecting her little toes was important . Also , she can wear these with shorts as well as sundresses .
 I have rarely been disappointed with a Stride Rite shoe or sandal for my kids . This sandal is comfortable for my daughter , and I feel good about her toes being protected . The velcro closure makes it easy for her to put on the sandals by herself . Looks great going to the park or to church . My daughter was allowed -LRB- by someone else -RRB- to wear these sandals to play in the mud , and they cleaned up very easily and still looked great .
 I love this style sandal for my 5 year-old daughter . The fit is great and it 's nice and roomy . Closed toe makes it wearable through the fall here in FL .
 My daughter has a wide foot and Stride Rite is one of the only shoe makers that come in varied widths for young children . These sandals are pretty , comfortable and offer good support to my 5-year-old . They are sturdy enough to play in and pretty enough to wear with dresses !
 I bought these for my daughter in a smaller size , and when she grew out of them , I purchased another pair . These are the best spring/summer sandals . They have faux buckles , which are actually velcro tabs . This makes life easier for mom and dad . They also come in an extra wide -LRB- XW -RRB- size , which my daughter needs . You pay more for Stride Rite shoes , but you can tell they are made better than other brands .
 My daughter loves these sandals , and was very opinionated about choosing them again when she grew out of the first pair . Unlike many similar sandals , the leather is soft , the sole is flexible , and the footbed is cushioned . They look cute with sundresses for church , but run like a tennis shoe ! The little pink flowers on the front are just enough of a pretty , `` fancy '' touch for her , without being overwhelming or clashing with any other colors she might wear .
 As usual , I am impressed with the quality of stride rite shoes . These are great for wide little feet -LRB- especially ones that are thicker from top to bottom -RRB- . These hold up to a beating and I love the velcro closure .
 Once again Stride Rite has the best fit for our little one 's wide feet . Would definitely recommend this cute pair of sandals .
 We absolutely LOVE these sandals . We 've bought them for the past 3 years -LRB- maybe 4 ? -RRB- , every summer , for both of my daughters . They are pretty enough to wear with cute summer dresses , yet rugged and durable enough to wear to the playground . They have excellent construction , and have always lasted us the entire summer season , as well as into the fall and a portion of the following spring . They have the kind of quality support for growing , active feet that you would expect from Stride Rite . I ca n't say enough good things about these shoes ! This is the first year my 8 year old daughter will not have a pair of these , as her feet have outgrown the size chart for these shoes , but my 5 year old just got this summer 's pair in the mail last week . She was thrilled to pull them out and try them on , as they are her favorite shoes , as well as mine . Excellent investment , excellent product .
 These sandals are beautiful and comfortable , very durable too . They are easy to go with any summer clothes . My daughter had several pairs of shoes to wear but she always prefered this one . She even wanted to wear them to school in winter if we let her . So this year I am going to buy another pair for her . Thanks SR. .
 Durable and comfortable sandal . With Stride Rite we never prove wrong . Cute , durable , comfortable . Simple though nice pattern . Holds the leg very well .
 My granddaughter loves these shoes . They are very pretty and a good fit . With a wide foot , Stride Rite is about the only brand we can buy .
 I ordered these for my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter . They are very nice sandals . Without looking carefully at the choice of sizes , I clicked on the XW instead of just Wide . When I caught my mistake it was too late to change it . I read through some reviews and found someone who said she 'd gotten the wide and that they did n't seem like a wide , so had returned them for XW . I am glad for my mistake . The shoes fit perfectly .
 Overall good running shoe . A little less cushioning than past Cumulus series . Overall good sole support and comfort .
 these things have been my runners/workout shoes for over a couple years now . they 've done , i think 2 1/2 , marathons and still feel good.after writing this i realize i really should be getting new shoes .
 I 'm a biased fan of the Asics line . I believe they offer some of the more reliable and comfortable running shoes.The shoes I ordered had a nice wide toe box and are very breathable . I 've run quite a bit in the 2 pairs I 've purchased and have no complaints at all .
 I have used the shoes for a few weeks now . They are comfortable with modest support and fairly light weight . I believe the advertised weight of 10.4 oz is an understatement but the shoes are still a good value . I am training for a marathon and plan to use these for the event -LRB- in October -RRB- . Right now I am primarily using a pair of Ascics 1120 Gels but plan to fully transition to these in a few weeks . The Asics 1120 offer more support and cushion , but at the price of being heavier . I do n't need the additional support so the Cumulus is a better shoe for me . Hope this helps .
 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 This is the second pair , I have owned , and these are very good boots . You do n't have to break them in . The fit is superior .
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast .

 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .

 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment .

They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower .

 The description was dead on and the dimensions aided in choosing this rack for the space available in my closet . It was assembled when it arrived and I only added the topper -LRB- sold separately -RRB- and was ready to store shoes .
 A great way to organize your shoes in a confined space . Cedar freshens the area . Holds four pair of shoes -LRB- snuggly -RRB- on one rack , with the ability to stack the racks . The back panel strip -LRB- optional -RRB- is a bit flimsy , especially with longer shoe sizes -LRB- 15 + -RRB- . A good investment for the price .
 100 percent pine and smells so good . This product makes you look forward to opening your closet haha . I highly recomend . There are no illustrated directions but it 's realy not needed and does come with simple directions . Also comes with extra wood pegs that can be sued for stacking a second rack .
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 Ok , I live in Minnesota where it has been -10 for about the last 3 weeks . I spend lots of time out on the ice , ice fishing and these have kept my feet nice and toasty warm . They are a bit on the heavier side , but it 's nothing I ca n't deal with . They stick to the ice great , like I 'm walking on cement , and they are the warmest boot I have ever worn . Ca n't wait to use these for some hunting next fall ! Would definitely buy again and I highly recommend them .

 This shoe is a stylish and responsive addition to the vast adidas selection . It has very good heel support , without sacrificing flexibility . For those of you who enjoy room for your toes to `` breathe '' and curl , be sure to get them a size and a half to a size large . The only problem I found with these , was that unless tied firm and tight , your foot slides around a little bit . Overall , I highly recommend these shoes .
 Shoes are really pretty and comfortable . I have received many compliments . They are easy to clean and have a little elastic on the back that makes them easy to put on and take off . I have trouble wearing heels but I was able to handle these well .
 Just got the Brown Croc Patent today . Such a beautiful shoe ; photo does n't do it justice . Best of all , it is comfortable , especially for someone who has WW-width feet like me.Ross Hommerson rocks ! 4/3/2012 update
 Quality , stylish , comfortable and all around fabulous ! -LRB- Wife 's words ... -RRB- Will be buying in all colors ! So impressed , looks great , do n't hesitate to buy . = -RRB-
 My first pair of croc pumps I think they are very very comfortable I got the wide width the slingback is comforable I would diffently buy them again or refer them to my family and friends you will be pleased .
 i was looking everywhere for a deal and found the m VERY CHEAP priced here . overall the shoes look very cool and are extremely light . im used to vans shoes that feel heavy on the feet but these shoes are very light and thin as if walking on air . i like them so far . not bad at all .
 Not only are the the Puma Anjan trendy and hot but they are also the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn . I bought my first pair last summer , as I work long shifts on my feet and these shoes are excellent for that . They are thin and have breathable mesh , I very much recommend you go out and buy them .
 I bought my puma 's on amazon like 4 years ago , before everyone else started wearing them . I ca n't stand big giant basketball shoes with velcro , and springs that look like space boots . If you want nice casual kicks you need to get some pumas . They have tons of cool colors and you ca n't go wrong with black . Who does n't love these .
 I am in the process of buying myself a pair of puma `` Anjan '' .

 Brasilians always say Havaianas are n't just flipflops , they say they are the best . They are so right . These all rubber flipflops are more comfortable , they last much longer , and look good.I own 8 pairs of them , and wear them much more frequently than any other shoe , including Cole-Haan and Timberland.These sandals are comfortable enough for a full day of sightseeing in Washington , DC or at an amusement park .
 I got these sandals this spring from Urban Outfitters in the pale pink color , called `` crystal pink '' by UO . They are soo comfortable I wear them everyday -- taking the metro and walking basically everywhere -- without getting blisters or anything . They are stylish but simple enough that you can wear them with anything . They are so versatile , I went on a two week vacation and only brought one pair of shoes , my havaianas ! I just ordered three more pairs because they have such pretty colors . If you buy these sandals , you will not regret it .
 I usually ca n't wear cheap thong sandals as my feet are quite wide and fall off the inside . But I fell in love with these in Australia and have been wearing them ever since . They are cheap enough to get loads in different colours , they look good with anything and are sooooo comfy I wear them all day without noticing.They are the only toe post sandals my girlfriend can wear , she usually hates things between her toes!They make Birkenstocks look clumpy and overpricedPerfect footwear !
 I got 10 pairs at a site called Igapost.com . These things rock !
 These slippers are great ! They are so soft and comfortable on the inside . I wear them as shoes , not slippers , because they are so cool looking . These are much less expensive than those other brands that are so popular now , and they look better too . The first pair I bought was too big , the second pair fits better but is still a little big . I would suggest going down if you are a half size , not up , but that 's just my opinion . Overall , great shoe !
 I wear these slippers a lot ! They are warm , comfortable , and reasonably priced for the great quality . My husband & I both have a pair & we love them !
 I purchased a pair of Bear Paw Slippers . Following the guidelines of the description of the product , I went up a size for fit . When they arrived , they were really nice and liked . They were too large . I tried to reorder and they were not available . I tried contacting The Claussette by phone and was told to e-mail . I e-mailed my dilemna and waited a week , no answer , I forwarded my e-mail again , three days ago . Still no response . I just want to replace the item , or just get an answer .
 Great Product , Supper nice company , who do what they say there going to do ! An Ace plus Seller + + + + + + High encourage all to view and purchase there fine line of products . My wife love them so well I ordered another pair for christmas .

 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 This is the second pair , I have owned , and these are very good boots . You do n't have to break them in . The fit is superior .
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 This shoe is a stylish and responsive addition to the vast adidas selection . It has very good heel support , without sacrificing flexibility . For those of you who enjoy room for your toes to `` breathe '' and curl , be sure to get them a size and a half to a size large . The only problem I found with these , was that unless tied firm and tight , your foot slides around a little bit . Overall , I highly recommend these shoes .
 Ok , I live in Minnesota where it has been -10 for about the last 3 weeks . I spend lots of time out on the ice , ice fishing and these have kept my feet nice and toasty warm . They are a bit on the heavier side , but it 's nothing I ca n't deal with . They stick to the ice great , like I 'm walking on cement , and they are the warmest boot I have ever worn . Ca n't wait to use these for some hunting next fall ! Would definitely buy again and I highly recommend them .

 I would like to say that this shoes is good , comfort , and nice . Regarding the quality it seams perfect . Thanks
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 i was looking everywhere for a deal and found the m VERY CHEAP priced here . overall the shoes look very cool and are extremely light . im used to vans shoes that feel heavy on the feet but these shoes are very light and thin as if walking on air . i like them so far . not bad at all .
 Not only are the the Puma Anjan trendy and hot but they are also the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn . I bought my first pair last summer , as I work long shifts on my feet and these shoes are excellent for that . They are thin and have breathable mesh , I very much recommend you go out and buy them .
 I bought my puma 's on amazon like 4 years ago , before everyone else started wearing them . I ca n't stand big giant basketball shoes with velcro , and springs that look like space boots . If you want nice casual kicks you need to get some pumas . They have tons of cool colors and you ca n't go wrong with black . Who does n't love these .
 I am in the process of buying myself a pair of puma `` Anjan '' .
 I never really thought of myself as someone who has wide feet until I received my keds . I still love the damn shoe so I 've kept them and broken them in to fit my foot . They 're good looking shoes and are very comfortable -LRB- once broken in -RRB- !
 I have been wearing Keds Champion for over 65 years . It is hard to find sneakers that come in narrow widths .
 Have been wearing Keds for years . Had to go to a larger size because I need thicker insoles . They 're great !
 I love to wear my keds . The price , the quality and having them available was why I chose them , Its had to find keds this time of year . I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size , just leather not canvas material . Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found .
 I have major problems finding size 9-1/2 medium in any shoe so I was pleased to find these at Fusion through Amazon . They are great , the fit is correct and very comfortable . Not much one can say about canvas tennis shoes but they are nice quality and more important , as I said before a good true fit .
 Keds is one shoe I can always depend on for the best fit , color , style and comfort . Washable , and wearable right out of the box , I loved Keds as a kid and even more as an adult
 I ordered these in a wide width because the regular ones always seem to make my feet hurt . They are comfortable .
 These are some of my favorite shoes
 At first I ordered an 8.5 and they were too big but i was nervous about exchanging them cause i did n't want to get charged twice . but i went for it anyways to try to get an 8 and they fit perfectly and I got refunded on the shipping of the previous pair that did n't fit -LRB- and obviously did n't have to pay for the shoes again cause it was an exchange with the same vender -RRB- . bottom line
 The Keds are fine . I have had them for a few days now and they are great . No complaints at all .
 The shoes are nice but not in the way I expected . I should have ordered them a bid larger and much wider .
 My mother has long , narrow feet and has had difficulty finding a good fit . This was convenient and a perfect fit . She 's delighted -- and so am I.
 I 've been eyeing the graphite colored Keds for awhile now and I am not disappointed that I finally bought them!I am normally a size 9 to 9.5 in shoes , and because of the loose fit from a previous pair of size 9.5 Keds , I went with a size 9 . So they fit perfectly . I 've worn them walking around the city a few times and have had no pressure points/no blisters/no sore spots . That 's the ultimate test for me -- comfort in walking . Well , they definitely passed the test .
 My wife said she was n't able to find Keds anymore so I looked on Amazon and there they were . Got a pair and they were just like the ones she had thought were discontinued . THe frist pair we got had a smudge on the heel . Amazon made the return easy and new pair arrived in a day . They were perfect ! My wife is happy being able to find the Keds and I am happy with Amazon 's great service .
 Love the black lower edge color . I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day . The past keds fit a little better . Wonderful shoes otherwise .
 I am always a size 6 in footwear , but get a 6.5 for sneakers -LRB- Converse , Vans -RRB- . I bought the navy Keds in size 6 -LRB- M -RRB- , medium width , and it 's a little too narrow . However , going up to 6.5 would result in the shoes being too long . I wo n't be able to wear these without socks in the summer , so I 'm going to invest in a pair of insoles when summer comes . I agree with previous reviewers that these shoes run narrow and long . After having them on my feet for some time with thin socks , they have stretched slightly in width . The quality is pretty good , comparable to canvas Converse and Vans . I bought Keds to wear around on campus since I wanted something less bulky than Converse All-stars and a bit more feminine than Vans Lo Pros . Overall , I 'm satisfied with my purchase and might buy another pair in the future .
 LOVE these . Got them in grey with yellow laces - LOVE this color combo . They are true to size , comfy with or without socks -LRB- thin socks -RRB- , and clean very easy . I use oxyclean spray and/or put them in the washer and they come out squeaky clean . So glad I got these !
 The sneakers arrived timely . I have loved Keds since I was a kid and it 's nice to be able to get them so easily .
 Are so little and pretty -LRB- 6M :p -RRB- . The size are just right and the color is nice . All that I was expected .
 I previously had the same Keds sneaker . Liked them . Ordered a medium width , not a wide width . Had to return them .
 This style of Keds are cute enough to wear with summer dresses and maxi skirts . They provide more arch support than ballet flats and are good for lots of walking .
 I was hoping to order these in 10 1/2 , but that appeared to not be an option . I have a difficult time with many shoe manufacturers not offering my size . I use extra inner soles & that helps , but I wish my size was available .
 The quality does n't look as good as I hoped - you can see the glue and a space where the base is attached . I bought these looking for something that might hold up a little better than the cheaper canvas shoes I usually buy at Target - hopefully they will last a little longer otherwise they may not be worth the price . On the other hand they fit just right and are very soft and comfy on my feet . I like the color and the lining and stitching look pretty good .
 I got these Keds black canvas sneakers for my Mom for Christmas . She totally loved them !! Said they fit great and were very comfortable . Black canvas is hard to find in the stores ~ especially in such a small size ~ so I was delighted to find them online . Package arrived on time and in great condition . I highly recommend this product and vendor .
 The Ked Champion is what I hoped it would be and I was/am very satisfied .
 The price was right , appreciated free shipping ... received the product 10 days after the suggested delivery ... purchased for a gift , and it arrived the day I needed it ... was worried it would not arrive
 I 'm very happy with this purchase . I love my new navy Keds ! They came quickly and fit great !
 The shoes were great , but I have such a small feet they were too big . Sorry I had to return them .
 Just bought several NEW Keds in White , Black , Navy , Bright Blue and Red to replace the OLD Keds that I bought 20 years ago ! And my `` old '' Keds are still for perfect for yard shoes , knock around shoes etc ! My new Keds in White and Black are of leather and how comfortable and easy care they are ! The Bright Blue , Red and Navy Blue are canvas and washable . All are just wonderful and looking forward to another 20 years service . Since I was a kid , I have lived in Keds sneakers for the comfort , looks and the fact that they last and last and last . They are all worth every penny that I paid for them . Thanks Keds , hope you never change !
 SALUDOS , LAS KEDS WOMEN 'S CHAMPION BASIC OXFORD SNEAKER , SE LAS TRAJE PARA MI ESPOSA , Y QUEDO MUY COMPLACIDA Y AGRADECIDA , POR QUE LAS ZAPATILLAS RESULTARON SER MUY COMODAS Y A LA VEZ ELEGANTES , POR LO TANTO SE LAS RECOMIENDO , BYE .
 el articulo me encanta . . me parecen demasiado lindos ... y me llegaron en perfecto estado ! muchas gracias por sus servicios !!
 I wear a 10 and it is hard to find shoes and sneakers that fit . I ordered a 10W -LRB- wide -RRB- and they fit perfectly . They fit so well that I feel they were made especially for me.The canvas is great and seems very durable . They are very comfortable and easy to walk in , especially compared to my old clunky sneakers . I will buy KEDS from now on.I also bought the same shoe in white leather -LRB- 10W -RRB- and that sneaker runs a little larger . I can slip into the white leather sneakers if I 'm not wearing socks , but I can not do that with the black canvas one.NOTE
 I wore my old black ones out and the navy were a great deal -LRB- under $ 20 -RRB- . Super comfortable , exactly what I expected .
 I had to break into these shoes before they got comfortable , but shipping was fast and it 's a great price for the quality of the shoes . I 've never had Keds before so idk if it 's quality has gotten better or worse , but you get what you paid for .
 Great item , it is excelent for gift or any event you made , i totaly recommend it , i just love it .
 I never know , when buying shoes over the internet , if they size will be right . These shoes are true to size , good quality , and fit perfectly !
 dice que soy muy c&oacute;modas , ellas es de pie ancho y se las compre a la medida , creo que por eso las valora como excelentes .
 these sneakers are perfect to use for an exercise class or at the gym . they are lightweight and very comfortable
 MY wifes all time favorite shoes and this is the place to buy them and you can save a lot of money from these people .
 I loved absolutely everything about my pair of Keds - excellent throwback to my elementary school years - however , they were a tish too narrow for my big flippers so they had to be returned unfortunately.The yellow laces definitely gave the graphite color a pop that made the Keds cute and fun . I might hafta order this in a wider size ... : D
 I have no idea what everyone is talking about when they say that these are poor quality . They appear to be the same exact keds that you would buy in any store . I 'm not sure if the other reviewers received a different shoe , or just are n't familiar with ked 's . Also , the sizes are the same as normal ked 's . I regret listening to the reviewers who said that they run small . I ordered a half a size up from what I normally wear , and they 're too loose . I 'll keep them anyway because they 're so inexpensive , but I wish I had n't listened . Probably unrelated , but I ordered these on friday at 8pm and chose one day shipping and they arrived saturday morning at 9:48 . Excellent shipping .
 I 've always wanted to wear Keds , and now I finally can ! I have wide feet , so they have always been to tight width wise . I 'm so glad I was able to find them in wide width . Love the low rise of the shoe , love the look . The only thing I would change is making the inside a bit softer , and maybe more support . But I still love them !
 I love love love these shoes ! I have wide feet , and sometimes it 's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet , but these shoes are so perfect ! I think I will buy a pair in every color now !
 I love Keds tennis shoes . Denim is very hard to find and I 'm thankful Amazon is so easy to shop . No muss , no fuss . Just find the product and someone brings it to your door . I must say , though , that there should never be s & h charges on anything . Bank rates and credit card rates are getting too difficult to live with without having to considering s & h.
 This is the only way to shop !! The shoes were great , they fit , and we had them in a couple of days !! I could not find these red Keds in any stores near us so I went to Amazon and found them in seconds . We had them so quick-I was shocked !!! Thanks Amazon !!
 The shoes arrived in a jiffy and were all that I 'd hoped they would be ... a little wider than those of my youth -LRB- because that 's the way I 'd ordered them -RRB- , still lightweight and comfortable , and with solid arch support . They 're good walkers without being bulky . They 're trim summer oxfords that do n't overpower the look of an outfit . I got a stony-beach scuff on one toe , so I washed it . It washed and dried nicely , but the toe is n't pristine anymore , so , I guess I 'll polish these sneaks just as I did in the '60s .
 When I was growing up , my Floridian grandmother only wore one kind of shoe that I can remember
 I love this shoe . It is the same style that I had twenty years ago . The shoe is light weight , comfortable , and durable . I would highly recommend them because you would not want to wear any other tennis shoe.Sincerely , csh
 SCREW WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING ! I purchased these and they came within 3 days . They are VERY comfortable , light , goes with anything you wear , and they are cheap . I bought some from Payless and these are WAAAAAAAAAY better : -RRB-
 This is probably my 10th pair of these sneakers . I wear them to death . Not fancy ... comfortable ... goes with all casual clothing and very `` smart '' looking . Very Audrey Hepburn .
 I originally ordered the wrong size . Amazon arranged an exchange and I am enjoying the sneakers . I always have a good experience with Amazon .
 I had forgotten how much I loved my `` sneakers '' back in the day when I routinely wore Keds . Now I am in love with them all over again . Great shoes !
 I was needing these shoes in a hurry and I was n't disappointed . Thanks for the great service and the condition of the package when it arrived was excellent .
 These shoes were just as I expected . They do seem to run about a half size small , though . They do seem well made . Thanks !
 I wore Keds as a child and loved them . I got these to wear with a poodle skirt because I could n't find any saddle oxoford shoes to suit me . I am looking forward to wearing my new Keds .
 The shoes came earlier than expected and were in good shape . They were brand new and in the box and the size was correct .
 I love the sneakers . They are better quality than the ones at Payless , and a good price too .
 Keds is known for quality and this show will not let you down . The only negative is that I purchased extra wide and it was no different than the medium width . There was nothing that allowed for my Mother 's wider foot to fit into .
 The Keds Champion style has been around a long time . I have worn it many times throughout my life . I wanted denim , so I ordered these . The denim is somewhat difficult to find . Not everyone carries it . One drawback I noticed . It has been years since I have worn this style and it is not as supportive as some other Keds styles . However , I am sure I will enjoy it . A comfortable shoe with almost no break-in needed .
 Love these shoes , they 're so comfortable ! I 'm kind of inclined to order one in each color ;-RRB- One thing that should be noted - these have no arch support so if that 's important to you bear that in mind when ordering .
 Love these shoes ! Have been wearing them all my life and still think they are the best ! Great price and super fast shipping ! Could n't , t be happier !
 I wear Ked sneakers always and I was over joyed to find this show at such a low price . It is just as expected , great quality and reliable shoe !
 Keds Shoes are worth the money , i will buy again as long as the price does not go up , excellent
 I love this product and I received it in a very timely manner . I have absolutely no complaints except maybe it 's my fault I got white keds because now they are pretty dirty haha but I knew that would happen . I recommend everyone get a pair of shoes like these ! And from this site . Just wish there was free shipping ...
 Pros : Came BEFORE they said it was going to be deliveredQuality is greatCons : Beware of the size you get ... I got the 8.5 A and I did n't realized A meant narrow and when I say narrow , I mean VERY NARROW ! Thank god my feet are very narrow or they would be too small!Great product overall ! -LRB- :
 very cheap for Keds , fits excellent , got it really fast in two days , i just love them they ar very confortable and looks well with everything . Totally worth it : -RRB-
 Love these boat shoes . A + + + + + for comfort in the front toes and back heel . Hope they sell other colors . Nice construction .
 I love anything denim . these sneakers are great with jeans . They feel a little big but not unwearable . thanks
 I love my new Keds sneakers . I have lots of colors to wear with different outfits to work . Getting ready to order acouple more pairs . I recommend using Amazon highly ! Never have had a problem with them .
 I wouldnt go as far as to say they were a fashion statement but I love these sneakers for daily walks during lunch . I used to get disouraged from walking until I found these and realized that my feet actually dont have to be soar after I walk , I just needed sneakers that fit well for me . I also bring them when I go shopping for extended periods like mall shopping . the looks are deceiving , they are nicely made
 These sneakers are great . Super comfortable and fit really well , esp . considering they were bought online ... Keds are well made I think , and they were delivered to my door in a short time . . a little pricey , but well worth it
 I purchased these for my daughter . We actually had a hard time finding these in any store where we live . Delivery was timely and item was as described .
 Quick delivery brought my much needed white keds to me . I had my old pair for 7 years and they were falling apart . These are my favorites and I love the new keds logo showing on the side of the shoe rather than on the back . Very cool for keds ! What else can I say , for 40 years + , keds classics have been there . I could n't wait as a 7th grader back in the & * $ @ 's for my first pair and ditching those orthopedic white oxfords saddle shoes ! Oh happy day ! Been wearing them ever since . Now they come in a rainbow of colors -LRB- and new styles , too -RRB- but the white keds will always be a classic in my wardrobe !
 These shoes have always been my favorite standby for summer . They have been around for years and I always have a pair or two in my closet .
 Product arrived as promised and in good condition . Great shoes for around the house without the weight of the heavy athletic shoes .
 This sneakers are just great ! They are true size . I am very pleased with my purchase .
 These sneakers are very comfortable and I am very pleased with the look and price . I would highly recommend for a casual flat everyday shoe .
 THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS TOP-NOTCH , SAME AS THE SNEAKERS ! I HAVE BEEN BUYING THEM FOR YEARS AND WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE WHO LIKES COMFORT AND A GOOD PRICE .
 My new keds are so awesome ! They look exactly like the picture . I am so happy that I got these . They are comfy and stylish , and when they wear out , I will buy from amazon !
 These are cute , they stay tied , and there 's just enough slip to use these babies on a dance floor without having to spring for full suede bottoms . They also hold up well when you throw them into a huge dance bag and accidentally crush them in the trunk of your car .
 These are cute keds . My daughter has size 11 feet so it is hard to find shoes to fit her . These were just what she was looking for
 I love Keds and they 're always true to size , so nice to know I can order them here . I 'll likely order more .
 I gave these KED Sneakers a 5 Star rating because they are everything I expected and more ! Thrilled to pieces !
 I like this shoe . It is simple and gives you a clean look ! somewhat stiff in the beginning . Made out of cotton and does get dirty , but for the price . . I like them alot !
 These are great to throw on for shopping or running errands . No complaints . They have improved the sole since the last time I purchased them .
 product received as was ofered . no problems with it and satisfaded with the order . also came on time as expected .
 Love them have been wearing Keds for yearsand they never let me down . My 10yr old daughter also loves hers .
 i love these . if you are getting them , get your EXACT size . really comfy . GETTING MORE . happy buyer , and more to purchase !
 Best fit I have had for these shoes would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a soft play shoe . .
 These shoes are cute and convenient . I pair them with jeans to do chores like grocery shopping , or when I go to the movies . They do n't really have arch support so I wo n't be wearing them for long walks.They do fit a little differently and are narrow , but it works for my feet . I would not recommend these shoes to people with wide feet or who plan to use them all day , everyday .
 I have had these shoes for probably 5 years . They are still fully functional . I have owned Vans for that length of time and they have worn out in the first 2 years but Keds are extremely good quality . I have bought different colors but they never fail me . They are comfy for walking . Although , I have found out if you are walking long distances that they might strain your feet By long distance I mean a couple of miles . But overall , I love them and they are definitely worth the price .
 a lot longer than i thought they would be . but a nine would be to small . but they are nice . just wish they were n't so long .
 My sister in law only wear these shoes . I could n't find them in a department store , so I decided to check Amazon . I was so elated when I found them and in her hard to find size . I thought that I would n't get them in time for Christmas , but they arrived just as promised . My sister in law LOVED them and I was extemely satisfied !
 My grandaughter is so pleased and happy with her shoes . They are awesome as she wanted . The article came on time for a day she has to used . Good service , excellent pruchase
 Purchased these for my 75 year old sister who had been looking and looking for some navy keds . She loves them .
 Great quality for the money . Hate the heaviness of most tennis shoes , these are light weight and good support without making my feet feel heavy
 Worn keds my whole life . Still love them . This is my daughters second pair of black . Think it 's so cool that as a teenager she wears them .
 Wonderful product , great quality ! I just ca n't say enough about how much we love them ! If you are on the fence about getting these , do it , you will not be disappointed !
 I love these shoes . Because of my knees I need a shoe that is totally flat and Keds fit the bill . I like the black/black style because it looks less like a tennis shoe . They wear very well and clean up easily .
 These cute , white Keds are perfect with so many outfits . Their slender sillouette adds a feminine touch to jeans , shorts , capris and summer skirts . They are comfortable for walking around town and give a much simpler profile than most sneakers these days .
 I used to have a keds as a kid and I was n't sure whether I would want a shoe that I had during my childhood . I do n't regret anything about these shoes , they are just as comfortable as I remembered them .
 Product arrived quickly , with great packaging . The color was exactly as pictured . The fit is execellent with more arch support than I expected . The shoes appear to be well made without any visible defects . I will probably order a second pair in another color as I am very pleased with these . They are just what I was looking for .
 This is a great shoe for lindy hop ! It seems all the girls in East Coast swing use Keds shoes . I was having a problem because I have wide feet . I could not find wide width Keds in the local stores around my town . I was worried about the fit , so I tried my size on at the store of the med width , just to get an idea of the length to make sure I order the right size . I have worn them to several dances and they work and feel great . There is no need to get suede put on the bottom of these , they spin just fine on the dance floor . I am very happy with these shoes !
 I purchased blk/blk and absolutely love it ! I got 8W becasue I have wide feet but when I received it was bit too wide . I 'm going to get regular instead of wide next time I purchase my second pair .
 These Keds are a classic ! Our school has uniforms , so they look great with any solid pants or with shorts . They 're also really comfortable to wear without having an overly athletic feel . Love them ! And , they come in a million different colours , haha .
 I was delighted to find out that Keds still makes the sneakers I bought as a kid . I just wore out the last pair I had -- I purchased extras at least twenty years ago , so have n't had to look for new till now . Well , almost the same sneaker ... These do n't seem to be made to the same last as the old models ; they are n't quite as good a fit , but are still pretty comfortable , and the sole is still flexible and light weight . The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement , I think , if it holds up to wear . The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone . I 'm sorry about that , as it gave them a more streamlined appearance . But unless these new Champions do n't wear well , I will definitely look for more when I wear out these two pairs a decade from now .
 If you 're looking for a lightweight , casual , hang-around-in shoe , this is a perfect choice . It is comfortable and can be spot-cleaned . Machine washing is not recommended .
 First , Keds are usually around $ 45.00 and finding them here for less was amazing !! I was on the hunt for a pair of comfortable shoes to walk around a college campus , since at times I have to get from A to B in a matter of seconds . I wanted a pair of shoes that were not only comfortable but cute and casual as well . I ordered the size that I am , an 8.5 in N -LRB- narrow/slim fit -RRB- they fit perfectly to the dot ! I LOVE them , much better choice than buying an off brand of the canvas shoes and know that they might not last as long pr have the best quality in them . I got them in the navy color , perhaps now i 'll get them in red or white soon ! These are a perfect buy , very comfy , very casual chic ; -RRB-
 Arrived quickly and just as pictured . Got the grey with yellow laces and they are true to size and exactly what I expected . Very pleased !
 Bought these for my daughter to play Tracy in a high school production of Hairspray set in the 60 's . Great classic style and fit and perfect for a lot of dancing !
 Leads ; still love them after all these years ! Wore them as a kid and they still feel great ! Yay Keds
 I got these for my daughter for her work shoes , she loves them . They hold up nicely , she works for Donatos and they have held up nice .
 I am very pleased with this product . would definitely recommend to any one who asks me about it . Ellen Levitt
 I was looking for this ones at the stores , no luck , and also , this one has a very good price !!
 Total satisfaction , works perfectly , everything ok , this product its ok , and it can be recommended for others users without doubt
 I absolutely love these Keds , I bought them for recruitment and thought I 'd never wear them again . I normally buy Vans but did n't want to spend that much for shoes I did n't want . I was very wrong ! Love these , wear them all the time and intend on buying more Keds !
 The quality and the outlook is good , but it 's kind of longer at the tip of the shoes and make it loose when I walk .
 The size fits perfectly , the color is exactly like the picture , and above all it 's super super cute.Makes me want to purchase another color !
 I 've been wearing Keds champion sneakers for years and years . Would not consider buying anything else ! Thanks to Keds for a great product .
 Sure , Keds are n't made like they were back in the day , but for the price you really ca n't complain . I got these to wear casually since I did n't want to shell out double the amount for similar shoes , and I love them ! There 's no arch support , but that 's nothing some insoles ca n't solve . After a few months of wear -LSB- even to dances and the gym -RSB- , my Keds still look pretty new . However , beware people with wider feet ! These shoes are a but narrow in the toe area .
 Keds have always been good sneakers . These seem to have lived up to that . Since they are white , they did not wash well but I discovered if you dry them in the dryer , the streaks that show up when you air dry them disappear .
 These are great run around shoes and camping . Light weight so you ` renot logged down on short hikes . Don.t show dirt and i , ve washd them in the past . I wear 8.5 N andthese shoes fit pefectly . Nice navy lighter than shown but not toolight . Avazoncame through again for me . Jakjaneus
 I love my new keds , Ive never owned a pair , only heard about them/seen them . I have worn them off and on for the last 4 months and have to say them feel awesome and look great with just about everything !
 Searched local stores , this shoe and no where to be found . Ordered on Amazon , and it is exactly what I wanted . I am extremely pleased .
 I got just the right shoes I have been looking for they fit fine and look nice.Thank You
 The shoe was exactly what I was looking for and the price was better than on Keds own web site .
 Anyone that wear Keds knows that they are great shoes . Got these for my wife and she likes them . Great looking shoes that offer solid support for you feet .
 I have been wearing KEDs for over 50 years , love them . They were exactly what I odered , no problems
 I ordered my Keds here because they were available in the size AND color I wanted - which never happens elsewhere . It 's hard to find shoes I like that fit my feet because I wear a smallish size and have really deep insteps . But here , I was able to get exactly what I needed - 7 extra wide , red . I 'm rocking them with all my favorite outfits and I will definitely be back when I want more .
 After always wearing athletic shoes , I finally returned to my beloved Keds . They are just what I needed to wear with jeans and shorts to avoid the messy , clunky look of my big feet in athletic shoes . I really like the graphic color because it is so neutral that I think will not shoe dirt as much as white ones do .
 These are classic black gym shoes . We needed plain black gym shoes for the school play . These shoes were perfect .
 They are just right for my flat narrow feet , i will be wearing these shoes all summer -- they go with evrything.Elaine
 these are really just what I wanted - classic and clean lines , Unfortunately too small , although I ordered my usual size 9 medium . so I had to return them .
 I received these shoes quickly after my purchase and they fit the description and picture and were exactly what I wanted . They fit well and look great .
 Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado . Muchas gracias . Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.Saludos desde Venezuela
 I 've grown up wearing Keds . Mostly the white canvas Champion Sneaker . It 's always been my go-to shoe . They have become rather expensive in the stores these days . Being retired I do n't have extra disposable cash so I watch for good sales . Amazon always has good sales and good sellers . I got my Keds economically and I have happy feet . Thanks to Keds and Amazon .
 i have a pair of light pink keds that i 've had for 10 + years . when my 17 year old daughter said keds are cool again , i decided to get a pair of red . buying from amazon i saved a bunch , and they still fit and look the same quality as my originals . i love them !
 I was so happy to receive it on the day it camebecause my other sneakers was worn out becauseit was torn , and I finally put my other sneakers inthe trash because I finally got this new sneakersto wear .
 I ordered these for my mom . She has always wore these even when she was a waitress . Both pairs she wares all the time . Shipping time was excellent !
 I wear these all the time ! I really like that they came with the yellow and white laces . They have become a total staple in my wardrobe . Comfortable , cute , and versatile .
 Wife had liiked for these particular sneakers for months . the 4.5 size was imposible to find in stores . We will increase our purchases on the internet and especially at Amezon in the future
 I love these shoes . Very cute , simple , classic style . The graphite color is very versatile -LRB- comes with white laces if you do n't dig the yellow -RRB- . Some arch support for comfort and good structure to the shoe . I would n't run a marathon in these shoes , but they are perfect on the weekends or vacation , when you be doing a good amount of walking but still want to look cute .
 Keds are good quality and very comortable . These will last a long time . They have good width and arch support .
 A great sneaker . Good quality , as always . A present for my granddaughter . I 'm sure she 'll be delighted . . Best price I could find .
 OUTSTANDING ! it 's a happy day when my mom can actually find a shoe to fit her comfortably and at such a low price . She loves the color and comfort . Fast , excellent shipping .
 I just purchased my old stand-by , traditional Keds from Amazon . Loved the price -LRB- $ 20 cheaper than the Keds site -RRB- and they arrived at my home within 3 days . My feet are happy to be in their old comfortable standards . Thanks
 I love my keds . In fact they are better then my converses . Best decision I 've bought online . The price was a little high but worth it
 I love these shoes ! This color goes great with any outfit , and is great for any season ! They are a must have shoe :-RRB- . Like all keds , I typically order a half size smaller .
 Comfortable!Love it ! Looks great with skinny jeans . DId n't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand . . oh wells . Love it ! looks so clean and cute .
 THE KEDS SHOES WERE GREAT . THE GIRLS LOVE THEM AND THEY ARRIVED WHEN SAID.WOULD ORDER THEM AGAIN AND PROBABLY WILL .
 Love these leather oxfords ! I have worn them continually every day since I got them 3 months ago and they show no wear and tear even gardening , no dirt sticks to the leather although I washed the laces . They have no insoles but are comfy as is , flat shoes as what was described . I cant find them locally so viola here on Amazon ! Keds company is perfect if the shoe is the wrong size or color re
 These little tennis shoes are the most constant think on the market today . They are ALWAY comfortable , they machine wash up great ! I could walked for days in them because they are so light . I LOVE MY KEDS !!
 As far as I 'm concerned , this shoe is perfect . I bought the black with white laces . I can wear it every day , it 's cute , it 's comfortable , and it 's inexpensive . It goes great with capris , boot cut jeans , skinny jeans , and slimfit pants . You can wear them with or without socks , but I prefer the liners -LRB- no shows -RRB- with these . I 'll admit that I 'm newer to the Keds brand as an adult and so I ca n't comment on how much more comfortable they used to be `` back in the day . '' I wore this brand as a kid and to me they feel exactly the same as they once did . I 've probably become pickier in my older age and I still find these to have adequate support though they are quite thin . I had been buying Vans brand shoes that look very similar to these for years , but was getting tired of paying $ 50 for them . I do n't know how long these will last , but seeing as they are inexpensive , I wo n't mind if I only get a year or so out of them . One more quick note
 I have worn Keds sneakers for over 50 years . The quality is superb & the comfort is wonderful , whether wearing with socks or not . Highly recommend .
 I have worn Keds for over 50 years and I love them . The last pair I had had something different about the instep that was n't as comfortable as usual but his pair is wonderful ! I like them because they 're not bulky like a lot of the sneakers out there now !
 I grew up in keds , they have always been my favorite . Same great quality as always . Keep up the great work .
 Im 18 and these shoes are the style and there comfortable also . This brand has been around for a long time and there shoes are the best
 I need to change shoe size from 6N to 6M . You have no place to make a change . Other than that I like the on line ordering.George
 Love the sneaker and it fits well and worth the money . It is comfortable and great for the summer when you are out walking for leasure .
 They are the one pair of shoes you ca n't go wrong with . Wear them with shorts or jeans , always looks great !
 I 've purchased the navy blue keds size 9 . I usually have size 9.5 and that 's what I should 've ordered ; they 're a little tight . They work though and I love them ! They 're a cute light shoe that laces up so perfect for running around in the summer . Remember to wear socks with these because they will last longer and you wo n't get blisters on your heel like I did . I plan on ordering more .
 I really like the Keds sneakers . . I ordered Navy and they look black . I would order again but in another color .
 I can always get my narrow in width size - and the clean lines are perfect for all my casual needs . Mainly , though the size and width is perfect for me .
 My teenager picked these out . she loves them enough to wear them at least 2x a week and says they are comfortable . I like that they do n't show dirt .
 I love my new red keds !!! They arrived right on time and are perfectly amazing !! Thanks to the great price I even ordered another color !
 Love them , easy purchase , easy return -LRB- ran longer than I expected -RRB- I usually need a 7 or 7.5 but needed a 6.5 in this . Quick turn around on purchase .
 great shoe at a great price , classic shoe that goes well with just about any outfit , fits snug so may want to size up
 they were great while they lasted -LRB-
 i love my sneakers . i have to say that one of the things i like is i can wash them and i have never had the problem of the front of the insole coming apart
 So comfy and goes with any outfit . Great for everyday wear and you look cool too . I literally wear them everyday .
 The fit is perfect.I also ordered the exact same pair in black . The Black and Navy are so similar in color , I really only needed to order the black . The color is exactly as pictured.Prompt arrival .
 These shoes are exactly what I wanted ! I needed a comfortable , light weight shoe for vacation and I came across these Keds and I am happy about my purchase . Super fast shipping , and a beautiful product .
 So far , good for my daughter . Comfort on the feet , no issues , just love the Endless Style , like other brand name shoes for women . She 's enjoying them . Happy Holidays .
 The brand `` Keds '' speaks for itself . But I got it at a great price and came in just a few days . Like the fact they come in different widths .
 My wife love these shoes . Thank you very much.They look good , and fit perfect.I would buy these again . Do you have more colors ?
 I have one of every color - like beige best - goes everywhere - little pricey for my pocketbook but they come in my size and width so I guess I will continue to buy them
 The Keds sneaker met my expectation . It is comfortable and is of good quality . I 'm very happy with the fit and overall comfort .
 These are extremely good sneakers ! I bought a brand new pair of black womens Keds Champion sneakers at a Sal . Army store I frequent quite a bit for only 4 dollars . These are great basic shoes . An older relative saw them and said they wore them during jr. high school in the 1950s as part of their gym uniform . I prefer these classic everyday shoes over something with more padding and more modern . These are very flexable shoes , the laces are better than other brands . These sell for around $ 30 generally . For that price I feel that makes them one of the most affordable shoes on the market . If you like old school Converse , Jack Purcell , Vans then I think you 'll be very happy to own these classic shoes . A lot of the skateboard companies make copies of these and classic Vans . Just go with the originals ! If I could afforf it I 'd own 10 pairs but am thinking about buy 2 more pair right now . The other styles Keds now makes look great as well . If you happen to go to thrift stores check out the womens footwear . I find lots of Keds there and scored another new pair for $ 5 about 2 weeks after finding these.These shoes feel right and work well for all activities . No downsides to these that I can see . 5 stars !!
 I am so happy with my keds . They 're my new go-to shows . I ordered a 7.5 -LRB- I normally wear somewhere between a 7 and 8 -RRB- and while they fit , I think I would order a 7 if I were to purchase another pair . Stock up on no-show socks when you order them and enjoy !
 Just what I expected and arrived in a timely manner . I have narrow feet and the B width fit pretty good , so you may want to keep that in mind if you have wide feet .
 I love these shoes - I wear them every day ! They fit great and shape to your foot . They are pretty basic shoes - no fills . They go great with jeans , especially the navy keds.Super comfortableEasy to cleanVery trendy - great qualityOnly problem - I have been wearing them almost every day for several months and they are starting to show wear around the toes .
 I searched all over for red sneakers , and boy , was RED hard to find ! Did n't find them in any store , so was very pleased to find them online . Amazon had the best price of any online location . Sneakers are very cute and comfy -- as Keds always are . Fit true to size . Very happy with my purchase .
 These Keds are hard to find anymore . They are the only shoe my diabetic mom can wear with comfort . She can go all day with these on and her feet are so sensitive .
 I received a different color from what I ordered , but I like them . Ca n't go wrong with Keds !
 the keds fit perfectly . Usually I am leary about ordering shoes without trying them on , however these fit well and I am pleased with them
 I am a fan of Keds and have several pairs of Keds shoes on different colors . They are true size and fit my feet very well . I wear them every morning for exercise and got much compliance . Highly recommend them for active women .
 I love these shoes ! And after you get them broken in -LRB- takes a little while -RRB- , they are adorable and comfy ! But they are definitely not for people with wide feet . They seem to run a little narrower than shoes I normally buy . But they 're fantastic shoes nonetheless !
 Keds is a classic and never goes out of style . It is always hard to find my size , 12W , but I found it here with no problem . Would recomment to everyone !
 I ordered the wrong size shoe and talk about ease and no worry return and order of correct size . I know no matter what I order from AMAZON.COM my transaction will be easy and I will be completely satisfied . I like that since I hate shopping . Amazon.com makes it easy to shop and the prices can not be beat . I will use Amazon.com for everything I need . I also feel safe using a credit card online knowing Amazon.com protects my information .
 These Keds are everything the seller described . Size runs true to form , they are extremely comfortable and look great !
 These white Keds -- the same wonderful shoe I wore all through my childhood summers -- are still a great value . They are lightweight , easy-care and comfortable . Every girl and woman should have a pair in her wardrobe .
 This is exactly what I was looking for . I have looked in all the local department stores around where I live and I have n't been able to find any , or if I do find Keds shoes , they do n't have this style in my size . I will definitely order again when this pair wears out .
 These little sneakers , as I call them , are just like bedroom slippers ! Wonderful purchase price and service.ThanksS . Wells
 these are just like they have always been . comfy , good looking and long lasting .
 I got these for running around cleaning my house and running errands -LRB- my new lace up shoes for anyone follows flylady :P -RRB- . They fit well and are very comfortable . I also really like the red color : -RRB-
 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last
 Ok , I live in Minnesota where it has been -10 for about the last 3 weeks . I spend lots of time out on the ice , ice fishing and these have kept my feet nice and toasty warm . They are a bit on the heavier side , but it 's nothing I ca n't deal with . They stick to the ice great , like I 'm walking on cement , and they are the warmest boot I have ever worn . Ca n't wait to use these for some hunting next fall ! Would definitely buy again and I highly recommend them .
 I got some Tennis Pros with black stripes about three weeks ago . After wearing them a few times with jeans , I noticed the stripes on the outside of both feet had faded a bit , so they are n't truly black anymore ; instead , they are a shade of darkish gray . Otherwise , I love them and try to wear them as much as possible . Very comfortable and I think they look great with jeans . Perfect for casual Fridays .
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 I love this shoe . It 's dressy , but casual enough for every day summer wear , and it 's comfortable for walking around every day . I bought one years ago at a retail store , then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and could n't find anything else that came close . I found these here , and ordered the same ones I had before , and am very happy about it . Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6 !
 Very nice shoe it would be great if this style came in more colors . Shoes are comfortable and sturdy , great for walking .
 I ordered the Mimosa sandal in 7E Camel . It is true to size and comfortable . I love the style , looks dressy even as a low heel . The footpad inside is man-made material , but with stockings it is comfortable . Too bad the footpad is n't microfiber or something like that .
 very comfortable shoe . I have worn these for many years & have many colors . Good with casual or dressy . I was so happy I found the black again . For a long time they were n't available .
 This is a perfect sandal for dress or casual . I needed a navy pair to wear when I am working conferences and these are great . They are comfortable and look very neat with dresses or suits .
 This LifeStride shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had - I like it so much I have it in three different colors . Even after wearing it all day my feet are feeling great . You ca n't go wrong with this shoe .
 I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart . They were so very comfortable , and worked well with different types of outfits , including shorts and capris . The only problem , -LRB- which other people have mentioned -RRB- , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum
 I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that . But , once on , they are the most moldable , soft , well fitting and supportive sandals I have . I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily . Another complaint is that they are so hard to find ! I have several pairs and will keep looking ...
 I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect . They arrived on time and the fit was exact . Will certainly order from the manufacturer again .
 I previously owned a pair of these sandals -LRB- over 5 years ago -RRB- which I really liked , but for some reason they no longer fit confortably . I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels , but more casual , loose fitting shoes . My new sandals fit beautifully . I can wear them all day long in complete comfort . I 'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too .
 I do not ususally order shoes but I was very pleased with this purchase and Peltz Shoes . The shoes were shipped immediatley and I received them within 3 days . Would purchase from them again . Thanks
 This is my second pair , in as many years . Comfortable , nice hieght and affordable .
 I have these sandals in five different colors . They are incredibly comfortable yet stylish , and can be worn with slacks or skirts for work or play . Although they are not leather , they look and feel just like it . Great for fashion-minded vegans or those looking for a comfortable , inexpensive sandal .
 Very comfortable and cute shoe . I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size . I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look .
 I bought four pair of these in different colors . They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you 've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies ! ;--RRB- I have long , narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well . I am absolutely delighted with them .
 Very cute flat shoe . If your feet tend to swell however I would order a wide width . Other than that the shoe looks great with jeans or capri pants !
 I love these Life Stride Sandals . Can be worn when dressed up or casual . Very comfortable . Planning on purchasing more in several colors .
 I love these shoes and have them in blue , white and black . I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts . fit true to size .
 I love these sandals and am unhappy that they are discontinued . If there are any out there in size 8 give me an email !
 I bought these shoes to wear to a wedding ... they were so comfortable I could have danced all night and nearly did !! Thank you !!
 I bought this shoe in mimosa and navy . I need the wide width . The sizing was very true.I am very satisfied with this shoe and highly recommend to anyone needing the wider widths.N.Mayo

 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .
 Super comfortable . Great support ; the special sole and heel pads cushion each step and ease the shock to the musculoskeletal system . The foot is surrounded by breathable fabric on top of a generous amount of padding . This model is also good looking enough to wear in casual non-work situations . - A world away from the $ 49.95 discount-store work boots !
 I have been wearing wolverine durashock boots for over ten years . You can not get a more comfortable and durable boot .

 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .
 Super comfortable . Great support ; the special sole and heel pads cushion each step and ease the shock to the musculoskeletal system . The foot is surrounded by breathable fabric on top of a generous amount of padding . This model is also good looking enough to wear in casual non-work situations . - A world away from the $ 49.95 discount-store work boots !
 I have been wearing wolverine durashock boots for over ten years . You can not get a more comfortable and durable boot .
 Cheap shoes , doesnt look cheap at all , fun snickers well made , confortable . Wont regreat if you decide buying this pair . Good look
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 I bought these for my daughter . Was confident they would be of good quality given they were Adidas brand . The only thing my daughter did n't like were the very wide shoelaces . Went and picked up a new pair of laces for a buck to solve that problem . She is a picky pre-teen so I was delighted when she said she liked them . The orange color is very bright and compliments the white shoe .
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .

 The best trail running show I ever had , perfect balance of light weight + stability + the typical Asics feeling .
 These are the most comfortable shoes and they look great too ! I have them in every color .
 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last

 I ran my first marathon ever yesterday -LRB- Grandma 's Marathon , Duluth , MN -RRB- and I had been training with several different pairs from different named brands . I always ended up with foot and toe blisters after about 8 miles . After reading Runners World review of the latests , I ordered this pair from Amazon.com . It arrived one week before the race and immediately felt the difference when I tried to run 4 miles with it . The forefoot compartment is roomy and heel part well-cushioned . The shoes felt like they are already broken in . Against my friends ' advice , I went ahead and used it in the race and you bet , I finished with a decent time and without a single foot blister . I highly recommend this product . Thank you Mizuno for my first sucessful marathon !

 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last

 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .

 I ran my first marathon ever yesterday -LRB- Grandma 's Marathon , Duluth , MN -RRB- and I had been training with several different pairs from different named brands . I always ended up with foot and toe blisters after about 8 miles . After reading Runners World review of the latests , I ordered this pair from Amazon.com . It arrived one week before the race and immediately felt the difference when I tried to run 4 miles with it . The forefoot compartment is roomy and heel part well-cushioned . The shoes felt like they are already broken in . Against my friends ' advice , I went ahead and used it in the race and you bet , I finished with a decent time and without a single foot blister . I highly recommend this product . Thank you Mizuno for my first sucessful marathon !

 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country

 I usually by a very pricey brand name slipper . These were a quarter of the cost and are holding up nicely for my husband . He says they are just as comfy as the usual brand .

 I love Merrell shoes and these are no exception . Very comfortable and sturdy . One warning - the shoes look like they do not have tie laces . Many Merrell models are slip-on moc style shoes and I assumed from the picture that the lacing was like other shoes , just for stretch purposes . In fact , the shoes have laces and have to be tied . This is n't what I thought I was getting , but I can live with it .
 These are special shoes . Each time I put a new pair on , there is zero break-in time ; they 're extremely comfortable . I 'm very hard on them , hiking the canyons in them for a couple hours every day , but they hold up wonderfully . And I feel very protected in them . Durable and versatile . I keep a spare clean pair for errands , because they 're good looking casual shoes .
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition

 I ordered these for a scout backpacking trip , they are lightweight , and comfortable . I never thought I would wear these besides the trip , but I found myself wearing them around the house , they are very comfortable .
 I use these for gardening . Comfortable and easy to wash . Fit is true to size .
 I love my Carolina Crocs ! I live in Nairobi , Kenya , and they are the talk of our campus ! It 's great to be able to support the Tar Heels from head to toe , literally!I am wondering , however , about the return policy . I was not credited with a full refund for the pair of shoes that I returned , and I am curious as to why that is . I am grateful for any refund , but was just wondering why only a partial one.Thanks for the great product!Lisa Orr
 We love are UNC CROCS . DELIVRY WAS FAST , WE EVEN HAD TO EXCHANGE FOR SIZE AND STILL HAD VERY FAST . /
 I gave this to my wife whom went to The Ohio State and was very happy to receive the Ohio State Crocs . They were received in a timely manner and was well represented .
 I love Crocs . They are so comfortable and it 's like wearing no shoes at all ! Add burnt orange and a longhorn and these are the BEST shoes ever ! I 've had several compliments . I 'm a teacher and several students have asked me where I got them ! I LOVE THESE SHOES !
 Just like any other Crocs , but the colors and logo are my alma mater . Same comfortable fit with just that special something so that I can call them my own .
 item returned as too small . sizes are too limited to waste my time with.either restock or get rid of the item
 EXCELLENT PURCHASE IS REALLY A PRODUCT QUALITY , SAME AS PUBLISHED IN THE PHOTO AND GREAT PRICE . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . It was very good buy .
 We 're Trojan fans and were thrilled to see these SC crocs for a bargain price . Everyone loves the bright colors.They have most of the big universities . Lots of fun to wear .
 They do n't make these college themed Crocs any more , so when I find themI buy them . They are great easy and comfortable shoes . No need for socks -- slip them on and off you go !! If you find them in your size and with your teamgobble em up -- you wo n't be sorry !!
 Just what I was looking for . Perfect fit -LRB- since there are no half sizes , buyer needs to go down to next full size -RRB- . E.g. , If you are an 11 1/2 , you need to order the 11 .
 I have gone through several shoes over the years . I finally went to a specialty shop for advice and to get fitted . I tried on 5 pair and ended up with the Grid Omni . The shoe is very stable and has eliminated any of the lingering aches and pains that I had experienced with the other shoes I have tried . I highly recommend them .

 I 've bought them for my father . He liked them very much , since they 're very comfortable and nice . It 's quality is superb . They fitted and arrived on scheduled time .

 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .

They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last
 I ran my first marathon ever yesterday -LRB- Grandma 's Marathon , Duluth , MN -RRB- and I had been training with several different pairs from different named brands . I always ended up with foot and toe blisters after about 8 miles . After reading Runners World review of the latests , I ordered this pair from Amazon.com . It arrived one week before the race and immediately felt the difference when I tried to run 4 miles with it . The forefoot compartment is roomy and heel part well-cushioned . The shoes felt like they are already broken in . Against my friends ' advice , I went ahead and used it in the race and you bet , I finished with a decent time and without a single foot blister . I highly recommend this product . Thank you Mizuno for my first sucessful marathon !

 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition
 I , ve not had any problems with the shoe . other people have had a problem with the zipper . in 30 years of public safety work i found this shoe is very lite in weight and just feels great on my feet and ankles . I will advise you if i have any zipper problems .
 These are very nice and super comfortable shoes . They are cushioned inside so they feel like you 're wearing running shoes . I highly recommend Columbia brand hiking boots . They are on the small side , though . I had to get them half a size larger than I normally wear .
 great boots , if they fit . had to send them back cuz they ran too small by one size
 I just bought these boots and found them to be quite comfortable . I had been hiking in some old , cheap hiking boots and thought it was time to upgrade . I went with these because the price was right and Columbia seemed to be a good brand . I would recommend ordering at least a half size bigger as they seem to run a little small .
 I have worn Columbia Hikers for several years and usually buy a new pair every spring . I searched for the Razor Ridge until I found them here at a price that was much lower than elsewhere . I received them within a few days and have been wearing them ever since . They feel great and look even better than the low ones I bought last year .
 I really love this boot it is lite weight great for hiking when i first put them on it was like i have been using them for a long time it is a great boot
 I had both hiked in the snow and done rock scrambling with this hiking boot . It has a good grip , a good protection of the ankle , and provides reasonable thermal insulation against the cold weather . For its low price , I do n't think I could ask for more .
 Almost return the shoe because it was very snug at first . Wore them for a day and they are very comfortable . I like Hi Tec Lite Shoes but my size was unavailable . These are almost as good .
 Loved the boots ! Very comfy and did n't need much time to break in . The reson it is 4 stars , because there is no WIDE width . That is the major problem for me to get the shoes that really fit . My size is 6 1/2 , but I had to buy 8 in order to make shoes work for me . Thaks to those who mentioned that this boots run on the smaller size , so I added extra 1/2 of the size to the one I usually buy with Medium width and it worked just perfect !

 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country

 I ran my first marathon ever yesterday -LRB- Grandma 's Marathon , Duluth , MN -RRB- and I had been training with several different pairs from different named brands . I always ended up with foot and toe blisters after about 8 miles . After reading Runners World review of the latests , I ordered this pair from Amazon.com .

 These are really good looking casual shoes . They even came with an extra set of laces ... One pair of white and one pair of gray . I have n't yet worn them for long periods but they seem comfortable . Not as supportive as my saucony running shoes , but I did n't expect them to be . My only complaint is that the heel seems a little bit shallow , in the sense that my heel feels like it wants to slip a bit when I walk , despite the overall size of the shoe being right . This is minor though . Good look and good feel for a good price .
 I am completely and utterly in love with these shoes ! I get comments all the time . They not only are amazing looking but are extremely comfortable as well.It 's hard for me to find shoes due to an old injury . A few years ago I injured my left foot , and because of scaring , I do n't have full functionality and it is slightly wider than my right foot . This makes it extremely difficult for me to find shoes that will work . I also am on my feet constantly at my job so that is always a factor . These shoes are wonderful!I was wary about buying shoes online -LRB- I 've never done so before -RRB- , but I just could n't pass these up . I 'm very glad I did n't !
 This is a great athletic as well as a run around town shoe ! I bought these to replace a ten year old pair . My husband and I fast walk , sometimes jog , and this shoe is comfortable and supportive!The price is very attractive also !
 These shoes get noticed due to the color combination . This grandmother loves it . The fit is perfect and the comfort rates high on the scale .
 Love these Saucony Jazz Sneakers ! Bought them in black/silver this time . I have them in three colors . They really are the most comfortable shoes I own and they are so cute ! Cute and comfy , what more could you ask for ? Highly recommend .
 These shoes were on a relative 's wish list - bought a pair for her and liked them so much I bought a pair for me .
 I own these sneakers in 2 other colors already , but I always wanted the black pair . They are incredibly light and comfortable . They fit true to size and hold up great . I got my first pair in 2003 and are still wearable ! You will not regret this buy .
 I have always loved Saucony Jazz and I needed a black pair , which are hard to find , for work . These are awesome . Fast shippment . As described .
 This is the best brand of casual tennis shoes I have yet to find and I can only find a wide selection on Amazon.com . Most stores you can walk in to only carry the low-pro version , however Amazon offers more than one look of the original Jazz . Very pleased with the product -- brand new , no defects .
 These are my favorite shoes . I will be so sad if they ever stop making them . They are the most comfortable for walking or for casual .
 i absolutley love these !! they are so comfortable and look great with my jeans and sneakers !! love them !! defenilty reccomend them !
 I love these sneakers , I 've worn through pair after pair over the years and I keep buying more . They are super light and cushiony , great for walking or running . I just ca n't get into new styles of running shoes that feel clunky , heavy or throw me off balance . These classic joggers have n't changed in decades and are perfect just the way they are !
 I need a pair in every Colorado . I wore sauconys in high school and I still love them now . they run a half size small so if u want a roomier fit buy up a half size . I love it
 I have a few of the original Jazz shoes . They are awesome . Probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn .
 There 's a reason everyone has these sneakers . They 're awesome . This is my second pair -LRB- I have purchased both burgundy and now grey/purple -RRB- - wore the first ones to shreds . They 're light , they 're comfortable , and they 're cute . Gone are the days of boring white sneakers .
 For years I have wanted this design of Saucony , but did n't want to pay full price . Well the lightning deal for these was perfect !! I love Saucony shoes ! They are great for those who have a high arch and a wide foot .
 A friend recommended these to me for work . I think these must be the most comfortable shoes I own . I would highly recommend them to anyone on their feet all day .
 I got these for work . Im on my feet for 12 hours a day . It 's like walking on clouds all day !! Amazing .
 Looove , love , loove , love , love ! I have always had a problem finding comfortable shoes . I have very low arches and these shoes give me the perfect amount of support ! Other brand feel like I have a rubber ball or something under my foot and hurt very much ! They are very light weight and easy to keep clean . I just throw them in the washing machine -LRB- but never the dryer -RRB- and they look brand new . I think these has been the 5th pair I have owned .
 My daughter loves these shoes ! They have `` cush '' and are comfortable for all day wear . She has had them several weeks and still look like new - would buy again .
 This is my fourth pair of Saucony Jazz Originals . I absolutely love them ! I live in NYC and spend a lot of time walking -LRB- several miles a day -RRB- . These shoes offer the cushion and support I need to get through the day and survive the NYC streets . They provide support like a tennis shoe but look much more stylish . I love that they come in a variety of colors . I always receive lots of compliments on these shoes.The shoes fit true to size . I wear 7.5 in most shoe brands , and the 7.5 fits perfectly.Jazz Originals always come with two sets of laces in different colors . This gray/purple shoes comes with matching light gray and purple laces . I use the purple .
 Very comfortable and true to size . Love the red or black shoestring options . In my opinion you ca n't go wrong with Saucony .
 i love these shoes , this is my 4th pair and my second pair from amazon.com , i love them and i ca n't find the good colors in stores but amazon always has every color ever made so i always have endless options .
 This is a great shoe , I bought them over a year ago . They have held up over several washings -LRB- not sure if you should or not , I just do n't put them in the dryer -RRB- . I have two kids and I am always outside with them . I actually like them because they have a bit of style -LRB- my style -RRB- , I have the burgandy ones , they look great with cords , jeans , and yoga pants . These can also be worn to work out , I wear them on my walks and jogs , and they are more comfortable then some of the heavy runners out there . I have a slightly wide foot , which is no problem . My brother has them in the mens , and he has a narrow foot , again , they fit him great !!
 I love Saucony ... I do n't know why I bought a different brand for my previous pair . I just got these in the mail today and they are so comfortable . When I was on the subway to work today , I was wondering when my shoes would arrive . I looked at this stylish girl sitting across from me and she was wearing the EXACT style I just bought . Damn !
 For anyone who needs to wear something casual but not TOO casual like ordinary sneakers , but still needs the cushioning and comfort of padded-heel sneakers , Saucony Originals are the answer . They let you choose colours to go with different outfits and still walk in sneaker-like comfort . They are defintely more padded than most ordinary -LRB- and expensive -RRB- so-called ` walking shoes ' in the market -LRB- I have tried them all over the years , even the most expensive brands -RRB- . Saucony Originals beat them all . I walked through the Museums and Galleries of London and then explored the street sites for hours each evening in my Saucony Oringinals and was amazed to find that my feet did not hurt by the end of the day ! Usually just a few hours walking on the hard marble floor of a Museum is enough to get my feet aching . My Sauconys allowed me 10 hours of pure pleasure with no pain !! Without looking like a dork ! Now I wear them to my business appointments matched with smart-casual pants . I always get admiring comments on them -LRB- my first pair are a pale green combo -RRB- . These are also suitable for people with real-foot problems . I have a very bad pronation and they have held up and held me up , wonderfully.The only complaint is that Amazon does n't carry enough of the colour combinations in different sizes!I 'd buy not one more pair , but a cupboard-full !
 I have a lot of trouble finding a comfortable shoe . I was visiting San Francisco and had trouble with the shoes I was wearing very quickly . We stopped at a shoe store to get me some new shoes and I picked the Saucony Jazz because I liked the style and they looked comfortable . I put them on , and they were , and I hoped that they would stay that way because a lot of walking can change that very quickly . These shoes did n't have to be broken in at all . They were perfect from day one , I can wear them for everything I do , and the ones I have from San Francisco are still in great condition even after serious abuse over the course of 2 1/2 years . I got these the other day , since my old pair is all black and I wanted another version of the Jazz . The colors are interesting , but I love them just as much as my old pair . They are just as comfortable as the pair I had been wearing for 2 1/2 years without needing a break in . I highly recommend these .
 I 've had several pairs of these sneakers over the years . They are so comfy , affordable , and I see no reason to ever switch to a different shoe .
 I purchased a pair of women 's Saucony Jazz sneakers years ago and loved them . They do n't pinch anywhere and make walking on my treadmill a breeze . The Jazz model is hard to find in stores , but I can order them over the internet and that 's great.Whatever I order through Amazon always turns out to be a good choice .
 These shoes are wonderful . The support is incredible . If you do a lot of running or power walking , look no further .
 I love Saucony 's so when I needed new shoes , I got these . They 're super comfy to walk in but murder to stand in which is why I 'm not giving them a 5 . I talked to a salesman at the Saucony store who said their shoes are meant for action and movement , not standing ... which is true . So , if you 're a cashier or stand in line a lot , these may not be the best choice . I 'm about 60 lbs overweight and find these extremely comfortable to walk in . I do overpronate a little and wish they had stiffer support on the inside to keep my ankle from rolling in , but that can be fixed with inserts . They 're cute , they breathe easy and do n't need to be broken in . . they 're flexible ... so you ca n't go wrong with these . I 'd love to have more in different colors !
 I love these kicks ! They are light weight , comfy and true to size . I wear an 8 , ordered an 8 and thats how they fit ... like an 8 . Perfectly ! They are nice and roomy across the top of the foot -LRB- but my foot it kinda narrow -RRB- They are a little snug around the heel but not to the point of discomfort . I have a hard time finding shoes that are comfortable due to having high arches . My feet do n't hurt at the end of the day after wearing these . I can easily fit arch supports or heel cushions in them for added comfort -LRB- but do n't have to -RRB- . I vote yes on these ! I will be purchasing these in other colors !
 I have the grey with the purple flourish.I bought these when I found out I had bunions and was dxed with planar fasciatis . The doc told me to only wear sneakers . Fortunately the dress code where I work is lax so I was able to ditch my flats and start wearing sneakers . I chose these because
 Ha d apair of these years ago and they were the most comfortable shoe i ever owned , bought them at a thrift shop too ! finally decided to get another pair and nothing has changed ! even brand new they feel like you been wearing them forever ! I would advise anyone ot buy these shoes !
 My wife has worn them non-stop since they arrived . They 're great . I have since bought her another pair of these because she loves them so much .
 I have had all kinds of dance sneakers -LRB- for zumba -RRB- and this ones are the best from y flat feet ! They do not hurt my feet at all and keep them with lateral support!I 'm getting me my third pair already !
 These sneakers have already gotten me many compliments and I love the old-school vibe . The removable insole is cushy , but I will probably change it out soon for something with stronger arch support . One weird thing -LRB- which maybe is unique to the pair I was shipped ? -RRB- is that the shoes came with two sets of laces each - white ones that go through all the shoeholes and leave enough lace for only a single knot and then gray laces that are only laced through the last two or three sets of holes and then have a little too much leftover -LRB- I double-knot them and the loops almost reach the ground -RRB- . It 's weird not because it came with two laces , but because I do n't see how either set could work alone . The white laces are too short unless you trust a single knot when tying your shoes , and the gray ones , while too long the way they came laced , would be impossibly short to lace through the entire shoe.I 've made it work by doing a single knot with the white laces and getting the gray ones double-knotted just right to keep the loops from being too long , but it is a hassle to tie each shoe twice every morning and I 'm not sure if it 's meant as a fashion statement or if they got lazy about finding the right length for the laces .
 Five stars . No debate over that . Nope.I buy different colors and versions of the jazz and ca n't find anything else that competes.Right now , my brown -LRB- laced with brown -RRB- ones are on their last few miles -LRB- loose that bounce and you know its time -RRB- and I am trying to decide which color to go with this time . The pair before those were burgandy . The pair before those a grey/greenish color , before those ... I forget.I am a stylish woman and find ways to make them work with my casual clothes.I have not had the black with silver accents in a long time ... maybe I will get those !
 These shoes are warm and comfy and perfect for walking or running to class -LRB- if you need to -RRB- I got them because I knew I would be walking a lot more and wanted something that went with a lot of different styles . people comment on them all the time and even my husband is super jealous and wants his own pair . they are awesome !
 Shoes are comfortable . I am pleased with the product I ordered.This style shoe was hard to find in stores , glad I was able to find online . I will order again in the near future .
 This shoe is very comfortable , true to size , and is so far holding up very well . I switched the laces for white because otherwise the shoes were just too green , even for me ! I often get comments on how cute they are . These are the shoes I pull out anytime I 'm looking for comfort !
 These are by far the most comfortable tennis shoes I 've ever worn ! I have tendonitis in my left foot and after walking ALL day in these shoes , my feet were still very comfortable and did not hurt . BUT , the photo makes these shoes look really bulky and they are n't . I almost did n't buy them based solely on the picture because it makes them look very square , boxy and bulky . These are great shoes
 These are great sneakers for day to day walking around . They are comfortable as soon as you put them on and hold up pretty well to regular use . I wear them a few days a week and my first pair lasted almost 2 years before they became less comfortable . They look great with jeans and I often get compliments on them . I 've had them in gray/olive and now in navy/silver . I 'm a size 11 and love that these fit and are affordable . The only reason I 'm not giving them 5 stars is because the arch support could be better . I will totally buy these again !
 This is my fourth pair of Saucony Originals . I find them extremely comfortable with excellent arch support for my high arches . And I get compliments on how attractive they are !
 Ca n't find any sneakers that fit as well as these Saucony 's . Now that I found them , I just order when needed and do n't have to worry about the fit . Most size 10 's have been too small . These are perfect , lightweight and comfortable beyond belief !
 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country
 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last

 I ran my first marathon ever yesterday -LRB- Grandma 's Marathon , Duluth , MN -RRB- and I had been training with several different pairs from different named brands . I always ended up with foot and toe blisters after about 8 miles . After reading Runners World review of the latests , I ordered this pair from Amazon.com . It arrived one week before the race and immediately felt the difference when I tried to run 4 miles with it . The forefoot compartment is roomy and heel part well-cushioned . The shoes felt like they are already broken in . Against my friends ' advice , I went ahead and used it in the race and you bet , I finished with a decent time and without a single foot blister . I highly recommend this product . Thank you Mizuno for my first sucessful marathon !
 Shoes are really pretty and comfortable . I have received many compliments . They are easy to clean and have a little elastic on the back that makes them easy to put on and take off . I have trouble wearing heels but I was able to handle these well .
 Just got the Brown Croc Patent today . Such a beautiful shoe ; photo does n't do it justice . Best of all , it is comfortable , especially for someone who has WW-width feet like me.Ross Hommerson rocks ! 4/3/2012 update
 Quality , stylish , comfortable and all around fabulous ! -LRB- Wife 's words ... -RRB- Will be buying in all colors ! So impressed , looks great , do n't hesitate to buy . = -RRB-
 My first pair of croc pumps I think they are very very comfortable I got the wide width the slingback is comforable I would diffently buy them again or refer them to my family and friends you will be pleased .
 Men 's Propet CampWalker Waterproof Boots Hi -LRB- top -RRB- ... My first pair , was purchased about 2-3 years ago . These were very comfortable , from the start . That pair , was the BLACK ones -LRB- and are about 80 % worn out , and I walk a lot -RRB- . This time -LRB- 1-1-2011 -RRB- , I got the BROWN colored ones , and these are less comfortable , but are OK -LRB- not as good as before ? -RRB- . Both are the same exact part number , 10X -LRB- 3E -RRB- and has M3589 , on the tong tag . I usually use a 10-EE . And the Website uses , 10XW for its description?Trying to figure out what 's the difference -LRB- besides color -RRB- , I got out my tape measure . The older BLACK pair are 1/8 inches wider , in both the rubber sole and the shoe -LRB- at the widest point -RRB- . Fix-wise , the BROWN pair feels like , they are slightly tighter . If I push my foot hard forward in the shoe , my big toe , does n't touch the inside tip of the shoe -LRB- my older BLACK one 's , I could -RRB- . The BROWN ones seem slightly cheaper -LRB- sole and materials used -RRB- . Bottom line : The BLACK one were very nice -LRB- exceed my expectations -RRB- , BROWN , less so -LRB- TBD -RRB- . The BROWN pair are slightly more narrow and longer by about 1/8-in , or so . I expect them to brake-in -LRB- stretch-to-fit -RRB- - If so , I 'll be happy ... BTW ; ShoeBuy , does n't answer their phones nor email , I tried many times ... Update -LRB- 2-14-2011 -RRB- : These ones rub my heal , the wrong way . Hopping they would brake-in , I tried to ignore it - Till I had a sore spot . I like these boots , so I wanted to try anything . I used a hair dryer on the offending area , that was rubbing my heal . Once I got it hot , I pushed the area outward . This seems to have helped 90 % . TBD
 Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price . Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price . Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I do n't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots . After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good . Even though they are black , they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs . They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them .
 We Purchase these every six months , they are great walking shoes , very comfortable , sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition

 We all love the shoes , they fit perfectly and most important , my grandson was thrilled with them .
 These shoes were a great bargain and my son loves them . Cool soccer shoes !
 I felt in love with this shoe during my High School Track and Field years -LRB- 2000 -RRB- !!!! Now , I buy them every other year . My hubby even like them and now I order one for him also . They 're so light and easy on my feet . If you are a runner , especially a sprinter you will not regret buying this shoe .
 These Pumas are one of my favorite pair of casual shoes . Very comfortable , just be sure not to snag the `` woven '' . I do n't go a day without someone complimenting them , and we all know compliments are nice .
 they are so different , and everytime i wear them . . i get compliments . . great shoe to buy if you are into shoes and outfits . .
 Consider yourself as a `` Un rey '' when wearing these sneakers . Really great style .
 I got some Tennis Pros with black stripes about three weeks ago . After wearing them a few times with jeans , I noticed the stripes on the outside of both feet had faded a bit , so they are n't truly black anymore ; instead , they are a shade of darkish gray . Otherwise , I love them and try to wear them as much as possible . Very comfortable and I think they look great with jeans . Perfect for casual Fridays .
 A perfect shoe if you need something comfortable that you can easily slip on and off for quick trips to the store or a quick walk .

 very cute boots for toddlers . stylish and practical.gore-tex is a great technology to prevent soaking.I gave only 4 stars as they are rather difficult to put on
 I got these for my 2nd grader daughter to replace her Merrill and Reebok sneakers -LRB- which were good , but not great -RRB- . These shoes are AWESOME . She loves the pink color , naturally , and I love that they are constructed like an adult athletic shoe -LRB- most kids shoes are NOT , even the upscale brands -RRB- . I 'm sure these will last into the fall . I also like that Adidas has half-sizes in their kids line . The fit is perfect . She says these are the most comfortable sneaker she 's ever worn . They were outrageously cheap -LRB- $ 15 -RRB- - try beating that at the mall for this quality shoe - impossible !
 I ordered these shoes , the price was great !!! I received them really fast and they fit perfect.It was a very positive online shopping experience .
 Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes . Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes , so I was pleased . I do have hammer toes , and got a few red spots on top of my toes , but I do n't know how I could have avoided that .
 Softspots are my favorite shoes . These are super comfortable , fit well , and last a long time . So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work , and my feet never hurt . Bravo ! I highly recommend them .
 These are a nice pair of casual work shoes . Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks . They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer .
 This is a great shoe , though I find that it runs narrow . I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all . My right foot wentin with some effort . It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in . I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato
 Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years . The only thing I do n't like about them , they are not made in the UNITED STATES now . . I needed them or I would not have bought them . Hope they will give me the service the others did .
 I am on my feet 12 or more hours a day . Cement floors and high activity have destroyed multiple sets of shoes . I have bough some brands and totaled them in 3-4 months . The only thing showing wear is the finish . The toes are scuffed up from crawling and moving around working on equipment . If there is work to be done I am all over it . My shoes better be prepared to take it all . These Wolverines are comfortable and solidly built.When I do finally give them more then they can handle , I will be buying another set to replace them . I would love a more durable toe area for lasting beauty but I do n't want to give up the comfort that these shoes offer to my hard working feet .
 Second pair that i have purchased for working a 12 hour shift . Boots are steel toed , rated for 600 volts , and light and flexible . Feel like regular boots . I even wear them on my days off sometimes as they are a good looking shoe . Company purchases 1 pair of safety shoes per year , and after 16 years i have gone through many different brands of safety shoes . These are the best . No leg fatigue or foot pain . They come in wide size , but normal size fits fine . I enjoy the added safety of the 600 volts rating as i work around high voltage constantly .
 My first pair of Wolverine boots . I have read nothing but good reviews , so I tried a pair . These are the most comfortable boots I have ever had . I use these 10 -12 hrs a day on concrete , gravel , slanted surfaces , etc. and these are sturdy and look nice . Almost like walking on air ! Uppers made in Dominican Republic , assembled in the USA . I will never buy cheap Chinese -LRB- communist -RRB- made boots again .
 Very comfortable . I 'm on my feet 10 hrs . a day on concreet floors and these are the best I ever found .
 These are great boots , I do n't go to stores anymore . I just order these every year as they are very comfortable from day one .
 This boot is Great!I work 12 hour shifts , Very comfortable and keep feet dry . Soft leather make break in time easy . Have looked at other boots and feel this is the best boot for the buck . Sears use to sell this boot off the shelf and no longer do , witch left me looking on the web . Amazon had the best price and best policy for returns . Thank You Amazon !
 I just picked up a pair of these boots and on the first use they felt great even after being in them all day . They also look good too . Great job Wolverine !

 In general Brooks is a good brand . This model in particular is awesome . you will not believe how cushioned it is ! If you are looking for a very comfortable running or walking shoe , this is it !
 The Glycerin 6 are heavy and poorly designed . The Defyance are the closest distance trainer but not as well cushioned and designed as the Glycerin 5 .
 Recently purchased a pair for an upcomming marathon and they have exceeded my expectations . Once they were broken in i could really appreciate the comfortable fit and even cushioning the sneaker provides.If you are a nuetral runner i would recommend a pair .

 The boots have exceeded by expectations . Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville . I 'm wearing them to work with slacks , polo , and dress coat . The smooth finish allows you to dress formal -LRB- suit -RRB- and also looks good with jeans . Being new , the lower section -LRB- foot covering -RRB- has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft . When worn for a while , the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture . The lower portion still shines more than the shaft . Unlike other boots , these have a sole with traction control . I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product . While wearing these boots six days a week -LRB- 14 hr days -RRB- , I have not noticed any foot , leg , or back pain . These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own . The `` break-in '' period was short . I recommended conventional black shoe polish . In 2011 , I will order a second pair . It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option -LRB- tan -RRB- in this same boot . I hope this helps ...
 These boots were a gift to my Grandson . Double H has always have had good products and this is no exception . They were received on time , packed well to arrive in perfect condition , which they did . My Grandson is wearing these and likes them very much .
 Very please with my boots . I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish . Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country

It arrived one week before the race and immediately felt the difference when I tried to run 4 miles with it . The forefoot compartment is roomy and heel part well-cushioned . The shoes felt like they are already broken in . Against my friends ' advice , I went ahead and used it in the race and you bet , I finished with a decent time and without a single foot blister . I highly recommend this product . Thank you Mizuno for my first sucessful marathon !
 I felt in love with this shoe during my High School Track and Field years -LRB- 2000 -RRB- !!!! Now , I buy them every other year . My hubby even like them and now I order one for him also . They 're so light and easy on my feet . If you are a runner , especially a sprinter you will not regret buying this shoe .

 Super cute little sandals , but seem to run a bit small , and strap across the top is barely long enough . Still , feel great for driving or walking , and the straps seem to be stretching a bit so they 're quite comfortable . I plan to use these a lot this summer . Think the stud detail on all the straps is really cute and makes these just a bit different !

 This is my second pair of softwalk shoes and I just LOVE them . They are true to size so I never have to worry if I order online if they will fit . And they are stylish and sooooooo comfortable . I have problems with pain in my feet and toes with other brands , but never with these . They are wonderful from the first day I wear them and on .
 Wanted comfortable slip-on shoes to take on a trip for ease in getting thru TSA screenings . Ended up using them every day ! Love 'em .
 I love these shoes . They are really cute , true to size and very comfortable . I 've received compliments on how cute they are .
 Great clogs , available in WW if you need them -LRB- and I need them ! -RRB- . The &#34; Murietta &#34; style comes in many colors and textures . I must have 5-6 pairs . I started buying them a few years ago , and still buy a couple every year . They 're durable , comfortable and stylish .
 My favorite shoe -- I have them in brown and black ... and actually this is my 2nd pair of black . I wore out the first pair I had ! I have narrow feet and these fit perfectly . I can walk on them for long distances or stand for hours with no pain in my feet . Pretty much all of my other shoes are Softwalk as well , but these are my faves !!
 I first fell in love with the Softwalk Clog several years ago and used them as my work shoes until they wore out . I was unable to find the same style for about 6 months and was so happy to see them back for sale . They are comfortable beyond belief and I love not having the extra shoe around the back of my heel . I think I just might buy another pair in case they are taken off the selection list again .
 I wish I could get more of these awesome suede clogs.They are super comfortable . Perfect for work or at home .
 Very comfortable and very cute ! Its a little warm to wear in South Texas in this heat . I ca n't wait for some cooler weather so I can enjoy these shoes some more .
 Splurged on the black suede last week and have just gone back for the same style in dark grey . Shoe is very attractive and does not have that `` matronly '' look to it despite its low heel . Much more attractive than the photo representation . Most importantly , the shoe is soooo comfortable . Material hugs your feet like a pair of gloves . I got both pairs at a subtantial discount -LRB- additional promotional discount for the grey pair -RRB- but would have paid full price . They are certainly worth it .
 Except for a few pair of cowboy boots , Softwalk are the only shoes I have bought for almost 5 years . They are great for my long hours on my feet . No other shoes have worked as well .
 Softwalk shoes are the only shoes I buy anymore . I have long hours on my feet and no other shoes have worked as well . I have this in several colors . -LRB- except for an occasional pair of cowboy boots -RRB-
 I 'm on my feet most of the day at work and my feet are so comfortable in these shoes . The cushions inside the shoe give my foot a massage as I walk . You just put your foot in the shoe , say wow , and you do n't want to take them off . Find a shoe store that carries softwalks , put your foot in them to get the correct size and then search online best price , they 're not cheap but they are worth it .
 These are my favorite style of shoe . I have them in many colors . Feels like walking on pillows . Nice wedge heel with stability and no slip . Easy on and off and they hug so nicely there is no effort keeping them on while walking . Do yourself a favor and splurge for these ! Sizing is accurate for your normal shoe size .
 These are great . I ordered them in a narrow and they fit perfect . I would definately recommend them to anyone . Very comfy and the texture is very unique .
 These were too small/narrow for me even though I bought a wide width . I could tell , however , they would have been comfy to the feet .
 I have a narrow foot so I ordered these in AA . The fit is perfect for my narrow foot and the cushion in the clog makes it easier to stand or walk all day .
 I 've been wearing MBT shoes for years , suffering sesamoiditis . This Muriett Solftwalk is very comfortable and I can walk long distances without any feet pain .
 I wanted a clog with a little more height ; very nice clog and really comfortable . I would really recommend these clogs since they are a little dressy too . .

 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last

 The reaction of my girlfriend when i bought it was very good ... she loves it very much and uses it all the time

 I bought them as a gift for my husband and he really likes them . They are a little stiff and need to be broken in but other than that they are nice .
 Nice pair of business casual shoes , but I am not sure if they are meant for daily use . For the price , they are a steal of a deal .
 SUPER SEXY SUPER GREAT PRODUCT . Got them for my husband and he loves them . very great good looking with the white thread . better than the black shoes with black thread . highly recommend for hot husbands everywhere
 The style and pricing of this shoe make it a favorite in my inventory . Love Madden products for fit and style and Amazon 's price is $ 30 less than retail stores .
 As far as style and comfort these are my favorite shoes to buy . I have wide feet and these shoes slip on very well and stay on very well . Look good and last 6 months which is good for how much I pay . Buy again and again
 Got these for my husbands birthday . He always wanted some white ones and feel in love with them when he saw them .
 Tha NOVO is a great shoe ; light , comfortable , and the leather is real soft . I wear them both with dress and casual outfits . I bought the Oxford Tan first , wore them for a month and decided to buy a second pair in brown . I recommend the NOVO to anybody who is looking for a stylish , comfortable shoe with a great value .
 The color and wash of these are so much nicer looking than regular brown loafers you 'd find somewhere else.The person I bought them for needed to exchange them for half a size down than his usual .
 This is a good shoe , but not an excellent one . I purchased it 3 months ago and it 's holding well . It 's very comfortable .
 The shoe was n't as supple as I thought hence only 4 stars , but after wearing them several times they feel like they were Made especially for me
 These shoes are very nice but they run small . The return process is very easy . Too bad Amazon did not stock the correct size for me and I did not want to buy from their 3rd party sellers .
 Amazing shoe for the price - I purchased the white one 's at $ 25 with free shipping , which is an amazing discount . Very unique , sharp looking style has gotten loads of compliments .
 As far as driving shoes concerned , their not the best I 've ever had , but they 're pretty close . I only wear them out on the weekends , but they 've held up pretty well so far . Being that the leather is white , actually makes taking care of them pretty easy with the use of a shoe whitener . However , the leather seems not quite as sturdy as other shoes I 've purchased , but then again , with a gift card , these only cost me $ 10 . A solid purchase for if I may say so .
 I have received so many compliments on this shoe , especially when wearing it with Jeans and Colored shirt at work . Pefect shoe for Business Casual. , comfortable and stylish .
 Really , wish i ordered two pairs , hard to find shoes like these and they last a decent amount of time .
 Great shoe ... soft , sleek looking , comfortable and the process was extremely easy to use ... I pick the wrong size and was able to return and receive a new pair within a week
 This is my second pair of these shoes . They are comfortable with or without socks . For the price it is a good shoe . Excellent for casual wear or as a dress shoe .
 The shoes are very sleek and comfortable . I wore them during a date night with my wife and it completed the look . I 'd recommend these shoes to all Steve Madden fans !
 I used these shoes for three years as my daily shoes during residency training in busy clinic/hospital where I would walk/Stand for several hours . After those three years , the shoes insoles were already worn so I added Dr Scholl 's insoles to reinforce it . Yet the leather and the outside soles still maintained its crisp and unworn look . A lot of people would see these shoes and comment that my new shoes looked nice . They would be surprised when I tell them I have had them for years.Unfortunately , I have to move on with new shoes after using these for so long . But I am already very impressed and committed to Steve Madden shoes , so I am buying the Steve Madden Men 's Nobyll Loafers . They look alike , but at least a bit different . I just ordered these and wanted to add a few lines in favor of my Novo shoes as a gratitude to a well built shoe . `` I will miss you good Novo . '' Sob sob sob .
 I would have rated the shoes with 5 stars , but they run half a size larger than what I usually wear , besides that they are great .
 These shoes are so nice ! Exactly as described ! I bought these as a birthday present for my dad . I was very excited when I found these shoes so cheap !
 I got these for a friend , they really looked great , He said they was a little narrow for his foot . But got them streached a little and feels great . Really enjoy shopping with Amazon , so for everything has been delieveried on time . And the price you ca n't beat .
 Shoe is high quality , well made and very comfortable - I wear it everyday . Received many compliments from others . Highly recommended .
 The shoes were a gift for my husband . He loves them . They are little tight in the toebox , otherwise great .
 These fit beautifully and are perfect for almost any use . The upper is all leather with a leather lining , which is nice .

 These shoes were absolutely beautiful . They match two dressy outfits I currently have . The beading on them was nicely done . Could n't believe the price and was pleasantly surprised!Cherri

 Bought these for my wife . They are not great to walk in , she tells me , but she looks fantastic in them.Do yourself a favor and treat that special lady in your life to these classic shoes. ; -RRB-
 You have to know that they are really small pads ... And be really small i mean tiny ! But they protect a lot for that size , and they are really cute ! I love this tiny pads and you 'll love them too if you like to feel the floor . I would n't recomend this for begginers . . They may hurt with this alone , but if you begginer use it with another pad they are awsome !
 My second toe is significantly longer than my first , come to think of it , so is my third toe . These pads fit into tight space of the toe box and really provide relief to to my toesies !
 I have had the worst problem finding toe protectors for use in my pointe shoes . Most are not enough or too much !! These are small and fit right into the platform area of the box -LRB- my pointe shoes are Russian Pointes . -LRB- They really only work for a medium or small platform , they will not work for a wide platform -RRB- . I put the large one in first then layer it with the small -LRB- for the 1st & 2nd toes -RRB- for extra padding , then use a Lambs Wool toe cover over my toes . I love these Toe Savers , just enough !!
 I really like these , I had Bloch Pointe shoes at first , and I loved them . However , most everyone else in my class had Russian , so I wanted to test them out . I realized that the Russian pointe did n't have the extra padding that the Bloch had , and since I have thin toe pads , it made a difference . I looked online , and found these . I love them ! They help a lot , and I do n't hurt as badly . The only problems are that they get holes easily if you put them inside your toepad , which I did the first time because they are a little hard to position in your box if your hands are bigger than your box , which mine are , -LRB- although the holes do n't make much of a difference in the padding -RRB- , the sticky-ness on the end does n't stick -LRB- but that might be better , that way if you put them in crooked or end up not liking them they are n't there forever -RRB- , and they make the shoe a little tighter . But overall , I would say that these are awesome ! -LRB- Plus they come in pink and purple ! -RRB-
 They work great for saving your toes while wearing pointe shoes.Use them regularly and think they work very well .

 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 These Pumas are one of my favorite pair of casual shoes . Very comfortable , just be sure not to snag the `` woven '' . I do n't go a day without someone complimenting them , and we all know compliments are nice .
 they are so different , and everytime i wear them . . i get compliments . . great shoe to buy if you are into shoes and outfits . .
 Consider yourself as a `` Un rey '' when wearing these sneakers . Really great style .

 I loved the way the flats looked like in Amazon.com only when they arrived it did n't look as I thought they would when I wore them . They are pretty and comfortable and that 's what counts plus it 's a good bargain .
 These shoes are adorible . They are very hard though . Not a lot of give . They are definitly worth the price . I would recommend !

 This shoe is very nice and comfortable , but be sure of your shoe size before ordering . My grandson had grown much more than he knew and I ended up having to return the shoe for only the size being too small . The shoe size was accurate , but my grandson had grown another size larger . These shoes were represented accurately and we would have been pleased if we could have used the size . When we returned the shoes , we were refunded our money in a very timely manner . I have never regretted ordering from Amazon .
 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 This is the second pair , I have owned , and these are very good boots . You do n't have to break them in . The fit is superior .
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .
 Super comfortable . Great support ; the special sole and heel pads cushion each step and ease the shock to the musculoskeletal system . The foot is surrounded by breathable fabric on top of a generous amount of padding . This model is also good looking enough to wear in casual non-work situations . - A world away from the $ 49.95 discount-store work boots !
 I have been wearing wolverine durashock boots for over ten years . You can not get a more comfortable and durable boot .
 When I was a kid in the 70s , there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out , but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards , either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings . Those sneakers were great for any sport , they held up under abuse , and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike . These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design , and come in a wide variety of cuts , colors & materials . I 've got several pairs of low-cuts , one pair in suede with natural -LRB- translucent brown -RRB- rubber toe , another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber , and this pair , shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber . There are a variety of color combinations to pick from , in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile . They are some of the toughest , well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well . They 're the ultimate casual weekend shoe , and the most recent ones I 've gotten come with a lighter , shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert , giving better support . I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too , and honestly , the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands . They can stand up to serious abuse , especially the ones made out of leather .
 The service was unbelievably easy , and the product was shipped sooo fast ! Thank you ! This was my first purchase but it wo n't be my last
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .

 Product arrived as promised and in good condition . Great shoes for around the house without the weight of the heavy athletic shoes .
 This sneakers are just great ! They are true size . I am very pleased with my purchase .
 I got these Keds black canvas sneakers for my Mom for Christmas . She totally loved them !! Said they fit great and were very comfortable . Black canvas is hard to find in the stores ~ especially in such a small size ~ so I was delighted to find them online . Package arrived on time and in great condition . I highly recommend this product and vendor .
 The Ked Champion is what I hoped it would be and I was/am very satisfied .
 The price was right , appreciated free shipping ... received the product 10 days after the suggested delivery ... purchased for a gift , and it arrived the day I needed it ... was worried it would not arrive
 I 'm very happy with this purchase . I love my new navy Keds ! They came quickly and fit great !
 The shoes were great , but I have such a small feet they were too big . Sorry I had to return them .
 Just bought several NEW Keds in White , Black , Navy , Bright Blue and Red to replace the OLD Keds that I bought 20 years ago ! And my `` old '' Keds are still for perfect for yard shoes , knock around shoes etc ! My new Keds in White and Black are of leather and how comfortable and easy care they are ! The Bright Blue , Red and Navy Blue are canvas and washable . All are just wonderful and looking forward to another 20 years service . Since I was a kid , I have lived in Keds sneakers for the comfort , looks and the fact that they last and last and last . They are all worth every penny that I paid for them . Thanks Keds , hope you never change !
 very cheap for Keds , fits excellent , got it really fast in two days , i just love them they ar very confortable and looks well with everything . Totally worth it : -RRB-
 Love these boat shoes . A + + + + + for comfort in the front toes and back heel . Hope they sell other colors . Nice construction .
 Love the black lower edge color . I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day . The past keds fit a little better . Wonderful shoes otherwise .
 I am always a size 6 in footwear , but get a 6.5 for sneakers -LRB- Converse , Vans -RRB- . I bought the navy Keds in size 6 -LRB- M -RRB- , medium width , and it 's a little too narrow . However , going up to 6.5 would result in the shoes being too long . I wo n't be able to wear these without socks in the summer , so I 'm going to invest in a pair of insoles when summer comes . I agree with previous reviewers that these shoes run narrow and long . After having them on my feet for some time with thin socks , they have stretched slightly in width . The quality is pretty good , comparable to canvas Converse and Vans . I bought Keds to wear around on campus since I wanted something less bulky than Converse All-stars and a bit more feminine than Vans Lo Pros . Overall , I 'm satisfied with my purchase and might buy another pair in the future .
 LOVE these . Got them in grey with yellow laces - LOVE this color combo . They are true to size , comfy with or without socks -LRB- thin socks -RRB- , and clean very easy . I use oxyclean spray and/or put them in the washer and they come out squeaky clean . So glad I got these !
 The sneakers arrived timely . I have loved Keds since I was a kid and it 's nice to be able to get them so easily .
 Are so little and pretty -LRB- 6M :p -RRB- . The size are just right and the color is nice . All that I was expected .
 I previously had the same Keds sneaker . Liked them . Ordered a medium width , not a wide width . Had to return them .
 This style of Keds are cute enough to wear with summer dresses and maxi skirts . They provide more arch support than ballet flats and are good for lots of walking .
 I used to have a keds as a kid and I was n't sure whether I would want a shoe that I had during my childhood . I do n't regret anything about these shoes , they are just as comfortable as I remembered them .
 Product arrived quickly , with great packaging . The color was exactly as pictured . The fit is execellent with more arch support than I expected . The shoes appear to be well made without any visible defects . I will probably order a second pair in another color as I am very pleased with these . They are just what I was looking for .
 These are some of my favorite shoes
 At first I ordered an 8.5 and they were too big but i was nervous about exchanging them cause i did n't want to get charged twice . but i went for it anyways to try to get an 8 and they fit perfectly and I got refunded on the shipping of the previous pair that did n't fit -LRB- and obviously did n't have to pay for the shoes again cause it was an exchange with the same vender -RRB- . bottom line
 The Keds are fine . I have had them for a few days now and they are great . No complaints at all .
 The shoes are nice but not in the way I expected . I should have ordered them a bid larger and much wider .
 My mother has long , narrow feet and has had difficulty finding a good fit . This was convenient and a perfect fit . She 's delighted -- and so am I.
 My sister in law only wear these shoes . I could n't find them in a department store , so I decided to check Amazon . I was so elated when I found them and in her hard to find size . I thought that I would n't get them in time for Christmas , but they arrived just as promised . My sister in law LOVED them and I was extemely satisfied !
 I never really thought of myself as someone who has wide feet until I received my keds . I still love the damn shoe so I 've kept them and broken them in to fit my foot . They 're good looking shoes and are very comfortable -LRB- once broken in -RRB- !
 I have been wearing Keds Champion for over 65 years . It is hard to find sneakers that come in narrow widths .
 Have been wearing Keds for years . Had to go to a larger size because I need thicker insoles . They 're great !
 I love to wear my keds . The price , the quality and having them available was why I chose them , Its had to find keds this time of year . I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size , just leather not canvas material . Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found .
 I have major problems finding size 9-1/2 medium in any shoe so I was pleased to find these at Fusion through Amazon . They are great , the fit is correct and very comfortable . Not much one can say about canvas tennis shoes but they are nice quality and more important , as I said before a good true fit .
 Keds is one shoe I can always depend on for the best fit , color , style and comfort . Washable , and wearable right out of the box , I loved Keds as a kid and even more as an adult
 The shoes arrived in a jiffy and were all that I 'd hoped they would be ... a little wider than those of my youth -LRB- because that 's the way I 'd ordered them -RRB- , still lightweight and comfortable , and with solid arch support . They 're good walkers without being bulky . They 're trim summer oxfords that do n't overpower the look of an outfit . I got a stony-beach scuff on one toe , so I washed it . It washed and dried nicely , but the toe is n't pristine anymore , so , I guess I 'll polish these sneaks just as I did in the '60s .
 When I was growing up , my Floridian grandmother only wore one kind of shoe that I can remember
 I love this shoe . It is the same style that I had twenty years ago . The shoe is light weight , comfortable , and durable . I would highly recommend them because you would not want to wear any other tennis shoe.Sincerely , csh
 SCREW WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING ! I purchased these and they came within 3 days . They are VERY comfortable , light , goes with anything you wear , and they are cheap . I bought some from Payless and these are WAAAAAAAAAY better : -RRB-
 This is probably my 10th pair of these sneakers . I wear them to death . Not fancy ... comfortable ... goes with all casual clothing and very `` smart '' looking . Very Audrey Hepburn .
 I originally ordered the wrong size . Amazon arranged an exchange and I am enjoying the sneakers . I always have a good experience with Amazon .
 I had forgotten how much I loved my `` sneakers '' back in the day when I routinely wore Keds . Now I am in love with them all over again . Great shoes !
 I was needing these shoes in a hurry and I was n't disappointed . Thanks for the great service and the condition of the package when it arrived was excellent .
 These shoes were just as I expected . They do seem to run about a half size small , though . They do seem well made . Thanks !
 I wore Keds as a child and loved them . I got these to wear with a poodle skirt because I could n't find any saddle oxoford shoes to suit me . I am looking forward to wearing my new Keds .
 The shoes came earlier than expected and were in good shape . They were brand new and in the box and the size was correct .
 I love the sneakers . They are better quality than the ones at Payless , and a good price too .
 Keds is known for quality and this show will not let you down . The only negative is that I purchased extra wide and it was no different than the medium width . There was nothing that allowed for my Mother 's wider foot to fit into .
 MY wifes all time favorite shoes and this is the place to buy them and you can save a lot of money from these people .
 These sneakers are very comfortable and I am very pleased with the look and price . I would highly recommend for a casual flat everyday shoe .
 THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS TOP-NOTCH , SAME AS THE SNEAKERS ! I HAVE BEEN BUYING THEM FOR YEARS AND WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE WHO LIKES COMFORT AND A GOOD PRICE .
 My new keds are so awesome ! They look exactly like the picture . I am so happy that I got these . They are comfy and stylish , and when they wear out , I will buy from amazon !
 These are cute , they stay tied , and there 's just enough slip to use these babies on a dance floor without having to spring for full suede bottoms . They also hold up well when you throw them into a huge dance bag and accidentally crush them in the trunk of your car .
 These are cute keds . My daughter has size 11 feet so it is hard to find shoes to fit her . These were just what she was looking for
 I love Keds and they 're always true to size , so nice to know I can order them here . I 'll likely order more .
 I gave these KED Sneakers a 5 Star rating because they are everything I expected and more ! Thrilled to pieces !
 The Keds sneaker met my expectation . It is comfortable and is of good quality . I 'm very happy with the fit and overall comfort .
 My grandaughter is so pleased and happy with her shoes . They are awesome as she wanted . The article came on time for a day she has to used . Good service , excellent pruchase
 Purchased these for my 75 year old sister who had been looking and looking for some navy keds . She loves them .
 Great quality for the money . Hate the heaviness of most tennis shoes , these are light weight and good support without making my feet feel heavy
 Worn keds my whole life . Still love them . This is my daughters second pair of black . Think it 's so cool that as a teenager she wears them .
 Wonderful product , great quality ! I just ca n't say enough about how much we love them ! If you are on the fence about getting these , do it , you will not be disappointed !
 I love these shoes . Because of my knees I need a shoe that is totally flat and Keds fit the bill . I like the black/black style because it looks less like a tennis shoe . They wear very well and clean up easily .
 These cute , white Keds are perfect with so many outfits . Their slender sillouette adds a feminine touch to jeans , shorts , capris and summer skirts . They are comfortable for walking around town and give a much simpler profile than most sneakers these days .
 i love my sneakers . i have to say that one of the things i like is i can wash them and i have never had the problem of the front of the insole coming apart
 So comfy and goes with any outfit . Great for everyday wear and you look cool too . I literally wear them everyday .
 product received as was ofered . no problems with it and satisfaded with the order . also came on time as expected .
 Love them have been wearing Keds for yearsand they never let me down . My 10yr old daughter also loves hers .
 i love these . if you are getting them , get your EXACT size . really comfy . GETTING MORE . happy buyer , and more to purchase !
 Best fit I have had for these shoes would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a soft play shoe . .
 These shoes are cute and convenient . I pair them with jeans to do chores like grocery shopping , or when I go to the movies . They do n't really have arch support so I wo n't be wearing them for long walks.They do fit a little differently and are narrow , but it works for my feet . I would not recommend these shoes to people with wide feet or who plan to use them all day , everyday .
 I have had these shoes for probably 5 years . They are still fully functional . I have owned Vans for that length of time and they have worn out in the first 2 years but Keds are extremely good quality . I have bought different colors but they never fail me . They are comfy for walking . Although , I have found out if you are walking long distances that they might strain your feet By long distance I mean a couple of miles . But overall , I love them and they are definitely worth the price .
 a lot longer than i thought they would be . but a nine would be to small . but they are nice . just wish they were n't so long .
 I absolutely love these Keds , I bought them for recruitment and thought I 'd never wear them again . I normally buy Vans but did n't want to spend that much for shoes I did n't want . I was very wrong ! Love these , wear them all the time and intend on buying more Keds !
 The quality and the outlook is good , but it 's kind of longer at the tip of the shoes and make it loose when I walk .
 I wear a 10 and it is hard to find shoes and sneakers that fit . I ordered a 10W -LRB- wide -RRB- and they fit perfectly . They fit so well that I feel they were made especially for me.The canvas is great and seems very durable . They are very comfortable and easy to walk in , especially compared to my old clunky sneakers . I will buy KEDS from now on.I also bought the same shoe in white leather -LRB- 10W -RRB- and that sneaker runs a little larger . I can slip into the white leather sneakers if I 'm not wearing socks , but I can not do that with the black canvas one.NOTE
 I wore my old black ones out and the navy were a great deal -LRB- under $ 20 -RRB- . Super comfortable , exactly what I expected .
 I had to break into these shoes before they got comfortable , but shipping was fast and it 's a great price for the quality of the shoes . I 've never had Keds before so idk if it 's quality has gotten better or worse , but you get what you paid for .
 Great item , it is excelent for gift or any event you made , i totaly recommend it , i just love it .
 I never know , when buying shoes over the internet , if they size will be right . These shoes are true to size , good quality , and fit perfectly !
 dice que soy muy c&oacute;modas , ellas es de pie ancho y se las compre a la medida , creo que por eso las valora como excelentes .
 these sneakers are perfect to use for an exercise class or at the gym . they are lightweight and very comfortable
 I loved absolutely everything about my pair of Keds - excellent throwback to my elementary school years - however , they were a tish too narrow for my big flippers so they had to be returned unfortunately.The yellow laces definitely gave the graphite color a pop that made the Keds cute and fun . I might hafta order this in a wider size ... : D
 I have no idea what everyone is talking about when they say that these are poor quality . They appear to be the same exact keds that you would buy in any store . I 'm not sure if the other reviewers received a different shoe , or just are n't familiar with ked 's . Also , the sizes are the same as normal ked 's . I regret listening to the reviewers who said that they run small . I ordered a half a size up from what I normally wear , and they 're too loose . I 'll keep them anyway because they 're so inexpensive , but I wish I had n't listened . Probably unrelated , but I ordered these on friday at 8pm and chose one day shipping and they arrived saturday morning at 9:48 . Excellent shipping .
 I 've always wanted to wear Keds , and now I finally can ! I have wide feet , so they have always been to tight width wise . I 'm so glad I was able to find them in wide width . Love the low rise of the shoe , love the look . The only thing I would change is making the inside a bit softer , and maybe more support . But I still love them !
 I love love love these shoes ! I have wide feet , and sometimes it 's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet , but these shoes are so perfect ! I think I will buy a pair in every color now !
 I love Keds tennis shoes . Denim is very hard to find and I 'm thankful Amazon is so easy to shop . No muss , no fuss . Just find the product and someone brings it to your door . I must say , though , that there should never be s & h charges on anything . Bank rates and credit card rates are getting too difficult to live with without having to considering s & h.
 This is the only way to shop !! The shoes were great , they fit , and we had them in a couple of days !! I could not find these red Keds in any stores near us so I went to Amazon and found them in seconds . We had them so quick-I was shocked !!! Thanks Amazon !!
 I received a different color from what I ordered , but I like them . Ca n't go wrong with Keds !
 the keds fit perfectly . Usually I am leary about ordering shoes without trying them on , however these fit well and I am pleased with them
 I love anything denim . these sneakers are great with jeans . They feel a little big but not unwearable . thanks
 I love my new Keds sneakers . I have lots of colors to wear with different outfits to work . Getting ready to order acouple more pairs . I recommend using Amazon highly ! Never have had a problem with them .
 I wouldnt go as far as to say they were a fashion statement but I love these sneakers for daily walks during lunch . I used to get disouraged from walking until I found these and realized that my feet actually dont have to be soar after I walk , I just needed sneakers that fit well for me . I also bring them when I go shopping for extended periods like mall shopping . the looks are deceiving , they are nicely made
 These sneakers are great . Super comfortable and fit really well , esp . considering they were bought online ... Keds are well made I think , and they were delivered to my door in a short time . . a little pricey , but well worth it
 I purchased these for my daughter . We actually had a hard time finding these in any store where we live . Delivery was timely and item was as described .
 Quick delivery brought my much needed white keds to me . I had my old pair for 7 years and they were falling apart . These are my favorites and I love the new keds logo showing on the side of the shoe rather than on the back . Very cool for keds ! What else can I say , for 40 years + , keds classics have been there . I could n't wait as a 7th grader back in the & * $ @ 's for my first pair and ditching those orthopedic white oxfords saddle shoes ! Oh happy day ! Been wearing them ever since . Now they come in a rainbow of colors -LRB- and new styles , too -RRB- but the white keds will always be a classic in my wardrobe !
 These shoes have always been my favorite standby for summer . They have been around for years and I always have a pair or two in my closet .
 I really like the Keds sneakers . . I ordered Navy and they look black . I would order again but in another color .
 The Keds Champion style has been around a long time . I have worn it many times throughout my life . I wanted denim , so I ordered these . The denim is somewhat difficult to find . Not everyone carries it . One drawback I noticed . It has been years since I have worn this style and it is not as supportive as some other Keds styles . However , I am sure I will enjoy it . A comfortable shoe with almost no break-in needed .
 Love these shoes , they 're so comfortable ! I 'm kind of inclined to order one in each color ;-RRB- One thing that should be noted - these have no arch support so if that 's important to you bear that in mind when ordering .
 Love these shoes ! Have been wearing them all my life and still think they are the best ! Great price and super fast shipping ! Could n't , t be happier !
 I wear Ked sneakers always and I was over joyed to find this show at such a low price . It is just as expected , great quality and reliable shoe !
 Keds Shoes are worth the money , i will buy again as long as the price does not go up , excellent
 I love this product and I received it in a very timely manner . I have absolutely no complaints except maybe it 's my fault I got white keds because now they are pretty dirty haha but I knew that would happen . I recommend everyone get a pair of shoes like these ! And from this site . Just wish there was free shipping ...
 Pros : Came BEFORE they said it was going to be deliveredQuality is greatCons : Beware of the size you get ... I got the 8.5 A and I did n't realized A meant narrow and when I say narrow , I mean VERY NARROW ! Thank god my feet are very narrow or they would be too small!Great product overall ! -LRB- :
 I am a fan of Keds and have several pairs of Keds shoes on different colors . They are true size and fit my feet very well . I wear them every morning for exercise and got much compliance . Highly recommend them for active women .
 I love these shoes ! And after you get them broken in -LRB- takes a little while -RRB- , they are adorable and comfy ! But they are definitely not for people with wide feet . They seem to run a little narrower than shoes I normally buy . But they 're fantastic shoes nonetheless !
 Keds is a classic and never goes out of style . It is always hard to find my size , 12W , but I found it here with no problem . Would recomment to everyone !
 I ordered the wrong size shoe and talk about ease and no worry return and order of correct size . I know no matter what I order from AMAZON.COM my transaction will be easy and I will be completely satisfied . I like that since I hate shopping . Amazon.com makes it easy to shop and the prices can not be beat . I will use Amazon.com for everything I need . I also feel safe using a credit card online knowing Amazon.com protects my information .
 These Keds are everything the seller described . Size runs true to form , they are extremely comfortable and look great !
 These white Keds -- the same wonderful shoe I wore all through my childhood summers -- are still a great value . They are lightweight , easy-care and comfortable . Every girl and woman should have a pair in her wardrobe .
 This is exactly what I was looking for . I have looked in all the local department stores around where I live and I have n't been able to find any , or if I do find Keds shoes , they do n't have this style in my size . I will definitely order again when this pair wears out .
 These little sneakers , as I call them , are just like bedroom slippers ! Wonderful purchase price and service.ThanksS . Wells
 these are just like they have always been . comfy , good looking and long lasting .
 i like them a lot , but there not likethe old school keds , with the terryinside . were can i find some orange colored keds ?
 I ordered these in a wide width because the regular ones always seem to make my feet hurt . They are comfortable .
 i have a pair of light pink keds that i 've had for 10 + years . when my 17 year old daughter said keds are cool again , i decided to get a pair of red . buying from amazon i saved a bunch , and they still fit and look the same quality as my originals . i love them !
 I was so happy to receive it on the day it camebecause my other sneakers was worn out becauseit was torn , and I finally put my other sneakers inthe trash because I finally got this new sneakersto wear .
 I ordered these for my mom . She has always wore these even when she was a waitress . Both pairs she wares all the time . Shipping time was excellent !
 I wear these all the time ! I really like that they came with the yellow and white laces . They have become a total staple in my wardrobe . Comfortable , cute , and versatile .
 Wife had liiked for these particular sneakers for months . the 4.5 size was imposible to find in stores . We will increase our purchases on the internet and especially at Amezon in the future
 I love these shoes . Very cute , simple , classic style . The graphite color is very versatile -LRB- comes with white laces if you do n't dig the yellow -RRB- . Some arch support for comfort and good structure to the shoe . I would n't run a marathon in these shoes , but they are perfect on the weekends or vacation , when you be doing a good amount of walking but still want to look cute .
 Keds are good quality and very comortable . These will last a long time . They have good width and arch support .
 I like this shoe . It is simple and gives you a clean look ! somewhat stiff in the beginning . Made out of cotton and does get dirty , but for the price . . I like them alot !
 These are great to throw on for shopping or running errands . No complaints . They have improved the sole since the last time I purchased them .
 After always wearing athletic shoes , I finally returned to my beloved Keds . They are just what I needed to wear with jeans and shorts to avoid the messy , clunky look of my big feet in athletic shoes . I really like the graphic color because it is so neutral that I think will not shoe dirt as much as white ones do .
 These are classic black gym shoes . We needed plain black gym shoes for the school play . These shoes were perfect .
 They are just right for my flat narrow feet , i will be wearing these shoes all summer -- they go with evrything.Elaine
 these are really just what I wanted - classic and clean lines , Unfortunately too small , although I ordered my usual size 9 medium . so I had to return them .
 I received these shoes quickly after my purchase and they fit the description and picture and were exactly what I wanted . They fit well and look great .
 Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado . Muchas gracias . Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.Saludos desde Venezuela
 I 've grown up wearing Keds . Mostly the white canvas Champion Sneaker . It 's always been my go-to shoe . They have become rather expensive in the stores these days . Being retired I do n't have extra disposable cash so I watch for good sales . Amazon always has good sales and good sellers . I got my Keds economically and I have happy feet . Thanks to Keds and Amazon .
 I 've been eyeing the graphite colored Keds for awhile now and I am not disappointed that I finally bought them!I am normally a size 9 to 9.5 in shoes , and because of the loose fit from a previous pair of size 9.5 Keds , I went with a size 9 . So they fit perfectly . I 've worn them walking around the city a few times and have had no pressure points/no blisters/no sore spots . That 's the ultimate test for me -- comfort in walking . Well , they definitely passed the test .
 My wife said she was n't able to find Keds anymore so I looked on Amazon and there they were . Got a pair and they were just like the ones she had thought were discontinued . THe frist pair we got had a smudge on the heel . Amazon made the return easy and new pair arrived in a day . They were perfect ! My wife is happy being able to find the Keds and I am happy with Amazon 's great service .
 I just purchased my old stand-by , traditional Keds from Amazon . Loved the price -LRB- $ 20 cheaper than the Keds site -RRB- and they arrived at my home within 3 days . My feet are happy to be in their old comfortable standards . Thanks
 I love my keds . In fact they are better then my converses . Best decision I 've bought online . The price was a little high but worth it
 I love these shoes ! This color goes great with any outfit , and is great for any season ! They are a must have shoe :-RRB- . Like all keds , I typically order a half size smaller .
 Comfortable!Love it ! Looks great with skinny jeans . DId n't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand . . oh wells . Love it ! looks so clean and cute .
 THE KEDS SHOES WERE GREAT . THE GIRLS LOVE THEM AND THEY ARRIVED WHEN SAID.WOULD ORDER THEM AGAIN AND PROBABLY WILL .
 Love these leather oxfords ! I have worn them continually every day since I got them 3 months ago and they show no wear and tear even gardening , no dirt sticks to the leather although I washed the laces . They have no insoles but are comfy as is , flat shoes as what was described . I cant find them locally so viola here on Amazon ! Keds company is perfect if the shoe is the wrong size or color re
 These little tennis shoes are the most constant think on the market today . They are ALWAY comfortable , they machine wash up great ! I could walked for days in them because they are so light . I LOVE MY KEDS !!
 SALUDOS , LAS KEDS WOMEN 'S CHAMPION BASIC OXFORD SNEAKER , SE LAS TRAJE PARA MI ESPOSA , Y QUEDO MUY COMPLACIDA Y AGRADECIDA , POR QUE LAS ZAPATILLAS RESULTARON SER MUY COMODAS Y A LA VEZ ELEGANTES , POR LO TANTO SE LAS RECOMIENDO , BYE .
 el articulo me encanta . . me parecen demasiado lindos ... y me llegaron en perfecto estado ! muchas gracias por sus servicios !!
 Anyone that wear Keds knows that they are great shoes . Got these for my wife and she likes them . Great looking shoes that offer solid support for you feet .
 I have been wearing KEDs for over 50 years , love them . They were exactly what I odered , no problems
 I ordered my Keds here because they were available in the size AND color I wanted - which never happens elsewhere . It 's hard to find shoes I like that fit my feet because I wear a smallish size and have really deep insteps . But here , I was able to get exactly what I needed - 7 extra wide , red . I 'm rocking them with all my favorite outfits and I will definitely be back when I want more .
 I was hoping to order these in 10 1/2 , but that appeared to not be an option . I have a difficult time with many shoe manufacturers not offering my size . I use extra inner soles & that helps , but I wish my size was available .
 The quality does n't look as good as I hoped - you can see the glue and a space where the base is attached . I bought these looking for something that might hold up a little better than the cheaper canvas shoes I usually buy at Target - hopefully they will last a little longer otherwise they may not be worth the price . On the other hand they fit just right and are very soft and comfy on my feet . I like the color and the lining and stitching look pretty good .
 The size fits perfectly , the color is exactly like the picture , and above all it 's super super cute.Makes me want to purchase another color !
 I 've been wearing Keds champion sneakers for years and years . Would not consider buying anything else ! Thanks to Keds for a great product .
 Sure , Keds are n't made like they were back in the day , but for the price you really ca n't complain . I got these to wear casually since I did n't want to shell out double the amount for similar shoes , and I love them ! There 's no arch support , but that 's nothing some insoles ca n't solve . After a few months of wear -LSB- even to dances and the gym -RSB- , my Keds still look pretty new . However , beware people with wider feet ! These shoes are a but narrow in the toe area .
 Keds have always been good sneakers . These seem to have lived up to that . Since they are white , they did not wash well but I discovered if you dry them in the dryer , the streaks that show up when you air dry them disappear .
 These are great run around shoes and camping . Light weight so you ` renot logged down on short hikes . Don.t show dirt and i , ve washd them in the past . I wear 8.5 N andthese shoes fit pefectly . Nice navy lighter than shown but not toolight . Avazoncame through again for me . Jakjaneus
 I love my new keds , Ive never owned a pair , only heard about them/seen them . I have worn them off and on for the last 4 months and have to say them feel awesome and look great with just about everything !
 Searched local stores , this shoe and no where to be found . Ordered on Amazon , and it is exactly what I wanted . I am extremely pleased .
 I got just the right shoes I have been looking for they fit fine and look nice.Thank You
 The shoe was exactly what I was looking for and the price was better than on Keds own web site .
 These are extremely good sneakers ! I bought a brand new pair of black womens Keds Champion sneakers at a Sal . Army store I frequent quite a bit for only 4 dollars . These are great basic shoes . An older relative saw them and said they wore them during jr. high school in the 1950s as part of their gym uniform . I prefer these classic everyday shoes over something with more padding and more modern . These are very flexable shoes , the laces are better than other brands . These sell for around $ 30 generally . For that price I feel that makes them one of the most affordable shoes on the market . If you like old school Converse , Jack Purcell , Vans then I think you 'll be very happy to own these classic shoes . A lot of the skateboard companies make copies of these and classic Vans . Just go with the originals ! If I could afforf it I 'd own 10 pairs but am thinking about buy 2 more pair right now . The other styles Keds now makes look great as well . If you happen to go to thrift stores check out the womens footwear . I find lots of Keds there and scored another new pair for $ 5 about 2 weeks after finding these.These shoes feel right and work well for all activities . No downsides to these that I can see . 5 stars !!
 I am so happy with my keds . They 're my new go-to shows . I ordered a 7.5 -LRB- I normally wear somewhere between a 7 and 8 -RRB- and while they fit , I think I would order a 7 if I were to purchase another pair . Stock up on no-show socks when you order them and enjoy !
 Just what I expected and arrived in a timely manner . I have narrow feet and the B width fit pretty good , so you may want to keep that in mind if you have wide feet .
 I love these shoes - I wear them every day ! They fit great and shape to your foot . They are pretty basic shoes - no fills . They go great with jeans , especially the navy keds.Super comfortableEasy to cleanVery trendy - great qualityOnly problem - I have been wearing them almost every day for several months and they are starting to show wear around the toes .
 I searched all over for red sneakers , and boy , was RED hard to find ! Did n't find them in any store , so was very pleased to find them online . Amazon had the best price of any online location . Sneakers are very cute and comfy -- as Keds always are . Fit true to size . Very happy with my purchase .
 These Keds are hard to find anymore . They are the only shoe my diabetic mom can wear with comfort . She can go all day with these on and her feet are so sensitive .
 This is a great shoe for lindy hop ! It seems all the girls in East Coast swing use Keds shoes . I was having a problem because I have wide feet . I could not find wide width Keds in the local stores around my town . I was worried about the fit , so I tried my size on at the store of the med width , just to get an idea of the length to make sure I order the right size . I have worn them to several dances and they work and feel great . There is no need to get suede put on the bottom of these , they spin just fine on the dance floor . I am very happy with these shoes !
 I purchased blk/blk and absolutely love it ! I got 8W becasue I have wide feet but when I received it was bit too wide . I 'm going to get regular instead of wide next time I purchase my second pair .
 These Keds are a classic ! Our school has uniforms , so they look great with any solid pants or with shorts . They 're also really comfortable to wear without having an overly athletic feel . Love them ! And , they come in a million different colours , haha .
 I was delighted to find out that Keds still makes the sneakers I bought as a kid . I just wore out the last pair I had -- I purchased extras at least twenty years ago , so have n't had to look for new till now . Well , almost the same sneaker ... These do n't seem to be made to the same last as the old models ; they are n't quite as good a fit , but are still pretty comfortable , and the sole is still flexible and light weight . The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement , I think , if it holds up to wear . The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone . I 'm sorry about that , as it gave them a more streamlined appearance . But unless these new Champions do n't wear well , I will definitely look for more when I wear out these two pairs a decade from now .
 If you 're looking for a lightweight , casual , hang-around-in shoe , this is a perfect choice . It is comfortable and can be spot-cleaned . Machine washing is not recommended .
 First , Keds are usually around $ 45.00 and finding them here for less was amazing !! I was on the hunt for a pair of comfortable shoes to walk around a college campus , since at times I have to get from A to B in a matter of seconds . I wanted a pair of shoes that were not only comfortable but cute and casual as well . I ordered the size that I am , an 8.5 in N -LRB- narrow/slim fit -RRB- they fit perfectly to the dot ! I LOVE them , much better choice than buying an off brand of the canvas shoes and know that they might not last as long pr have the best quality in them . I got them in the navy color , perhaps now i 'll get them in red or white soon ! These are a perfect buy , very comfy , very casual chic ; -RRB-
 I got these for running around cleaning my house and running errands -LRB- my new lace up shoes for anyone follows flylady :P -RRB- . They fit well and are very comfortable . I also really like the red color : -RRB-
 Arrived quickly and just as pictured . Got the grey with yellow laces and they are true to size and exactly what I expected . Very pleased !
 Bought these for my daughter to play Tracy in a high school production of Hairspray set in the 60 's . Great classic style and fit and perfect for a lot of dancing !
 Leads ; still love them after all these years ! Wore them as a kid and they still feel great ! Yay Keds
 I got these for my daughter for her work shoes , she loves them . They hold up nicely , she works for Donatos and they have held up nice .
 I am very pleased with this product . would definitely recommend to any one who asks me about it . Ellen Levitt
 I was looking for this ones at the stores , no luck , and also , this one has a very good price !!
 Total satisfaction , works perfectly , everything ok , this product its ok , and it can be recommended for others users without doubt
 As far as I 'm concerned , this shoe is perfect . I bought the black with white laces . I can wear it every day , it 's cute , it 's comfortable , and it 's inexpensive . It goes great with capris , boot cut jeans , skinny jeans , and slimfit pants . You can wear them with or without socks , but I prefer the liners -LRB- no shows -RRB- with these . I 'll admit that I 'm newer to the Keds brand as an adult and so I ca n't comment on how much more comfortable they used to be `` back in the day . '' I wore this brand as a kid and to me they feel exactly the same as they once did . I 've probably become pickier in my older age and I still find these to have adequate support though they are quite thin . I had been buying Vans brand shoes that look very similar to these for years , but was getting tired of paying $ 50 for them . I do n't know how long these will last , but seeing as they are inexpensive , I wo n't mind if I only get a year or so out of them . One more quick note
 I have worn Keds sneakers for over 50 years . The quality is superb & the comfort is wonderful , whether wearing with socks or not . Highly recommend .
 I have worn Keds for over 50 years and I love them . The last pair I had had something different about the instep that was n't as comfortable as usual but his pair is wonderful ! I like them because they 're not bulky like a lot of the sneakers out there now !
 I grew up in keds , they have always been my favorite . Same great quality as always . Keep up the great work .
 Im 18 and these shoes are the style and there comfortable also . This brand has been around for a long time and there shoes are the best
 I need to change shoe size from 6N to 6M . You have no place to make a change . Other than that I like the on line ordering.George
 Love the sneaker and it fits well and worth the money . It is comfortable and great for the summer when you are out walking for leasure .
 They are the one pair of shoes you ca n't go wrong with . Wear them with shorts or jeans , always looks great !
 I 've purchased the navy blue keds size 9 . I usually have size 9.5 and that 's what I should 've ordered ; they 're a little tight . They work though and I love them ! They 're a cute light shoe that laces up so perfect for running around in the summer . Remember to wear socks with these because they will last longer and you wo n't get blisters on your heel like I did . I plan on ordering more .
 A great sneaker . Good quality , as always . A present for my granddaughter . I 'm sure she 'll be delighted . . Best price I could find .
 OUTSTANDING ! it 's a happy day when my mom can actually find a shoe to fit her comfortably and at such a low price . She loves the color and comfort . Fast , excellent shipping .
 The fit is perfect.I also ordered the exact same pair in black . The Black and Navy are so similar in color , I really only needed to order the black . The color is exactly as pictured.Prompt arrival .
 These shoes are exactly what I wanted ! I needed a comfortable , light weight shoe for vacation and I came across these Keds and I am happy about my purchase . Super fast shipping , and a beautiful product .
 So far , good for my daughter . Comfort on the feet , no issues , just love the Endless Style , like other brand name shoes for women . She 's enjoying them . Happy Holidays .
 The brand `` Keds '' speaks for itself . But I got it at a great price and came in just a few days . Like the fact they come in different widths .
 My wife love these shoes . Thank you very much.They look good , and fit perfect.I would buy these again . Do you have more colors ?
 I have one of every color - like beige best - goes everywhere - little pricey for my pocketbook but they come in my size and width so I guess I will continue to buy them
 I can always get my narrow in width size - and the clean lines are perfect for all my casual needs . Mainly , though the size and width is perfect for me .
 My teenager picked these out . she loves them enough to wear them at least 2x a week and says they are comfortable . I like that they do n't show dirt .
 I love my new red keds !!! They arrived right on time and are perfectly amazing !! Thanks to the great price I even ordered another color !
 Love them , easy purchase , easy return -LRB- ran longer than I expected -RRB- I usually need a 7 or 7.5 but needed a 6.5 in this . Quick turn around on purchase .
 great shoe at a great price , classic shoe that goes well with just about any outfit , fits snug so may want to size up
 they were great while they lasted -LRB-
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 I love theses boots so far . They were quick to break-in and the feel great . The only drawback of these boots is the sizing . They are from Italy so the sizes are different from the us . I would recomend on getting atleast a half size smaller than normal .

 this pair of shoes are very confortable but i recommend to buy 1/2 size more than you fit !
 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .
 Super comfortable . Great support ; the special sole and heel pads cushion each step and ease the shock to the musculoskeletal system . The foot is surrounded by breathable fabric on top of a generous amount of padding . This model is also good looking enough to wear in casual non-work situations . - A world away from the $ 49.95 discount-store work boots !

 These are very comfortable athletic shoes for both walking and running . Well made and very good quality . Fast shipping as well . I 'm very happy with this putchase .
 These shoes are light weight and very comfortable . Great for running and aerobic classes ! Love the pink color too ... get lots of compliments !
 This show is not only cute and wonderful color , but so very comfortable . Almost like wearing slippers . True to size and width .

 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 These are very comfortable athletic shoes for both walking and running . Well made and very good quality . Fast shipping as well . I 'm very happy with this putchase .

 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .
 Super comfortable . Great support ; the special sole and heel pads cushion each step and ease the shock to the musculoskeletal system . The foot is surrounded by breathable fabric on top of a generous amount of padding . This model is also good looking enough to wear in casual non-work situations . - A world away from the $ 49.95 discount-store work boots !
 I have been wearing wolverine durashock boots for over ten years . You can not get a more comfortable and durable boot .
 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 What a beautiful sandal - made very well and beautiful to look it . Comfortable and I love them in black !
 I ordered these for my husband , , he only likes laceless slip on with hopefully a comfy arch and non slip and this shoe has it ALL . I gave it all stars cause we had looked everywhere for a shoe so similar , although he would have liked a deep brown color or black but he has had no complaints . . and he is a very very picky when it comes to shoes ... he could n't get over this price . . he usually will spend around 180 or more . So this was a ` just try it ' kind of thing and now he only wants this shoe .
 Looks so good that I cringe whenever it gets dirty , Which as a work shoe it often does.Love the fact I can pull it off quickly when I come in the house so I do n't track dirtKeep in mind it is sized to wear with thick socks .
 Very comfortable ; could be worn without sox . I 've been wearing mine daily for 2 months in a fatty acid refinery -LRB- greases and oil , high temperatures , etc -RRB- and they holding up well . difficult to keep clean because they 're sort of suede , but as of now , I 'd buy 'em again . And they ARE brown , a fawn color actually .
 These shoes are very confortable and sturdy . They had a broken in feeling instantly and are easy to slip on and off . The price was right for a very practicle work shoe .

 Nice shoes , but lack up support might not make them last after while , but nice design and concept . I get alot of compliments.BUT I would not order form footlocker again . They shipped these in a bag !? A shoe box in a bag ?! By the time they got to me the box was totally crushed and not in any good condtion . BAD BAD SHIPPING I called footlocker and they could have cared less .

 Good shoes , well constructed but very light . They 're quite comfortable but I would n't want to walk long distances in them . They run a bit long so I 'd get a size down .
 Actually got the shoe in a 9 in the end . I guess Kenneth Cole run big . Great looking shoe and roomy and comfy . Not a ton of padding and support . Very slipper like . Will be putting some sort of insole in them , but I usually do that anyway . Wo n't be wearing them for long walks . Very happy though .

 This is a really great sneaker - my son loves them ! He has been wearing these for well over 3 months and no problems . These are the only pair he ever wants to wear .
 My three year old grandson has almost every item made from the movie CARS.When I saw these sneakers , I just had to get them for him . He lives in Rhode Island , and I live in Delaware . It was so cold that his southern mommy would not leave the house to go to the mailstation to pick up the package . Finally , his dad picked them up on the way home from class . He called and said , `` Ganny !!! thank you for Lightening McQueen shoes . I love them '' I know all the characters since he has most of the toys . He wanted to wear them with his CARS pajamas to bed . They appeared to be of good quality for a rough and tumble three year old . Thank you for helping make Jack 's Valentine ` sDay even more special .
 A big hit with my son . Velco is great for those that do n't know how to tie yet , and the style and fit are perfect !
 Shoe looks and feel great . The price was great for a pair of crocodile shoes .

 I 'm the kind of person who walks half a mile rather than bother with the car , so I need shoes that can stand up to that . Lots of women 's shoes are flimsy , or uncomfortable to walk more than parking-lot-to-store . These shoes are well-constructed and feel like they will keep me walking for a long time.My feet are a little wide , but these shoes fit well from day one and did not require `` break-in '' or stretching .
 I just got these in the mail and they are very comfortable . I really like the way they are darker than they appear in the picture . The only reason they are not a 5 star is they are a little stiff . I assume that is so they will break in without loosing their structure and support . I ordered the same size as my other Merrell 's and they fit perfectly .
 Love these shoes . No break in period very stable . Straight from the box to the trail . They are a true size fit for my foot and I require a wide toe box . I hike in them and do long distance horse riding in them . I would purchase another pair of these shoes .
 A very comfortable shoe but too short in the toe ... -LRB- I am a perfect size 8 -RRB- ... Had to give them to my daughter . Also I would like the shoes identified as to whether or not they are lace ups or toggle fasteners as I prefer the toggle closure .
 I do n't believe they carry this color any more as was hard to find when I ordered it , got 1 of the last ones . This is an awesome shoe & I use for hiking as well as every day use , & vacations where I do a lot of walking . My husband has a similar shoe by the same maker & is the one who recommended it to me & I 'm happy he did . I am usually an 8 , & these do run small so needed a 8 1/2 . Price on Amazon was comparable to the store , but I hate shopping so like the convenience of having it delivered to my door .
 I bought so many other hiking boots ; however , the toe boxes were too small and those that seem to fit rubbed on the joint where my big toe to my foot so bad I could n't stand them . This shoe solved all of my problems . I hope this shoes styles is a classic !!
 My husband recently bought his first Merrell shoes and raved about them . Since I am the walker in the family I decided to give them a try . I ordered Women 's Merrell Moab Ventilator . The fit and shoe are perfect and amazingly fast delivery speed . Very happy I will be buying more that 's for sure !
 Merrell shoes are worth the price . They last and last , and have great support for aching feet . I 'm please to find my size at a good price .
 I bought these hikers for a trip to Maui . I hiked all over Haleakala National Park and never got any blisters or cramped feet . They are sturdy enough for hiking but light weight enough to keep your feet cool . The tread on the bottom was just enough to keep from slipping . I 've had Merrell 's before and always had good luck with them . Would definitely buy again !
 this was my 4th merrell purchase and as previously experienced , they are the best . this shoe is a little bulkier -LRB- less feminine -RRB- than my others but also has more cushioning . great stability as always . will make an excellent walking/hiking shoe as the sole tread is aggressive . this will be my go-to shoe for the next few months as i rehab from an auto accident and the extra comfort and stability will be a great asset . i highly recommend this shoe and this brand . sizing has been consistent in all four styles . delivery was quick and as always , thanks amazon for the great value !
 Great shoes for outdoor hiking , walking . Light but with good support . Based on the previous reviews I got half a number larger than my actual size and fits perfect .
 Love these shoes . Hiked the Grand Canyon in them and they were very comfortable and have great traction . People who were hiking with me wearing gym shoes had several issues with sliding , but not once did I slide on the gravel on the trails . After the hike , everyone wanted a pair .
 An exceptionally comfortable shoe , you forget you have it on , its versatility and ventilation are fabulous ! Living and trail hiking in the Phoenix area is challenging , especially in the heat of summer , but these shoes are marvelous . Just bought a replacement pair , because they wear so well and are absolutely perfect for day hikes in moderate terrain . Why mess with perfection ? The shoes have great traction , shock absorption , comfort and are so light , you can run or walk the trails ... and they look great !
 I had never heard of this particular brand of shoe until I found them on Amazon . I was in the market for a new pair of tennies and decided I 'd give these a try -LRB- because of all the positive reviews I 'd seen -RRB- . I love these shoes ! They are an awesome fit for me . I never had to break them in as they were a perfect fit from the beginning . They have great traction in wet conditions , are extremely flexible , and wash well . I definitely recommend these shoes to those of you looking for a good hiking shoe especially , or just a good pair of all-purpose shoes.Update 12/3/11
 I ordered one whole size bigger than I normally wear because I would be wearing a slightly thicker sock . However , when I tried them on they were too small . I have to return mine and go even bigger . I could still tell the design was very good quality and so comfortable even though it was too short . So , I would say they run small so order a larger size.I would recommend this product to someone else . My only disappointment was that I had to return them , therefore having to wait even longer to wear them .
 I am very please with my purchase . Just the look , and shape of these shoes makes you want to have them.I am a UK6 , and always get confused when buying from the US depending on brand . But after having a look at the size conversion table , I went with the US 8.5 , which is UK6 and they fit perfectly and are comfortable ; -RRB-
 Very comfortable , lightweight hiking shoes that offer good support . The breathable material helps keep your feet a good temperature , as in not too hot . They also look nice , not a first priority , but a bonus !
 Very comfortable good arch support , ESP when on your feet on hard concrete all day and work long hours daily .
 This is my second pair . I use these for work and stand on my feet for more than ten hours a day . Great boots that give comfort and support .
 I absolutely love these shoes ! I live not very far from the place these are named after ; Moab , UT , and I can tell these shoes were inspired by this part of the country . They keep my feet cool in the heat of the day , and the soles grip very well - they do great climbing slickrock and hopping around while canyoneering . The only downside is that they 're no better than any other shoe with ventilation at keeping the sand out , so if you 're going to be hiking in the desert , you 've got to decide which is more important - keeping your feet ventilated or keeping sand out . There really is no way to have both.As for sizing , I ordered my regular size and they are a perfect fit , but it seems most people are having to order a half-size up . Perhaps they wear thicker socks than I do when I hike!These shoes fit perfectly right out of the box , as others have said.Overall , I am so happy I decided to go with these when I needed to replace my old hiking shoes . I think they 'd be great for hiking anywhere that 's not cold , but if you live in or are planning to visit the Southwest , these are absolutely the shoes you 're looking for !
 I was shopping for hiking shoes and found these . They are really cute on , and I find that I grab them often to wear just for everyday , because they are so comfortable and cute ! I would highly recommend them !
 Love these . Perfect for the trip I 'm planning to Israel!I know there will be alot of walkingn and these are great .
 These are the shoes I use for my everyday needs . I walk around in them , I work out in them - I wear them almost everyday . These shoes are so comfortable , that if you wear them enough , you wo n't want to go back to flimsy popular things . They roll your foot along the outside , taking a lot of pressure off of the ball and allowing women to walk in a more comfortable , natural way . I rarely have very sore feet , even if I have a very busy day.I bought a pair of these for my mom -LRB- she has a bazillion feet problems -RRB- and these shoes have actually helped her with a lot of those . She can stand up longer , she never trips while she 's walking , and her feet are much less sore at the end of the day.I have worn this brand/model of shoe for about 5 years now . I buy a new pair every year . I will warn that if you wear them enough , and especially if you get every once in a while lazy and just jam your feet in without untying the laces , then there is a little plastic ankle support piece behind the heel that gets bent inward and sticks into the back of your ankle . It 's really sharp , and it chafes . I am a lazy when it comes to putting shoes on , so I do the cram the foot in thing a lot . Therefore I buy new shoes every year . However , the actual shoe , besides the little plastic back , is never worn out by the time I need a new pair . So if you are careful , even with extensive wear , these shoes should last you a long time . -LRB- PS
 I always wear Merrells to work . These have great support AND cushion . I 've learned to buy a half size larger for a better fit .
 I bought these based on the other reviews on Amazon , and while I 'm not as blown away as some purchasers , I 'm pretty satisfied with these shoes as a whole . They are n't as comfortable as I would have liked , but I think that is more a case of my foot neuromas than with the shoe itself . They are well constructed , give my feet pretty good support , and best of all have a lot of toe room . When I get my new orthotics I think the comfort level will improve . I would really recommend these shoes to all .
 I was recently in the market for a good hiking shoe to last me through a geology field camp that was 3 weeks out in Death Valley . We were out literally all day almost every day scrambling around some extremely `` pokey '' rocks . -LRB- The rocks were sharp and pokey enough that all of us tore multiple items of clothing , I tore all 3 pairs of my pants beyond repair . -RRB- But these shoes held up!I have to spend my money very wisely and was looking for a shoe that was worth the money . I wanted a shoe that would be durable but be light and comfortable to wear . I needed a sole that was going to give me grip on slick rocks but be able to withstand those sharp pokey ones too . Finally I wanted something that did n't look like a military combat boot or something I borrowed from a construction worker!This shoe managed to live up to every one of my needs . I had a friend who bought some shoes for a similar price and hers fell apart the FIRST DAY . Most other peoples shoes started biting the dust soon after , there was probably a shoe glue shortage in town after our group came by . Towards the end of the trip I could n't help but brag about my shoes as I seemed to be one of the few people that still had shoes that were in excellent condition.And you can bet I plan on bringing them for my next 3 week field camp .
 Currently this pair of Merrell shoes I have been wearing 5 days a week for work -LRB- I am an RN -RRB- for the last 4 months . Love 'em ! Lightweight , great for secure trek from parking lot -LRB- snow , freezing rain all the Midwest weather elements -RRB- , supportive , cushions my feet well enough that them doggies ai n't barking by the end of my working day.I have been a dedicated Merrell wearer for last 5 years and have not been disappointed in any of their products . They do n't let my feet overpronate as many other brands did that cost more . Very sturdy . Love the idea that I buy them , immediately put them on and they mold to my feet . No period of `` break in '' , just put them on and go.If you have wide feet you need to check the toe box of the pair you choose to make sure they give you ample room . If you have extremely narrow feet you may have to wear padded socks depending on the style you purchase.I also haveWomen 's Merrell Chameleon Arc MJand Women 's Merrell Chameleon Arc Stretch Both are great shoes.Happy Trails !
 This is my 3rd pair of Merrell Hiking shoes and they are wonderful ! This shoe feels great the first time you put them on . Hiked all over Glacier National Park 2 days after getting shoes . No blisters whatsoever . Very light weight . Highly recommend this product .
 These shoes are great ; very comfortable . I already have 4 other styles and could not resist these .
 So confortable and light . No break in period at all . Wear them all the time and color is good with everything .
 I love this shoe . I wear the Merrell Siren shoes most of the time , and I wear a 9.5 in those , so I was surprised that I need a 10 in the Moab Ventilator . It seems to run a little small , so I reordered them in 10 . Very comfortable , I am prone to plantar Faciaitis and Merrell shoes have more support than the average running shoe and keep my feet in a neutral position . I will never be without my Merrell 's , I hope !!
 These hiking shoes are great . They are lightweight , good support , good traction and very comfortable !
 These are my first pair of Merrills and from what I have experienced so far they wo n't be my last . I was looking for a shoe suitable for long distance walking -LRB- 5 + miles -RRB- , day hiking in the mountains and an upcoming trip to Europe . After reading several reviews , I bit the bullet and ordered the Moab Ventilator . They arrived a few days later and I put them on ... so cushiony and I could tell right away there will be no break-in period for these shoes . I have already worn them on a couple of 2 miler walks and so far they are lightweight and comfortable but definitely sturdy . LOVE the beluga/lilac combination - they will go with most of my walking/hiking gear . Even my husband noticed my shoes and complimented them . Ca n't wait to take these babies on the trail !
 I love these shoes . The platform is molded to your foot and offers a solid foundation for hiking . They do n't let my foot slide around .
 Very happy with shoe . Provided good support and traction . First pair survived over 1000km of training and the Camino de Santiago . Purchased new pair to go on next expedition .
 I wear this shoe nearly every day to walk in the desert , and it gives me good footing and good support . I did get a half size larger , as people recommend , and it fits fine . The taupe color is great , as it does n't show dust , which is plentiful in the desert . The mesh upper is also good , as it allows ventilation . I like vibram soles for their sure footing on rock , and an added benefit is that thorns ca n't penetrate , unless they are really big , wicked thorns . With my old walking shoes , I had to get the needle-nosed pliers and pull out the thorns in the sole after every walk .
 they are the first pair i ever had . i really like them . i am on my feet all day at work walking around and standing in one spot for a while also . they aer great .
 The shoes are great and arrived quickly . They fit perfectly . My feet are wide and this is a nice comfortable shoe with lots of room .
 I had been searching for a low hiker to replace my columbia 's which are sadly wearing out . I wanted a comfortable hiker that looked good too . This shoe is perfect . So comfortable and to walk in . My foot roles very naturally in this shoe and it takes strain off of the balls of my feet and my arch . The ventilation feels wonderful too ; my feet do n't get too hot.I did take the advice of other reviewers and went with a 1/2 size larger than my normal size . I am a solid size 7 in womens shoes . I went with the 7 1/2 and am very glad I did . Its not so much the width as much as the length . I think if I 'd have gone with a 7 my toes would have touched the ends , making the shoe uncomfortable to wear .
 These are the best shoes I have ever purchased !!! They are great for my job as a Support Technician and Quality Auditor at my job . I would encourage everyone to buy them !
 This is a great multi purpose athletic shoe . My husband worn his first pair of Merrel Moab to threads wearing them to work every day . Now I just bought him a second pair . I wear mine to walk my dog in the park every single day . Both of us replaced original sole pads with Superfeet Insoles . This is a perfect shoe for wide feet , very comfortable and roomy . No time needed to break them in . I would highly recommend them , but I would suggest to replace original sole pads with Superfeet insole pads .
 I was n't able to find the size that I wanted in any store around where I live -LRB- size 10 1/2 is a kinda hard size to find -RRB- I had tried the shoes on in both 10 's and 11 's so I knew what they felt like . I was happy to get everything I wanted and they came with no trouble . Thank you Amazon .
 Great buy . I would recommend these to any buyer . I wore them on a 40 mile backpacking trip and they were the best shoe for the trip .
 My husband and I both bought Merrell hiking boots 10 years ago before a trip to Europe . They 've been all over Europe , climbed a few mountains , done a lot of hiking and walking , and are still structurally sound . We both agree they are the best shoes we 've ever worn . They are comfortable and stable . The only reason I am buying a new pair is because the material at the toes is finally starting to wear ... but it took 10 years to get that way !
 I love , love , love these shoes and now have two pair in different colors -LRB- I love them that much -RRB- ! No break-in period is needed . I have foot problems and wore this pair right out-of-the-box on an eight mile hike with no pain at all . The sole provides excellent traction allowing me to feel very sure-footed on both dry and wet surfaces . They 're going with me to China to ensure I 'll be comfortable throughout my vacation . Buy them 1/2 size larger than your usual size .
 These are the first shoes since my foot injury in which I do n't experience ball of the foot pain . I 'm pleased with the fit , too . Often , shoes that fit my toes are a bit wide in the heel and tend to slip . Not so , with these shoes . They hug the heel nicely , while still allowing plenty of room in the toe box .
 I bought these shoes for a trip to New Zealand . I had them on just about every day for almost 3 weeks , including on the planes . They are super comfortable and they are great hiking shoes . I used them for mountain biking , hiking and just walking wherever I went . My feet were warm and dry even though I walked through water on many occasions . They are totally worth the money .
 My husband purchased these shoes for me for Christmas to replace a pair of Columbia hiking sneakers that I had worn for years . We hike our mountain often so I needed a pair of sneaker type shoes with good support . They fit true to size , felt supportive without being too restrictive , and were lighter on my feet than they appeared . I also use them for walking around town and running errands . I 've also gotten compliments on them from friends who also are active hikers . I would recommend these shoes to anyone who is a casual weekend hiker or for general walks for fitness .
 I have a hard to fit foot and have tried several brands of low cut hiking shoes/sneaker . I returned 2 pairs of Keenlow cut hikers because nothing fit right . I finally tried the Merrell 's women 's low cut Moab Ventilator -LRB- in Smoke/blue -RRB- . The shoes ran true to size with a nice wide and deep toe box while still comfortable in the heel . My orthotics fit in the shoe without any loss of comfort . These shoes are supportive , comfortable and good looking.They grip well whether walking in the city or on trails . I could n't ask for more and I highly recommend them !!
 These shoes were bought and used for a hiking trip to the Grand Canyon and Sedona . They came through with flying colors . This semi-couch potato hiked several miles a day and came home without a single blister . In fact , I liked them so much that I wore them the entire vacation including out to dinner eventhough they had some mud caked on them -LRB- my traveling companions were n't thrilled about this , however -RRB- .
 This is my second pair of Merrells . They are a true size so that I 'm not afraid to order from Amazon . I have troubled feet and these make my feet feel sooooooooo good !
 These shoes were absolutely perfect for what i bought them for , which was backpacking around Africa . I was really happy that they were wide , as i usually struggle finding shoes wide enough for me ! So if you have a wide foot , i recommended them!They do look like bulky shoes , but they are not heavy!all round good shoes for travelling !
 I have wide short feet and have had problems with shoes in the past , Merrell Hiking shoes give me the support that I need .
 I purchased these for walking or running but found myself wearing them all the time . I walk a lot and the rubber on the bottoms has n't worn down !
 These are the most comfortable shoes I 've ever worn ! I had to go up a size -LRB- usually wear an 8 or 8.5 , but had to order a 9 -RRB- and then they fit perfectly . They are lightweight , yet keep my feet very warm . They are rugged enough to wear hiking/climbing , but not bulky so I can wear them for everyday shoes as well .
 I purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves them . Merrell quality ca n't be beat and she says they are some of the most comfortable shoes she has ever worn . Too bad they do n't come in black as well .
 I love hiking in these shoes ! They are so comfortable and sure footed . Also , these are ventilated , so while they are not waterproof like my other Merrells , they are great for hiking in a dry environment . I only wear tennis shoes now when I am running.They might run a little small , like most Merrells . But , I ordered a 6.5 and they seem to fit me fine -LRB- that is the size I normally wear in a shoe -RRB- .
 What much more can I say about a hiking shoe . I always get one size bigger than my normal size so the toes do not touch no matter where I walk . I purchased this shoe because the appearance
 The hiking shoes are extremely comfortable and nice looking . Wore them on a bike ride as well as a hike and they were just what I needed . I am very pleased with them .
 I frequently buy Merrell day hikers because they fit well for my wide foot and are comfortable for hiking or work .
 The shoe ended up being too small for me so had to return , otherwise I 'm sure it was a fine shoe .
 I love these shoes . They were super comfortable from the first wear , and I did n't have any `` breaking in '' period . No blisters or red marks on my feet . I love wearing them and feel like they even work on casual Friday . I ordered a 1/2 size up but I 'm not sure it was necessary . The only downside is I ordered them -LRB- late -RRB- for a vacation trip and they arrived the day after I left home . But that was really my fault.I am really enjoying them as an everyday sneaker .
 I do n't write many reviews but this time I just have to . First of all , the seller SHOE PARLOR is very friendly , honest and ships fast . Also , he responded very quickly to my emails since I had a few questions about these shoes . I will definitely purchase from them again.I just had surgery on both feet -LRB- I will forgo the details -RRB- and I 'll have to wear only comfortable , orthotic-friendly shoes for quite a while . So I had to find a light , wide and sturdy shoe.I was lucky to find these and I owe it to all the Amazon reviews.Indeed , as soon as I got them I put my orthotics in , and hopped on . WOW ! I like to wear my walking shoes without socks , so I dared to do it now too . I walked for three miles to test-drive them , -LRB- with another rescue old pair in my bag -RRB- and to my amazement , I walked without chaffing or without getting any blisters . This never happened to me before with any shoes.Very important also
 Width-wise , this shoe is so comfortable ; however , length-wise the size 10 -LRB- female -RRB- runs a bit short . I 'm a true 10 and my big toe grazed against the toe of the shoe - a great concern for extensive walking and wear . Otherwise , show appears extremely well-made .
 I purchased these hiking shoes for our vacation to Banff & Jasper National Parks . They were perfect for our family excursions into the `` wild '' . The hikes we took were not on very rough trails , so I ca n't vouch for their quality on long , strenuous hikes . They were , however , very comfortable and surprisingly light . The tread is strong enough to climb and hike over rocky terrain . Now that we have been back from our vacation for a few weeks , I choose to wear them around town because I like the way they look and because they are comfortable . For those who may be concerned about how they fit with custom orthotics , I can tell you that they are roomy enough for my orthotic inserts . The insole that comes with the shoe is removable , which makes using inserts even easier . Even without my inserts , they are comfortable and offer decent arch support . I find I can wear them for a long time without the need for my inserts . I ordered the shoe a half size larger than my normal size , which works well for me .
 I really like these shoes alot . It took me a couple weeks to get used to them though because they are comfortably structured . Now that I 'm used to them , it feels like I 'm walking on pillows . They have given me enough additional comfort that my knees do n't ache the next day after I 've been on my feet on concrete floors 8 hours the prior day . I will definitely get another pair . I love the look too ! Would have given them a 5 except for the break-in period .
 A great shoe -- so worth the money ! The area around the ankle is padded , the shoe fits without being snug or loose , and has great cushioning with each step . The fabric is soft but durable , and the tread has reliable traction and grip . The beige color matches everything since it has varying shades , and it laces up beautifully ... it 's worth repeating
 I work a 14 hr shift in a hospital and I am on my feet for most of that time . These shoes are great and they were great from the get-go . I hear people talk about `` breaking shoes in '' . I had no problem with that . My feet are fine all day . My legs and back are great at the end of the day !
 These are my `` go to '' shoes . I have worn them all over the world , as well as around home . They are great for uneven surfaces , excellent support . My knees do n't ache like they used to .
 I love my Merrell 's . They are the best walking shoes I have ever had . I have had surgery on both of my feet , yet in these shoes , I can walk 4 to 5 miles and my feet still feel great . I plan on buying another pair soon just to have an extra pair !
 These are the second or third pair of these shoes I 've purchased and they are perfect for light hiking and everyday wear . At one local store I was told that they get more repeat buyers for this shoe than any other . I 'll likely buy another pair when these wear out . Wo n't be for awhile though - they wear well and last a long time .
 If you 've never tried a pair of Merrell athletic shoes , this style will get you hooked . I 'm on my second pair of this particular style and the old ones are still going strong . I 've also had many of the other styles and they 're all awesome . They are a good value for the money .
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 I 've always stayed away from flip-flops because I hated the plastic piece between my toes . In this pair , the toe separator is cloth , not plastic , which improves the entire experience . Additionally , the shoes themselves feel much more supportive than other flip-flops , and are comfortable for walking.The discreet tray in the heel is genius ! It was the reason I originally purchased them . I 'm planning a trip , and I 'd like to be able to go purse-less and pocket-less . I 'm so glad I took a chance on these shoes.Though they are more expensive than most flip-flops , they are worth every penny !
 I initially bought these for the novelty and was surprised at how amazing they are . These are the most comfortable shoes EVER ! Very cushy , and the part of the thong that goes between your toes is fabric , so no painful blisters . I wear these all the time and am considering throwing away all of my other flip flops . I do n't ever use the compartment in the heel , but it 's good to know it 's there . I will definitely be buying another pair .
 I have never owned a pair of flips flops until my boyfriend convinced me to buy these Reefs before we moved to Hawaii . They are well built and very comfortable . It did n't take long for me to get used to the cloth between my toes.The coolest thing about this pair of flip flops is the hidden compartments . And some other readers mentioned the tray sliding out , I do n't know how this could happen , because the velcro strap that fastens the tray securely in place , is under your heel . It 's never slid out on me . In fact , I have a hard time getting the tray out . I have no worries about carrying a credit card or keys in them when I want to go purse-less . Great idea in well made product .
 The sandals are great . They 're a little heavier than I thought they would be , but love them none the less .
 My friend recommended this to me . I love them ! I wear them almost everyday ! I stand and work on concret most of the day . They are wonderful !! I will buy more !
 I had never been able to wear flip flops before ; the thing between the toes bothered me . This pair was COMFY from the get go . They feel very sturdy and supportive -LRB- I have wide , flat feet -RRB- , so much so that I have hiked in them and found them equal to sneakers . They 're open so not protective like sneakers , but that can be a good thing if you have a painful toe joint and do n't want to constrain the toes . The base is wide enough that my pinky toe does n't slip off -LRB- something that happens for me with other flip flops -RRB- , and I have worn them a TON for maybe 2 yrs . The velcro finally broke just now and I love 'em so much I 'm going to buy another pair .
 After wearing these flip flops.you will never , ever , ever wear anything else on your feet.besides asic running sneakers.I have a bunch of flip flops.through them all away after buying and wearing these . . I purchased 2 more pairs in different colors ... I disagree totally with the reviewer.saying they are to heavy.NOT !!!!!!!!!!! They have great arch support.stay on your feet . . even if you are doing a lot of walking or fast walking.TOTAL COMFORT ... worth every penny.and they last forever ...
 in the new tradition of awesome reef sandals , this is a great buy ! fun , comfortable , and cool . the only thing i would warn others about is that the stash has a tendency to slip out at first . other than that , this is a great sandal , and i would buy it again .
 These sandals were * perfect * for a vacation I recently took ... When everyone wants to be swimming -LRB- and no one is on the beach to watch money , keys , etc -RRB- , these give a little peace of mind . Who is going to bother a pair of sandals ?! And importantly , they 're comfortable too !
 These are very comfortable athletic shoes for both walking and running . Well made and very good quality . Fast shipping as well . I 'm very happy with this putchase .
 These shoes are light weight and very comfortable . Great for running and aerobic classes ! Love the pink color too ... get lots of compliments !
 This show is not only cute and wonderful color , but so very comfortable . Almost like wearing slippers . True to size and width .
 They arrived quickly and as expected . I ended up returning them due to purchasing two pairs by accident . No hassles and great customer service .
 The pink is gorgeous . The fit is roomy -LRB- Ihave a c foot -RRB- . Cushy , yet supportive-perfect blend . Oh , true to size and 50 bucks !

 I purchased a pair of Jos. A Bank 's suede slip-ons for my boyfriend for his birthday . As a very picky consumer , I sought slippers that could function as house shoes that would provide the ultimate in comfort for my hard workin ' man . Turns out that I enjoy the sheep-skin smoothness of the lining , too ! Now I have to remind my honey to take his slip-ons off before he leaves the house -- he wants to wear them everywhere .
 Great style . feel good and fit well . Quality leather , good stiching , quality heal and sole with smooth finish . Will buy again in future .
 I felt in love with this shoe during my High School Track and Field years -LRB- 2000 -RRB- !!!! Now , I buy them every other year . My hubby even like them and now I order one for him also . They 're so light and easy on my feet . If you are a runner , especially a sprinter you will not regret buying this shoe .
 These boots are a very high quality product . Complete leather uppers and leather soles and a very good fitting shoe.My buying experience through Amazon was excellant . Very good service and prompt shipping .
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 first of all , i am a big soccer fan and i have been playing the sport for more than 12 years , i play at least 3 times a week so i have tried aloooooooooooot of shoes , dont bother by the nike crab -LRB- except for the talaria model for its light weight 7 lb ! -RRB- ... this addidas shoe is really great , gives you great grib on the ball thanks to the leather exterior and curivng of the side . when you try it you might find it heavy so give it time -LRB- two games max -RRB- and you will see . great heel support and for the fashon lovers its nice looking .

 I 'm the kind of person who walks half a mile rather than bother with the car , so I need shoes that can stand up to that . Lots of women 's shoes are flimsy , or uncomfortable to walk more than parking-lot-to-store . These shoes are well-constructed and feel like they will keep me walking for a long time.My feet are a little wide , but these shoes fit well from day one and did not require `` break-in '' or stretching .

 Some shoe bags are extremely expensive and too small to fit a pair of running shoes . These are inexpensive , washable and expendable . I use one of the bags for international plugs and cell phone and laptop batteries , so they can be used for other things and not just shoes .
 I brought them for Christmas gifts for all of my staff . They all loved them . Thanks for getting them to me before Christmas .
 I am so glad I bought many of these shoe bags in both black and natural because I need alot when shoe boxes get banged up in the closet after time and it 's a nice drawstring bag for packing into luggage . Bag is also useful for many other small items such as toiletries/hair dryer/curling iron etc. . Nothing fancy just practical & I should have bought oodles of these sooner as it 's a must have all purpose storage/traveling/camping item . I was thinking of decorating a few bags to for crafting items as you can paint the canvas for gifts in these too . Possibilities are nearly endless . 5 stars

 I have numerous foot problems but these shoes feel and look GREAT ! My feet do n't hurt at all with these on . Wonderful support for people with arch and heel problems . Would recommend to anyone .
 The Reebok Amaze mid is a comfortable shoe that also provides great ankle support and a cool look . These shoes can match any outfit you have and make people look twice . Highly reccomended
 Wow , my first review . Naturally , I would review the T-Macs first , but I just love the Reebok Amaze classics . I got the baby blue and white . If you cool ghetto and urban , defintely it 's a pick up . Comfortable , stylish , good ankle support , and lasts for a long time . I just keep buying more of it .

 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part . Otherwise these are broke in the first day for me .
 It 's soft , and it lasts . I bought my over 2 yrs ago . My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that . Great value .
 very nice looking boot but they run narrow . the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me .
 This is my third pair of these . They last and last . Very comfortable . I am on my feet all day and these are great .
 THIS IS THE EXAT PARTNUMBER BOOT I HAVE WORN FOR SEVERAL YEARS . I WORKED A CAR WASH AND IT KEPT MY FEET DRY AND SAFE FROM ELECTRICAL SHOCKS . WORK ON HARD SURFACES AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE .
 I 've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them . They are very comfortable and they last a long time . I personally like the Durashock boots but I 've owned both types and they are all great . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Boot provides excellent foot support . Light weight and flexible . No break in time required . Boots wear great right out of the box !
 Durashocks are fairly comfortable . There 's little apparent shock when walking on pavement , and for me a needed metal support shank . Despite the contrasting eyelets and hooks , they pass in a business casual environment . One other unexpected benefit is that these are much quieter when walking on carpet or pavement than lug-soled boots . They do tend to squeak on tile , though.The main drawback is that these boots tend to run narrow . I tend to get toe bang with most shoes and boots and have D width feet . When I bought a second pair , I bought them wide . The toe box is still narrow , albeit slightly wider than the D pair , but the rest of the fit is actually narrower . Unfortunately the wider size did n't solve the toe bang problem.Other drawbacks are that the provided laces are dual-color -LRB- fine for a true work boot environment , unlike my office -RRB- and too short . Also , the upper two sets of hooks are too narrow and laces tend to slip out of them while tying the boots .
 On my third pair in last many years . Must be satisfied with this model . You will be pleased with these for yard work , hiking or general industrial work .
 Super comfortable . Great support ; the special sole and heel pads cushion each step and ease the shock to the musculoskeletal system . The foot is surrounded by breathable fabric on top of a generous amount of padding . This model is also good looking enough to wear in casual non-work situations . - A world away from the $ 49.95 discount-store work boots !

 I have been wearing wolverine durashock boots for over ten years . You can not get a more comfortable and durable boot .
 I have used this brand in this past and have always had great things to say . with this pair of boots nothing has changed . i am on my feet on concrete and steel grates for 13 hours a day and these boots do their job and have done their job thus far . of course your feet will become sore after such a lengthy day 6 or 7 days a week but these are very nice . there are other great boots out there and i have spent 200-300 dollars to acquire them but these do the trick for a hell of a lot less money !
 This is the second pair , I have owned , and these are very good boots . You do n't have to break them in . The fit is superior .
 this boot is a very good work boot , easy on your feet.i have wore this type of boot for many years , amazon had the best price . .
 This is my 4th pair , of this style . On the steel toe version , the leather rubs off the toe real fast . But the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of weeks for my big toes to get comfortable , because the front sole is as hard as the heel part .

 I felt in love with this shoe during my High School Track and Field years -LRB- 2000 -RRB- !!!! Now , I buy them every other year . My hubby even like them and now I order one for him also . They 're so light and easy on my feet . If you are a runner , especially a sprinter you will not regret buying this shoe .
 I have been buying these totes for over 7 years . They are GREAT . Well made and sturdy ! I have `` embellished '' them and sold them . I have given many as gifts as well . No one has ever complained . They have also worked well as grocery totes . I have tried many other totes , but these have held up the best .
 when i saw this gab i loved the genz one . . i ordered it and was afraind that it wo n't be that good . . i wanted a bag to put my college books , , coz they are really heavy plus other things i like to carry along with thr books . . and this bag solved my painfull problem . . my shoulder does n't ache me and my staffs are safe now . . but when i recieved it . . i made an enner from cotton to make sure it 's safer . . at the end i advise you people to buy this one , , and i 've already ordered the red one ^ - ^

 I have to say , I bought these leather espadrille thongs from Newport News and wore them while in Maui . They were the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn . I want the tan ones now , but they only have a size 5 . So I will continue to look for them . In the meantime , I just bought another pair from Amazon -LRB- Newport is sold out -RRB- because I want to have a backup pair should I wear the ones I have out . VERY comfortable and stylish too . I wore them with shorts , a bikini and summer dress . I highly recommend them !

 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 this is truly the best shoe i 've ever bought , and trust me , i 've had em all , nike , brooks , nb etc etc. . THIS IS NOT JUST FOR TRAIL RUNNING . i use mine on trails and on the street and the shoe does great on both . i got these after having these recommended to me by a guy at galyans after i explained that my knees sometimes played up after a lacrosse injury . these shoes just make it a pleasure to run . really chushiony , totally eliminated my knee pains , great grip when i do go on the trails ! would totally recommend these to anyone . my friend borrowed them yesterday and was so impressed that she 's going to get herself a pair today !

 The Reebok Amaze mid is a comfortable shoe that also provides great ankle support and a cool look . These shoes can match any outfit you have and make people look twice . Highly reccomended
 Wow , my first review . Naturally , I would review the T-Macs first , but I just love the Reebok Amaze classics . I got the baby blue and white . If you cool ghetto and urban , defintely it 's a pick up . Comfortable , stylish , good ankle support , and lasts for a long time . I just keep buying more of it .

 Ibought it to my nephew and he loved . I loved too . If you like the movie `` Cars '' you would love .
 The product was as advertised , the shipping was extremely efficient , the price worth every cent .
 Very cute . Well made . A great gift amoung all the toys my nephew received .
 I bought this for my boyfriend birthday . He says its stylish , comfortable and durable . He wears it a lot so I think it is good bang for my buck .
 I love my new converse ... It really was an excellent purchase , and the delivery was on time ... I have no problems at all , hope to shop very soon with the same costumer
 This classic shoe I have bought in several other colors . These shoes match everything and there is nothing comparable on the market .
 Less rubber at the toe than the earlier , 1st edition of that shoe . At least from what I can remember of the 70 's . Still , this has instantly become my dress sneaker of choice .
 The product was just as advertised and was received on time . Thanks for the great shoes .
 Classic summer shoe . Provides more arch support than originally thought . Easy to clean ... I just drop them into the washing machine .
 Well , they 're tennis shoes . They came fairly quickly . Although after I ordered them I found them about $ 10 cheaper elsewhere . You 'll have to do your own search .
 These shoes were so popular when and where I was in middle school and high school . I love the feel of the thick sole underneath the lightweight top . This shoe was cool then and now I 'm bring them back ! Plus I love the story behind Jack Purcell - these are the original `` Air Jordans '' you might say .
 These shoes are awesome ... . looking . Not so great on the feet . They hurt mine after an hour or two of wear . I bought a Dr. Scholls gel sole to fix the problem though and they are great.Another huge problem
 I like these converse sneakers better than some of the others because they look a little more preppy . I got these in white -LRB- mainly because that 's the only color they had in my size ! -RRB- and they 're great . They 're true to size . I 'm a size 9 in women 's and they fit perfectly . If you get the white ones however , they are not as white as they look in the picture . The bottom part of the shoe is more like an off-white tone . Not the really crisp white you see in the photo . They 're still great , and I looked for these at other places and they were trying to sell them for 65 dollars . So this is a great deal for Jack Purcells .
 I 've been wearing Converse All Stars since the early sixties . The Jack Purcell is the same sneaker minus some stripes . I do n't understand the gripe about `` feet burning '' ? I have `` medium '' feet ? Normal feet ? I do n't have flat feet nor do I have high arches . Just regular feet . Converse sneakers are THE most popular sneakers in the world . Do n't lace them so tight , wear crew socks and stop jumping out of trees and off roof tops and you 'll be fine . They are a casual wear sneaker , not an athletic sneaker . Relax . Be casual.One point , they are canvas not leather . I knew that before I bought them . Amazon should edit the description .
 I bought these for myself and I could n't be happier with them . They run a little shorter than what I usually wear -LRB- I would go up half a size if you want a little room -RRB- , but other than that they are the most comfortable Converse I have owned .
 Shoes were as expected and like every other pair of Jack Purcell 's new out of the box I have ever purchased .
 I saw these in a J. Crew store and of course , they are cheaper on Amazon . They are exactly what I saw ! I 've washed them a few times and they held up . The canvas stains particularly easily so they did n't stay nice and white for long , even with the washing .

 If you need a pair of shoes to bring out the best of your formal dresswear , think about the Kenneth Cole New York Men 's Trip Planner as one of your first -LRB- and best -RRB- options ... I bought it for my wedding and it was the best decission .

 these were great for the three years I have had them for running varsity track at my school . I have sprinted and hurdled faster and I am jumping higher in high jump . They come with spikes and a wrench . Perfect for a basic pair of spikes . Just loved them .
 nice solid shoes for rugged play . I play a lot of pick up games and playing conditions can be quite sloppy - especially during the rainy season in Northern Cali . these are excellent shoes for the price as the leather comfortably hugs your feet for good ball control . however , for game conditions on a quality pitch , I go with the mercurial vapors - feels like you 're wearing latex socks with studs !

 This is a great price for a tight looking shoe . I do admit it looks a little dull on the web , but it person these shoes are awesome ! The fit is great , and its great for running up and down the court.I have had these shoes for awhile now , and they still look new and feel good ; probable because i got the black ones . I have been purchasing ATR 's since they begin to make them , and i have alwayz been happy with my buy , so i would check out this shoe , or the ATR Elite shoe , which looks nice in white , which i bought.Overall , this is a great price , and a great looking shoe . You wo n't be dissapointed with this buy , no matter what color shoe you get . Thanx , and plz rate this helpful !!!
 I have owned many pairs of Altama Mil-Spec combat boots over the years , and they have always performed well.Pro : - comfortable - durable - highly resistant to water : - keep feet dry -LRB- triple stitching and full tongue keep water out -RRB- - resistant to the damaging effect of water - the wide lugs of the tread never pick up pebbles , and mud comes of easily - eyelets are very durable and are quick and easy to laceCon : - none to speak ofThese are almost the only foot-gear I wear .

 This is a great boot and it fits well . The foot is leather lined but the shaft of the boot is unlined and is very thin leather . I bought and returned them because of the unlined shaft . Boots are supposed to be warm and that unlined shaft would not be as warm as the average boot .

 I have had this boot for about four years now and I could not be happier . They are very comfortable as well as durable . I have put about 300-400 miles on them and the treads are not new , but they have held up well . The calfskin lining is one of the features that drew me to buy this boot in the first place . When you wear these boots with a good pair of smartwool socks , they wick away the moisture so fast and efficiently that you really wo n't even be able to tell that your feet are sweating . I would recommend this boot to anyone that goes on extended trips of 3 days or more , mostly because they are a little pricey if you are just the ocassional weekend hiker .

 I think that Dr. Marten 's shoes , besides being very confortable to even walk far distances , its price is very reasonable , they last untill you are ` tired ' of seeing them in your dressing room .
 this is my first pair of doc . martens ... i saw my brother wear them for years and wondered what the big deal was ... i always bought shoes from a department stores like kohls/JCpenny etc. . These shoes blow those shoes away . . they are so comfortable and light . I am on my feet for 10 hours a day and these shoes sure beat the department store + dr scholls insole combo ... they have such a unstylish stylishness to them that it 's amazing ... also for less than $ 40 here , this is the cheapest pair of doc . martens you can get . . i can only wonder how good the other $ 80 + doc martens are ... this is the best present for your feet ! amazon was awesome with the shipping as well . . ordered it on friday using super saver shiping and got them tuesday morning .

 Son muy bellos y sin detalles , a mi esposo le facinaron dice que son super comodos , llegaron en perfecto estado , para la proxima los pido medio numero mas.Suerte
 Primarily , I like the message that 's written inside the box . Months ago I wanted to buy these pair of shoes cause they look very simple and comfortable . Well , the results were awesome , people started asking me where did I get the shoes ? For a driving shoes , the are very innovating , even though I have n't driven with them yet ... They just fit with dark , classic or white jeans , chinos -LRB- even rolling up the pants to give them protagonist -RRB- I can recommend this brand to anyone whose buying luxury and style . The leather 's spanish , which means quality and comfort !!
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 I purchased these shoes a few weeks ago and have worn them a couple of times . The shoes feel true to size and width . They are not very comfortable to walk in for long periods of time or for long distances . They cause hotspots and blisters . The buckle on the strap across the toes can rub on the pinky toe and make it painful to walk after a while . The shoes have an attractive design and the details on the heel give it a special look . They can be worn at any occasion -LRB- formal or casual -- hoping you wo n't be on your feet for too long -RRB- . I would definitely recommend these shoes -LRB- if you are willing to sacrifice comfort -RRB- .
 These shoes are awesome . Worth every penny of the original $ 144 price tag but a steal at only $ 19.98 !!! They are beautifully made and very comfortable . I like that the front strap across your toes you can make one notch looser or in my case , one notch tighter , for a more exact fit . So far I do n't notice that the strap rubs on my toes like another reviewer stated but if it does I 'll adjust the strap accordingly . Also , plenty of notches to make the ankle strap looser or tighter , depending on your fit . I love everything about them . I got them in the linen accented with orange leather . Ca n't wait to take them on my trip to Florida in a few months and to wear the heck out of them this summer !
 These Shoes are comfortable for everday wear and look great . However , the white fabric in the front gets dirty really quick , and you have to manually clean it . That 's the only down side . Love it .

 nice solid shoes for rugged play . I play a lot of pick up games and playing conditions can be quite sloppy - especially during the rainy season in Northern Cali . these are excellent shoes for the price as the leather comfortably hugs your feet for good ball control . however , for game conditions on a quality pitch , I go with the mercurial vapors - feels like you 're wearing latex socks with studs !

 These shoes -LRB- i bought the black croco -RRB- are spectacular . They are extremely comfortable , considering how high the heels are . I have narrow feet and they fit exceptionally well , without any sliding or rubbing . I was able to wear these shoes for 7 hrs at a wedding and had no blisters . Definitely worth buying !
 These are great shoes ! Comfortable and look very hot !! The size does seem to run a little larger than you expect though - I normally wear a 7.5 and had to reorder a 6.5 so they would n't slide off when I walked . Other than that - excellent buy .
 This shoe is truly fabulous but the sizing is a bit off in my case . Some of the other reviews stated that the shoe slipped off and was too big so i bought a half size smaller which is quite uncomfortable for me . Amidst all that , the colour and style is amazing , it is a very sturdy shoe especially for the height and extremely sexy but i would advise that you purchase your normal shoe size . It may be the best suggestion !
 I bought these in Berries Glass color and they are perfect , beautiful shoes . I love the way they fit . I have semi-wide feet and these feel great !
 These shoes are HOT ! I love the scoop on the inside by the arch ... just HOT ! They are higher than any other I have worn , but pretty comfy for the height . I think they seem to run a bit big ... I always wear a 7.5 and was walking out of these , so I 'll have to get an insert of some type .
 I just ordered the tan leopard print heel , and i love it . this shoe is so sexy and fits beautifully . i have thicker legs and these shoes really elongate them i love this shoe and alot of my friends do as well . i ordered an 8 and felt that maybe i could have went with an 8 1/2 , but maybe thats because i havent fully broke them in yet . other than that i have no complaints and i intend on ordering 3 more pairs the gold , silver and patten leather black ones . this shoe is great !!
 THIS SHOE IS PERFECT ... I LOVE THIS SHOE -LRB- LEOPARD PRINT -RRB- ... I WEAR THEM AT WORK WITH A TAN PENCIL SKIRT AND DARK BROWN TOP ... THE SHOES ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS ... THE ONLY THING ABOUT THESE SHOES IS THEY RUN A SIZE BIGGER ... I ORDERED A 9.5 BUT PROBABALY COULD HAVE WORN A SIZE 9 ... I BOUGHT ENSOLES , BUT WHEN YOU WEAR THEM FOR A WHILE THEY WILL SLIDE UP AND DOWN ... OTHER THAN THAT NO COMPLAINTS ... LOVE THE LOOK OF THIS SHOE
 I own this shoe in two different colors and my goal is to get them all ! No one believes me , but they 're very comfortable . Not only that , but they 're very sexy as well . Dont let the high stilleto heel scare you ; the shoe is very comfy to wear . I could wear these shoes every day , all day !
 this shoe is great , i bought pewter liquid and is very sexy but this shoe is expensive here but in other places they are cheaper . so thats y im not giving 5 star.i wish they can reduce the price
 I bought the silver ones and they are very pretty compared to the other types of silver shoes that are out there . I usually do not wear shoes that are this high , I stick to 3 inch heels , but these were comfortable for a couple of hours . I wore them on New Year 's Eve from 7pm to 2am . At the end of the night the edge of the peephole was hurting my big toe on my right foot . Also these run big , when I tried them at the store they felt fine but using them that night my feet started to slip out . I usually wear a 7.5 but maybe I should have bought a 7 .
 I got these for my wife , it was her first pair of red peep toes and she flipped when she got them ! She is small , about 5 foot 2 . And her tiny feet fit perfectly in them . The cutout on the inside shows her cute little feet off and you can see the perfect amount of toe through the peep . She loves the way they look and feel . The red patent is super glossy , and the heel is slim and sexy . This is a great evening shoe , my wife just loves putting them on for a romantic evening out .
 Good Morning ! I bought these for my Birthday Weekend , and dancing with my friends . They worked wonderfully ! They 're ONLY a 4 inch heel , -LRB- surprising from Jessica Simpson -RRB- , but they did n't hurt 5 hours into wearing them . I LOVE these HEELS !
 These shoes seem to run true to size for me ... except they are a little narrow for my foot . I am stretching them at the toes to make em fit more comfortably . . Also I got a insert for the heel to help keep em from sliding on me ... Besides all the work Ive had to put in these shoes . . I love em . . They are so cute , I get so many compliments on them .
 This shoe fits perfectly . . I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments . . It def . worth the money and it fits nice , especially if u have wide feet
 I LOVE these shoes . They 're a little uncomfortable if worn all day , but who ever said shoes should be comfortable ?? :-RRB- Very cute .
 I have never owned this style shoe before and I loved the look of them so I decided to buy the black croc -LRB- because it was the cheapest -RRB- . The shoes are super hot , true to size and they even feel like slippers without the fuzz =-RRB- . The second I tried them on I fell in love and went digging in my closet to find a shirt to match so I could wear them immediately ! I would definately go back and buy more in other colors . Worth the price ladies !
 Very coftable shoes . Make you look sexy . The only problem is that the size is big . I wear a regular 7 and were a little lose . But a half size smaller than what you are .
 The leopard print heels were much less expensive -LRB- $ 50 + -RRB- than the other colors , so I went on a limb and purchased them . I LOVE them . -LRB- As does my boyfriend . He thinks they 're sexy . -RRB- They were so much cuter in person . I wear heels all the time so am used to uncomfortable shoes , but I kid you not - I was amazed when I first tried these on . They are so comfortable , and EASILY wearable for an entire day if you are used to heels , and I 'm sure even a novice could handle an 8-hr day in them.I have only one complaint
 I found these shoes at a local retailer who did not have them in my size . In fact , no retail store within 100 miles had them in my size . I am leary about purchasing shoes on-line because you never know if they will fit just right . I already knew that I was getting a good quality shoe because I had previously tried them on . My concern was more with quality control i.e. that the 9.5 I ordered would actually be a 9.5 and not run big or small and that the shoe would be durable emough to wear for long periods of time as I am not into paying good money for shoes that need to be removed for comfort . They arrived and were a perfect fit . Also , very well constructed so they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time . I am considering buying them in three or four colors just because I like them so well . Highly recommend !!
 Had tried the shoes on at the store so I knew what size I needed . Amazon had many more colors to choose from and the price was right . Love the shoes and they came very fast .
 I love shoes and have many different brands . These are my most comfortable shoes I own . I have a couple of Jessica Simpson shoes and they are the best shoes I have . You get more than you paid for !
 I had been looking for a pair of patent leather shoes to match an outfit , so I was thrilled when I finally found this pair . They are n't the most comfortable shoes I own , but they look so good that who cares ?! They add a sexy touch to all my business suits while still looking professional .
 This is a very sexy , classy shoe . Wear with your favorite cocktail dress , or skinny skirt . Comfortable all around . The black suede is very chic and very hard to find these days . I truly hope suede is coming back as the new FAD .
 The shoe is beautiful . I have it in 3 different colors . Although I like the black , the croco design does n't show up as well in the other colors .
 These boots fit my son and he really likes them This is the first time I was successful in purchasing footwear on line and actually having them fit . Hooray !
 I love these boots , I wear them to work . I do alot of walking at work and this is the only boot that I have found to stand up to the waer and tear and they are a great value for the money . I would buy another pair .
 These boots are great quality ! I bought them for my dad who is a police officer and he loves them . He said they were hard to break in , but really good quality . I had to return them several times because of the tricky E vs EE sizing . We got it figured out and he loves his new boots .
 We ordered these boots in a size 16 , Amazon was the only company that could deliver the boots in that size . I ordered from four different companies . Thats a whole lot of boot for $ 87 !

 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had .

 I like the way these shoes fit my feet . I took the original pads out and replaced them with Spenco orthotics to deal with my plantar fascitis . This was no problem . I know the shoes are n't very stylish . In fact , they look rather clunky , especially in black . I would have preferred white , but FootLocker did not carry my size in that color . Coincidentally , I eventually found Sears selling 574 's in white , and I just took delivery of four pairs . Sears priced them $ 3 higher -LRB- including tax -RRB- and did not include free delivery.Maybe a NewBalance expert will discern some significant difference between the 574 's and the older 374 's for $ 10 less . I ca n't . I do like the NB monogram ... it matches my initials .

 The first time I saw this shoe -LRB- in black/white patent leather -RRB- was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker . Being a fan of `` old-school '' shoes and Mr. Walker , I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G . The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair , whether in high school , college or at the pro level . The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic `` shell toe '' as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks . The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple , but unique.Another huge plus which I 'm sure everyone will notice is the price . ... it ai n't gon na clean out too many pockets and for this price y' all can go out and cop a pair or two -LRB- one for home games , one for the road -RRB- . So , the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it 's worth considering if you 're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe -LRB- ... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use -RRB- or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park .
 These shoes are comfortable as well as long lasting . They do not make your feet sweat or smell bad like other high top shoes . This shoe never goes op of style
 I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them . After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try . This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable . I also love the classic style . And you ca n't complain about the nice price .
 I am delighted with this product . previously bought addias trainers , but found these are lite , hard wearing and very comfortable . After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented '' Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their '' . which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man . EXCELLLANT PRODUCT .

 I got this shoe a few weeks ago and I was pleased with the general look . For the price they are the best around . I absolutely love Ted Baker shoes . I have a few other pair of Ted Baker 's and they fit fine . This shoe however did not fit as nice as others . It was extremely tight . I am trying to break them in however , but I do n't know if it will help . They are probably a size smaller than marked . Be careful !

 I have had this boot for about four years now and I could not be happier . They are very comfortable as well as durable . I have put about 300-400 miles on them and the treads are not new , but they have held up well . The calfskin lining is one of the features that drew me to buy this boot in the first place . When you wear these boots with a good pair of smartwool socks , they wick away the moisture so fast and efficiently that you really wo n't even be able to tell that your feet are sweating . I would recommend this boot to anyone that goes on extended trips of 3 days or more , mostly because they are a little pricey if you are just the ocassional weekend hiker .

 nice solid shoes for rugged play . I play a lot of pick up games and playing conditions can be quite sloppy - especially during the rainy season in Northern Cali . these are excellent shoes for the price as the leather comfortably hugs your feet for good ball control . however , for game conditions on a quality pitch , I go with the mercurial vapors - feels like you 're wearing latex socks with studs !

 The boots are comfortable and easy to wear . Are not heavy , which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair . The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston . Water does not penetrate them at the bottom . Nice buy !
 Timberland is a good product . I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland . Theses boots do have a solid fit , as one customer stated , but the fit is very comfortable ! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather . Highly recommended . The price is extremely low for a Timberland product . This boot is a winner !
 MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM . YEAH , , , HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR . SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DID N'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW . HOWEVER , I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DID N'T NEED ONE . THANKS SO MUCH . . WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON .
 Greatest Most durable boots I 've ever purchased . I 'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid . All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost . I 'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting .
 I gave these a five star based on price and performance . I purchased these boots for about 50 % off at 50 dollars . They have served well in the snow - waterproof and warm . I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available . As a workboot , the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole . Overall a great shoe .
 My son was thrilled to find these Tims at this unbelievably low price . Amazon shipping was prompt as always , and the fit was perfect .
 I usually reserve myself to Doc Martens , but I was looking for a style change when I found these boots at an unreal price . They are lightweight and comfortable , and look very nice in solid black . The best thing about them is their durability . I am tough as hell on shoes in general , but these are very scuff resistant . I imagine these will still look good 6 months from now without any type of repair , but we 'll see .
 Never owned a pair of Tim 's before . Took them out for an all day hike and WOW ! Really resistant to water , comfortable , and are durable . look forward to owning these for a few years .
 The canvas velcro shoes were all that I had hoped.I had a full hip replacement on 1/3/06 . Therefore , I needed something that was easy to put on and comfortable to wear . The canvas velcro shoes filled the bill .
 I purchased these for my mom after she had a hip replacement and was unable to bend to tie shoes . These worked great . They look nice and fit very well . The linen texture and beige color go with all her summer things . She is very pleased with the shoes . Never had a break in period with these either .
 These are great shoes . They are very comfortable and easy to put on . Fast delivery too .
 these shoes are so comfortable . the neat thing about these shoes is you can toss them in the washer and they look new again .
 Recently retired , and looking for comfortable attractive shoes . These are great .
 Velcro is a God sent to someone with M.S.the purchase of this item was easy and fast.the size was correct without actual being there for the fitting

 These are some good looking shoes , but comfort wise they are n't my favorite . The arch support is lacking , and the heel rubs on my ankle if my socks do n't go high enough . the sole is cushiony , but the rest is pretty thin . I would probably go 3 1/2 stars if i could but still a decent shoe .

 I originally ordered a different pair of Rockport 's that are so comfortable it should be illegal ! These are not the same ... they run narrow and do not have the interior support of the other . But just because I had a certain idea in mind does n't mean they are n't beautiful , quality made shoes . So I gave them a 4 .

 These boots are great quality ! I bought them for my dad who is a police officer and he loves them . He said they were hard to break in , but really good quality . I had to return them several times because of the tricky E vs EE sizing . We got it figured out and he loves his new boots .

 This bag is the best ever , it is small but handles all of my needs.The leather is soft and yet sturdy , and as with all Tignanello bags , it iswell made . I love it , especially that I can slip it over my head and havemy arms free while being secure in the knowledge that it wo n't slip off ofmy shoulder . It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.I have no negatives about this purse .
 This purse is VERY soft and is the perfect size for a casual time out where you need a purse but not one getting in the way . I recently had a purse stolen at a restaurant in Barcelona because it did not fit comfortably on my lap in the restaurant so I put it between my feet on the floor . The ever-vigilant purse snatchers got it . THIS purse fits comfortably on a lap yet has enough space for necessities . Also it is quite handsome .

 I 've been wearing this shoe for years . It has always been very comfortable and long-wearing .

 received it fast great for evening or jeans that need a little bling love it
 I love this bag because it is very cute and very small . I am a fan of tiny handbags . It holds just the right amount of stuff . However , I have used it only a handful of times and it is falling apart at the side seams . Nothing I ca n't fix with a needle and thread . I still love it though .
 This is the third pair of these shoes I have bought . All different colors . They are great to wear in the office in the summer .
 We have ordered the same shoe 3 times as it has some stretch and is good for hammer toes , it is a flat so the foot will not slide down . It would be nice to find something else but we keep ordering the same shoe . We have used amazon to order the VAN ELI shoe .

 I have had these shoes for 2 months , not a problem noted , seamless design , to spots for irritation , and I have not had any problems with sqeaking .
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 These were some beautiful boots but you must know how to walk on extremely high shoes . I can say I know how to walk on them and these were really a challenge . My husband did n`t want to wait for me all the time . If you are not familiar with walking straight ... . please do n`t buy them .
 I just love them . I use them a lot . Considering the high heel they are very confortable .
 i love this boots - they look amazingly feminine , and they fit true to size . the leather quality is very nice , and the rubber-covered sole makes the boots more stable . it takes some time to learn how to walk fast in them , though .

 The upper part was nice leather , although I expected the `` cognac '' color deescription to be closer to cordovan than the lighter brown it is . Only negative is the sole is very thin leather , meaning it will wear out much quicker than the thicker rubber sole i am accustommed to . Very lightweight , not to be worn in rain or bad weather . For the price a -LRB- I got them on discount around $ 30 . -RRB- a good value .

 I bought these for my preschooler whose feet are on the wide side . I bought the extra wide size because they were out of the wide . The extra wide was great ! She is not overweight just has more width to her foot . I am glad I ordered the XW because they fit great . If you think wide may be good , the XW would probably work too .
 These are nice looking shoes-but they 're not sized correctly . I had to wear them around all day just to break them in . Unless you run a little small in your size , I 'd advise moving a size up .

 just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo . I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box . They feel like I already broke them in . These are going to be great for pants or skirts . I 'm very happy with them .
 I soooo love these boots . . the colour is great , different than any I ever had . They are also so very comfortable , even the first time I wore them . the leather did not need time to break like other boots . I love them , the colour , the feel and the height is just right !!
 I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot , the color , the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort . I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores .
 Super comfy boots from day 1 ! NO break-in time which is an added bonus . I 've had many compliments on them . They DO run true-to size . Shipping was faster than predicted : -RRB-
 Absolutely beautiful boot and ca n't wait to wear them . We do n't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can . Sorry I ca n't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport , I doubt I will be disappointed .

 These are the second pair of CAT steel tipped boots I have owned . The 1st lasted me for 7 years but were finally ready for retirement . The CAT Hydraulics which I now don are the most comfortable work boots I have ever owned ... more comfortable , even , then some of my hiking boots.Ths only complaint I have , however , is the lack of waterproofing/water resistance . A typical puddle will wet your foot w/in . Once the water reaches the tongue/toe interface , it just flows in through the seam .

 awesome details , bold but not arrogant styling . Ted at his best.Runs similar to his other shoes in that it feels small compared to boot sizing.Unlike , any shoes shown with upwards curve on toe , this hold a degree of shape , helped by a thicker than average sole for a leather soled shoe .

 We ordered these boots in a size 16 , Amazon was the only company that could deliver the boots in that size . I ordered from four different companies . Thats a whole lot of boot for $ 87 !
 I just love my slippers . I have had them for a least five years . This year I bought new fleece inner soles for my slippers , asthe other ones wore out . The new slippers I bought were for my adult daughter , who complained about cold feet.She somewhat likes the slippers , but feels they are a bit heavy like shoes . She would have liked lighter weightslippers . I however really like that I can run outside in my slippers to get my dog and if I step in poop , I can easilywash the soles off . As I said different stokes for different folks .
 Just got my pair in today . Shipping was fast ! This is my first pair of Dr. Scholl 's shoes . Could n't beat the $ 15.89 deal . First of all , perfect fit ! I am a size 9 , lean a little towards the W size , and the comfortable fabric cross straps in the front do not rub or cut into the skin of the feet . That 's one of my biggest pet peeves when I buy shoes . I do not like the straps to cut into my feet , but these shoes are very comfortable , and dressy too . The pictures do n't do the shoe justice . In real life , the shoes have a little `` glitz and glam '' to the fabric heel . I thought it was real gemstones sewn into the fabric , but it 's not . Beautiful , perfect for that nice dress or when you feel like pairing your wardrobe with a dressy shoe . It has a nice , comfortable in-sole . I think I might purchase the black pair too !
 So retro . So comfy . All my friends want to borrow them . I love them . I wear them all the time .
 I absolutely love these shoes -- I usually wear flip flops if I am gon na do any bit of walking around and these were a welcome departure from those !! I felt more confident and tall !!! Do n't hesitate to purchase . Look GREAT with low waisted jeans -- loved the profile ! Buy these with confidence -- true to size .
 Sexy looking shoes that are actually comfortable to wear . And I 'm someone who never wears anything with a heel over 1 1/2 inches high .
 Comfortable , stylish and priced right ! I got them in red and brown and am always looking for an excuse to wear them , ... even around the house . Would purchase them again and again and again , in every color available in my shoe size . Great buy !!
 These were really nice cleats , but they run a little small -LRB- as with other addidas shoes -RRB- . I had to return them and would have gotten the next 1/2 size up if it had been available . I ca n't say how durable they are as my son never got to use them . Overall great shoes , great price but order 1/2 size larger than you would normally need .
 This is a great price for a tight looking shoe . I do admit it looks a little dull on the web , but it person these shoes are awesome ! The fit is great , and its great for running up and down the court.I have had these shoes for awhile now , and they still look new and feel good ; probable because i got the black ones . I have been purchasing ATR 's since they begin to make them , and i have alwayz been happy with my buy , so i would check out this shoe , or the ATR Elite shoe , which looks nice in white , which i bought.Overall , this is a great price , and a great looking shoe . You wo n't be dissapointed with this buy , no matter what color shoe you get . Thanx , and plz rate this helpful !!!

 The Melissa shoe gives a perfect look to any outfit . The texture and the unusual varieties of colors this product gives can make any outfit seem like the best . The way the shoes shapes the foot and brings out your natural texture as well as the shoes color is awesome . No wonder this product is so popular among all teenage girls today . Melissa 's are a great shoe , it brings out the best in you and whatever you may wear .
 I 've owned these shoes -LRB- in black -RRB- for over a year . I am writing this because I totally disagree with the other reviewer . When I have a long work day ahead of me , these are the heels I choose . I wear a 39 in these , and mostly a 39 in Ecco , though some I wear are 40s . I disagree that they run big , I think Ecco itself sometimes is in between with their Euro sizing . These are really comfortable .

 These shoes were comfortable for my son right off the bat , and they look adorable !
 I bought these for my mother in law . She saw them in the Neiman Marcus catalog and thought she might like them . Well , she does ! She wears them all the time . Very comfortable and stylish .
 This shoe looks fantastic on ! It is also very comfortable . I have n't been this excited about a shoe in a long time ...

 I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on , but i heard good things about this brand and model , so i gave it a shot , i have bad support in my feet and week ankles , these shoes look kinda big , but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support , and they lasted a very long time , i plan on making another order soon .
 The sneakers arrived in a timely fashion , as promised . They were exactly what my son wanted . They were priced reasonably.They were of high quality and true to size . Thank you , Amazon
 Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell . any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got . the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt . A lot ! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth . but other than that they really have nice ankle protection , by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them . i would and did recommend them to everyone . so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent !
 it looks really cool and really comforible . everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt .
 Great boot at a reasonable price . My son was very happy to recieve them so quickly . Hoping they last longer than the ones we bought last year and so far they are standing up to the beating a kid can put on them .
 There 's definitely something to be said for still being able to buy kids sizes as an adult . There 's also something to be said about the pair these are replacing being 11 years old . The originals outlasted many people 's cars , lets hope these can do the same !
 Bought these for my two year old granddaughter . So far they 've held up nicely through several early season campouts in the Wash. . Cascades . She 's worn them in the rain with her rainsuit , and splashing in puddles when it was n't raining , but the boots kept her feet dry as advertised . And they look adorable on her as well ! Great service , fast shipping , overall an excellent online purchase .
 My 5 year old son loved these boots and wears them constantly since receiving them for Christmas . They were priced below area stores and arrived within a few days of ordering online . The fit is true to description and they are very well-made . I recommend them to others .
 My son like the boot , it fit well and is water proof . We received the boot just a few days after ordering it .
 I bought these boots for my toddler daughter this winter . We 're very pleased with this product . It 's very classic , stylish and well made .
 THE SHOES IS WONDERFUL AS IT LOOKS MY SON LOVES IT AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BUY MORE AND RECOMMEND OTHER FRIENDS TO SHOP AT AMAZON THE BEST STORE IN THE WORLD
 After looking for a long time we were able to find the boots we were looking for . thanks again !!
 ... LOVED his new boots for Christmas . It took a hammer and chisel to get him out of the mirror . Highly recommended .
 These boots are comfy , easy to tie and you can really wear them for all seasons . I live in New England and wear them to school every day .
 I am glad with the product and good size specification.the more i liked of it is its color , i was waiting a black but instead it is a really spectacular dark green.no regrets about them , i am thinking to buy one more pair for my cousin .
 The waterproof boots perform perfect in snow days . Keep feet dry and warm . They also look good . I love it !
 My 10yr old Daughter has hard to fit feet , to say the least ! We have always gotten her good shoes usually fitted at Jamiel 's or other high end stores . 99 % of the time , we get her shoes , sneakers or boots , she wears them 1-2x 's & complains about the fit ! I 'd about had it & was thinking it would cost less to move to a tropical climate & let her run barefoot !!!! So far AMAZON has been a lifesaver -LRB- hers anyway ! -RRB- I bought NB wide $ 40 sneakers & she LOVES them , wearing them consistently 3-4 times a week . Snow came & we had problems ... . Uggs are her fav pair yet they are n't for snow & rain :-LRB- so the hunt was on ! Cheap ones , wide , xtra wide , expensive ones , ones we 'd never heard of - ALL did n't fit ... then , looking thru the WIDE width section of girls shoes on here - I found THESE . Now I had tried a different brand of work boots & they fit terrible & were made even worse , so I worried . I waited days , looked again , 1left in her size 5.5 wide ! I grabbed em ' , I was desperate ! They came today - I was shaking , she was scared yet another would n't fit ... Well Dear Lord she put them on & ran around the house smiling & yelling &#34; I LOVE EM ' &#34; !! She has a EE width , yet these in just wide fit perfect ! I am now looking to buy stock in the company , as I will be buying soooo many pairs in various sizes ! THANK YOU Timberland & Amazon ! Made well , soft leather & the sole is flexible . A great boot -
 buy this one for my girl friend , she like it , feel comfortable whe she wear it . Seem nice as well , maybe i need one for myself .
 Exactly what I ordered and fit great . Im not sure if they are really waterproof , but i bought them to walk on rocks in Afghanistan and they work great for that .
 she loves her boots . . came in excellant conditions and on time . . cheaper than buying them in a store . . will purchase more in the near future
 I wear a 6.5 in kids and that 's what i ordered . They seemed a little big when i first tried them on but theyre fine . I love my boots ! great purchase ! and they came fast !
 great classic boot always in style , runs a little big , but put an insole from an old sneaker in it and fits much better now .
 I 'm an adult female who has great difficulty finding women 's shoes small enough to fit . These boys ' size 4 are perfect and the boot is very sturdy and attractive -LRB- as hiking boots go -RRB- . I will buy this brand and size every time I need new ones from now on . I 'm quite satisfied with this purchase .
 With all the snow and school cloosings my son and I headed for the hills to pass the time sledding . He was wearing some velcrow closer snow boots from a large package store . They were totaly useless . Soon as the velcrow gets ice and snow impregenated in it it 's useless . After exausting all of our local retailers including Cabelas we decided to spend the extra for these boots . We have not regreated it . With some good wool socks we were able to spend hours and hours outside sledding without any complaints of cold or wet feet . Get yours big enough to accomidate the socks . We went 1/2 size bigger .
 The product was brand new , everything was like described , they are really looking good and are warm as well , the perfect winter shoe
 I was so confused to what size I should get . I looked up a bunch of reviews and I got a mix of getting a half size smaller to a full size smaller . I have a friend that has a pair and she told me to get a full size smaller . I wear a 6.5 in women 's shoes , and a size 5 in boys . I got a size 4M in big kids . They fit perfectly . I 'm glad I got a full size smaller . My toes just barely hit the front of the shoes and I can still wear socks . I suggest you get a full size smaller . Timbs do run really huge . They are great quality and the shipping was quick . Happy with my purchase !
 What can I say great shoes and a competitive price . These shoes take the rough beating that a toddler can levy on shoes . They look great and are easy to clean given they are waterproof .
 Love these boots . Have this style in about 7 colors . These are my favorite for work as the grey is a beautiful color and goes with my black work cargo pants . I brush them clean when they get dusty and they still look good as new . Very comfortable for all day on my feet and I have a high arch . Good support .
 My son loved theses shoes when he recieved them for christmas . They looked exactly like the picture above they are authentic Timberlands .
 These boots were sold out everwhere I was happy that I found them online at a cheaper price , and they arrived on time
 Got them for my active 5 yo son and he was aborable in them . He wore them with dark jeans and a cable sweater in the same color of the boots .
 Size is good , but not very comfortable shoes , also many like to wear for some time.We recommend that you buy
 I got these boot 's for my son . The size was right on & look good.The only thing I had a problem wit is the wide size 's ! They do NOT fit like wide boot 's should & they even say wide inside . Other then that they are good boot 's .
 Very nice boot . Great for waking in the snow and it catches the eye of others when you wear them with the right clothes .
 '' Santa '' brought these for my son and he has n't taken them off since ! I was worried about how they would fit since he did n't try them on first and he has a narrow foot , but no complaints from him !
 I bought these boots as a present for my son 's fifth birthday . He had been asking for boots just like his daddy . The quality is great . Kids love these boots and they go with almost anything .
 I bought these boots for my son , he is going on a camping trip at the end of Jan. . He needed a boot that would keep him both dry and warm . He love 's them !
 Got these for Christmas for my 7 Year Old . They were a GREAT price ! He 's happy and so am I.
 I wish they would list a size cross reference chart . Cause the boot says 6.5 US but 39 EUR which really equates to 8.5 US womens . Bought for my daughter for xmas is says toddler/little kid/big kid so I thought she petite 6 is her size perfect ! NOT the shoes fit me & I am am 8.5 now I can even get her size for the same price . Great quality though just need to work out the sizing issue
 Great boots . Tim 's are the absolute best and my kids love them . Shipping was fast .
 Just what i was looking for . the product is in perfect condtion.i have been looking for these shoes for WEEKS and no one had my size.im really happy with my purchase
 these are so cute and really made very well ... kind of heavy for a 2 year old but she looks so cute in them . Well worth the price
 I 'm a size 8 1/2 in womans and I 'm in love with these great fashion statement . Keeps my feet warmm
 price and boots great thanks please email me with items like that im a single father and cant afford to pay regulor prices thanks
 My son knows that when he puts on these boots that he is dressing to impress ! They have become an essential part of his wardrobe ever since he could walk handeling the weight of the boot ! This is the first time I have ordered the boot without having to wait more then 2 weeks for it !
 This boot is very classic and stylish . My four year old son loves his boots and it matches all of his wardrobe .
 I bought these boots for my daughter this winter . She outgrew that size i bought very quickly . I was desperately searching for another pair that would fit her for the rest of the spring and until next fall . Amazon was the only place that i could find them . I had placed an order with another company and then they were put on backorder until July . I looked at amazon the next day and they were cheaper and would be there 2 days later . Great boots awesome quality my daughter loves wearing them outside . Definately a great purchase . The price is a little much for a 2 year old but at least they last .
 Those boots are very good quality . Very strong . Timberlands are large boots -LRB- impression -RRB- compairing to other shoes . The shoe sole is a little bit hard and not very flexibel .
 The boots are awesome ... perfect just as they were stated to be . Arrived in a timely manner . We are very pleased with this product .
 Easy ordering process . . Received within expected time frame . Item is as I expected . No complaints . Very pleased with my purchase .
 Purchased for my wife -LRB- she has small feet -RRB- . She really likes them , says they are comfortable and the price was good .
 These are the perfect outside boots for my toddler . She loves them . The price was right and I have no doubt that we 'll get a lot of use out of them - they 're so sturdy that she 'll wear them and then hand them down to her little sister . It 's very hard to find cute , well made boots for a toddler girl and I am so glad we found these ones .
 ... . Terrific fit , great deal and they look good on tiny feet !
 I have twin toddler boys who run all over so I wanted something sturdy and warm for our sloppy winters . I was concerned they 'd be too stiff , but ordered them anyway based on other reviews and because they 're offered in wide sizes -LRB- not common for toddler boots-trust me I 've looked ALL OVER -RRB- . By the time Ifound them , the only color available in their sizes was black , which has actually worked out well . My boys LOVE these and do n't want to wear anything else , so next fall , assuming they 'll have outgrown these , this is all I 'm buying . In addition to all the wonderful qualities everyone else has cited , I am so grateful they make the toddler boots in wide sizes too . One boy is actually an extra wide , so I ordered a half size up-the fit is great , and more to the point , he must be comfortable because he demands I put them on .
 Thanks a lot !!! Good brand , good shoes , I like it very much ! Classic shoes , I recomendate this item to my friends !
 Absolutely love these really cute boots . Bought them as a gift for a friend 's son for Xmas and they look awesome . Sizing was perfect and the price was good as well .
 Our local shoe store stopped carrying childrens shoes because of the economy and big box stores so I was forced to go on line to find quality boot style shoes for my seven year old son -- he absolutely loves them and they fit him well -- he says they will smash anything ! Looks like they are fun too !
 Great boots for children and to keep their feet warm doing the winter months.I love Timberland boots for my son because they 're quality made and durable.Amazon is the cheapest place to get these boots for my son .
 My eight year old received these for Christmas and wears them constantly . They are durable , comfortable and look great ! I did order them in his actual size and found them to be roomy , but with a heavy sock it 's fine . He absolutely adores them !
 I love itBut I did not grasp the sizeSo I give it to my friendsI decided to buy a new one
 Everything was great perfect for my son . Shipping came fast and quality of the shoe was great ! They was a half size to big but thats ok give my son time to grow in them . For perfect fit purchase a half size down .
 I love these boots ... Great pair of boots my 6 year old loves them and so do I ! Good investment : - -RRB-
 No review necessary . They are wheat timbs . The quality n look of these boots from Timberland speak for themselves . : -RRB-
 Shipped very quickly , received in two days . Run slightly big . Heavy-duty high quality . Great boots for boys . Might be able to wear next year , too .
 Even though it seems a bit ridiculous buying children shoes for this kind of price , which is none-the-less , the shoes came in perfect quality and they 're even more adorable than the pictures online . The delivery was quick , and the outside package was undamaged .
 Really happy with the quality of these sturdy kids work-boots with soft uppers and sturdy build , my son just loves them , and I was really pleased too , fast ship too !
 I bought these boots for my son for his birthday . I was very pleasantly surprised when I received them , they are very nice looking . They are really exactly what I was hoping for .
 I looked everywhere for a boot that would hold up and be comfortable for my 8 year old son . He is on the go all the time and does n't stop . I ordered this boot and they are great . He wears them ALL the time . They are holding up well and he says they are very comfortable . They seem to run a bit big so order the size they are in at the time . I almost ordered a half size bigger and I am glad I did n't . He has plenty of room and they should last for some time .
 I was kind of skeptical of buying off of amazon because i thought they were n't going to be authentic . but sure enough they are the real deal
 I usually wear a 6.5 but they are a little big so I would order a half size down but other than that they 're great .
 My 6 yr old son really loves these boots and wants to wear them every day . He wanted `` work '' boots so he could be like his Daddy . Previously he had a pair of boots with a manmade upper and those did not last too long . He is very hard on footwear , but so far these seem to be holding up well . He even wears them to school on days he does n't have gym .
 I do love my boots however they do run big so keep that in mind when you are purchasing a pair . Mine are too big but being the lazy person I am and knowing I bought them for winter I kept them because I can wear with thicker socks . Another complaint I have is that it took so long for them to ship off the boots like a full week for them to post as shipped . I 'm use to it take two days at most . The shipping issue is why I give it four stars .
 Ordered for himself these shoes . I have a foot on the insole length 25 cm Order size 7C BIG KID was written 24,8 cm When they arrived , they were more inside on the insole , they were 25.5 cm For me , it is sensitive !
 I just ordered these boots for my son and LOVE THEM ! These boots are good quality , rough and tough boots - perfect for the boys . I was told that these boots ran big , so even though my son wears a size 5 , I ordered him a 5 and they fit perfect .
 I bought these for my rowdy 3 year old and he loves them . They are not too heavy and they are also wide enough for his feet .
 These boots worked perfectly for my son . They are very well made . They are a great color . They are a little heavy , but that 's probably because of the sturdy construction . He has worn them several times already . I would recommend these boots .
 We bought these for our 5 year old but our 4 year old wanted the Merrell Chameleon in Wineberry . I have to say the Merrells look more comfortable as they 're not as stiff , have a padded tongue , and fuller padding around the ankle . That all being said , the 5 year old loves these ... because they 're pink . The laces are difficult to tie as they are so slippery and tend to loosen up before you can get a good bow tied , especially for a young one just learning to tie . They are competent boots , which were hard to find for little girls . We used them on short hikes in a state park and they performed acceptably . Can not comment on their waterproofness as we did not tromp through any water . If you have a little princess with her heart set on pink and a need for waffle-stompers , these will work .
 I love them , they came earlier than i thought , so I got to wear a week earlier to a party
 These are really beautifully made boots . I bought them in black for my 12 year old daughter in the Big Kids size 5 and she loves them . Very high quality material and craftsmanship . Exactly what one expects from Timberland products . Best of all , I got them for approximately $ 50 less here on Amazon than what they sell for on the Timberland website . Highly recommended !
 I wear a size 8 in women shoes and a size 7 in big kids.I was told that timberland boots run big so i was wondering where the sizes say 6.5 -LRB- M -RRB- and beyond , is that big kids , toddlers , or walking shoes ?
 I really like these shoes , wearing very comfortable , is slightly larger than the normal code point , but does not affect the wearing comfort .
 came in time my son loved it and excellent quality and true to size i would buy more for him in a different color
 Great product . Great price . Have recommended the boots to friends . My child loves them . The parents of his friends have been asking where I got them .
 i love timbs . They are awesome and beautiful and waterproof and not too heavy . They are the perfect shoe for you
 they were a bit darker than what I expected but they were fine with me.there for a 6yr anyway . . price good
 I like the style , it fits me perfectly and the quality is great . My mom ordered another black pair when she saw mine .
 My son wears these boots he had them for like two months and they still look new and the price was great saved lots of money
 love my boots they got here a day before time ! im very pleased . everywhere else wanted 98 dollars for them but i got them for 48 dollars here ! im super stoked
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 Dynasty shoes are way more impressive once you take them out of the box than they are online . I could not believe how cute and sexy they are and how they make your foot look smaller , slimmer and sexier too.Once you put these on , you may have trouble taking them off.You could use these as sexy slippers because the black velvet and diamond broach styling is fancy enough to wear with other velvet or silky items.Holiday parties will also be all the more enjoyable because of the `` Memory Fit '' Cushion Insole . The memory foam cushioning fits the unique curves of your foot . I rarely find shoes I like , so these were a fun discovery.Shoes have come a long way since my first pair of Dr. Scholl 's sandals ... ~ The Rebecca Review
 I got these in black and they are beautiful ! Great for summer since they are sandal style , but also perfect for the holidays with the bit of glitz they have ! They are WAY cuter than pictured and comfortable too !
 I thought I was taking a big chance buying shoes online , as I have wide feet . But I ordered them anyway because the price was right.The shoes fit me perfectly ! I think the fabric gives them some stretching ability . They would probably fit any width just fine . The cushioning in the sole makes them quite comfortable to wear on the town , or the dance floor.The color is sort of a pinky-red , but because of the texture they match most light to dark blue-reds . Probably would n't match an orangy-red .
 I LOVE these shoes !! They are the tiniest bit difficult to walk in , but that 's heels for you . Nice and soft also , and the red is amazing ! Prepare to be noticed !

 Nice light weight shoe that has gotten plenty of attention . Had someone ask me initially if it was a gucci shoe !
 I 've bought several pairs of these shoes over the years , now I just ca n't decide which color to try next ! I am an ER nurse and spend a lot of time on my feet . These were even great during my last pregnancy . Very durable too . Some of my friends recommend these over their Danskos .
 I love itBut I did not grasp the sizeSo I give it to my friendsI decided to buy a new one

 These are the perfect outside boots for my toddler . She loves them . The price was right and I have no doubt that we 'll get a lot of use out of them - they 're so sturdy that she 'll wear them and then hand them down to her little sister . It 's very hard to find cute , well made boots for a toddler girl and I am so glad we found these ones .
 ... . Terrific fit , great deal and they look good on tiny feet !

 Great product . Great price . Have recommended the boots to friends . My child loves them . The parents of his friends have been asking where I got them .
 i love timbs . They are awesome and beautiful and waterproof and not too heavy . They are the perfect shoe for you
 they were a bit darker than what I expected but they were fine with me.there for a 6yr anyway . . price good
 I like the style , it fits me perfectly and the quality is great . My mom ordered another black pair when she saw mine .

 These boots are comfy , easy to tie and you can really wear them for all seasons . I live in New England and wear them to school every day .
 I am glad with the product and good size specification.the more i liked of it is its color , i was waiting a black but instead it is a really spectacular dark green.no regrets about them , i am thinking to buy one more pair for my cousin .
 The waterproof boots perform perfect in snow days . Keep feet dry and warm . They also look good . I love it !
 My 10yr old Daughter has hard to fit feet , to say the least ! We have always gotten her good shoes usually fitted at Jamiel 's or other high end stores . 99 % of the time , we get her shoes , sneakers or boots , she wears them 1-2x 's & complains about the fit ! I 'd about had it & was thinking it would cost less to move to a tropical climate & let her run barefoot !!!! So far AMAZON has been a lifesaver -LRB- hers anyway ! -RRB- I bought NB wide $ 40 sneakers & she LOVES them , wearing them consistently 3-4 times a week . Snow came & we had problems ... . Uggs are her fav pair yet they are n't for snow & rain :-LRB- so the hunt was on ! Cheap ones , wide , xtra wide , expensive ones , ones we 'd never heard of - ALL did n't fit ... then , looking thru the WIDE width section of girls shoes on here - I found THESE . Now I had tried a different brand of work boots & they fit terrible & were made even worse , so I worried . I waited days , looked again , 1left in her size 5.5 wide ! I grabbed em ' , I was desperate ! They came today - I was shaking , she was scared yet another would n't fit ... Well Dear Lord she put them on & ran around the house smiling & yelling &#34; I LOVE EM ' &#34; !! She has a EE width , yet these in just wide fit perfect ! I am now looking to buy stock in the company , as I will be buying soooo many pairs in various sizes ! THANK YOU Timberland & Amazon ! Made well , soft leather & the sole is flexible . A great boot -
 buy this one for my girl friend , she like it , feel comfortable whe she wear it . Seem nice as well , maybe i need one for myself .
 Exactly what I ordered and fit great . Im not sure if they are really waterproof , but i bought them to walk on rocks in Afghanistan and they work great for that .
 she loves her boots . . came in excellant conditions and on time . . cheaper than buying them in a store . . will purchase more in the near future
 I wear a 6.5 in kids and that 's what i ordered . They seemed a little big when i first tried them on but theyre fine . I love my boots ! great purchase ! and they came fast !
 great classic boot always in style , runs a little big , but put an insole from an old sneaker in it and fits much better now .
 Great boot at a reasonable price . My son was very happy to recieve them so quickly . Hoping they last longer than the ones we bought last year and so far they are standing up to the beating a kid can put on them .
 There 's definitely something to be said for still being able to buy kids sizes as an adult . There 's also something to be said about the pair these are replacing being 11 years old . The originals outlasted many people 's cars , lets hope these can do the same !
 Bought these for my two year old granddaughter . So far they 've held up nicely through several early season campouts in the Wash. . Cascades . She 's worn them in the rain with her rainsuit , and splashing in puddles when it was n't raining , but the boots kept her feet dry as advertised . And they look adorable on her as well ! Great service , fast shipping , overall an excellent online purchase .
 My 5 year old son loved these boots and wears them constantly since receiving them for Christmas . They were priced below area stores and arrived within a few days of ordering online . The fit is true to description and they are very well-made . I recommend them to others .
 My son like the boot , it fit well and is water proof . We received the boot just a few days after ordering it .
 I bought these boots for my toddler daughter this winter . We 're very pleased with this product . It 's very classic , stylish and well made .
 THE SHOES IS WONDERFUL AS IT LOOKS MY SON LOVES IT AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BUY MORE AND RECOMMEND OTHER FRIENDS TO SHOP AT AMAZON THE BEST STORE IN THE WORLD
 After looking for a long time we were able to find the boots we were looking for . thanks again !!
 ... LOVED his new boots for Christmas . It took a hammer and chisel to get him out of the mirror . Highly recommended .
 Great boots . Tim 's are the absolute best and my kids love them . Shipping was fast .

 I 'm a size 8 1/2 in womans and I 'm in love with these great fashion statement . Keeps my feet warmm
 price and boots great thanks please email me with items like that im a single father and cant afford to pay regulor prices thanks
 My son knows that when he puts on these boots that he is dressing to impress ! They have become an essential part of his wardrobe ever since he could walk handeling the weight of the boot ! This is the first time I have ordered the boot without having to wait more then 2 weeks for it !
 This boot is very classic and stylish . My four year old son loves his boots and it matches all of his wardrobe .
 I bought these boots for my daughter this winter . She outgrew that size i bought very quickly . I was desperately searching for another pair that would fit her for the rest of the spring and until next fall . Amazon was the only place that i could find them . I had placed an order with another company and then they were put on backorder until July . I looked at amazon the next day and they were cheaper and would be there 2 days later . Great boots awesome quality my daughter loves wearing them outside . Definately a great purchase . The price is a little much for a 2 year old but at least they last .
 Those boots are very good quality . Very strong . Timberlands are large boots -LRB- impression -RRB- compairing to other shoes . The shoe sole is a little bit hard and not very flexibel .
 The boots are awesome ... perfect just as they were stated to be . Arrived in a timely manner . We are very pleased with this product .
 Got them for my active 5 yo son and he was aborable in them . He wore them with dark jeans and a cable sweater in the same color of the boots .
 Size is good , but not very comfortable shoes , also many like to wear for some time.We recommend that you buy
 I got these boot 's for my son . The size was right on & look good.The only thing I had a problem wit is the wide size 's ! They do NOT fit like wide boot 's should & they even say wide inside . Other then that they are good boot 's .
 Very nice boot . Great for waking in the snow and it catches the eye of others when you wear them with the right clothes .
 '' Santa '' brought these for my son and he has n't taken them off since ! I was worried about how they would fit since he did n't try them on first and he has a narrow foot , but no complaints from him !
 I bought these boots as a present for my son 's fifth birthday . He had been asking for boots just like his daddy . The quality is great . Kids love these boots and they go with almost anything .
 I bought these boots for my son , he is going on a camping trip at the end of Jan. . He needed a boot that would keep him both dry and warm . He love 's them !
 Got these for Christmas for my 7 Year Old . They were a GREAT price ! He 's happy and so am I.
 I wish they would list a size cross reference chart . Cause the boot says 6.5 US but 39 EUR which really equates to 8.5 US womens . Bought for my daughter for xmas is says toddler/little kid/big kid so I thought she petite 6 is her size perfect ! NOT the shoes fit me & I am am 8.5 now I can even get her size for the same price . Great quality though just need to work out the sizing issue
 I 'm an adult female who has great difficulty finding women 's shoes small enough to fit . These boys ' size 4 are perfect and the boot is very sturdy and attractive -LRB- as hiking boots go -RRB- . I will buy this brand and size every time I need new ones from now on . I 'm quite satisfied with this purchase .
 With all the snow and school cloosings my son and I headed for the hills to pass the time sledding . He was wearing some velcrow closer snow boots from a large package store . They were totaly useless . Soon as the velcrow gets ice and snow impregenated in it it 's useless . After exausting all of our local retailers including Cabelas we decided to spend the extra for these boots . We have not regreated it . With some good wool socks we were able to spend hours and hours outside sledding without any complaints of cold or wet feet . Get yours big enough to accomidate the socks . We went 1/2 size bigger .
 The product was brand new , everything was like described , they are really looking good and are warm as well , the perfect winter shoe
 I was so confused to what size I should get . I looked up a bunch of reviews and I got a mix of getting a half size smaller to a full size smaller . I have a friend that has a pair and she told me to get a full size smaller . I wear a 6.5 in women 's shoes , and a size 5 in boys . I got a size 4M in big kids . They fit perfectly . I 'm glad I got a full size smaller . My toes just barely hit the front of the shoes and I can still wear socks . I suggest you get a full size smaller . Timbs do run really huge . They are great quality and the shipping was quick . Happy with my purchase !
 What can I say great shoes and a competitive price . These shoes take the rough beating that a toddler can levy on shoes . They look great and are easy to clean given they are waterproof .
 Love these boots . Have this style in about 7 colors . These are my favorite for work as the grey is a beautiful color and goes with my black work cargo pants . I brush them clean when they get dusty and they still look good as new . Very comfortable for all day on my feet and I have a high arch . Good support .
 My son loved theses shoes when he recieved them for christmas . They looked exactly like the picture above they are authentic Timberlands .
 These boots were sold out everwhere I was happy that I found them online at a cheaper price , and they arrived on time
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 These boots are comfy , easy to tie and you can really wear them for all seasons . I live in New England and wear them to school every day .
 I am glad with the product and good size specification.the more i liked of it is its color , i was waiting a black but instead it is a really spectacular dark green.no regrets about them , i am thinking to buy one more pair for my cousin .
 The waterproof boots perform perfect in snow days . Keep feet dry and warm . They also look good . I love it !
 My 10yr old Daughter has hard to fit feet , to say the least ! We have always gotten her good shoes usually fitted at Jamiel 's or other high end stores . 99 % of the time , we get her shoes , sneakers or boots , she wears them 1-2x 's & complains about the fit ! I 'd about had it & was thinking it would cost less to move to a tropical climate & let her run barefoot !!!! So far AMAZON has been a lifesaver -LRB- hers anyway ! -RRB- I bought NB wide $ 40 sneakers & she LOVES them , wearing them consistently 3-4 times a week . Snow came & we had problems ... . Uggs are her fav pair yet they are n't for snow & rain :-LRB- so the hunt was on ! Cheap ones , wide , xtra wide , expensive ones , ones we 'd never heard of - ALL did n't fit ... then , looking thru the WIDE width section of girls shoes on here - I found THESE . Now I had tried a different brand of work boots & they fit terrible & were made even worse , so I worried . I waited days , looked again , 1left in her size 5.5 wide ! I grabbed em ' , I was desperate ! They came today - I was shaking , she was scared yet another would n't fit ... Well Dear Lord she put them on & ran around the house smiling & yelling &#34; I LOVE EM ' &#34; !! She has a EE width , yet these in just wide fit perfect ! I am now looking to buy stock in the company , as I will be buying soooo many pairs in various sizes ! THANK YOU Timberland & Amazon ! Made well , soft leather & the sole is flexible . A great boot -
 buy this one for my girl friend , she like it , feel comfortable whe she wear it . Seem nice as well , maybe i need one for myself .
 Exactly what I ordered and fit great . Im not sure if they are really waterproof , but i bought them to walk on rocks in Afghanistan and they work great for that .
 she loves her boots . . came in excellant conditions and on time . . cheaper than buying them in a store . . will purchase more in the near future

She 's worn them in the rain with her rainsuit , and splashing in puddles when it was n't raining , but the boots kept her feet dry as advertised . And they look adorable on her as well !

 After looking for a long time we were able to find the boots we were looking for . thanks again !!
 ... LOVED his new boots for Christmas . It took a hammer and chisel to get him out of the mirror . Highly recommended .
 I was kind of skeptical of buying off of amazon because i thought they were n't going to be authentic . but sure enough they are the real deal
 I usually wear a 6.5 but they are a little big so I would order a half size down but other than that they 're great .
 My 6 yr old son really loves these boots and wants to wear them every day . He wanted `` work '' boots so he could be like his Daddy . Previously he had a pair of boots with a manmade upper and those did not last too long . He is very hard on footwear , but so far these seem to be holding up well . He even wears them to school on days he does n't have gym .
 I do love my boots however they do run big so keep that in mind when you are purchasing a pair . Mine are too big but being the lazy person I am and knowing I bought them for winter I kept them because I can wear with thicker socks . Another complaint I have is that it took so long for them to ship off the boots like a full week for them to post as shipped . I 'm use to it take two days at most . The shipping issue is why I give it four stars .
 Ordered for himself these shoes . I have a foot on the insole length 25 cm Order size 7C BIG KID was written 24,8 cm When they arrived , they were more inside on the insole , they were 25.5 cm For me , it is sensitive !
 I just ordered these boots for my son and LOVE THEM ! These boots are good quality , rough and tough boots - perfect for the boys . I was told that these boots ran big , so even though my son wears a size 5 , I ordered him a 5 and they fit perfect .
 I bought these for my rowdy 3 year old and he loves them . They are not too heavy and they are also wide enough for his feet .
 These boots worked perfectly for my son . They are very well made . They are a great color . They are a little heavy , but that 's probably because of the sturdy construction . He has worn them several times already . I would recommend these boots .
 We bought these for our 5 year old but our 4 year old wanted the Merrell Chameleon in Wineberry . I have to say the Merrells look more comfortable as they 're not as stiff , have a padded tongue , and fuller padding around the ankle . That all being said , the 5 year old loves these ... because they 're pink . The laces are difficult to tie as they are so slippery and tend to loosen up before you can get a good bow tied , especially for a young one just learning to tie . They are competent boots , which were hard to find for little girls . We used them on short hikes in a state park and they performed acceptably . Can not comment on their waterproofness as we did not tromp through any water . If you have a little princess with her heart set on pink and a need for waffle-stompers , these will work .
 I love them , they came earlier than i thought , so I got to wear a week earlier to a party
 These are really beautifully made boots . I bought them in black for my 12 year old daughter in the Big Kids size 5 and she loves them . Very high quality material and craftsmanship . Exactly what one expects from Timberland products . Best of all , I got them for approximately $ 50 less here on Amazon than what they sell for on the Timberland website . Highly recommended !
 I wear a size 8 in women shoes and a size 7 in big kids.I was told that timberland boots run big so i was wondering where the sizes say 6.5 -LRB- M -RRB- and beyond , is that big kids , toddlers , or walking shoes ?
 I really like these shoes , wearing very comfortable , is slightly larger than the normal code point , but does not affect the wearing comfort .
 came in time my son loved it and excellent quality and true to size i would buy more for him in a different color
 Great product . Great price . Have recommended the boots to friends . My child loves them . The parents of his friends have been asking where I got them .
 i love timbs . They are awesome and beautiful and waterproof and not too heavy . They are the perfect shoe for you
 they were a bit darker than what I expected but they were fine with me.there for a 6yr anyway . . price good
 I like the style , it fits me perfectly and the quality is great . My mom ordered another black pair when she saw mine .
 My son wears these boots he had them for like two months and they still look new and the price was great saved lots of money
 love my boots they got here a day before time ! im very pleased . everywhere else wanted 98 dollars for them but i got them for 48 dollars here ! im super stoked
 Easy ordering process . . Received within expected time frame . Item is as I expected . No complaints . Very pleased with my purchase .
 Purchased for my wife -LRB- she has small feet -RRB- . She really likes them , says they are comfortable and the price was good .
 These are the perfect outside boots for my toddler . She loves them . The price was right and I have no doubt that we 'll get a lot of use out of them - they 're so sturdy that she 'll wear them and then hand them down to her little sister . It 's very hard to find cute , well made boots for a toddler girl and I am so glad we found these ones .
 ... . Terrific fit , great deal and they look good on tiny feet !
 I have twin toddler boys who run all over so I wanted something sturdy and warm for our sloppy winters . I was concerned they 'd be too stiff , but ordered them anyway based on other reviews and because they 're offered in wide sizes -LRB- not common for toddler boots-trust me I 've looked ALL OVER -RRB- . By the time Ifound them , the only color available in their sizes was black , which has actually worked out well . My boys LOVE these and do n't want to wear anything else , so next fall , assuming they 'll have outgrown these , this is all I 'm buying . In addition to all the wonderful qualities everyone else has cited , I am so grateful they make the toddler boots in wide sizes too . One boy is actually an extra wide , so I ordered a half size up-the fit is great , and more to the point , he must be comfortable because he demands I put them on .
 Thanks a lot !!! Good brand , good shoes , I like it very much ! Classic shoes , I recomendate this item to my friends !
 Absolutely love these really cute boots . Bought them as a gift for a friend 's son for Xmas and they look awesome . Sizing was perfect and the price was good as well .
 Our local shoe store stopped carrying childrens shoes because of the economy and big box stores so I was forced to go on line to find quality boot style shoes for my seven year old son -- he absolutely loves them and they fit him well -- he says they will smash anything ! Looks like they are fun too !
 Great boots for children and to keep their feet warm doing the winter months.I love Timberland boots for my son because they 're quality made and durable.Amazon is the cheapest place to get these boots for my son .
 My eight year old received these for Christmas and wears them constantly . They are durable , comfortable and look great ! I did order them in his actual size and found them to be roomy , but with a heavy sock it 's fine . He absolutely adores them !
 I love itBut I did not grasp the sizeSo I give it to my friendsI decided to buy a new one
 Everything was great perfect for my son . Shipping came fast and quality of the shoe was great ! They was a half size to big but thats ok give my son time to grow in them . For perfect fit purchase a half size down .
 I love these boots ... Great pair of boots my 6 year old loves them and so do I ! Good investment : - -RRB-
 No review necessary . They are wheat timbs . The quality n look of these boots from Timberland speak for themselves . : -RRB-
 Shipped very quickly , received in two days . Run slightly big . Heavy-duty high quality . Great boots for boys . Might be able to wear next year , too .
 Even though it seems a bit ridiculous buying children shoes for this kind of price , which is none-the-less , the shoes came in perfect quality and they 're even more adorable than the pictures online . The delivery was quick , and the outside package was undamaged .
 Really happy with the quality of these sturdy kids work-boots with soft uppers and sturdy build , my son just loves them , and I was really pleased too , fast ship too !
 I bought these boots for my son for his birthday . I was very pleasantly surprised when I received them , they are very nice looking . They are really exactly what I was hoping for .
 I looked everywhere for a boot that would hold up and be comfortable for my 8 year old son . He is on the go all the time and does n't stop . I ordered this boot and they are great . He wears them ALL the time . They are holding up well and he says they are very comfortable . They seem to run a bit big so order the size they are in at the time . I almost ordered a half size bigger and I am glad I did n't . He has plenty of room and they should last for some time .
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 Very comfortable . I bought them at a higher price so I 'm mad that they are so cheap now . They were worth the price I paid , so they are definitely worth this price .
 Too bad it 's not leather BUT for the price , I could n't have found a better boot ! I 've paid a lot more on others that have killed my feet after wearing for just an hour or so . I 'd buy another pair if it came in another color !
 I got these at a really good price so I do n't care that they are not really leather . They are cute and just what I needed . They are also comfortable . I bought them in mahogany too .

 We ordered these boots in a size 16 , Amazon was the only company that could deliver the boots in that size . I ordered from four different companies . Thats a whole lot of boot for $ 87 !

Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 These are very cute flats , I ordered them in red . It 's a perfect shade of deep red . They feel true to size , are a bit narrower in the toe area but not too narrow to change sizes . Overall , they are a very cute flat for everyday wear !
 these slippers pretty much fit , i 'm an 8 in street shoes so i ordered this half size bigger -LRB- 8 1/2 -RRB- and they fit perfectly ! they look pretty awesome too !
 I received these the very next day that I ordered them , and got free shipping . They appear to be good quality and look nice . I ordered them for one of my kids after the dance store I ordered all of the shoes from was out of stock in that one size . Unfortunately , I wo n't have the rest of them from the dance store for a week or so , and I had to pay for shipping through them ! Now I wish I ordered all of them from Amazon . Good to know for next time !
 I love Capezio cobra ballet shoe 's fit . The fit is better than Bloch Prolite II leather ballet shoes I bought here in Australia . When they say it 's street shoe size ... it definitely is ! Too bad the seller does n't ship overseas . But good thing my mother-in-law came to visit me so I had Amazon deliver it to her CA address . : -RRB-
 These things wo n't last forever , but they 're a good deal considering the price . They also fitted fine , I normally wear a 7 , and I did n't have any problems with sizing . The only real downfall is that they are lined in white . I have dirty feet and after two hours of dancing the shoes are already showing their age .
 YAY ! I wanted them so bad but after reading the reviews about them being too small i became discouraged , so i decided to go ahead and get some anyway . Im usually a size 8 1/2 in street shoes so I bought a size 12 ballet shoes and they fit like a glove ! the little strings above the toes are adjustable and the split leather soles are great for my roughtness . No I an not a dancer but I love them to prance around the house and they are great for plane travel ! these are the best and i will always buy these .
 I dance in a University company and my shoes were looking a little worn out ; so , I decided to order these for class purposes only . I wear a 7 in street shoe size and ordered a 7 . They did fit in that way . I have a slender foot I suppose , because even after tightening my elastics they were still too wide -LRB- slightly -RRB- . It is still a nice shoe for class and the other elastics i just tie in a knot and wrap around my foot .
 I really like these ballet shoes . They are a little snug , I ordered my actual shoe size -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- and probably could have used a 9 , but they will stretch out with wear . They are comfortable and were a great value !!
 I danced for years as a kid , and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types . They do n't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes , but they hold up a little longer -LRB- and because my toes are on a slant/angle , the shape looks better anyway -RRB- . I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small , but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes . I had to exchange them , and the exchange process was hassle free and quick - had the new shoes within a few days .
 Came on time . They are still good but just a bit small -LRB- some people prefer it more snug -RRB- I 've only been using them for a short while but so far I 'm pretty happy with them .
 I bought it for my girlfriend because it 's her favorite ballet shoe , it 's the second she have , all the same , she does n't change it for others .
 I own a pair of cobras in both leather and in canvas , and I love them both . I mistakenly purchased the leather ones when I first started taking ballet classes , but was very pleased with how long they lasted . My canvas shoes are much more comfortable for everyday practice . Breathable , with some give , I would reccommend these shoes to anyone looking for a good pair of ballet shoes - Even my instructor and all my classmates encourage people to buy them !
 I have wide feet , so the fit could be a little better , but I did order regular sizes ... I wear a 10W-11M , and ordered a 10M and it fit just fine , I ca n't imagine how baggy and slippery anything bigger would be . It 's adjustable with the tiny bow elastic . I wish I would have stain guarded them before wearing , they do pick up everything you are near . my 9 yeah old niece tried to get me to give them to her maybe 30 times , haha . I ordered her her own set for her birthday . Shh ! I 'm pleased . I 'm not a dancer , well not in 15 years anyway , I ordered them for folding up in my purse to have when my high heels get too uncomfortable . They 're gon na be way cuter than any other foldable flats !
 What am I ? Am I a business man who needs appropriate shoes ? Am I an active father who needs comfortable apparel when getting around with my kid ? Am I someone who likes to go out on the town and to dinner in a dressed up casual manner ? The answer is that I am all of the above and these shoes are the greatest things because they allow me to always be who I am . I picked up these shoes because I had heard how comfortable they were and let me just say that they feel like slippers . High quality shoes can not be underestimated as you ca n't put a price on comfort . What I really love most about these shoes is that they look great . I 'm not into the flashy foot scene for men . I like a nice , normal looking conservative shoe without the tassles and strange seams that run across the toes , or wing tips ... . just not my style . But have you noticed that most of men 's shoes are a bit over the top and too fancy ? I like a nice black polished look -LRB- but not too shiny , subtle is the key -RRB- and these shoes are perfect for me . They look great in a suit , they look great with jeans . They are n't heavy and wo n't weigh you down at all , but they are strong enough to withstand the rain or a day at the park . They do n't squeek in the hallways at work , so I do n't distract co-workers . Anyway , I just love these shoes . I have had them for awhile and they show no signs of wear and tear . They are my favorite things that I own excpet for my Guinness Stout hoodie ... which these also go great with . 200 stars for these -LRB- 100 stars for each shoe . -RRB- Oh , you got ta wear these .
 I 've had several pairs of ECCO shoes , and I can not recommend them highly enough . They are extremely comfortable , and I think they look great to boot . I wear these shoes constantly , and they last a very long time . For the price , you ca n't beat them for their combination of quality , durability , and style .
 American wear sneakers everywhere . In some cases it is a fashion statement , but I suspect it is mostly because they are light and supremely comfortable.If you travel to Europe , you find that very few Europeans wear sneakers . They mostly wear shoes like this . I always used to wonder why they were willing to sacrifice comfort for conventional style . I used to put it down to stuffy tradition.That is , until I purchased a pair of these ECCO 's . They are literally dress sneakers . Now I know why Europeans wear shoes like this . They are as light and comfortable as a pair of sneakers , but can be worn practically anywhere.They are not ultra-smart dress shoes , but are entirely suitable for daily office job wear and for most day or evening functions . They are also quite comfortable enough to be worn around town or for long foot commutes . Remember , those Europeans also do n't use cars as much as Americans . They walk more.They are also tough . I am on my second pair . The first was worn several days a week for a few years . For someone who is accustomed to conventional leather shoes , it is difficult to convey just how good and comfortable these ECCOs are . you have to try them .
 Whoever at Ecco that decided to discontinue this shoe should be fired along with the ones that decided to move operations to China .
 I 've been searching everywhere for a `` plain '' shoe without too many `` lines '' on it as well as with a rubber sole . I came across a pair of black ones -LRB- or red ? -RRB- and bought them but could n't find the other color . I was very happy when I found them on Amazon . The shoe looks great and I use it at work -LRB- business casual -RRB- or when going out/dates/events . It is VERY comfortable . The only minor downside is that it is slightly expensive - when I ordered it , it was around $ 150 . If it was $ 100 I would definitely give it the fifth star . Still , it is worth it - it is the most comfortable non sports shoes I ever had .
 Not best for running but look very cool . comfortable enough to wear for style
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .
 Love this shoe , I purchased my 1st pair -LRB- pink -RRB- with another seller at full price . Was looking for others in a different colors when I found these . Bought them in all the shades -LRB- orange , black and natural -RRB- . I wear them at work with no problems , all the girls are asking me where I got them ... so you better buy them soon ! Love Ann Klein and Amazon !
 I would recommend AK Anne Klein Wedge Heel Shoes to all my family & friends . I love the color -LRB- orange -RRB- . There very comfortable and they can also be wore dress up or casual . I ca n't wait til the weather change so i can wear my shoes , i like bright color .
 This is the sexiest pair of shoes I ever had . They are comfortable and soft .
 I purchased this shoe in black and it 's gorgeous . It goes well with skirts and jeans . I absolutely love them .
 the shoe offered w/the color white/blue/red is the asics gel-tiger paw , but the white/blue/lightning colored one is the asics gel-ds racer VI i do n't know may want to check it out but this is a great shoe -LRB- both of them -RRB-
 Great Product . . Good for summer ... Just what I expected ... However , the size was huge . I 'd suggest buying it a half size smaller than you need .

 They were very comfy and to get them use your naturall shoe size unless ur toes are a lil long . My toes are pretty tiny so i got away with a 6.5 shoe haha ! for turns on the dance floor they are nice and the white is a very crisp cute color !
 i love the flexibility and grip these shoes havetheyr just wonderful theyr also very comfortablebut the best part is once im done with these i move on to my pointe
 it is great for beginners like me they work well just need to make sure you get the right size

 I really like these ballet shoes . They are a little snug , I ordered my actual shoe size -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- and probably could have used a 9 , but they will stretch out with wear . They are comfortable and were a great value !!
 it is great for beginners like me they work well just need to make sure you get the right size
 I danced for years as a kid , and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types . They do n't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes , but they hold up a little longer -LRB- and because my toes are on a slant/angle , the shape looks better anyway -RRB- . I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small , but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes . I had to exchange them , and the exchange process was hassle free and quick - had the new shoes within a few days .
 Came on time . They are still good but just a bit small -LRB- some people prefer it more snug -RRB- I 've only been using them for a short while but so far I 'm pretty happy with them .
 I bought it for my girlfriend because it 's her favorite ballet shoe , it 's the second she have , all the same , she does n't change it for others .
 I own a pair of cobras in both leather and in canvas , and I love them both . I mistakenly purchased the leather ones when I first started taking ballet classes , but was very pleased with how long they lasted . My canvas shoes are much more comfortable for everyday practice . Breathable , with some give , I would reccommend these shoes to anyone looking for a good pair of ballet shoes - Even my instructor and all my classmates encourage people to buy them !
 the shoe offered w/the color white/blue/red is the asics gel-tiger paw , but the white/blue/lightning colored one is the asics gel-ds racer VI i do n't know may want to check it out but this is a great shoe -LRB- both of them -RRB-
 I 've never bought track shoes before and this certainly wo n't be my last pair . They make you feel faster and more responsive on the track , and for the price and quality buying these shoes was a no-brainer . I think a 1/2 size larger would be more comfortable .
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 Great shoes . Just as promised . I recommend this seller .
 I have another pair for outside , cold . I want another one of these for in and out of car and office and home visits for winters in Minnesota . They are boots , not too warm in the car , office , or people 's homes , but with pants look more like a shoe and less like a boot ! I 'm buying another pair .
 These are great because they run wide - that 's hard to find . Slight heel , but not uncomfortable , even when walking a lot .
 These golf shoes are the sharpest I 've seen -- and according to hubby -- the most comfortable ! The style is very eye-catching as I bought the white with orange . He reports they are light and have great arch support . I think he will request HI-TEC from now on !!
 We ordered these boots in a size 16 , Amazon was the only company that could deliver the boots in that size . I ordered from four different companies . Thats a whole lot of boot for $ 87 !
 I dance in a University company and my shoes were looking a little worn out ; so , I decided to order these for class purposes only . I wear a 7 in street shoe size and ordered a 7 . They did fit in that way . I have a slender foot I suppose , because even after tightening my elastics they were still too wide -LRB- slightly -RRB- . It is still a nice shoe for class and the other elastics i just tie in a knot and wrap around my foot .

 They were very comfy and to get them use your naturall shoe size unless ur toes are a lil long . My toes are pretty tiny so i got away with a 6.5 shoe haha ! for turns on the dance floor they are nice and the white is a very crisp cute color !
 i love the flexibility and grip these shoes havetheyr just wonderful theyr also very comfortablebut the best part is once im done with these i move on to my pointe

 I have wide feet , so the fit could be a little better , but I did order regular sizes ... I wear a 10W-11M , and ordered a 10M and it fit just fine , I ca n't imagine how baggy and slippery anything bigger would be . It 's adjustable with the tiny bow elastic . I wish I would have stain guarded them before wearing , they do pick up everything you are near . my 9 yeah old niece tried to get me to give them to her maybe 30 times , haha . I ordered her her own set for her birthday . Shh ! I 'm pleased . I 'm not a dancer , well not in 15 years anyway , I ordered them for folding up in my purse to have when my high heels get too uncomfortable . They 're gon na be way cuter than any other foldable flats !
 these slippers pretty much fit , i 'm an 8 in street shoes so i ordered this half size bigger -LRB- 8 1/2 -RRB- and they fit perfectly ! they look pretty awesome too !
 I received these the very next day that I ordered them , and got free shipping . They appear to be good quality and look nice . I ordered them for one of my kids after the dance store I ordered all of the shoes from was out of stock in that one size . Unfortunately , I wo n't have the rest of them from the dance store for a week or so , and I had to pay for shipping through them ! Now I wish I ordered all of them from Amazon . Good to know for next time !
 I love Capezio cobra ballet shoe 's fit . The fit is better than Bloch Prolite II leather ballet shoes I bought here in Australia . When they say it 's street shoe size ... it definitely is ! Too bad the seller does n't ship overseas . But good thing my mother-in-law came to visit me so I had Amazon deliver it to her CA address . : -RRB-
 These things wo n't last forever , but they 're a good deal considering the price . They also fitted fine , I normally wear a 7 , and I did n't have any problems with sizing . The only real downfall is that they are lined in white . I have dirty feet and after two hours of dancing the shoes are already showing their age .
 YAY ! I wanted them so bad but after reading the reviews about them being too small i became discouraged , so i decided to go ahead and get some anyway . Im usually a size 8 1/2 in street shoes so I bought a size 12 ballet shoes and they fit like a glove ! the little strings above the toes are adjustable and the split leather soles are great for my roughtness . No I an not a dancer but I love them to prance around the house and they are great for plane travel ! these are the best and i will always buy these .

 I have had these shoes for 2 months , not a problem noted , seamless design , to spots for irritation , and I have not had any problems with sqeaking .

 These sandals will go great with various styles of pants and skirts which makes them very versatile . I also love the bronze color , it looks great in the summer . Also , although they are technically high heels they are very comfortable and do n't seem too high due to the slight platform in the front .
 I have n't put a mile on these yet , but they fit well and have sufficient room for my orthotics . I am 6 ' 5 '' , 230lbs and try to wear shoes that will support my frame , these will . These are not as comfortable as a walking athletic shoe or a running shoe . I plan to update this review after I have put some miles on these shoes .
 I have narrow feet and it 's difficult to find shoes in my size . These were size 13 B and fit fine and are good walking shoes .
 These are terrific sneakers . They look great and have very sharp colors that make a statement . They are very comfortable , lightweight , and durable . The cushioning is great as well . They are great for running and for walking as they provide great traction and stability . I wear these with shorts or with jeans .
 Comfy shoes and they look good with almost all types of pants especially jeans . They can get dirty so take care not to get them wet . The suede does n't do very well being wet . For more arch support get an insert but I did n't have any problem with it .
 These shoes certainly feel and fit like a glove . You dont need breaking them in . The first time you try them is as good as they 'll feel a month later . Easy to wear , easy to wash , easy to match .
 I order this shoes for my husband , he was amazed , they are so comfortable and light , he said it feels like walking on air.Great product , fast delivery .
 product delivered as expected . nice shoe , comfortable and attractive looking.are they gon na last 10 yrs ? no . I did get what I was expecting and they are what I was looking for .
 Bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them . Nice that two sets of laces were included so you switch out based on your personal preference . Lowest price we found too . I made him an Amazon fan with the price !
 Saucony have always been excellent shoes and those I purchased did not disappoint . The shoes were shipped to me in great condition .
 Son muy c&oacute;modas , livianas y en este momento las llevo puestas . son todo lo que esperaba de estas Saucony Jazz .
 These are one of the best pairs of shoes I 've ever owned . They can take a real beating . They 're super light , breathable , they look great , and are very comfortable even after VERY long walks . The proof ? I 'll begin by saying that I sealed them with waterproofing spray , which I used to protect the suede . I walk to class in the rain in them , do sports in them , and I hiked in them to Rainbow Falls -LRB- 5 hour hike , long story ... -RRB- . Sharp rocks , lots of mud , falling into water , falling into ditches ... and my feet were hardly sore . When I got back , I wiped them down with a wet towel and they came out BRAND NEW and wore them out that night to dinner . I 'm not saying that you should hike in them , because the rocks will definitely hurt and these are not at all designed for hiking . I 'm just proving a point , and that is that these shoes can survive brutality .
 I love these sneakers ... stylish , comfy and easy to take care of . I 've bought these in two different colors and am looking to buy more .
 i admit to being a little skeptical when i first saw my 20-something son in his saucony 's . `` you should try them dad , they feel like you 're wearing slippers . '' as it turned out , i actually was looking for an alternative to wearing white athletic shoes with jeans . that look reminded me too much of seinfeld and i wanted a fashion sneaker instead . so i bought the saucony jazz in brown and it was one of the most comfortable shoes i have worn . since that purchase i have had foot surgery and found that my sauconys were the only shoes i could wear while recovering . unfortunately , the brown color was not universal with much of my wardrobe so i ordered a second pair in black . just as happy with them except that the weather here just got warm enough to wear shorts and i needed something more appropriate for that . my third pair of sauconys arrived today and i am now set for all occasions of foot comfort . at the gym , on my bike , at work , in church or just hanging around , i think i 'm covered.i do n't think i would advocate this shoe to run in because it seems a b
 I have nothing but wonderful things to say about these shoes . The are lightweight , well constructed , and look great . I bought a pair about two and a half years ago , wore them almost every single day , and they were still in usable shape when I decided to buy another pair . The are also the most comfortable shoes I haven ever worn . I love the vintage design -LRB- I was told they are remakes from the 70 's -RRB- and they look good enough to be worn in even semi-formal occasions -LRB- your opinion may vary , I think black Chucks can be used as dress shoes -RRB- . I have the brown and tan version and I plan to buy another pair or two in different colors , just to change up my wardrobe . With a price tag around $ 50 these shoes ca n't be beat . I know I 'm going off here , but I really love these shoes .
 I had a pair of Saucony Jazz sneakers a few years back and always had trouble finding them in size 14 until I turned to amazon . This shoe is classic and feels a little more `` exclusive '' because the brand is n't as recognizable as Nike or Reebok throwback type shoes . They fit great , and are reasonable priced so buying a new pair each season or multiple colors does n't seem unreasonable . The shoe arrived with a short navy blue accent lace and a standard white . I went with the all white and they look great .
 My 11 yr . old son will ONLY wear these sneaks . They are comfy and wide for his big feet .
 I 'm quite happy with this purchase . I was n't really expecting such a good quality by the price I was paying . I 'm not saying that these are the best sneakers on Earth , but I would strongly recommend them for someone looking for a very comfortable shoe at a moderate price , which can be used either as a casual shoe or as a running one.As a casual runner , I like to feel like if I was walking all the time on grass ; and this is what I get with these shoes . They 're very flexible , so probably they will fit any foot shape . They 're quite light so you do n't feel any extra weight . And the footbed is very well cushioned so that you get the impression that you could jump out of the building anytime . They seem very compact and durable , and so far I have n't had any trouble with them.On the minus side , the only things I can complain about is that they tend to get dirty -LRB- if you use them in the mountain ! as long as you stick to the road like the usual pedestrian , no worries ! # and they are a little bit hot . They do n't transpire so much #obviously because of the materials it 's made of -RRB- , so I would n't recommend them for usual running
 I bought some women 's jazz 10 years ago and I still wear them , but these shoes are wider since they are men 's . These shoes have better gripping and traction , but thinner soles overall . They are very comfortable and easy to slip on and off , but the liner is not glued down inside the shoe . They are good looking , I am satisfied , and I would most likely buy them again .
 great shipping and great product ! i love my shoes and they were exactly what i ordered at a great price .
 Used them for years they give me a bounce to my step for my spring walks .
 great shoes light and durable i often wear them to work and walking back and forth 1.5 miles to get there and no fatigue or anything great looking too
 In the past 25 years I have purchased over 20 pairs of Saucony Jazz . I use them for recreational running and casual wear.Periodically I try on a competitor 's shoe on one foot and keep the Jazz on the other . Invariably there is no comparison and I return to Saucony.The cost remains competitive , the style has become appealingly retro but I return for the comfort comfort comfort ...
 Nice shoes much thinner material than I 'd anticipated but woah very comfortable and look nice thanq for everything saucony < 3
 Look good and are very comfortable . No complaints with the shoes what so ever and now I 'm looking to add more colors to my collection
 These sneakers are quite comfortable and light . Good sneakers , good price . They come with two pairs of laced which is nice .
 I purchased these shoes on sale so they were a great buy and I really like them so far . They have great traction and are breathable making them a great warm weather shoe . The only downside is that the top is really thin so if they get wet or it is cold out it comes right through the top .
 My First Saucony ever is very comfortable , and great to walk in , it looks great and stylish too . Great design at very good price .
 I bought these shoes based on the Amazon Reviews and I was n't disappointed . I am a big guy and I wear a size 14 Shoe . I tried many pairs and sizes of Nike , New Balance , and Propet -- all uncomfortable and disappointing for a variety of reasons.These Saucony shoes are really great !!! Very light and comfortable right out of the box -- I was able to put them on and immediately run a 2.5 mile course -- smiling all the way . In short these are absolutely OUTSTANDING SHOES and a GREAT VALUE . From now on , I will be looking to Saucony on Amazon for all my athletic shoe needs . Very happy .
 These shoes arrived 3 days before the eta . They were totally comfortable when I tried them on . Fit like a glove . I 've only had them for a couple hours but right now I want to buy another pair . By the way I 'm a diabetic electrician and comfortable shoes are very important .
 I recently bought these shoes for casual wear . They go well with shorts and jeans , and the low profile sits comfortably below my ankles . Last year , I had surgery to suture my ruptured Achilles tendon so I am very very cautious and picky of what goes on my feet . These are very comfortable and have adequate padding and shock absorption for casual wear and walking . I can not run in these shoes due to the lack of support . I chose the tan color to avoid white shoes from getting smudged and discolored quickly . Overall , I rate these better than Pumas and Adidas . Missing 1 star due to quality may be a little to brittle for my taste .
 Once upon a time a young man and his friend were browsing in a Dick 's Sporting goods store . This was , perhaps , eight or nine years into the past . While perusing the merchandise a couple sets of shoes were noticed that were on `` clearance '' . They happened to be the Saucony Jazz Originals in all black with white floor trim . The young man and his friend each purchased a pair of these sole lovers . As the years passed the young man grew in wisdom and stature , but his choice of foot apparel remained constant . Every two years he purchases a new pair of Saucony Jazz Low Pros to replace the old . Then , taking the `` back-up '' pair out of the closet -LRB- who were ever so gracefully awaiting their chance to be pounded on the ground -RRB- he places them as his primary and places the new pair into the closet to be worn gently for a couple years until they become the young mans sole savior .
 These shoes have been cool kid shoes since the nineties . Sure , the company strategically targeted the youth market back then , but that 's why Vans became cool too , and Converse , and all the other brands that people think makes them counter-culture . It 's a gimmick , but if the product is good , why not increase market share?Bottom line
 I dumped all my coins into a CoinStar machine at the grocery store , and instead of losing the 9 % or whatever it is for getting cash back , I chose Amazon credit . I searched all through Amazon looking for something I wanted that was less than the amount from my coins , and I settled on these Sauconys , because I had a pair like them years ago that I really liked.I have no complaints about these shoes . I do not use them for running , basketball , mountain climbing , or anything like that . They are just my perfect day-to-day sneakers for hanging out in . They came with two pair of laces , black and white , which was a nice bonus . I chose black laces with a sort of gangster-weave lacing pattern that I prefer , and they slip on nicely , fit nicely , feel good , and look stylish in my opinion . I have n't tried myself , but for the hippie students out there , I would bet that these are some excellent hacky-sacking shoes.They are just the best . Nothing more to say .
 Great shoes that fit well and are very comfy . They do not hit my ankle when I walk . They do n't have a lot of padding like a running or walking shoe , yet are very comfortable on a walk . I have worn them on a 5 mile fitness walk and they were good . I also have bunions and they do not have straps that hurt my feet like some shoes . I usually wear them for casual wear with pants .
 I know how cool looking these shoes are , but if you 're under 30 then keep looking ... This shoe belongs to my generation and if ya 'll start wearing them they will stop being sooo damn cool ...
 el art&iacute;culo lleg&oacute; sin ning&uacute;n inconveniente y r&aacute;pido m&aacute;s que todo les recomiendo a todos las compras a esta tienda , muy serios ...
 My foot is 10.5 &#34; long and rather wide . I wear a size 10.5 in these and they fit great . I like the the wide and somewhat flat sole the Low Pros have . The shoes are soft and comfortable . Not as cool as my Tiger Ulitmates -LRB- size 10 -RRB- but those really are for people with normal -LRB- narrow -RRB- feet .
 I have another pair of these just like these only a different color that were getting old so I knew what to expect and what size to order . They fit well , were shipped on time and were in brand new condition . Not much more to add than that . ; -RRB-
 Great product , soft and light weight . My girl has a pair in blue and used to tease me about getting one for my self , now i got my own . I would definitely get another pair .
 Love these shoes . They are comfortable to walk around in all day -LRB- I walk ~ 2-3 miles each day around campus -RRB- , look stylish , and come in a bunch of different colors . I am planning on buying another pair soon to go with some of my other outfits .
 I replaced my origional Saucony thick soled shoes with these low pro shoes and wore them to work where I 'm on my feet for most of a 12 hour shift . I was concerned with how comfy they would be and although the thicker soled originals have more squish to them these are surprisingly comfy as well . It 's a firmer feel and my feet felt great at the end of shift .
 these are & have always been great shoes , they are super light , comfy & hold up very well even after 3 or so washes . i have always found myself rebuying these shoes pair after pair . many different colors to choose from as well .
 Great shoe at a great price ! Very lightweight , almost as light as Nike Free line , but for a fraction of the price and with retro styling . Ca n't wait to wear these ! Prime shipping got them to me really quick - recommended !!
 The Saucony Originals Men 's Low Pro Sneaker is an affordable , stylish-retro , everyday casual shoe comparable to New Balance Classics and more comfortable than Asics Onitsuka Tigers Ultimate 81s . The Dark Grey pictured is slightly bluish and lighter when in person , but no less attractive . Be mindful though that the suede leather can easily tear and the nylon can fray , however if taken care of these shoes will last you a good while tread-wise and they are so affordable that you can buy 2 pairs for the price of one New Balance or Asics !
 These are just about the only kind of every day shoe my husband will buy any more ! He has a wide foot and also can just tear through a shoe ! These shoes last and are very comfortable ! I also like the way they look . The price is right here at Amazon !
 They are as Comfortable as can be . Wear them everyday , and they looks fantastic . Looking to get another pair in a different color .
 They shipped fast and were packaged acceptably . I ordered a men 's 7 as they were on sale , but was worried that the men 's shoe would be too wide . I 'm pleased to say that was a baseless worry . The fit is perfect . Ladies , feel free to pick up any pair of Men 's Jazz Low Pros . They will fit . You just have to remember to buy two -LRB- maybe 2.5 -RRB- sizes down from your regular size . For example , I wear a 9/9 .5 in women 's and the men 's 7 has fit like a dream.As will all Saucony sneakers in this line , they are the most comfortable pair of shoes I own . These are my go to , errand running , tooling about town shoes . They are breathable , comfortable , stylish , timeless ... I 'm running out of adjectives . They go with jeans , casual slacks and shorts . I 've seen a few people wearing with them with skirts , but that is n't my style . Looks good on them though . A little care and you will wear these for years . My last pair gave out after 5 . If you have never owned a pair of Saucony 's think retro New Balance but better looking . These will also work as a minimalist running/walking shoe . The sole goes from about -LRB- eyeball measurement -RRB- a 1/2 inch at the heel to 1/4 inch at the toe .
 These shoes are great ! They are my second pair of Saucony 's . My first pair lasted me ten years . I have high hopes for these shoes .
 These are my favorite shoes ! I 'm wearing them today ... like 6 months after purchasing them . They did split the first week I got them , just a little 1/2 inch or so on the inside front . Not sure why , it seemed to just split from normal wear . Nothing else has happened since other than normal usage . They are very very comfy and I love the style . The shoe guy at the mall asked if I liked them because he wants to start carrying them at his store in the mall . Hopefully he does , but I 'll probably still buy them here because they 'll be 20-30 bucks cheaper .
 Had a pair of these about 6 years ago and they were my favorite pair of shoes . Ordered a new pair and again I was very satisfied . The shoe is comfortable and I wear them practically anywhere . Love them !
 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo . I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box . They feel like I already broke them in . These are going to be great for pants or skirts . I 'm very happy with them .
 I soooo love these boots . . the colour is great , different than any I ever had . They are also so very comfortable , even the first time I wore them . the leather did not need time to break like other boots . I love them , the colour , the feel and the height is just right !!
 I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot , the color , the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort . I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores .
 Super comfy boots from day 1 ! NO break-in time which is an added bonus . I 've had many compliments on them . They DO run true-to size . Shipping was faster than predicted : -RRB-
 Absolutely beautiful boot and ca n't wait to wear them . We do n't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can . Sorry I ca n't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport , I doubt I will be disappointed .

 these slippers pretty much fit , i 'm an 8 in street shoes so i ordered this half size bigger -LRB- 8 1/2 -RRB- and they fit perfectly ! they look pretty awesome too !
 I received these the very next day that I ordered them , and got free shipping . They appear to be good quality and look nice . I ordered them for one of my kids after the dance store I ordered all of the shoes from was out of stock in that one size . Unfortunately , I wo n't have the rest of them from the dance store for a week or so , and I had to pay for shipping through them ! Now I wish I ordered all of them from Amazon . Good to know for next time !
 I love Capezio cobra ballet shoe 's fit . The fit is better than Bloch Prolite II leather ballet shoes I bought here in Australia . When they say it 's street shoe size ... it definitely is ! Too bad the seller does n't ship overseas . But good thing my mother-in-law came to visit me so I had Amazon deliver it to her CA address . : -RRB-
 These things wo n't last forever , but they 're a good deal considering the price . They also fitted fine , I normally wear a 7 , and I did n't have any problems with sizing . The only real downfall is that they are lined in white . I have dirty feet and after two hours of dancing the shoes are already showing their age .
 YAY ! I wanted them so bad but after reading the reviews about them being too small i became discouraged , so i decided to go ahead and get some anyway . Im usually a size 8 1/2 in street shoes so I bought a size 12 ballet shoes and they fit like a glove ! the little strings above the toes are adjustable and the split leather soles are great for my roughtness . No I an not a dancer but I love them to prance around the house and they are great for plane travel ! these are the best and i will always buy these .
 I dance in a University company and my shoes were looking a little worn out ; so , I decided to order these for class purposes only . I wear a 7 in street shoe size and ordered a 7 . They did fit in that way . I have a slender foot I suppose , because even after tightening my elastics they were still too wide -LRB- slightly -RRB- . It is still a nice shoe for class and the other elastics i just tie in a knot and wrap around my foot .
 I really like these ballet shoes . They are a little snug , I ordered my actual shoe size -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- and probably could have used a 9 , but they will stretch out with wear . They are comfortable and were a great value !!
 I danced for years as a kid , and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types . They do n't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes , but they hold up a little longer -LRB- and because my toes are on a slant/angle , the shape looks better anyway -RRB- . I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small , but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes . I had to exchange them , and the exchange process was hassle free and quick - had the new shoes within a few days .
 Came on time . They are still good but just a bit small -LRB- some people prefer it more snug -RRB- I 've only been using them for a short while but so far I 'm pretty happy with them .
 I bought it for my girlfriend because it 's her favorite ballet shoe , it 's the second she have , all the same , she does n't change it for others .
 I own a pair of cobras in both leather and in canvas , and I love them both . I mistakenly purchased the leather ones when I first started taking ballet classes , but was very pleased with how long they lasted . My canvas shoes are much more comfortable for everyday practice . Breathable , with some give , I would reccommend these shoes to anyone looking for a good pair of ballet shoes - Even my instructor and all my classmates encourage people to buy them !
 I have wide feet , so the fit could be a little better , but I did order regular sizes ... I wear a 10W-11M , and ordered a 10M and it fit just fine , I ca n't imagine how baggy and slippery anything bigger would be . It 's adjustable with the tiny bow elastic . I wish I would have stain guarded them before wearing , they do pick up everything you are near . my 9 yeah old niece tried to get me to give them to her maybe 30 times , haha . I ordered her her own set for her birthday . Shh ! I 'm pleased . I 'm not a dancer , well not in 15 years anyway , I ordered them for folding up in my purse to have when my high heels get too uncomfortable . They 're gon na be way cuter than any other foldable flats !

 These golf shoes are the sharpest I 've seen -- and according to hubby -- the most comfortable ! The style is very eye-catching as I bought the white with orange . He reports they are light and have great arch support . I think he will request HI-TEC from now on !!

 it is great for beginners like me they work well just need to make sure you get the right size

 I love the Adi Racer models , this one in particular is very comfortable and has a great color , but the front end being suede does n't help to keep it clean for a long time , I suggest to send the shoe to a dryer shop for cleaning .
 I ca n't say enough good things about this shoe . These are the only shoes that I did n't have to replace the insole with superfeet . The arch support is just perfect ! Very COMFORTABLE ! I wear these shoes everywhere ! I 've used them trail riding my horse ; working on our ranch and just running errands . I 'm still wearing them a year later , they hold up really good .

 just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo . I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box . They feel like I already broke them in . These are going to be great for pants or skirts . I 'm very happy with them .
 I soooo love these boots . . the colour is great , different than any I ever had . They are also so very comfortable , even the first time I wore them . the leather did not need time to break like other boots . I love them , the colour , the feel and the height is just right !!
 I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot , the color , the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort . I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores .
 Super comfy boots from day 1 ! NO break-in time which is an added bonus . I 've had many compliments on them . They DO run true-to size . Shipping was faster than predicted : -RRB-
 Absolutely beautiful boot and ca n't wait to wear them . We do n't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can . Sorry I ca n't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport , I doubt I will be disappointed .

 Absolutely beautiful boot and ca n't wait to wear them . We do n't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can . Sorry I ca n't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport , I doubt I will be disappointed .
 I bought the white canvas toddler shoe for my 20 month old daughter about a month ago . We love them ! Easy to clean and looks great with every outfit .
 These shoes are great . They go with everything and are easyto clean off when they get dirty .
 They are nice shoes and of course they go with everything which is why I bought them . I would recommened them .
 the sandals are very comforatble and you cant beat that price , i would defintely invest in these sandals .

 I 've worn many brands of boots , some good -LRB- Durango , Rocky -RRB- , some bad -LRB- Red Wing , Iron Age -RRB- , and some REALLY bad -LRB- Laredo , Guide Gear -RRB- . Double-H is the BEST , by far.How do I love thee ? Let me count the ways : Made in USASolid construction with durable stitchingTough yet supple oil leather that does n't require polishingRugged and grippy outsolesAnd best of all , roomy EEE extra-wide sizes available!I used to like my Durangos , but Double-H blows 'em away . I just got these last week and they were comfortable right out of the box with no `` break-in '' period ! That is almost unheard of . These are outstanding boots and I 'm wearing them right now ... and will continue to wear them every day until I need a new pair .
 just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo . I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box . They feel like I already broke them in . These are going to be great for pants or skirts . I 'm very happy with them .
 I soooo love these boots . . the colour is great , different than any I ever had . They are also so very comfortable , even the first time I wore them . the leather did not need time to break like other boots . I love them , the colour , the feel and the height is just right !!

 These are very comfortable and I get compliments every time I wear them . Size seems to be true . I love them
 They are very comfortable for long periods of time . And super interesting in style and color .

 Item Shipped Quick Packaged Good Shoes Are Comfortable And They Look Good I 'd Buy From Seller Again And I 'd Refer Seller To Friends A+A+A + + + +
 I just love these shoes . I like the way they look . I have worn them in a casual sense and I do get curious looks here and there . I recommend using them without thick socks .
 Bought these for my son who is a law enforcement officer , he really likes them .
 I purchase these boots for out local Sheriff Dept. . They are great and last a long time . We will continue with Original Swat .
 In a 15 year career , and several pairs of boots , these are by far the most comfortable , reasonably priced and durable boots that I have owned .
 I bought a pair for me and my granddaughter . They are really nice and warm . Great for the snow season .
 I purchased these on a whim -- and everywhere I 've worn them , I get compliments ! The `` stones '' are plastic with the large one tacked -LRB- 2 stitches holding it -RRB- on as well as glued . They 're very thin soled , and I do n't anticipate getting more than 2 summers wear out of them , but I paid very little for them and ca n't complain . They 're fun to wear with jeans , capris , and shorts . Maybe Amazon will have them again and then I 'll order a `` spare pair '' !
 I love these shoes . I use them mostly in the spring and summer and ALWAYS get compliments . They are unique but work with many outfits . I gave it 4 stars because while they are not uncomfortable they are still heels and I ca n't wear them if I am going to be standing a long time .
 Bought these for a friend who lives in Belgrade , Serbia , and works outside during the winter . Her report is they are well made and are standing up , so far , to the tough wear and tear that she is putting them through . They are warm in deep snow and are comfortable with even the thickest socks . The light color is easy to clean because of the finish on the exterior ; dirt and grime just wash away with mild soap and a little scrubbing with a soft brush . Sturdy , warm boot with excellent workmanship .
 I bought a pair of these for my `` bam-bam '' who unfortunately has `` Barney Rubble feet '' like his Grandpa which are very wide accompanied by a high arch -LRB- the best of both worlds , right ? -RRB- I 've worn Hi-Tecs before in fire/rescue work and was familiar w / the brand , but had never purchased any of their kids stuff , especially sandals . I should have known better because these are absolutely PERFECT for the hard to fit tall/wide footed kids who would rather go barefoot because most shoes are too uncomfortable for them . The velcro closures give incredible flexibility w / or w/o socks and the soles are durable and non-slip . As far as `` comfortability '' goes , he would n't take them off , if that tells you anything .
 These are the most comfortable shoes that I have ever had . They are also extremely stylish . They come with a generous fit , are very light , and are also high quality .
 GREAT SIMPLE BUT RICH LOOKING SHOE . ORGINALLY ORDERED 11 EVEN THOUGH MY HUSBANDS SIZE IS 10.5 HAD TO RETURN AND THE SELLER WAS GOOD IN EXCHANGING . GREAT PRICE DO N'T HOLD BACK ORDER NOW ! MY HUSBAND LOVES BOSTONIAN GOOD QUALITY SHOES .
 This was a Christmas present and my husband really likes them . They are light weight yet still good for taking the dog out for a quick morning walk .
 These are great shoes for the man with extra wide feet . Warm and comfy , plus with the rubber sole it 's great to go out to get the paper .
 My adult son has been asking for slippers to fit his Size 13 , 4E feet for several years and I have n't been able to find any wide enough . I ordered these this year and gave then to him for Christmas . He says they fit perfectly and feel amazing on his feet . I 'm going to order another pair to have here for him when he visits . I am thrilled with the quality and overall ease it was in ordering from this vendor . Thanks !
 I couldnt be more happy with my product!really comfortable slippers and THE SHIPMENT WAS AMAZING ! -LRB- within two days ! -RRB- FOR FREE !
 I was very happy the day I got them . We have tile floors so having something to slip on for around the house is great . With a shoe like bottom , they are great for a quick trip to the grocery store . They look alike moccasins so you do n't feel like you just went out the door in your slippers .
 Prices on comfortable slippers that are well constructed have gone up over the years . I purchased these men 's slippers because I was able to determine that they were built to last , I could go out front for a limited amount of wear and importantly , offered at an attractive price.Jay Adler
 I purchased the slippers last year and they have held up very well . They are comfortable and I wear them all the time even outside . They are well made and I think it will last a long time .
 My husband is very particular about his slippers . We found most mall stores do not carry men 's slippers unless it is the Holiday season . I researched men 's slippers on the web and - shazaam , I found the Tamarac Suede Moccasin Slipper . I was looking for a size 12 - they came in 11 or 13 , so I chose 13 and they fit great . My husband used the cord to tighten up a bit . He says they are very comfortable and sturdy with excellent sole .
 I have been very pleased with my slippers . They are easy to step into and have been very durable . Not one negative comment .
 The slippers shipped quickly and were just as described . They fit my boyfriend very well and are comfortable . He 's is not a `` slipper person '' but likes these because they are more moccasin-style than slipper-style . I am very please with the purchase !
 These slipper shoes seems true to size , and they look quite good once the lace is darkened with a permanent magic marker ; otherwise there is too much contrast and they look cheap . Once the laces are darkened , they look good .
 My husband bought this houseshoes because he needed some new ones . He 's has commented several times on how comfortable they are .
 These moccasin 's are very nice , fit true to size ... If you wear a wide width , they are a true wide . A well built moccasin and very comfortable .
 The shoes seem to run a bit wider than expected . I 'm glad I didnt ' order wide since D width seems quiet wide as it is . Nice product !
 Shoes were as specified ; I liked them so much I kept them and got my relative a different present ...
 Shearling is cushier and the laces are thin & patently pseudo rawhide . Nonetheless these slippers are comfortable , light weight and good looking . If they only last a couple of years and need a spenco insert for better padding , they are still a bargain . Would -LRB- will -RRB- buy again anytime .
 I have purchased many pairs of slippers and these are by far the nicest . I have paid much more for a lot less quality . The shipping was prompt all in all it was a very easy transaction .
 The slippers are great ! They do seem to be on the large side of a 15 . My husband had to put paper in the toes . He wears 15 in every thing else .
 I 've had them for over a month now and I wear them every day both in the house and outside .
 My husband , George , loves his new slippers . They are very comfotable and he wears them all day around the house . Amazon.com is the best company on the internet to deal with . They let you know how your order is developing and it always arrives on or before the day it is due . I had to make a return once and they made it so easy . Keep up the good work !!!
 Super quality slippers . The workmanship is great and the price is too.fast shipping at a good price .
 I gave this product to my husband for his birthday . He found them warm and comfortable , just what he wanted . They were a good value -- something he also appreciated since I spent money he earned to buy them for him .
 These slipper/shoes are comfortable and easy to wear , either around the house or outside . A good bargain as well ...
 It was a little difficult to gauge the proper size , so mine ended up being a little loose . Still , they are a pretty close fit despite the guessing . They are comfortable , warm , and have a useful amount of traction on surfaces like a kitchen floor . Beyond that ... * shrug * Definitely satisfied with the value for money so far . If it lasts for a couple of years I 'd upgrade the rating to five stars .
 about a week after I placed my order and still had not recieved it , I decided to track my package to see where it ended up . According to the tracking it had already been delivered , but I had not recieved it . The next day I emailed shoe mall to explain the situation , they followed up within and hour and sent me a form to sign and return -LRB- postage was paid -RRB- about a week after I dropped the form in the mail my package arrived . Fortunately it was a christmas gift for my husband so I had plenty of time , but you can hardly blame a company for what the post office does . Overall I am very happy with the service I recieved . All companies will encounter problems and occasionaly make mistakes , what impresses me is how well they handle those situations .
 excellent house shoe that is able to be worn outside if needed . Would buy again
 I ordered these as a gift for my son . The quality was great and the price was right . We were both pleased with the purchase . I chose amazon to purchase through because I have had so much success finding what I want at prices I like on their site .
 decided to go up a size.from my usual 8.5 so i got the 9 's . but they fit too big.i should of got them 8 . other than that.they look awesome.i love them.i would return them , but i dont want to go through all that hassle though.so im keeping them
 Overall fantastic . They fit great look great and feel great . I wear them every day and would definitely buy another pair .
 I bought a size 11W for my husband who wears a 10 1/2 or 11 depending on the shoe . They arrived in a timely manner even during the Christmas rush . They are actually a little too wide for him , but we are keeping them because my 14 year old son nabbed them up with a smile . He sometimes wears a 12W -LRB- and still growing - yikes ! -RRB- but they fit him beautifully . I guess I have to reorder a 11 medium for my husband . Maybe in a different color so they do n't mix up the pairs - haha .
 My boyfriend is 12 but he is swimming in the size 12 . I got the wide version but did n't think that would make the length any different .
 Good quality and great fit , even for a wider foot . I would recommend and buy another pair for my husband .
 These slippers are easy to put on and if you are trubled by bending or hand problems , these are easy to wear and are compfortable .
 My husband is a size 14 , so I have to order for him . These fit great . Sizing is accurate . Very comfortable . He wears them a lot .
 Item is great . Definitely recommended . Only issue is the fabric might develop a smell naturally -LRB- not very pleasant -RRB- and I do n't really have bad smelling feet , thankfully . Packaging and shipment were great as always from amazon . I have a prime membership and would recommend it to others for quick shipments and no minimum order cost .
 Good looking slipper and fits well . Would recommend it to everyone . Good quality and received very fast through the mail .
 Comfortable , seem well made . Lose 1/2 star for not coming in 1/2 sizes . So these are a little big , heel rides up , and have to be careful not to smash back ends/sides sometimes .
 I do n't wear shoes any more!I go everywhere with these and do all my yard work.One pair of shoes cost 5 pair of these !
 I got these for my dad because he was wearing his slippers out to the movie theater and they were pretty flimsy . I tried talking him into a sturdier pair of moccasins especially a pair that would be comfortable like slippers but suitable for outings , but he wanted these . Reluctantly I got them for him and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how well they hold up ! He wears them all over the place and even though they are indoor slippers , they have rubber soles that allow my dad to go to the movies . He 's weird , I know . None-the-less , he says they 're the most comfortable pair of `` shoes '' he 's ever owned .
 With my foot being extremely wideI have a difficult time finding shoes that fit correctly . With respect to house slippers I 've just had to make do with whatever I could find and hope for the best . These house slippers fit as advertised . Size EEEE is size EEEE . No guesswork . And the price is also great .
 I purchased these house shoes for my son in law for Christmas - he bsolutely loves these shoes ! Very warm and well-made . Good price - good seller !
 I purchased these slippers for my husband for Christmas . He has 13 EEE sized feet so very difficult to find slippers which fit a wide foot . These slippers are true to size , very durable and warm . My husband is very picky about slippers and loves these !
 These slippers are terrific ... sturdy sole , soft inside . AND they arrived just DAYS after I ordered them . thanks . I would buy more .
 have never been much of a slipper guy , but now at 62 yo look for the easy way . . plus being daibetic , these make the nurses happy .
 I ca n't believe the bargain I got with these slippers . I ordered one pair and as soon as I put them on I came back and ordered the last two pairs they had in my size . It is so difficult to find quality slippers with a wide width but these are PERFECTION . Well made , comfortable , nice looking , I would even wear them to run to the store -LRB- gosh does that sound like some grandfatherly thing or what -RRB- . They are sharp looking and comfortable . What more can you ask ?
 I purchased these slippers after a lot of research and some trial and error with other brands . I am happy to report that my perseverence paid off , these are a well made , comfortable and nice looking pair of slippers . Price-wise they beat all competitors without any noticable compromise in quality .
 I was replacing the same slippers which lasted for about 10 years . They are warm , comfortable , and long-lasting -LRB- obviously ; - -RRB-
 This purchase was for a replacement of a almost identical pair of moccasins I purchased from Amazon over ten years ago . The first pair was so long lasting and durable I wanted to get as close as possible for the replacement pair . I think I have found the perfect replacement . The sole and color are identical . They seem to be very comfortable and decent quality . Amazon has a way of making the selection easy . Thank you .
 I purchased these for my husband who was wanting more of the St. John 's Bay moccasins I had purchasd at J.C.Penney 's and lasted for years . They do n't appear to be available any longer , so after much searching , I decided on these.He is very happy with them . They appear to be of excellent quality and should also last for years .
 I bought these for my son because our floors are so very cold . He loves them . The size is great . His feet are very long and wide , these slippers fit the bill perfect . They go outside as well . Well made and cozy .
 They were a gift for someone else . They were very happy to receive them .
 I liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived . They fit my husband 's feet well and he likes them . The only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace .
 Fit great unlike a lot of slippers that do not run true to size . Very comfortable .
 I ordered cinnamon , they emailed me saying I 'd ordered rust . Pictures are identical for the two , so I did n't think much of it . Just got them today . . waay more red than I would have liked.Besides that , they are incredibly soft and cozy . I will definitely be wearing them to school during the winter when its not going to rain . Not sure how long they 'll last for outdoor use , but they seem pretty sturdy as moccasins go . The laces feel very flimsy , but they 're mostly for show anyways . I 'm going to upload pics so future buyers can differentiate the two styles .
 I would recommend this slipper for any of the men in your life . It is comfortable and the sole is extremely durable .
 I purchased these slippers for my husband and we are very pleased with them . They are comfortable and durable ... what more could you ask for ?
 Real comfortable and looks great ! I would wear them all day even to work if I could .
 Great quality and good bang for my buck . The sizing was fairly true , sometimes you get things marked wide or extra wide that are definitely not . The are comfortable and look great , would buy them again and recommend them in a second .
 These slippers are ok ! Since they cost 14.99 I did not expect too much . Fit was tight at first . absolutely no arch support . but thats ok !
 I have no idea how they fit or how they are holding up , but the recipient was pleased when he saw them .
 My dad is very hard to buy for , so I thought I would buy him a pair of slippers . He is not impressed with a lot of things , however , He can not stop talking about these slippers and how much he loves them ! He says that they are very comfortable and he is always wearing them . Best gift I gave him !
 They were shipped promptly . I wear a 10 D in most shoes & that 's what I ordered . A little big . If you can go a 1/2 size smaller I would . The lining on the inside 's a little thin but about right for the price . Be careful how you choose your shipping method . Usually the cheapest method is either preselected or at the top of the shipping options . This one had the most expensive preselected & on top .
 These had the right fit , they 're just warm enough that I can wear them with or without socks depending on my mood . I work from home , so it 's important that they be comfortable all day . These nail it on the head .
 These are really nice slippers . My husband likes them a lot . I spent more and bought from Amazon.com and it 's Marketplace vendors instead of from one of the big back east catalog companies . They were all more expensive but all of higher quality . He wears slippers exclusively anymore now ; even though we live in Hawaii . There really are no slippers to be bought HERE on the Big Island of Hawaii . He wears a perfect size 11 shoe but we have to buy a size 13 in slippers . These were a bit loose but a 12 would have been to short . Nice quality , well made . A big thank you to Amazon and it 's Marketplace vendors ; we just love you and buy almost everything online now . 99 % of what we buy is not sold here ! and if it were it would be twice the price . Hats off to you all !
 My husband wanted a durable pair of slippers with rubber soles and he has to have a wide size in men 's , 10EE . He says they fit fine ! I am pleased with his reaction to these slippers .
 This was a beautifully made slipper , however I bought it for a Christmas gift and there was n't a return slip or even packing slip in the package . So I did not give this 5 stars for that . I hope it fits him for Christmas , slipper did look a little narrow .
 The slippers are well made , comfortable , and fit well in bare feet . The only complaint that I have is that they could be a bit wider to accommodate wearing socks .
 I 'm in my forties and I should note that most people of my age grew up thinking of Mizuno as a `` speciality sport '' shoe . When I started wearing Wave Riders four years ago , the comments I got from friends were along the lines of `` I thought they made baseball -LSB- or volleyball -RSB- shoes . `` But , trust me
 I got these shoes as a gift for Christmas and I love them !! I have heard that they run small , but for me my normal size was perfect !! They are super , super comfy and really cute .

 I ordered a pair of these shoes in Ivory Leather to keep in the office for my emergency meetings . Very classy looking . Comfortable for heels that tall . The original product looks more off-white than the picture displayed online , but it worked out for the best as it looks more expensive than it really is .
 While I am very happy with these heels and find them surprisingly comfortable -LRB- though I have not worn them for more than a couple of hours and certainly have not walked any long distance in them -RRB- , I was slightly disappointed at first to see that the `` silver '' color is not really very accurate . I would describe this color as somewhere between silver and gold , with a somewhat distressed -LRB- `` crackly '' -RRB- finish . After looking at the shoes for a bit , though , I found this color and finish quite appealing and would now recommend this color highly -LRB- particularly for holiday dress -RRB- . I would advise customers looking for a silver shoe with smooth leather to look elsewhere .
 I am a big Nine West fan and these shoes did not disappoint me . I wear these shoes regularly . They are comfortable and cute . The tip on the heel did wear down a few months after I got them but I had them replaced and these shoes are heavy in my rotation . If you are looking for a cute , sexy shoe that is still comfortable , then these shoes are for you !
 I said `` Wow '' when I opened the box . These shoes are amazing ... even better than I expected . They are high quality for the price ! They are quite comfortable considering the heel height , which is about 3-3/4 '' - 4 '' depending on where you measure . Very classy and versatile for any dressy occasion . Thanks Amazon !
 Excellent Beautiful Shoes !! Even though high heels , they are extremely comfortable and definitely nice looking !!
 These Nine West pumps are very sexy and look great with jeans . They are for sure not made for people with wider feet . I wo n't be wearing these with gouchos , cropped careers or skirts because the sides are very low and my feet hang out . They are very cute with jeans , like I said , and are a higher quality leather than most other pumps you find . I only wish they came a little wider !
 I love these pumps . Perfect for work . They are classy and high-heeled , but comfortable enough for me to wear every day . I ordered 2 pair ... these were to replace a previous pair I owned in which the heal wore down after 6 months .
 i like this type of shoes , i 'm very glad that i bought this pair , i wear this shoes , and i 'm lucky -RRB- -RRB-
 Excellent quality , durable , comfortable , pretty . He tears everything up when he wears things because he 's active . I have n't had these very long , but as a mom I can tell these are going to last from the workmanship . Good price too . Ya 'll need to order some more and let other people enjoy them . Thanks AMAZON !!!
 great price for such a great quality shoe . would highly recommend these to any one.comfortable fit , avaliable in extra large sizes . thank you
 I ordered these flip flops after looking at a dozen others . There are very comfortable and I could wear them all day from the very first time that I had them on . No blisters between the toes . I also like the fact that they are made in Hawaii , rather than in a low-wage Asian country , and was willing to pay the slightly higher price for them . Highly recommended .
 I have owned a pair of Island Slipper Men 's flip flops for almost 20 years and worn them every summer . I have been waiting for them to wear out so that I could justify buying a new pair . Actually I did n't realize that I could buy them online . Other than a little wear on the sole and some spots where they have conformed to my feet they are like new . The are also the most comfortable pair of flip flops or sandals that I have every worn .
 I 've worn Island Pro Sandals by Island Slipper , Hawaii exclusively for over 6 years . They are the most comfortable , durable and good looking sandal you can buy ! They form to your feet and keep you warm in Winter . I wear them to the beach , park , mountains and street . My current pair are 2 years old and show no wear ! They are practically indestructible . I 've tried all the other brands and there 's no comparison . Island Slipper Flip Flops are light years ahead of the rest . Wear the best , forget the rest !
 Island Slipper Men 's Aka Flip FlopI 've worn Island Pro Sandals exclusively for 6 years . They form fit to your feet . My last pair of Flip Flops are over 2 years old and show no signs of wear . They are practically indestructible . I 've tried all the other brands and Island 's are the best . They are more comfortable , stronger , better looking and keep my feet warm in the Winter . I wear them to the beach , park , mountains , and street . Throw away your old sandals and try Island Slipper brand , made in Hawaii . Forget the rest , wear the best !

 These are soooo comfortable , and I can wear them 3/4 of the year , since the toes are covered . The strap ensures that they fit just right , and the arch is just what I need to keep my feet from aching . Highly recommend .
 these shoes are terrific . They not only look nice , they are comfortable and my feet never get tired even standing all day . I have them in blue and black . Im not crazy about the blue but since the black were really wonderful , I wanted a back up pair and found blue on sale . I like them enough to buy them in brown also . I get more compliments on these shoes then any others I own , and I am talking about a lot of shoes !
 The footbed is very comfortable which is standard for Naot . I found the leather on these shoes to be quite stiff . The leather covering the toe area fits narrow . Because i always order a size up in Naot shoes , i can fit into these . I 'm hope the leather gives abit after i wear them and streches over the toe area to avoid any digging in . Its too bad Naot does not have a wide fitting shoe , for all of us that have a wider foot .
 Let me start out by saying that these are very cute and chic . Lelli Kelly brand has so many original styles . However , if you are purchasing these as an athletic shoe to be worn for play and phys . ed , keep in mind that they wear too quickly . The sole is flexible which is a bonus to allow for a more natural gait , however the rubber is like a pencil eraser and gets rubbed down quickly . The fabric stretches along the outside and the inside so therefore the support is compromised all around including heel cradle . A great shoe for casual dress , just not for tough play . Hope it helps
 In looking for a pair of harness boots , the choice came down to Frye and Double H. Double H got the nod and I 'm pleased with the results . I wear the boots mostly for riding -LRB- 10-15K miles a year -RRB- , with a little casual wear on the side , and they 're great for that . The fit 's good , the boots are comfortable , and they 're holding up well . The one thing that kept me from giving these boots 5 stars is the heel design . It 's just too big and clunky - Frye got the lines right there . But this is a personal taste thing ; otherwise , I have no problem with recommending these boots .
 If you are going to be on your feet all day and need support this is the best shoes . I have been suffering with heel problems for years , but when I purchase this shoes my problem was solved . I wear it everyday to work and now I have to purchase a pair for wearing in my house . The shoe is well padded well built and durable . My coworkers all comment on the style also . Now I search for all ECCO shoes .
 As all ECCOs , this shoe is very comfortable . DEFINTATELY runs at least 1/2 size large . I have many ECCO shoes in size 39 , had to reorder in size 38 . Ca n't say it is stylish , but I bought it specifically to put in suitcases and my briefcase - `` Smooshes '' down flat but offers good walking support when on .
 I 'm in my forties and I should note that most people of my age grew up thinking of Mizuno as a `` speciality sport '' shoe . When I started wearing Wave Riders four years ago , the comments I got from friends were along the lines of `` I thought they made baseball -LSB- or volleyball -RSB- shoes . `` But , trust me
 Wonderful quality for not a great price . Comfortable with a classic look . Comes individually wrapped in booties to keep clean with an additional bonus for packing in a suitcase .
 just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo . I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box . They feel like I already broke them in . These are going to be great for pants or skirts . I 'm very happy with them .
 I soooo love these boots . . the colour is great , different than any I ever had . They are also so very comfortable , even the first time I wore them . the leather did not need time to break like other boots . I love them , the colour , the feel and the height is just right !!
 I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot , the color , the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort . I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores .
 Super comfy boots from day 1 ! NO break-in time which is an added bonus . I 've had many compliments on them . They DO run true-to size . Shipping was faster than predicted : -RRB-
 Absolutely beautiful boot and ca n't wait to wear them . We do n't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can . Sorry I ca n't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport , I doubt I will be disappointed .

 These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress . Furthermore , on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are . I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry . 5 stars from me .

 These felt great the first time I put them on . No break in time needed . Bass shoes has done it again .
 Boots do run a bit small . I ordered a 13W and had to reorder a 14W . Not a big deal . As for a prior comment about the stitching inside the boot under the insole this was in mine also but it is not an issue at all . It is just the extra thread that was taped down to the bottom of the boot instead of being trimmed . The boots seemed to fit great -LRB- except for being a tad snug on the right foot -RRB- and were brand new as listed . Just an FYI in the future for others they can run a bit small . My other boots -LRB- 5.11 s -RRB- are a 13W and fit without issue . When I did receive the 14W , which was in 3 days they fit great without issue . I have been wearing them for 2 weeks and they are great . I will buy these again .
 I was cautions about buying these since they ARE made in China . Doc Martins lost all quality when they started making most of their boots in mainland China . Nonetheless , these are the most comfortable boots I 've owned .
 This is about the 5th pair of these boots purchased . Very comfortable , easy to wear . Light to wear every day . Very pleased with these boots . Mens and womens are equally wearable .
 I had recently purchased the Original SWAT boot because my last boots -LRB- a different brand -RRB- were on their last leg and were falling apart -LRB- they were over 4 years old -RRB- . My business travels take me to a wide range of military bases and urban search and rescue training facilities where I need to be in boots -LRB- not necessarily steel-toed -RRB- . I recently found out about these boots from a colleague and purchased a pair , which turned out to be the best boot purchase I have ever made . Not only are these boots are easy to slide on and off , especially with the side-zipper , they provide snug support and definitely allow your feet to breathe while on the job . I have no complaints about this product ... definitely a must for anyone that is active in tactical environments .
 These boots look good , feel good , and I really love how the zipper makes getting them on-and-off a breeze . I do n't see any loose stitching as some have indicated . The fastest shiping yet on anything I 've ordered from Amazon ; actually came a day early . I ordered a pair for me and one for my son , who is a carpenter . No complaints from either of us yet , other than I ordered the &#34; wide &#34; size 12 , and the boots do n't seem quite wide enough for my liking . I like them enough that I 'm not sure I 'm ready to actually use them for work boots . I think I will order another pair for rough and dirty work , and keep one for casual wear . My son fishes a lot in the winter by boat . One of the reasons I ordered him a pair , was that he might actually be able to get these boots off before drowning if he had to .
 Perfect fit for the dollar for a good looking & feeling boot that exactly needed when on the go o.
 Great boots . First day I wore them for about 9 hours . Very comfortable and flexible but sturdy . Would buy more !!!!
 Boots were comfortable out of the box , I am wearing them for the first time today on shift , So fa so good
 Just have them for a couple of days , but they are comfortable and great to work with ... my dogs do n't scream any more at the end of the day ... Even better price
 He works long hours on his feet , this boots leave his feet feeling like hour 4 vs hour 14 , Happy feet happy hubby !
 This is my second pair . I need the support of a boot but something light weight . These are the best boots that I have found and they are extremely comfortable .

 The canvas velcro shoes were all that I had hoped.I had a full hip replacement on 1/3/06 . Therefore , I needed something that was easy to put on and comfortable to wear . The canvas velcro shoes filled the bill .
 I purchased these for my mom after she had a hip replacement and was unable to bend to tie shoes . These worked great . They look nice and fit very well . The linen texture and beige color go with all her summer things . She is very pleased with the shoes . Never had a break in period with these either .
 These are great shoes . They are very comfortable and easy to put on . Fast delivery too .
 these shoes are so comfortable . the neat thing about these shoes is you can toss them in the washer and they look new again .
 Recently retired , and looking for comfortable attractive shoes . These are great .
 Velcro is a God sent to someone with M.S.the purchase of this item was easy and fast.the size was correct without actual being there for the fitting

 This little keychain makes a perfect gift ! The quality of the leather is great , and the keychain comes in a beautiful packaged box . Outstanding workmanship , overall .

 Dada 's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had . The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large . $ 20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous , but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name , your name , and your number . Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable , have good traction , and just look good .

 I 'm in my forties and I should note that most people of my age grew up thinking of Mizuno as a `` speciality sport '' shoe . When I started wearing Wave Riders four years ago , the comments I got from friends were along the lines of `` I thought they made baseball -LSB- or volleyball -RSB- shoes . `` But , trust me

 Great Kenneth Cole boot . Very fashion forward style . Fits slightly larger than sized . Very comfortable and well-made .
 I usually by a very pricey brand name slipper . These were a quarter of the cost and are holding up nicely for my husband . He says they are just as comfy as the usual brand .
 I now own several pair of Allen Edmonds shoes . I really like this boat shoe . I bought the British Tan colored and brown . Great colors , style and great sole . I had to put a felt tongue pad under the shoe tongue to alleviate any discomfort until they were fully broken in . The leather is thick and durable . It 's not going to wear out any time soon . Really high quality and great craftsmanship ! I wear a narrow width and Allen Edmonds make shoe with widths from AAA to EEE . I wo n't buy a shoe from any other company -LRB- Allen Edmonds -RRB- or any place else -LRB- Amazon -RRB- .
 These keep going strong after alot of wear . The leather and quality stands up to anything that I can dish out . Bad weather , rain , sun , heat , sand , you name it and these pass with flying colors . They are a bit stiff at first . That is because they are good leather and strong construction . They feel great and are what you expect from Allen Edmonds . Made in North America does make a difference . Very happy with these shoes
 These shoes are very well made and are worth the higher price . Sizes run small and I had to return them for the next size up . Dressier look than my usual Sabagos .
 Love em !! Take a little break 'n in but after that very comfortable . Leather feels very durable and should last a long time .
 I have two pairs of these AE boaters . I liked the first pair so much that I bought a second pair in a different color.There are a few reviewers on here who whine about how much they hurt their tender little feet during the `` break in '' period . You should ignore these reviewers . Why ? Because after you break them in -LRB- in one to two weeks ' of wearing -RRB- , they become very comfortable , and you can keep wearing them on a regular basis for years . I have done exactly that , and I anticipate being able to continue to wear them on a regular basis for years to come ; they are virtually indestructible . They could probably stop small-caliber bullets at beyond arm 's length and might as well be made of kevlar.They run slightly wider and longer than a regular AE . The fit , however , is otherwise more or less true-to-size . The styling is probably more conservative than other boat shoes from popular retail outfits . The only criticism I could level is that they 're lacking in inner-arch support , but I think this is because they are actually intended to be worn on a boat -LRB- surprise ! -RRB- . Considering that these appear to be available for less than $ 150 , they are an incredible value and very well worth the money .
 Do not understand the bad comments about these shoes . Just put in a full summer season -LRB- 2011 -RRB- in them working , mowing lawn , walking dogs , and yes
 THESE SHOES ARE LIGHT-WEIGHT , GOOD LOOKS , GREAT PRICE AND HI QUALITY MADE . THEY ARE SO COMFORTABLE GREAT ANKLE PROTECTION . GET THEM
 Bought these shoes from ebay , i open the box and saw them shining back they are amazing , shining and amazingably comfortable ! i recommend these shoes for a beguiner or any pro at that . a + + + + + buy them now for basketballing perfection !
 My 15 year old got these for Xmas . The shoes have withstood the harsh treatment my boy gives them . He really likes them for basketball , and he wears them only for basketball . -LRB- His old basketball shoes lasted less than a month . -RRB- Would recommend these shoes if the child likes the style . My boy had seen them in a store , and we found them at a considerable cost savings online , so we purchased them online .
 The shoe overall is great snug , comfy , and rele nice looking . these were alot cheaper than what i oringinally thought i was gunna spend `` amzon deal was 30 bucks , with free shipping '' . I 'm hitting 9 months with my other shoe i order at the same time as i got these . urges ppl to buy it !!!!!
 This is my second pair of these first one lasted me 6 years before i decided there to beat up to use anymore
 I bought these in highschool and loved them so when i saw they were available again , I could n't pass them up !
 I like this shoes , It 's good . The product and time is OK . Maybe it can offer more T-mac shoes and more colour to choose .
 I had googled basketball shoes for players with fallen arches . Several options came up . Im an old guy who does n't want to give up.I also have a bad ankle . So I put on my ankle brace and my knee braces , and my new T-Mac shoes with orthotic inserts inserted in them.I have been able to run the court pretty well with my new shoes . I think they have helped .
 I like the T-Mac style that is why I bought these . They are what I wanted and I 'm playing basketball better with them .
 This is a cool shoe , first saw it about a year and a half ago and finally i own it . Am loving it .
 just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo . I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box . They feel like I already broke them in . These are going to be great for pants or skirts . I 'm very happy with them .
 I soooo love these boots . . the colour is great , different than any I ever had . They are also so very comfortable , even the first time I wore them . the leather did not need time to break like other boots . I love them , the colour , the feel and the height is just right !!
 I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot , the color , the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort . I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores .
 Super comfy boots from day 1 ! NO break-in time which is an added bonus . I 've had many compliments on them . They DO run true-to size . Shipping was faster than predicted : -RRB-
 Absolutely beautiful boot and ca n't wait to wear them . We do n't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can . Sorry I ca n't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport , I doubt I will be disappointed .
 i ware these shoes all the time . you can put them on with jeans for a more modern punk look , or add a dress for some real eye catching out fits ! i love these & i 'm glad that i bought them almost two months ago ! they rock ...
 These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress . Furthermore , on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are . I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry . 5 stars from me .

 I do n't wear these much , but every time I do I get tons of compliments . They could stand a bit more cushioning , but they 're not really made for comfort , are they ? : - -RRB-

 This boot quickly became my favorite . Light weight but tough and durable with soles that are easy to clean after working in the garden . After two years I 'm ready to get another pair but the old ones are still going strong .

 Shoes for people who need orthotics ... but you can wear them without them . Great !
 I have another pair for outside , cold . I want another one of these for in and out of car and office and home visits for winters in Minnesota . They are boots , not too warm in the car , office , or people 's homes , but with pants look more like a shoe and less like a boot ! I 'm buying another pair .
 These are great because they run wide - that 's hard to find . Slight heel , but not uncomfortable , even when walking a lot .
 Fit was pretty true to size , though my husband -LRB- the wearer -RRB- says they feel nice and snug due to the furriness . Very nice and comfy and warm . Great to use for small treks outside with the rubber soles -LRB- better than some of the suede soles on other types -RRB- . We expect these to last for years , just like his prior pair . Wonderful product !

 i like this type of shoes , i 'm very glad that i bought this pair , i wear this shoes , and i 'm lucky -RRB- -RRB-
 These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress . Furthermore , on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are . I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry . 5 stars from me .
 The T. Moro is a fabulous color -- very dark brown , textured . The toe is more round than almond shaped which actually makes it even more comfortable . Great silhouette !
 I should have investigated a bit more on what color &#34; tmoro &#34; is . I wanted a black shoe . This is dark brown . But I am keeping it because it fits perfectly on my skinny foot . I am sure I will find outfits to match .

 I am very pleased with these shoes ! They arrived quickly and look great . Thanks to everyone who mentioned these shoes run a 1/2 size smaller . I normally wear an 8 1/2 , but took a chance and ordered these in an 8 and they fit perfectly . Very cute shoes , will probably order in other colors !
 I bought this same pair in black at Nordstrom recently for over $ 90 and they are still carrying them , I have n't received my brown croc pair yet but I have no doubt they will be perfect since I already have them and they are such great quality , comfortable from the beginning and such a classic style , can wear w / dress pants , jeans , or skirts and dresses ... Nothing cheap about them and to get them at this price is a total steal !!! I am contemplating buying another pair even before I get this pair because I have no doubt in my mind they are amazing and could sell out in a minute then I will kick myself !!
 I bought the black leather for a wedding and the red croco for both work and play and I do n't regret one dollar of my purchase ! It 's been forever since I 've been in a heel this tall and amazingly walking is no problem . The dancing at the wedding finally got to me by the end of the night but the red ones especially kick up any work trouser or everyday jeans . I too find them a half size too big so factor that in !
 i think this shoe is great for everyone that wears high heel shoes . i could them all day long and never get tiered of them . they also look good with all my outfits dresses and skirts witch is all i wear . thank you andy
 These shoes are so classic , but very sexy . I never fail to get compliments when wearing them . They run slightly small , but break in easily .
 I love these shoes more than all of my shoes . They are so loverly and perfect . I rec . these to everyone !!
 I like this shoe though I wish Enzo would have put in a little more cushion in the sole of the shoe . Because the sole is somewhat thin , I can feel rocks , rough cement , etc when I walk . Luckily a couple of shoe inserts helps ! The height is great if you like heels and not uncomfortable . I can rock in these heels all night !
 I have five pairs of the Enzo Angiolini peep toe pump in a variety of colors . I absolutely love them . These heels are actually gorgeous and comfortable . I love heels and many of them have left my feet , toes or ankles throbbing by days end-but not these . All of my friends that own these shoes feel the same way . If you want a pretty pair of high heels that are comfortable after a long day-then these are the shoes for you !
 Love these shoes . Practical enough to wear to work or on a night out . Not the most comfortable especially initially but very cute and classic . I bought my pair because a friend of mine recommended them , I still have mine while hairs mysteriously vanished at a party .
 I love the shoes ! They are very comfortable and they look great on . I 've only worn them once , but I 've gotten tons of compliments . I plan to wear them at my Wedding Rehearsal with my new dress , and I ca n't wait !! : -RRB-
 I have these in 2 colors and they are so comfortable . I get compliments on them all the time and can wear them for hours . Not too tall , so they can be dressed down for daywear .
 I first saw this shoe on QVC while flipping stations . I had been looking for a shoe like this - since it IS the quintessential shoe of 2008 , in my opinion - and fell in love with this particular pair . The smallest size they carried was a 6 but I ordered in anyway hoping it would fit . I normally wear a 5 but sometimes can get away with a 6 . I was hoping this would be the case . But I started to get paranoid so I searched online to find them here on the ever-reliable -LSB- ... -RSB- . From the reviews , I knew I was in trouble . As suspected , the shoe was too big . Way too big . I returned it to QVC and bought the 5 here when I should have heeded the warnings of the other reviewers and went down a whole size instead of just a half . So after three pairs of shoes , I finally have them ! I 'm slowly breaking them in but can not wait to wear these Black Beauties ! And better yet , they were cheaper here than at QVC and -LSB- ... -RSB- returned them for free -LRB- which QVC did not -RRB- . Two lessons to learn from my experience 1 -RRB- always check -LSB- ... -RSB- first for any purchase and 2 -RRB- trust these reviews and the advice given !
 I had bought these in another color and loved them . From that point , I keep looking for them in other colors . It takes at least a day or two to break them in and your feet might be slightly swollen , but afterwards , they are super comfortable . I usually wear size 6 , but a 5.5 fit me perfectly . I get tons of compliments when I wear them with pants or a skirt since they look dainty and feminine .
 I have been looking for the perfect black pump for so long ! I finally found it . This shoe is very sexy and comfortable . What more can a girl ask for : -RRB-
 Okay , so I have felt this way before . I have had a pair of shoes that I have to completely put away about three times so I can experience opening the box over and over again . But this time it really is different . These shoes are amazing . Where do I start?The color is amazing . The red is so dark that they are almost a jewel tone purple . The heel is thin and super long . They are very high - but that is exactly what I want some nights . The construction is perfect , they feel great on -LRB- even if I do wobble a tiny bit ! -RRB- . And that gold liner.Definintely for a night out when you want to impress . I have n't picked out the perfect outfit yet.A great deal ! If you love shoes , and you think these are tempting - buy them . You wo n't regret it !
 they are comfortable and classy - they wear well and are the perfect height heel !
 Love these shoes ! I bought them for a wedding and they treated me so well ! Not only are they completely adorable and I got tons of compliments on them , but they were SO COMFORTABLE ! I could n't believe it . My feet lasted through standing , walking , and dancing at the wedding , and even kept up with the after-party ! Now I just hope they stay in style for awhile so I can keep wearing them ...
 These shoes are beautiful and very well made . They do run big , so I suggest you order a size smaller that what you would normally buy . For instance , I typically wear a 5 1/2 to a 6 depending on the shoe . I ordered a 5 1/2 and it was much too big . I returned and purchased a size 5 and it fits perfectly .
 What a great shoe ! Completely fashionable - you could dress up or down . The material is high quality and comfortable ... Absolutely recommended . I think my roommate is buying a pair also !
 I keep buying these shoes over and over again . I looove them ! My only complaint is the patent leather peels on the heel easliy and I have to get a new pair every 6 months or so . But that maybe because I wear the heck out of them .
 I love this shoe -- Enzo Maylie 's are the classic perfect peep-toe pump , especially for the price -LRB- comparable style -- almost identical -- with more expensive Designer Label is over $ 300 -RRB- . Feminine , just the right heel height , beautiful feminine heel styling and toe clevage , very sophisticated for the price , and they are really comfortable for those of us who are on our feet all day -LRB- or dancing all night -RRB- . I own these shoes in 8 colors , and just bought them in orange croc for Spring to wear with a Navy sheath , and I always seem to return to this favorite classic as new colors and textures are introduced . Very feminine and sexy for all ages , just try them -- you 'll love these shoes ! As with other Nine West shoes , -LRB- Enzo , Bandolino -RRB- they do run 1/2 size larger than other brands .
 Great shoe , I had to break it in , but so far so good . Has a nice height to the shoe . What can I say , I 'm totally satisfied !
 So far I have 3 pairs of these stunning Enzo peep-toe shoes . They are gorgeous and excellent quality leather , with a 3-1/2 '' heel . Please note that they do run a 1/2 size bigger than normal -LRB- I wear an 8-1/2 shoe , so I order these in an 8 -RRB- . They 've given me blisters on my heels the first couple times wearing them , but once they 're broken in , they are quite comfortable compared to other pumps I own . Like another reviewer said , these pumps just do n't disappoint .
 I 'll be honest . . as soon as I took them out of the box I loved them , but thought there is no way my size 10 clodhoppers are going to squeeze into those . Well , I was wrong and they fit perfectly.I did unfortunately have to wear them at a conference 2 days later without having a chance to break them in -LRB- not recommended -RRB- We dress casually at work so it had been awhile since Id worn heels , and I was nervous about wearing them for the first time when Id be on my feet all day.I wont lie , my feet did hurt after being at that kind of an angle for 10 or so hours . Even though I walked , climbed stairs , got on/off shuttle buses , carried heavy bags ... . I did not have even the beginnings of a single blister . All that and no nylons.Enzo has always , and continues to sell a quality product.The hardest part was trying not to feel like a redwood about to topple over at any moment -LRB- 5 ' 8 without ... and well over 6 ' with these shoes -RRB- . All my complaining aside , I really do love them . They are incredibly feminine and I think Im going to buy another pair in a different color .
 My search for the perfect black peep-toe is over . These shoes are incredibly chic and comfy . They run a 1/2 size big , in my opinion , but I had to snag them while they were on sale . A heel pad should remedy the size issue for me .
 I 've ordered several pair of this shoe from Amazon , the style is classic and never ages . Amazon shipped them to me within two days of ordering . Love my shoes . Thanks , Amazon !
 Very comfortable , breath good also . I can use it all day and my feet do not get tired .
 I always hesitate to buy shoes without trying them on first . I 'm hard to fit properly & frequently end up with a blister from new shoes . Not in this case ! I bought these boots for a New Year 's eve trip to NYC . I was not able to wear them to break them in first . I got them in the mail & off I went . I walked all over NYC in these boots & they were great . Super comfortable fit . Not slippery on wet ground . They 're also easy to slip on & off . The only reason I did n't score them 5 stars is that after about a year , they 've developed a squeak , which I find annoying ... but still super comfy !
 I bought these along with 2 other Sudini boots . I love them . At first I was n't so sure but after wearing them in -- they became a go-to boot .
 these slippers pretty much fit , i 'm an 8 in street shoes so i ordered this half size bigger -LRB- 8 1/2 -RRB- and they fit perfectly ! they look pretty awesome too !
 I received these the very next day that I ordered them , and got free shipping . They appear to be good quality and look nice . I ordered them for one of my kids after the dance store I ordered all of the shoes from was out of stock in that one size . Unfortunately , I wo n't have the rest of them from the dance store for a week or so , and I had to pay for shipping through them ! Now I wish I ordered all of them from Amazon . Good to know for next time !
 I love Capezio cobra ballet shoe 's fit . The fit is better than Bloch Prolite II leather ballet shoes I bought here in Australia . When they say it 's street shoe size ... it definitely is ! Too bad the seller does n't ship overseas . But good thing my mother-in-law came to visit me so I had Amazon deliver it to her CA address . : -RRB-
 These things wo n't last forever , but they 're a good deal considering the price . They also fitted fine , I normally wear a 7 , and I did n't have any problems with sizing . The only real downfall is that they are lined in white . I have dirty feet and after two hours of dancing the shoes are already showing their age .
 YAY ! I wanted them so bad but after reading the reviews about them being too small i became discouraged , so i decided to go ahead and get some anyway . Im usually a size 8 1/2 in street shoes so I bought a size 12 ballet shoes and they fit like a glove ! the little strings above the toes are adjustable and the split leather soles are great for my roughtness . No I an not a dancer but I love them to prance around the house and they are great for plane travel ! these are the best and i will always buy these .
 I dance in a University company and my shoes were looking a little worn out ; so , I decided to order these for class purposes only . I wear a 7 in street shoe size and ordered a 7 . They did fit in that way . I have a slender foot I suppose , because even after tightening my elastics they were still too wide -LRB- slightly -RRB- . It is still a nice shoe for class and the other elastics i just tie in a knot and wrap around my foot .
 I really like these ballet shoes . They are a little snug , I ordered my actual shoe size -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- and probably could have used a 9 , but they will stretch out with wear . They are comfortable and were a great value !!
 I danced for years as a kid , and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types . They do n't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes , but they hold up a little longer -LRB- and because my toes are on a slant/angle , the shape looks better anyway -RRB- . I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small , but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes . I had to exchange them , and the exchange process was hassle free and quick - had the new shoes within a few days .
 Came on time . They are still good but just a bit small -LRB- some people prefer it more snug -RRB- I 've only been using them for a short while but so far I 'm pretty happy with them .
 I bought it for my girlfriend because it 's her favorite ballet shoe , it 's the second she have , all the same , she does n't change it for others .
 I own a pair of cobras in both leather and in canvas , and I love them both . I mistakenly purchased the leather ones when I first started taking ballet classes , but was very pleased with how long they lasted . My canvas shoes are much more comfortable for everyday practice . Breathable , with some give , I would reccommend these shoes to anyone looking for a good pair of ballet shoes - Even my instructor and all my classmates encourage people to buy them !
 I have wide feet , so the fit could be a little better , but I did order regular sizes ... I wear a 10W-11M , and ordered a 10M and it fit just fine , I ca n't imagine how baggy and slippery anything bigger would be . It 's adjustable with the tiny bow elastic . I wish I would have stain guarded them before wearing , they do pick up everything you are near . my 9 yeah old niece tried to get me to give them to her maybe 30 times , haha . I ordered her her own set for her birthday . Shh ! I 'm pleased . I 'm not a dancer , well not in 15 years anyway , I ordered them for folding up in my purse to have when my high heels get too uncomfortable . They 're gon na be way cuter than any other foldable flats !
 These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress . Furthermore , on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are . I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry . 5 stars from me .
 Well , ten dollar shoes . Great price . I love how everyone is complaining about how they are 1 size smaller than what they say.Actually you 're WRONG . Asics is a company based in Kobe . If you looked at the seller 's size charts , you would have clearly seen the international size chart.So it was more of your error for not selecting the correct size . So please , do n't complain about the Flat . These reviews are about the QUALITY of the item ... not about how it was n't what you ordered . They gave you exactly what you wanted.So people , look at the size chart . < 3

 They were very comfy and to get them use your naturall shoe size unless ur toes are a lil long . My toes are pretty tiny so i got away with a 6.5 shoe haha ! for turns on the dance floor they are nice and the white is a very crisp cute color !
 i love the flexibility and grip these shoes havetheyr just wonderful theyr also very comfortablebut the best part is once im done with these i move on to my pointe
 it is great for beginners like me they work well just need to make sure you get the right size

 Came on time . They are still good but just a bit small -LRB- some people prefer it more snug -RRB- I 've only been using them for a short while but so far I 'm pretty happy with them .
 I bought it for my girlfriend because it 's her favorite ballet shoe , it 's the second she have , all the same , she does n't change it for others .
 I own a pair of cobras in both leather and in canvas , and I love them both . I mistakenly purchased the leather ones when I first started taking ballet classes , but was very pleased with how long they lasted . My canvas shoes are much more comfortable for everyday practice . Breathable , with some give , I would reccommend these shoes to anyone looking for a good pair of ballet shoes - Even my instructor and all my classmates encourage people to buy them !
 I have wide feet , so the fit could be a little better , but I did order regular sizes ... I wear a 10W-11M , and ordered a 10M and it fit just fine , I ca n't imagine how baggy and slippery anything bigger would be . It 's adjustable with the tiny bow elastic . I wish I would have stain guarded them before wearing , they do pick up everything you are near . my 9 yeah old niece tried to get me to give them to her maybe 30 times , haha . I ordered her her own set for her birthday . Shh ! I 'm pleased . I 'm not a dancer , well not in 15 years anyway , I ordered them for folding up in my purse to have when my high heels get too uncomfortable . They 're gon na be way cuter than any other foldable flats !
 these slippers pretty much fit , i 'm an 8 in street shoes so i ordered this half size bigger -LRB- 8 1/2 -RRB- and they fit perfectly ! they look pretty awesome too !
 I received these the very next day that I ordered them , and got free shipping . They appear to be good quality and look nice . I ordered them for one of my kids after the dance store I ordered all of the shoes from was out of stock in that one size . Unfortunately , I wo n't have the rest of them from the dance store for a week or so , and I had to pay for shipping through them ! Now I wish I ordered all of them from Amazon . Good to know for next time !
 I love Capezio cobra ballet shoe 's fit . The fit is better than Bloch Prolite II leather ballet shoes I bought here in Australia . When they say it 's street shoe size ... it definitely is ! Too bad the seller does n't ship overseas . But good thing my mother-in-law came to visit me so I had Amazon deliver it to her CA address . : -RRB-
 These things wo n't last forever , but they 're a good deal considering the price . They also fitted fine , I normally wear a 7 , and I did n't have any problems with sizing . The only real downfall is that they are lined in white . I have dirty feet and after two hours of dancing the shoes are already showing their age .
 YAY ! I wanted them so bad but after reading the reviews about them being too small i became discouraged , so i decided to go ahead and get some anyway . Im usually a size 8 1/2 in street shoes so I bought a size 12 ballet shoes and they fit like a glove ! the little strings above the toes are adjustable and the split leather soles are great for my roughtness . No I an not a dancer but I love them to prance around the house and they are great for plane travel ! these are the best and i will always buy these .
 I have another pair for outside , cold . I want another one of these for in and out of car and office and home visits for winters in Minnesota . They are boots , not too warm in the car , office , or people 's homes , but with pants look more like a shoe and less like a boot ! I 'm buying another pair .
 These are great because they run wide - that 's hard to find . Slight heel , but not uncomfortable , even when walking a lot .
 I needed a comfortable shoe that was also stylish to run around in . I did n't want a running shoe type , but something sleeker . This fit thebill .

 It 's hard to get both , but style and comfort come with these sandles . Worth every penny .
 I 've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade . Yes ! Ten years ! I 'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend . The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable . IMHO there is n't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort , retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet , and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion , for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them , getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome . And I do n't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day !
 This is my second pair . The tops outlast the bottoms but they are good quality . I have a c width foot so they are good for me . Everyone likes different sneakers for fit and quality . These are made well and will last about a year of daily use . I am satified with them and will keep buying them . Rob
 Reebok its that I want . You can wear those everywhere during the day . But they run small maybe for a number . I use to wear 9 , but they did n't feet in my feet . so Think about this if you are going to buy these shoes .
 This is my fifth pair of ballistic so far . I bought my first ones about 14 years ago and was immediately satisfied with their confort . This is a product of excellent quality that , on average , tends to last more than 3 years without breaking apart . Please , keep in mind that I do use them often and I am not a sedentary person . They are a bit tall compared to other sneakers , but that has never been a problem . Really confortable and highly recommended .
 just in time and just what i needed . This are just like the first reebok shoes i got as a little kid . Light , confortable . They also fit just perfect . Strongly recomend this product .
 Love the shoe ! It 's kinda retro but it feels great . Exceeds my expectations . What more can I say ? It 's a Reebok !
 These shoes look awesome . They are a little snug at first but after a `` breaking in '' they feel really light and comfortable . Did I mention they look awesome ???
 These shoes are inexpensive , light weight , and very comfortable.They were hard to get on at first . There is a loop on the tongue that holds the laces ... I relaced the shoes without using the loop and they went on much easier.I 'm happy with them .
 These shoes are comfortable for getting around . Since it is a mans shoes I normally order down one size . There were no tens so I ordered the 10.5 . The shoe fit fine , the 10 would not have given me the same comfort . I would recommend this as a walking shoe .
 Awesome shoes that I 've bought several times over the years . I love the nondescript style and the -LRB- somewhat -RRB- retro look . Low key , nothing flashy but very cool.They 're getting harder to find . Here 's hoping Reebok keeps making these .
 buy them for the new year , I like the classic tennis and this is perfect , comfortable and a great price . certainly buy them again .
 This item was ordered as a gift for a relative , my nephew in Kansas . He received the item promptly and is very happy with it . Yes , we would order this item again .
 Very nice for the price , fits comfortably if you 're used to wearing heels .
 these slippers pretty much fit , i 'm an 8 in street shoes so i ordered this half size bigger -LRB- 8 1/2 -RRB- and they fit perfectly ! they look pretty awesome too !

 I dance in a University company and my shoes were looking a little worn out ; so , I decided to order these for class purposes only . I wear a 7 in street shoe size and ordered a 7 . They did fit in that way . I have a slender foot I suppose , because even after tightening my elastics they were still too wide -LRB- slightly -RRB- . It is still a nice shoe for class and the other elastics i just tie in a knot and wrap around my foot .
 I really like these ballet shoes . They are a little snug , I ordered my actual shoe size -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- and probably could have used a 9 , but they will stretch out with wear . They are comfortable and were a great value !!
 I danced for years as a kid , and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types . They do n't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes , but they hold up a little longer -LRB- and because my toes are on a slant/angle , the shape looks better anyway -RRB- . I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small , but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes .

 Mia Escapade Sandal , I tried these shoes on at a local Shoe Outlet , priced at $ 79 . Having made Amazon purchases in the past , I wrote down the style number , came home and looked on Ebay and Amazon for a value that fit my budget . I not only found the sandals at less than half price , I found a pair in Natural and a pair in Black . The height and style of these shoes ca n't help but be sexy . And they feel so much nicer on my feet , knowing I did n't break the bank to own them . My seller shipped immediately and safely . Awesome , awesome , awesome experience !!!!
 I bought this at unbelievable price , the product is excellent , very happy with it .

 They fit true to size , and look even better on ! They are made very well.I ca n't believe the price I got them at on Amazon , Love this site !
 A very comfy shoe , easy off at the airport , and styling with the Phoenix emblem .

 I ran into a girl the other day -LRB- literally -RRB- who was wearing these cool skates and I was quite impressed by their remarkable style and grace as she swayed across the deserted parking lot . It was a good day , I bent down to help her back up when I did I took a look at her Freeriders and noticed she had her phone number written on the side . So I got ta get going and find out how my wounded freerider bunny is doing .
 I got these for my 2nd grader daughter to replace her Merrill and Reebok sneakers -LRB- which were good , but not great -RRB- . These shoes are AWESOME . She loves the pink color , naturally , and I love that they are constructed like an adult athletic shoe -LRB- most kids shoes are NOT , even the upscale brands -RRB- . I 'm sure these will last into the fall . I also like that Adidas has half-sizes in their kids line . The fit is perfect . She says these are the most comfortable sneaker she 's ever worn . They were outrageously cheap -LRB- $ 15 -RRB- - try beating that at the mall for this quality shoe - impossible !

 Great Product . . Good for summer ... Just what I expected ... However , the size was huge . I 'd suggest buying it a half size smaller than you need .
 Love Rykas . I have a hard time finding Rykas in my size . The price was amazing , too . Ryka shoes are made for a woman 's foot , and feel great . I would recommend Ryka to anyone .

 I really like these ballet shoes . They are a little snug , I ordered my actual shoe size -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- and probably could have used a 9 , but they will stretch out with wear . They are comfortable and were a great value !!
 They were very comfy and to get them use your naturall shoe size unless ur toes are a lil long . My toes are pretty tiny so i got away with a 6.5 shoe haha ! for turns on the dance floor they are nice and the white is a very crisp cute color !
 i love the flexibility and grip these shoes havetheyr just wonderful theyr also very comfortablebut the best part is once im done with these i move on to my pointe
 it is great for beginners like me they work well just need to make sure you get the right size
 I danced for years as a kid , and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types . They do n't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes , but they hold up a little longer -LRB- and because my toes are on a slant/angle , the shape looks better anyway -RRB- . I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small , but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes . I had to exchange them , and the exchange process was hassle free and quick - had the new shoes within a few days .
 Came on time . They are still good but just a bit small -LRB- some people prefer it more snug -RRB- I 've only been using them for a short while but so far I 'm pretty happy with them .
 I bought it for my girlfriend because it 's her favorite ballet shoe , it 's the second she have , all the same , she does n't change it for others .
 I own a pair of cobras in both leather and in canvas , and I love them both . I mistakenly purchased the leather ones when I first started taking ballet classes , but was very pleased with how long they lasted . My canvas shoes are much more comfortable for everyday practice . Breathable , with some give , I would reccommend these shoes to anyone looking for a good pair of ballet shoes - Even my instructor and all my classmates encourage people to buy them !
 I have wide feet , so the fit could be a little better , but I did order regular sizes ... I wear a 10W-11M , and ordered a 10M and it fit just fine , I ca n't imagine how baggy and slippery anything bigger would be . It 's adjustable with the tiny bow elastic . I wish I would have stain guarded them before wearing , they do pick up everything you are near . my 9 yeah old niece tried to get me to give them to her maybe 30 times , haha . I ordered her her own set for her birthday . Shh ! I 'm pleased . I 'm not a dancer , well not in 15 years anyway , I ordered them for folding up in my purse to have when my high heels get too uncomfortable . They 're gon na be way cuter than any other foldable flats !
 these slippers pretty much fit , i 'm an 8 in street shoes so i ordered this half size bigger -LRB- 8 1/2 -RRB- and they fit perfectly ! they look pretty awesome too !
 I received these the very next day that I ordered them , and got free shipping . They appear to be good quality and look nice . I ordered them for one of my kids after the dance store I ordered all of the shoes from was out of stock in that one size . Unfortunately , I wo n't have the rest of them from the dance store for a week or so , and I had to pay for shipping through them ! Now I wish I ordered all of them from Amazon . Good to know for next time !
 I love Capezio cobra ballet shoe 's fit . The fit is better than Bloch Prolite II leather ballet shoes I bought here in Australia . When they say it 's street shoe size ... it definitely is ! Too bad the seller does n't ship overseas . But good thing my mother-in-law came to visit me so I had Amazon deliver it to her CA address . : -RRB-
 These things wo n't last forever , but they 're a good deal considering the price . They also fitted fine , I normally wear a 7 , and I did n't have any problems with sizing . The only real downfall is that they are lined in white . I have dirty feet and after two hours of dancing the shoes are already showing their age .
 YAY ! I wanted them so bad but after reading the reviews about them being too small i became discouraged , so i decided to go ahead and get some anyway . Im usually a size 8 1/2 in street shoes so I bought a size 12 ballet shoes and they fit like a glove ! the little strings above the toes are adjustable and the split leather soles are great for my roughtness . No I an not a dancer but I love them to prance around the house and they are great for plane travel ! these are the best and i will always buy these .
 Ive always wanted a pair of Lavers but never purchased them . Im really glad amazob had them so cheap ! I couldnt refuse the deal ! Great , stylish , lightweight , comfortable and downright slick shoe !!!
 They fit well , look nice , and are comfortable ! Ca n't ask for anything more than that ! Came packaged appropriately and looks just like the product description .
 It 's great that adidias has brought back all the old styles from the 70s & 80s when sneakers were sneakers.great fit and will last a year at least .
 this is probally the 10-15th pair i bought . the look great and all my friends love them . my teenage kids friends even like them and want to know where i find them . i tell them `` AMAZON '' where else .
 This is a pretty simple shoe , not really any way you can go wrong unless it starts falling apart in a week -LRB- which I hope it does n't -RRB- . One thing to note is that the upper part is shinier than it is shown to be in the pictures . That 's probably just because the image does n't show how it 's sort of like a plastic mesh type material that reflects light pretty well .
 I recently bought a pair of Rod Laver tennis shoes and I have nothing but good things to say . The shoes look great and are quite comfortable . They came to my house around 4 days after ordering them .
 I 'm a huge fan of Adidas shoes in general , so this review may seemed biased . However , of all the pairs of shoes I own , these are my favorite . They 're sleek , comfortable , airy , and true to size . Great for everyday use , but I would n't buy them for any sport activity as some of the reviewers have .
 These are my all time favorite . I found my first pair in 2003 and wear Rod Lavers 90 % of the time ever since . They are impossible to find in Canada , the Adidas store downtown does n't even know what they are , but said lots of people ask for them . When ever I got to NYC , I pop in to shoe mania at Broadway and 13th -LRB- Union Square -RRB- and take advantage of their buy one get one 1/2 off deal . The size is true , I am a 9 1/2 and they fit with a little extra room to play with . These shoes are also perfect for people with wide feet .
 These have been the best tennis shoes I have ever owned and I will continue to buy them as long as they keep making them . Nice comfortable fit with good support . They do n't wear out easily ...
 el producto llego a tiempo , son de muy buena calidad , igual a las fotos , lo recomiendo a toda la comunidad
 they are so nive that i am thinking to buy a few more pairs of the same kind very nice
 estan muy bonito los tenis y el envio estuvo rapido y bien preparado espero que siguen haciendo un muy buen trabajo muchas gracias
 Dynamite ! I do n't know where these came from , but they are the real deal . I have received a lot of compliments on these , both from over 40 folks who remember , and from my kids teen friends .
 I 've worn this since the '70s when they were `` In '' . I guess a lot of shoes are making a come back . These were the original `` gel '' like comfort shoes . When I was playing tennis , these were my favorite , along with Converse worn by Jimmy Connors . Nowadays , people throw their sneakers in the wash when it needs cleaning . Back then we hose spray ours and leave to dry . For the price , you ca n't beat this one . Also , try Puma Clyde/Suede , one of my favorites . One other pair I 'm looking at right now is the Adidas Country-not the Country II . But you ca n't go wrong with the Rod Laver .
 You ca n't buy Rod Lavers in any stores so you have to buy them online . I bought them as a gift for my husband for Christmas - I ordered them and they were at my door in DAYS , I was very relieved . Thanks !
 I Love these shoes , used to buy them all the time in stores , but ca n't find them anywhere but online anymore ! These are true to size and continue to be my favorite casual shoes ! Arrived on time and in perfect condition !
 This shoe has been around for so long and it is still one of the best shoes on the universe not only that but its amazing for hacky sack once u lace it right and it opens the to area great . But all around best shoe ever !!!!!
 this is about the 6-7th pair of these i have bought . i still have the pair from a couple of years back ! these look great , and im always getting complements/questions about them.all in all , just a great pair of sneakers . these are what i wore in high school , and theyre still cool today . ask any younger generation , and they will tell you the same !
 This shoe does n't only look great , but it also fits great and has nice traction . I also could n't believe how inexpensive it was .
 My son absolutely loves these shoes . He spends a lot of time creating art on them w/Sharpies , it 's great they wear so well . Because they are a tennis shoe , they 're supportive w / plenty of cushioning in in the soles . Thumbs up for these classic gems ! BTW , fit runs true to size .
 Judge the style for yourself , but the quality / fit is good -LRB- same as any other adidas shoe to me -RRB- . I think they look great .
 I had these 25 years ago . They were simply the best shoe I 've ever worn . Am going to buy them again .
 youll have a hard time finding this shoe in stores . i just wish they had more colors . great shoe !!!
 Great shoe that fits nicely . It matches the size that it is supposed to be -LRB- at least for size 12 -RRB- . I have no problems with this shoe and wear it everyday ; this is my third pair as well .
 This is the third pair of Lavers I 've had over an 8 year span . I would n't recommend wearing them for tennis or any other sport , but rather just to kick around in . This is a classic design that transcends time . I find the fit to be true to size . You can dress up or down in them , because they 're that versatile .
 30 years ago the Rod Laver tennis shoe was the shoe to have . It was ahead of its time much like the Nike Aggasi 's were in the late 80 's . Funny how shoes have evolved , with air in the soles , and tire rubber for the soles , etc and the cost is over $ 100 . Yet the Rod Laver has not changed it is still the same shoe it was 30 years ago , much like you ask how could you play tennis with a wooden racket how could you wear these on the court?The shoe runs true to size and is wider than Nikes . It breathes well thanks to the mesh upper . It is a very comfortable and stylish shoe . It may not be the best for court but you can not beat this as a weekend casual shoe .
 They are a very good shoes , but the size runs smaller than the other brands.Think of that when you are shopping .
 i bought this for some one . . not sure what the hell become of them and this shoes , do n't even know if it fit them or not
 THIS IS A VERY COMFORTABLE SHOE AND YOU WILL DEFINITELY BE PLEASED WITH THESE ON YOUR FEET , TO JUST WALK AROUND IN OR PLAY TENNIS OR JUST AS CASUAL FOOTWEAR !!!!!
 company delivered shoes as promised , wish I could have tried them on before purchase
 I adore these shoes ! They are comfortable and feel true to size . I have a slender foot , but these do n't slide around on my feet at all and I can stand for long hours in them without a problem . They are adorable with a pair of jeans or with a skirt . I watched and waited for these to go on sale and they were worth every penny I spent !
 Everywhere I go women compliment this shoes , I can walk comfortably and also they make my legs look really really long .
 Can I just tell you that these shoes are a must have ! I love , love , love these babies . They are so hot and I look good in them . If you like `` high '' heels , then they are for you . When you get them , you 'll know exactly how I feel .

 Once I find a good sneaker I stay with it . The toe box is roomy and the inner sole comes out to fit my orthotic . My back feels better also when I walk . I know it is a running shoe but this is the best walker for me .

 Love these shoes ! They feel great and fit well - 8W . Perfect for professional events or evenings out . My new favorite dress shoe brand !

 This is a great all around shoe . It 's definitely what you expect from Dr. Martens , and more some : - -RRB-
 i like this type of shoes , i 'm very glad that i bought this pair , i wear this shoes , and i 'm lucky -RRB- -RRB-
 I first came across these slippers during my honeymoon in Kauai in Sept. 07 . The resort I stayed at did n't have my size in stock but after I tried on the slippers -LRB- one size too big -RRB- I knew I had to have them . Bought them via Amazon and I am extremely satisfied with the purchase . They are very comfortable and form to your foot for a perfect fit . I would highly recommend these slippers to anyone looking for a stylish , comfortable slipper at a descent price .

 just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo . I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box . They feel like I already broke them in . These are going to be great for pants or skirts . I 'm very happy with them .
 I soooo love these boots . . the colour is great , different than any I ever had . They are also so very comfortable , even the first time I wore them . the leather did not need time to break like other boots . I love them , the colour , the feel and the height is just right !!
 I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot , the color , the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort . I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores .
 Super comfy boots from day 1 ! NO break-in time which is an added bonus . I 've had many compliments on them . They DO run true-to size . Shipping was faster than predicted : -RRB-
 Absolutely beautiful boot and ca n't wait to wear them . We do n't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can . Sorry I ca n't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport , I doubt I will be disappointed .
 Love this style , I remember my younger brothers and friends wearing them in the 70 's !! These sneakers are VERY well made and I would expect they 'll outlast other brands my son has worn before . The only negative I can even think of is the fact that they are more `` stylish '' than functional for wearing to school on days when they have gym class . They 're HEAVY and may not be the best choice for `` running laps '' !!
 These are light weight -LSB- another reviewer said they were heavy , not true -RSB- and less bulky than most `` skate '' shoes . I bought a brown and black pair for my sons who also think they are great !
 I have another pair for outside , cold . I want another one of these for in and out of car and office and home visits for winters in Minnesota . They are boots , not too warm in the car , office , or people 's homes , but with pants look more like a shoe and less like a boot ! I 'm buying another pair .
 These are great because they run wide - that 's hard to find . Slight heel , but not uncomfortable , even when walking a lot .

 Ellegant , great quality materials , excellent taste ... pretty unique.I 'm not a fan of that kind of ankle wrap , but this time , I simply did n't care .
 I got so sick and tired of keeping track of my wallet was still in my back pocket , that when I came across an aquaintence waiting in line at a conveinence store , I noticed his wallet when he pulled it out . I asked him how does that wallet work out for you , He said , I use to buy a new wallet every other year or sooner if it got wet or lost it buy slipping out of his back pocket . He said he had this wallet for three and a 1/2 years and is still in perfect condition . I searched online for hours till I came across this same one . I bought one . After two years , I bought a back up . Then , when my son got old enough to carry one , I bought three more . These are very well made wallets , durable , elegant and slip resistnet which kinda of makes them harder for pick pockets to get them out of your pants . I will never buy another type of wallet as long as these are made available .
 Bought this as a present for my father-in-law . He really liked it - it 's perfect for him . It 's just the right size to hold all of his cards and money - but most of all , it 's durable !

 These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress . Furthermore , on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are . I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry . 5 stars from me .

 First off , I 'm not really a kid , but I do n't want to sign up for an acount . Know that . I bought a pair a couple months ago . They obviously get kudos in the cool facter right off the bat . Then I put them to the real test . On the court . They are super comfortable and are still holding up great . They also breathe very well.This brings me to the only problems . Soon after I bought a pair , my friend did too . He plays in them not only on the hard-court , but on the black top when he 's practicing also . Therefore he uses them A LOT . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins . I 've only heard of this happening to a couple people , but if you abuse your shows as much as my friend does , you might want to look else where . Also the sound of the pump is audible . Not terribly noticable , expecialy on the court.All in all , this is a great shoe and really encourage you buying it . Whether you want it for hoops or for style , it 's sick no matter what .
 I just re-purchase that shoes , around yr ago , i bought the white color speers , when I found out is discount item , I re-purchase another pair -LRB- Black/gold -RRB- . That is a comfortable , cool shoes.Just for your information , I am working in HK . It 's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here . I need to purchase online and ship to HK . -LRB- Takes 14 days -RRB- . So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player . That is 100 % good choice . -LRB- Try it ... Very Good Deal -RRB- Excuse me ! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes ?
 This shoe is off da chain i bought this shoe when it came out . I gots the blue and white ones and they comfterable as hell they gots a spring in the sole so dat the wheel spins the only bad thing is that when you walk you hear the air from the spring but overall this shoe is off da hizzle .
 This shoes look sleek no doubt about that . Ive been trying to get my hands on them for a while now but i ca n't seem to find them anywhere . Can anyone tell me where to buy a beautfiul shoe like this ?
 I got 4 letters 4 you P-I-M-P
 I ummm actually have n't worn these shoes yet but . They get props from me just cause they look good . And they is original . so poo poo to you .

 These boots came nicely packaged and just slipped on , comfortably , right out of the box . Finished with attention to detail ... looks just like the pictures indicate.I got my size -LSB- 12M -RSB- and they fit well ... so , it appears to be true to size.I plan to wear these when the snow falls !
 I just ordered my third pair of these boots . I wear them in everything from mud to snow , gravel to concrete for 10-12 hours a day , five to six days a week , all year round and they are awesome . I usually get about two years out of each pair , so it evens out the money you 'll shell out for them . I 'll keep ordering them until they do n't make them anymore !

 I 've been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon . They , of course , had it and i ordered it immediately . It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove .
 I like these shoes very much , i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon , and these rank in my top 3 pairs . Very white , very easy to keep clean . I have wide feet , and these are not tight at all .
 The Puma Men 's Roma Shoe is simple but classy , yet good for everyday use . A great selection of colors assures that you 'll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe . Not only do these shoes look good , but they feel good also . I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile !

 I could not believe how light these shoes are - you do n't feel any weight at all . And yet they are roomy enough . My girl 's toes are rather wide , and this is a perfect fit for her . They have good inner fabric lining , are very comfortable , and look great .
 This is a nice slip on shoe that goes with lots of neutral and natural tones . The heel is a comfortable height . I am happy with it .

 I soooo love these boots . . the colour is great , different than any I ever had . They are also so very comfortable , even the first time I wore them . the leather did not need time to break like other boots . I love them , the colour , the feel and the height is just right !!
 I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot , the color , the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort . I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores .
 Super comfy boots from day 1 ! NO break-in time which is an added bonus . I 've had many compliments on them . They DO run true-to size . Shipping was faster than predicted : -RRB-

 These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress . Furthermore , on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are . I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry . 5 stars from me .
 i just buyed it for a gift to my girlfriend ... she loves this pair of Wristbands
 The Style is trendy , cute , sexy , and flirty . It 's perfect for Spring , Summer , and Early Fall !

 I ca n't give you a professional review on these but my daughter is 7 and she has n't taken them off since Christmas she dances as she walks in the kitchen and to her room . She wears a size 1 and I got her a size 2 they are a little big but there are pull strings to form them to your feet so they snugged down nice .

 I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that . But , once on , they are the most moldable , soft , well fitting and supportive sandals I have . I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily . Another complaint is that they are so hard to find ! I have several pairs and will keep looking ...
 I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect . They arrived on time and the fit was exact . Will certainly order from the manufacturer again .
 I previously owned a pair of these sandals -LRB- over 5 years ago -RRB- which I really liked , but for some reason they no longer fit confortably . I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels , but more casual , loose fitting shoes . My new sandals fit beautifully . I can wear them all day long in complete comfort . I 'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too .
 I do not ususally order shoes but I was very pleased with this purchase and Peltz Shoes . The shoes were shipped immediatley and I received them within 3 days . Would purchase from them again . Thanks
 This is my second pair , in as many years . Comfortable , nice hieght and affordable .
 I love this shoe . It 's dressy , but casual enough for every day summer wear , and it 's comfortable for walking around every day . I bought one years ago at a retail store , then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and could n't find anything else that came close . I found these here , and ordered the same ones I had before , and am very happy about it . Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6 !
 Very nice shoe it would be great if this style came in more colors . Shoes are comfortable and sturdy , great for walking .
 I ordered the Mimosa sandal in 7E Camel . It is true to size and comfortable . I love the style , looks dressy even as a low heel . The footpad inside is man-made material , but with stockings it is comfortable . Too bad the footpad is n't microfiber or something like that .
 very comfortable shoe . I have worn these for many years & have many colors . Good with casual or dressy . I was so happy I found the black again . For a long time they were n't available .
 This is a perfect sandal for dress or casual . I needed a navy pair to wear when I am working conferences and these are great . They are comfortable and look very neat with dresses or suits .
 This LifeStride shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had - I like it so much I have it in three different colors . Even after wearing it all day my feet are feeling great . You ca n't go wrong with this shoe .
 I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart . They were so very comfortable , and worked well with different types of outfits , including shorts and capris . The only problem , -LRB- which other people have mentioned -RRB- , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum
 I have these sandals in five different colors . They are incredibly comfortable yet stylish , and can be worn with slacks or skirts for work or play . Although they are not leather , they look and feel just like it . Great for fashion-minded vegans or those looking for a comfortable , inexpensive sandal .
 Very comfortable and cute shoe . I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size . I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look .
 I bought four pair of these in different colors . They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you 've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies ! ;--RRB- I have long , narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well . I am absolutely delighted with them .
 Very cute flat shoe . If your feet tend to swell however I would order a wide width . Other than that the shoe looks great with jeans or capri pants !
 I love these Life Stride Sandals . Can be worn when dressed up or casual . Very comfortable . Planning on purchasing more in several colors .
 I love these shoes and have them in blue , white and black . I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts . fit true to size .
 I love these sandals and am unhappy that they are discontinued . If there are any out there in size 8 give me an email !
 I bought these shoes to wear to a wedding ... they were so comfortable I could have danced all night and nearly did !! Thank you !!
 I bought this shoe in mimosa and navy . I need the wide width . The sizing was very true.I am very satisfied with this shoe and highly recommend to anyone needing the wider widths.N.Mayo
 For the price I paid these shoes are great . Do n't forget to order one size larger for women . Great for Salsa .
 Love it . I found this flexable shoe to be a joy to wear . I have never worn dance shoes before and find this shoe to be a great find !!!!
 I purchased these pumps for my daughter because my size was sold out . I love these shoes . My daughter loves these shoes . They look great and she says that they are extremely comfortable .
 really liked the look . they make me think of jazz parties and movie stars of 20 's . maybe it 's because the gold color . . but anyway . it 's just a funky piece , i 'm happy to have them.and they are really comfortable too . the heel is high enough , but you do n't really feel it.bad features i found out are :1 . gold ones look more glossy than on the picture , so it gives a little cheap look . but not too cheap . i can deal with it : -RRB- 2 . also the leather inside the shoe . . i believe it 's not genuine , and that makes feet sweat a little bit.so the quality is not that good , but the shoe itself is comfortable . really good for the price .
 I love this shoes , and I typically have size 8 feet , 8.5 is a bit large for me . I had to return this shoes in order to obtain a size larger , since 8M was too small somehow . I recommend you get a half size larger than you would normally buy .
 As usual Aerosole has made another unique fashionable yet comfortable shoe . I bought the gold color and get comments everytime I wear . Although I would not want to go all day shopping with this shoe , it is great for work or evening wear .
 i absolutely love this shoe ... i wear it everwhere ... and it goes with just about anything . . its so pretty n comfortable . . i love it ! will definitely be buying the gold ones ' too .
 Ive had these shoes for about a month now and I ca n't get them off . They are quite comfy and do n't sting as much as the usual . One day preparing to shower I took off all my clothing but was surprised at the shower door . I still had the darn shoes on . When shoes are to comfy to notice ... you 've got a winner !!
 1 . SEXY2 . COMFY3 . GOOD QUALITYReport Signature shoes never let me down !
 I 've had my eye on these since Bridget from The Fashionista Diaries wore them all over that show ... and I actually found them in white from a vintage/secondhand store -LRB- for $ 20 !! I was so excited ! -RRB- They are a tad worn but I think it makes them look even cooler ! I actually got them a half-size up -LRB- 9 -RRB- from what I normally wear -LRB- 8.5 -RRB- , and they fit like a glove ... I do n't know if thats just me though . They are pretty easy to walk in because of the platform , and I love them with colored or black tights for winter !
 SEXY SEXY SEXY !! These shoe are georgous . THey look better in person than on the website . This is now a pair of my favorite shoes .
 Absolutely Divine ! These pumps are a lot better in person than in the pic . The entire shoe is well crafted and the soles are super comfy with the padding .
 I LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE SHOES ! I PURCHASED THE GOLD ONES AND THEY ARE SO PRETTY AND MATCH PERFECT WITH MY DRESS THEY CAME VERY QUICK AND I AM OVERLY SATISFIED !
 I recieved the shoes in a timely manner and when I needed to exchange for a different size I did n't have any problems . I did end up returning the shoes . They were shaped rather odd and I could n't wear them .
 I perfer new balance brand in walking shoes for their fit and comfort the pair ordered arrives as scheduled and the size color were as ordered . pass pairs of new balance walking shoes have lasted a long time with little signs of wear
 These are very comfortable walking shoes , though a little tight in the width of the toe box . New Balance suggests that one buys a half-size larger , which is not an option with a size 14 -LRB- so I did n't -RRB- . If buyers are not aware , they should be
 Recently bought New Balance MW627 - not a great color but excellent fit - light weight and a great price .
 The shoes were fine but when I went to return them Amazon said since it was my error in buying the incorrect size that I would be charged a return fee . I would never try to buy any type of clothing from them again . The problem it seems is that I was honest by saying that they did n't fit instead of lying and saying I did n't like them instead . What a stupid policy .
 This is the best walking shoe I have ever had . It is much betterthan any of my sneakers . After a one mile walk , my feet feel fine.The same walk with sneakers makes me want to remove my sneakersasap .
 These are really nice . Very comfortable , light , and I like the look with jeans or dockers .
 Excellent product , excellent service , prompt delivery . This is the second pair of New Balance walking shoes I 've purchased . Perfect fit .
 Short of playing a sport or using an exercise machine in the gym , these shoes are perfect for any activity . Like any man -LRB- * -RRB- , I buy two pairs of shoes every year or so , and these are the ones I 've settled on . I 've been using this same style for the last 3 years , and I will keep buying this shoe until I die . If they stop making it , I 'm stocking up . They DO come from China - but they 're not cheaply made like most of the crappy things that come from there - these will last . -LRB- * -RRB- Unlike most women who buy more shoes in 3 years than a man buys in his lifetime.You know what I really like about this shoe ? It 's good enough for the office or most outdoor activities , and it 's not covered with all those flashy graphics and idiotic logos that the kids seem to like . Stupid kids . If you 've been in a shoe store in the last 5 - 10 years looking for shoes for normal adult males , you 'll know exactly what I mean.TIP
 I purchased two pair of New Balance Walking Shoes at the same time . I sent a glowing review of my firstpair and the service received . I did n't think a separate email was required . Suffice it to say that I was pleased with all aspects transaction especially the shoes themselves . Thanks !
 I bought EE -LRB- wide -RRB- and it 's a little bit thin , but are excelent to walk . Very good . Comfortables .
 I was looking for a walking shoe to wear everyday and on vacations . We travel a great deal and a comfortable , supportive shoe makes traveling so much easier . The NB MW627 fit the bill perfectly . The size was spot on . I wanted a non-white shoe for world travel and I wanted a comfortable and supportive shoe for both city and wilderness trips . I give this shoe 5 stars .
 The best walking shoe ever . I have tried a lot and these were the best . It was also great that they can pass as business casual for work . I bought two pair and wore them until I wore out the soles . They no longer make them and the models that replaced them are not styled so the will pass as business casual . If I could go back in time I would buy 50 pairs , enough to last me my lifetime .
 These shoes are great walking shoes with superior support . New Balance has replaced these with a new model that is not near as good . I bought two pair and wish I could find some more , the quality and fir are great and New Balance should have stayed with a proven mode .
 These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress . Furthermore , on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are . I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry . 5 stars from me .
 The shoes are a great value for hip hop and jazz . They work great when for hip hop tricks and tumbling . I needed to order a 1/2 size larger .
 These shoes are SO comfortable and they are good for walking . I received them from Discount Dance Supply about 3 or 4 days after I ordered through Amazon a month ago . The dance supply company also sends you an email letting you know your product was shipped which I really appreciate.I am a 6 1/2 in gym shoes so I ordered a size 8 . They are a perfect fit and there is just a little room left on the sides . I ordered 1 size up with my previous dance shoes -LRB- per my dance instructors advice -RRB- and they were too tight . Thanks to the other Amazon reviewers and just to be on the safe side , especially ordering through the mail , I went up 1 1/2 sizes . That being said , with these shoes , I do think you might be able to get away with going one size up just because of how comfortable the material feels on your feet , but you may or may not want to take that chance . : -RRB- I have n't danced in a few years so right now I use my dance shoes strictly for aerobics and walking because of the support . Ever since I started buying dance shoes about 5 or 6 years ago , I do n't like working out in regular gym shoes anymore . Eventually , I am going to go back to the Bloch Boost Dance Sneaker because I think the support is a little better and I like the higher heel on the back of the shoe . That 's just what I 'm used to.This dance sneaker is a very good price , a very good fit and worth the investment , especially if you are on a budget and are in need some new dance shoes.Best of luck in your shopping : -RRB-
 They really do n't say whether it 's a man 's or woman 's shoe . I guess it could be both . I ordered 1.5 sizes up from street shoe and it was WAY too small . I had to pay shipping back to dealer . I like the idea of a slippery sneaker since dancing in the summer in Georgia is quite hot , and I can wear this with shorts to practice and classes and not feel like a dork .
 I bought the shoes after reading everyone elses reviews , and they are fully worth the cost . However ladies please buy at least a size and a half bigger than dress shoe size . I wear a 8 dress shoes and bought a 91/2 of the dance shoes . They fit nicely . I wear them to Dance aerobics class and have alot of fun in them .
 I have had these boots for about 2 years , I have hiked through the woods , dug 4 ' deep ditches in hard clay , and I take several motorcycle trips every year . I wear these boots almost every day and the sole is barely worn and the insoles are still in good shape . After all this I just polished them with kiwi parade gloss shoe polish to a mirror finish that would make your drill instructor proud -LRB- not an exaggeration they do take a good polish -RRB- . Before I got these boots I went through about two pair of shoes a year , these boots are so tough that they will easily last for another 2 years . I would recommend these boots to anyone that needs a good pair of boots that with little maintenance will faithfully last for years , and for the price can not be beat . I would actually rate these boots at 4.5 stars because they only have one minor flaw ... Just after these boots were worn-in I noticed that the lining on the insole was pealing off , they were easy to remove so I took them to my sewing machine and stitched around the perimeter and they were as good as new and are still in use .
 I switched out my military issue jump boots for a pair of these Bate 's zip-sided Enforcers . The construction is solid , and the cushioning is greatly superior to that in a standard issue military boots . If you 've never worn boots with a zipper , I highly recommend them . The zipper makes getting out the door much easier . I do not know whether or not I would deploy without a backup pair of boots . If the zipper were to fail on these -LRB- in a deployed environment -RRB- , you 'd have a heck of a time keeping them on your feet . For stateside use -LRB- e.g. everyday Police use -RRB- , they are a great boot .
 These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress . Furthermore , on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are . I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry . 5 stars from me .
 I am very happy with these shoes . I was n't sure about the toggle type closure but so far they are so fast and easy -LRB- and my kids ca n't untie them . -RRB- It looks you could also put in regular laces if you needed to . The shoes are light and supportive . I have started going on walks again now that my feet feel so good .

 This boot quickly became my favorite . Light weight but tough and durable with soles that are easy to clean after working in the garden . After two years I 'm ready to get another pair but the old ones are still going strong .

 I 've had these boots for 4 years now and I love them ! They 're super lightweight , comfortable , and warm ! They 've held up wonderfully with light-moderate use . My only complaint is that they 're a pain to get on since they lace allll the way to the top . I wish they had quick laces for the upper 5 inches or so as they would be much easier to get on and off .

 I bought these for my daughter a couple of months ago . The quality was first , the fit was perfect . Price is well below specialty dance stores .
 My daughter was fitted for her first pointe shoe in August 2012 . This is the exact shoe that a professional selected for her . The box broke down & her foot had grown a bit . I ordered from this vendor and quickly received the shoe . It did not fit & I was shipped a replacement shoe while returning the shoes I ordered . NOTE

 These shoes are great - but be sure to order a WHOLE size larger than your normal size , these shoes run small
 man , the tilt is a classic skate shoe by a perfect companyi highly recommend all emerica products as they are of extremely high quality .
 These sandals are quite unique . I actually had to order one size larger because I really wanted to try them and even with that , they have come through for my aching feet . I love the fact that its basically one peice . No worry about stretched out toe seps or broken arch connections . The design allows for superior comfort , which includes a sort of squish down firmness with every step . They are quite thick , good protection .
 I have bought this product before and find it to be the most comfortable and longlasting slide . It is easy to clean -LRB- lanudry or brush -RRB- and offers a great fit without straps or adjustables . The underside holes allow for great ventilation . I wear them mostly around the house , but also for local shopping , the dog run and even the beach.My old pair is still wearable after 2 year 's regular use , so I kept them for when my boyfriend stays over.I might have liked to try another color , but to due to stock availability I 've stuck with basic black.All in all , I 'm very happy with the purchase .
 My 18 yr-old son found these at a local store , then had me go online to get three more pair . This despite the fact that they are durable and sturdy . He wears them everywhere , even bicycling -LRB- against my better judgement of safety , of course -RRB- and loves them . They are fairly rigid and will not fit everyone , but if you 're lucky enough to have the right shaped foot you 'll probably love them .
 And light weight and easy to walk with . Good traction . However they do have bristles that stick up for your feet to walk on , so if you like the massage to your feet , you will like these . If you like a smooth bottom , then these are not for you .
 I bought these for my husband , he does a lot of mountain biking and these are great to grab and go , especially in water .
 But you must pay attention to the size warning . I ordered as instructed -- a size or so larger . The shoes upon arrival were barely large enough -LRB- I usually wear a 6.5 to 7.0 US ; I ordered an 8 and they barely fit -RRB- . I use my shoes for my Zumba class . People in the class are complaining that their Zumba shoes are too slippery , but mine are slippery as well . I use it as an excuse to move more fluidly and do full rotations . However ... their shoes were $ 60 and mine were under $ 30 . So , you decide ...
 I took heed to the reviewers about the small size of this shoe and ordered an 8 -LRB- ! -RRB- although I normally wear a size 6 and a half to 7 . Thanks to the reviewers , the shoe size was perfect . I wear them to my dance class -LRB- recreational folkdance -RRB- , and they 're the most comfortable shoes I own . Great price , comfortable , and attractive .

 I am a certified sockaholic , I love these socks ! They look great , hold up super well and feel terrific ! You can not go wrong with these !
 My previous experience with the Sanuk sandals was with their Grasshoppers , and wow ... do I love them . Until then , I had not been a fan of flip-flops . But I got ta tell ya , the Grasshoppers were the ultimate in cool , summer comfort.That 's why I was most excited to find the Streamline Beach Basic Sandals on Amazon . My Grasshoppers are still worn frequently on those warm summer days , but I wanted a pair other than green and a possible replacement for if/when my Hoppers are just to worn out -LRB- I seriously hope that never happens -RRB- . I searched and searched for something similar and finally found them through Amazon.Here are the reasons you need a pair of these :1 -RRB- These are little more chunky than most flip-flops you see out there . Not only do I think that makes them more comfortable and stylish , they also seem more masculine because of it .2 -RRB- The 35mm strap is neoprene backed for comfort . From my trials with other flip-flops -LRB- including other styles from Sanuk -RRB- , this makes them the ultimate in comfort ... along with :3 -RRB- Anatomically molded footbed features toe bar , heel cup and arch support for all-day comfort . Not only does this make them more durable , but the ` squishy-ness ' of the sole is awesome on your feet.The only drawback that I can think of , and this is of course kinda nit-picky , is that the thicker sole takes longer to dry if it gets wet . But that has never been a serious issue.Can you tell I love these things ? Sanuk knows what they 're doing , I sincerely hope they keep this style around indefinitely . Get these now .

 I bought this shoe for an amateur dance class I took . I 'm not really a dancer , but I thought this class would be fun and I needed something that would be comfortable that I could move in . These are extremely comfortable . I ordered a half size bigger than what I normally take and it fit perfectly . I was able to do turns where I had to do them and I had no sore feet afterwards .

 I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart . They were so very comfortable , and worked well with different types of outfits , including shorts and capris . The only problem , -LRB- which other people have mentioned -RRB- , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum
 I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that . But , once on , they are the most moldable , soft , well fitting and supportive sandals I have . I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily . Another complaint is that they are so hard to find ! I have several pairs and will keep looking ...
 I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect . They arrived on time and the fit was exact . Will certainly order from the manufacturer again .
 I previously owned a pair of these sandals -LRB- over 5 years ago -RRB- which I really liked , but for some reason they no longer fit confortably . I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels , but more casual , loose fitting shoes . My new sandals fit beautifully . I can wear them all day long in complete comfort . I 'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too .
 I do not ususally order shoes but I was very pleased with this purchase and Peltz Shoes . The shoes were shipped immediatley and I received them within 3 days . Would purchase from them again . Thanks
 I was disappointed that the color of the shoes looks more black than navy blue , but it does allow me to wear them with black or blue outfits . They are a little tight to start with , but with wear , I hope they will loosen a bit . Otherwise , they are fine .
 This is my second pair , in as many years . Comfortable , nice hieght and affordable .
 I bought this shoe in mimosa and navy . I need the wide width . The sizing was very true.I am very satisfied with this shoe and highly recommend to anyone needing the wider widths.N.Mayo
 I love this shoe . It 's dressy , but casual enough for every day summer wear , and it 's comfortable for walking around every day . I bought one years ago at a retail store , then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and could n't find anything else that came close . I found these here , and ordered the same ones I had before , and am very happy about it . Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6 !
 Very nice shoe it would be great if this style came in more colors . Shoes are comfortable and sturdy , great for walking .
 I ordered the Mimosa sandal in 7E Camel . It is true to size and comfortable . I love the style , looks dressy even as a low heel . The footpad inside is man-made material , but with stockings it is comfortable . Too bad the footpad is n't microfiber or something like that .
 very comfortable shoe . I have worn these for many years & have many colors . Good with casual or dressy . I was so happy I found the black again . For a long time they were n't available .
 This is a perfect sandal for dress or casual . I needed a navy pair to wear when I am working conferences and these are great . They are comfortable and look very neat with dresses or suits .
 This LifeStride shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had - I like it so much I have it in three different colors . Even after wearing it all day my feet are feeling great . You ca n't go wrong with this shoe .
 I have these sandals in five different colors . They are incredibly comfortable yet stylish , and can be worn with slacks or skirts for work or play . Although they are not leather , they look and feel just like it . Great for fashion-minded vegans or those looking for a comfortable , inexpensive sandal .
 Very comfortable and cute shoe . I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size . I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look .
 I bought four pair of these in different colors . They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you 've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies ! ;--RRB- I have long , narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well . I am absolutely delighted with them .
 Very cute flat shoe . If your feet tend to swell however I would order a wide width . Other than that the shoe looks great with jeans or capri pants !
 I love these Life Stride Sandals . Can be worn when dressed up or casual . Very comfortable . Planning on purchasing more in several colors .
 I love these shoes and have them in blue , white and black . I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts . fit true to size .
 I love these sandals and am unhappy that they are discontinued . If there are any out there in size 8 give me an email !
 I bought these shoes to wear to a wedding ... they were so comfortable I could have danced all night and nearly did !! Thank you !!
 I ordered these for my daughter , she has wide and flat feet , so I was a little worried about the sizing but they were perfect!I recommend ordering a size to a size and a half larger than your normal size .
 Great shoes ! My daughter is not a beginner , but they lasted as long as the more expensive shoes . After trying we bought several more of those .
 , . RECOMMENDED ... . QUALITY AND DESIGN ... VERY GOOD PRICE IN SALE ... VERY GOOD PRODUCT ... RECOMMENDED ... . QUALITY AND DESIGN ... VERY GOOD PRICE IN SALE ... VERY GOOD PRODUCT ... RECOMMENDED . .
 purchased this item for my 11 year old just starting in point class , excellent quality very helpful on the phone .
 This is a great pointe shoe for the price . The fit chart was very accurate , making it much easier to order online . I saved over $ 25 buying online with free shipping . The only problem we have with this shoe is it 's durability . As my daughter 's pointe skills improved and her workouts intensified , these shoes failed to hold up for more than 3 months , approximately 14 classes . That can get expensive . However , we 've not found another shoe that holds up better AND fits and feels so well on her feet . These are really easy for her to break in and do n't leave blisters or in-grown toenails . Other brands we 've tried have hurt her feet . We purchased the Capezio `` ballet pink '' ribbon in 3 yard length which matches these shoes perfectly . I also found some Gaynor Minden elastic in the same color that also matches these shoes and the ribbon , all purchased from Amazon . See my reviews for these products .
 These have been the best pointe shoes for my daughter . She has a slightly wide foot with bunions and the wider box fits her perfect . Please note all pointe shoes should be fitted professionally and nobody should ever be on pointe unless your dancer teacher tells you that you are ready and please make use your school has qualified professional teachers . Starting pointe work too young can cause serious problems .

 I have had these boots for about 2 years , I have hiked through the woods , dug 4 ' deep ditches in hard clay , and I take several motorcycle trips every year . I wear these boots almost every day and the sole is barely worn and the insoles are still in good shape . After all this I just polished them with kiwi parade gloss shoe polish to a mirror finish that would make your drill instructor proud -LRB- not an exaggeration they do take a good polish -RRB- . Before I got these boots I went through about two pair of shoes a year , these boots are so tough that they will easily last for another 2 years . I would recommend these boots to anyone that needs a good pair of boots that with little maintenance will faithfully last for years , and for the price can not be beat . I would actually rate these boots at 4.5 stars because they only have one minor flaw ... Just after these boots were worn-in I noticed that the lining on the insole was pealing off , they were easy to remove so I took them to my sewing machine and stitched around the perimeter and they were as good as new and are still in use .
 I switched out my military issue jump boots for a pair of these Bate 's zip-sided Enforcers . The construction is solid , and the cushioning is greatly superior to that in a standard issue military boots . If you 've never worn boots with a zipper , I highly recommend them . The zipper makes getting out the door much easier . I do not know whether or not I would deploy without a backup pair of boots . If the zipper were to fail on these -LRB- in a deployed environment -RRB- , you 'd have a heck of a time keeping them on your feet . For stateside use -LRB- e.g. everyday Police use -RRB- , they are a great boot .
 Beautiful color leather , well-crafted shoe overall . Comfortable , easy to wear , and in a word

I would recommend these boots to anyone that needs a good pair of boots that with little maintenance will faithfully last for years , and for the price can not be beat . I would actually rate these boots at 4.5 stars because they only have one minor flaw ... Just after these boots were worn-in I noticed that the lining on the insole was pealing off , they were easy to remove so I took them to my sewing machine and stitched around the perimeter and they were as good as new and are still in use .
 I switched out my military issue jump boots for a pair of these Bate 's zip-sided Enforcers . The construction is solid , and the cushioning is greatly superior to that in a standard issue military boots . If you 've never worn boots with a zipper , I highly recommend them . The zipper makes getting out the door much easier . I do not know whether or not I would deploy without a backup pair of boots . If the zipper were to fail on these -LRB- in a deployed environment -RRB- , you 'd have a heck of a time keeping them on your feet . For stateside use -LRB- e.g. everyday Police use -RRB- , they are a great boot .
 I have had these boots for about 2 years , I have hiked through the woods , dug 4 ' deep ditches in hard clay , and I take several motorcycle trips every year . I wear these boots almost every day and the sole is barely worn and the insoles are still in good shape .

 I have purchused these same boots for years . the quality and workmanship are great . these boots are union made inMartinsburg , pa .

 I just bought my third pair of these boots in five years . I found them to be almost indestructible for light machine shop and daily use on the street . They are VERY COMFORTABLE , ideal if one is on your feet all day.They also polish up well and are presentable WORN as a dress boot/shoe . They felt like a favorite , comfortable old pair of shoes from the first time I put them on ... SORT OF INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BUNNY SLIPPERS!The boots are very well made from real leather.They are not heavy duty enough for heavy construction , logging or concrete work . Good for light farm work and driving.THEY ARE THE BEST WEARING WORK BOOT , I HAVE FOUND FOR DAY TO DAY WEAR.The soles have some tread , giving you fair traction in the grass , snow and ice plus have excellent wear resistance.Also ... the boot 's sole patterns does not leave large clumps of the outside on the kitchen floor , while stepping into the house.The boot sizing is pretty much exact . Only buy your exact sizeExcept a WIDER SHOE if you plan to wear multiple pairs of thick socks in the winter.They have an excellent size / width selection . I usually need a 14 EEEEE in a boot.The boots are almost waterproof , you will need to apply a reasonable coat of waterproofing silicone spray or mystery oil leather treatment . KIWI SHOE POLISH makes them shine up very well.The leather uppers are well cut out pattern and sewn together with care.I never had problems with the leather , material , sewn seams splitting or tearing , and no loosening or unusual wear with the heels or soles.The leather is thick enough to protect but still thin enough to be flexible.I have bought both he 6 inch and 8 inch versions of this farm boot.Both boot heights are just as easy to get on and off , however the eight inch high boot does gives you a bit more ankle support.So , I prefer the eight inch height.The only thing I can recommend extra for these boots ... Order a bit thicker , round nylon boot laces , instead of the flat , cotton shoe laces that come FACTORY standard with these boots.If you need soles with more traction get something with a VIBRAM sole.However , trust me , your wife will remind you , often , to remove your boots before coming into the house with VIBRAM soles on.The only tougher and better boots I have seen and bought , have been just as happy with , are the White 's Smoke Jumper Logging Boots and they COST ALMOST $ 500.00 The FARM BOOTS are a great deal ! I wish more American companies made things with this amount of care / pride in the product , a good design philosophy , used quality materials and all put together with wonderful workmanship!The people at WORK AMERICA remind me and hearken back to an earlier time in this country , when something that was stamped AMERICAN MADE or MADE IN USA meant often this product was the best made in the world!http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D94HNQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 I have these sandals in five different colors . They are incredibly comfortable yet stylish , and can be worn with slacks or skirts for work or play . Although they are not leather , they look and feel just like it . Great for fashion-minded vegans or those looking for a comfortable , inexpensive sandal .
 Very comfortable and cute shoe . I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size . I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look .
 I bought four pair of these in different colors . They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you 've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies ! ;--RRB- I have long , narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well . I am absolutely delighted with them .
 Very cute flat shoe . If your feet tend to swell however I would order a wide width . Other than that the shoe looks great with jeans or capri pants !
 I love these Life Stride Sandals . Can be worn when dressed up or casual . Very comfortable . Planning on purchasing more in several colors .
 I love these shoes and have them in blue , white and black . I find them very comfortable to walk in which I appreciate since I usually need orthodic inserts . fit true to size .
 I love these sandals and am unhappy that they are discontinued . If there are any out there in size 8 give me an email !
 I bought these shoes to wear to a wedding ... they were so comfortable I could have danced all night and nearly did !! Thank you !!
 I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart . They were so very comfortable , and worked well with different types of outfits , including shorts and capris . The only problem , -LRB- which other people have mentioned -RRB- , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum
 I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that . But , once on , they are the most moldable , soft , well fitting and supportive sandals I have . I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily . Another complaint is that they are so hard to find ! I have several pairs and will keep looking ...
 I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect . They arrived on time and the fit was exact . Will certainly order from the manufacturer again .
 I previously owned a pair of these sandals -LRB- over 5 years ago -RRB- which I really liked , but for some reason they no longer fit confortably . I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels , but more casual , loose fitting shoes . My new sandals fit beautifully . I can wear them all day long in complete comfort . I 'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too .
 I do not ususally order shoes but I was very pleased with this purchase and Peltz Shoes . The shoes were shipped immediatley and I received them within 3 days . Would purchase from them again . Thanks
 I was disappointed that the color of the shoes looks more black than navy blue , but it does allow me to wear them with black or blue outfits . They are a little tight to start with , but with wear , I hope they will loosen a bit . Otherwise , they are fine .
 This is my second pair , in as many years . Comfortable , nice hieght and affordable .
 I bought this shoe in mimosa and navy . I need the wide width . The sizing was very true.I am very satisfied with this shoe and highly recommend to anyone needing the wider widths.N.Mayo
 I love this shoe . It 's dressy , but casual enough for every day summer wear , and it 's comfortable for walking around every day . I bought one years ago at a retail store , then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and could n't find anything else that came close . I found these here , and ordered the same ones I had before , and am very happy about it . Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6 !
 Very nice shoe it would be great if this style came in more colors . Shoes are comfortable and sturdy , great for walking .
 I ordered the Mimosa sandal in 7E Camel . It is true to size and comfortable . I love the style , looks dressy even as a low heel . The footpad inside is man-made material , but with stockings it is comfortable . Too bad the footpad is n't microfiber or something like that .
 very comfortable shoe . I have worn these for many years & have many colors . Good with casual or dressy . I was so happy I found the black again . For a long time they were n't available .
 This is a perfect sandal for dress or casual . I needed a navy pair to wear when I am working conferences and these are great . They are comfortable and look very neat with dresses or suits .

The only problem , -LRB- which other people have mentioned -RRB- , is that they do tend to run narrow , so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe , I think that they are a great value.Addendum
 I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that . But , once on , they are the most moldable , soft , well fitting and supportive sandals I have . I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily . Another complaint is that they are so hard to find ! I have several pairs and will keep looking ...
 I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect . They arrived on time and the fit was exact . Will certainly order from the manufacturer again .
 I previously owned a pair of these sandals -LRB- over 5 years ago -RRB- which I really liked , but for some reason they no longer fit confortably . I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels , but more casual , loose fitting shoes . My new sandals fit beautifully . I can wear them all day long in complete comfort . I 'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too .
 I do not ususally order shoes but I was very pleased with this purchase and Peltz Shoes . The shoes were shipped immediatley and I received them within 3 days . Would purchase from them again . Thanks
 I was introduced to Converse All-Star 's -LRB- Chuck 's -RRB- two years ago and they are the best shoes I have ever owned . Before I knew about Chuck 's , I would have multiple pairs of sneakers for different activities , now I have one ! They have excellent foot support all the way up the ankle , the only downside is that the soles have no arch and if you are not already flat footed , they will probably make you that way . They are great shoes !
 I am a teacher and at Christmas time each year I ask for a student 's name of whom the counselors or home health nurses know is not going to havea Christmas because of family finances and/or struggles . Well , this year I was given the name of a student I had in my own class and whom I had already had sucha great connection and loved this kid . To find out they were not going to have a Christmas broke my heart !! Anyway , through some other sources , I was able to find out what this student wanted more than anything , if they could ask for just even one gift for Christmas . The student said they would love to have some REAL Chuck Taylor blue high-tops !! The fake ones they had saved money to buy at a local `` discount '' store fell apart so fast and they felt they had wasted their money.So ... I ordered these for that student and had them given anonymously . Let me tell you ... when that student entered my classroom the very morning after the y received these surprise gifted shoes ... that kid was so excited to show me , so happy in general , so excited to see everyone and openly socialize with head held high . Wow ... what great things these shoes did for this student in far more ways thanjust keep their feet dry My heart was fulfilled and this student will forever remember these shoes , I am certain !!
 very good purchase for my daughter , she had a pair before and she would n't take them off unless she went to sleep so they worn out in almost 3 years , so i got this new pair for her for xmas , i 'm sure she 's gon na love them.perfect sizing and quality .
 These were a favorite of mine growing up . The quality seems a tad better these days than when I was growing up . They 're not as comfortable asjogging or walking shoes , but there is a certain casual nostalgia when wearing them . These are not uncomfortable shoes mind you . If youare accustomed to High tech arch support and cushioned soles , these are not the shoes for you . But if you are looking for a basic shoe for youreveryday wear & tear , that have the nostalgic look of the late 50 's -60 's , look no further .
 I am on my third pair of converse , and I LOVE it to bits . They 're reliable -LRB- My first pair lasted 2 years , i was reluctant to buy another since it broke in -RRB- , last forever -LRB- you know , 2 years is a lot considering the other cheap China made crappy shoes -RRB- , and when you break them in , they 're heaven to your feet . One thing though , if you are going to use it for exercising , bad idea . Some Dr.Scholl 's slip-ins might make it more bearable . Overall , comfort 8/10 and style 10/10 . Customizable 10/10 . Great buy !
 Mono-Black Chucks are amazing utility shoes . I wear mine when : * working -LRB- with tie -RRB- * sledding * partying * hiking * gardening * attending black tie formal events -LRB- yes really -RRB- Ironically , the thing Chucks are bad for is the shoe 's original intended purpose
 These shoes are great for the price . They are light and they let your feet breathe easily . Only con is there is no arch support so after wearing the for a while my feet hurt badly .
 These shoes are great , they can be worn down with jeans and a tee or worn with nice dress clothes.I 'm getting the ones in pink.Get these shoes if considering.Very comfy also -LSB- Holla Back -RSB-
 Thank Heavens for those dear sweet chaps at Converse who years and years ago crafted this high-performance , foot-contouring , ankle hugging canvas shoe . Also available in the more contemporary leather versions , Converse All-Star Chuck Taylors ' are the most brilliant shoes known to -LRB- wo -RRB- man ... I 'm on stage a lot , so jumping around in these baby 's is a cinche - and when considering other stylish options -LRB- heels , clogs , cross trainers without the well needed ventalation that my feet so honestly deserve ? -RRB- , I 'm afraid that no one even seems to come close to Chuck 's humble design . I own a low cut pair in Orange Popsicle , two high cut pairs in Pink and Black and am in the processes of purchasing a pair of black leather boot-cut chuck taylors ... honestly , not any other shoes could provide as much daily wear and tear as these Chuck Taylors !! And , as an added bonus , they can be worn casually or dressed up with some tailored pants or flashy jeans for a night-time look ... I can not emphasise enough my dedication to these shoes - buy a pair , people , these old faithful 's will not let you down . I LOVE UNISEX SHOES !
 After being associated with the 50 's hipster and the 70 's hippie , the 80 's punk and now the millennium prepster these shoes have made the journey across time and generation . Made with a canvas material and a rubber soul these shoes stand the test of time and once thier broken in will quickly become your favorite pair of shoes . No matter the winter or the summer you 'll find yourself pulling these out of the closet to pair with your jeans or your skirt . And owning one pair is never enough . A pair in every color low and high is definitly required for the true converse wearer . Buy your first pair today to emmerse yourself in a true piece of history and the future
 Chuck Taylors are just my style !! They look good with anything i wear , and are very comfortable . All you need are some black jeans with a white or black shirt and your good to go !!! My only problem is that people just ca n't seem to watch where they are going , so if I pat dirt out of it , it looks like the color fade 's in that area . But overall great shoe to wear !!! Watch your feet though .
 Ok , I 'm 47 - and a professional female - probably heading back to my 2nd childhood - um - if I ever left childhood completely in the first place?Anyway , I had n't had a pair of Converse Hi-Tops since I was around 12 years old . I had seen some of the more `` artsy '' ones , but could never find my size -LRB- average foot -RRB- when I was looking ... and I knew I would n't be able to wear them to work if they were `` artsy '' Converse - because they are , after all , athletic shoes.I decided to buy the completely black Hi-tops ... and they are great . They are comfortable , even on my 47 year old feet . I really like them a lot . Glad I bought them , and maybe I 'll even see about getting a pair of the Artsy ones ... or maybe a pair in pink ??? Hope you 'll enjoy yours , when you get them .
 I purchased these for my grandson for Christmas - They arrived in plenty of time and were exactly what I ordered . It was all he asked for and he was totally excited when he opened them . He put them on immediately and just kept telling me how much he loved his shoes .
 I have been wearing these shoes for most of my life . They are n't $ 15 . anymore , but they are still worth the money . They are very flat , so do n't forget to get some insoles with arches for them ! You may want to add 1/2 a shoe size for this .
 I absolutely love my red Chucks . They are a timeless look that can be worn with your favorite jeans , tailored slacks , or a mini . And at such a great price , a better buy than the more modern sneakers in the same category . The shoes do run big , so be sure to the follow the suggestion of ordering two sizes smaller than your normal shoe size . I recieved my order from Eastbay within 3 days of purchase .
 No , I am not out on a cross country `` Walk for Peace '' but when I wear these shoes every step I take promotes World Peace . I have a red pair of peace shoes and I bought my mom a pair of pink ones . We love wearing them out together - we are a Mother/Daughter team making a double statement ! Also , we get many comments - whether together or alone . People just love them ! I wish I had these Peace shoes in 3 or 4 other colors .
 No complaints for this gift . They get worn a lot and so need to be replaced occasionally .
 Exactly what I needed , exactly when I needed it . I was in a group who all needed to get the converse hightops , and a few in the group had made online purchases and had problems . I went through Amazon , and had no problems whatsoever . Great information from the vendor .
 I 've never seen such a great selection of Chuck Taylor High Tops . I think this is my 5th pair . They have such great designs , nothing you would ever find in a department store . The shipping is always fast and my order has always been correct . I highly recommend this vendor !
 -LSB- -LSB- ASIN : B000FAI9X0 Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top red high top tennis shoes.They were just what the kid wanted , and they fit . He has been wearing them daily . Great!Vazel
 Love these converse shoes.They are a great shade of red , have already got a lot of comments on them.Thanks Chuck !
 We have found that by shopping on Amazon we are able to obtain all manner of items that we would not be able to purchase normally . My husband is 6 ' 6 '' tall and is a big man with big feet as you would expect . He wanted to buy these particular shoes as they were something that he had worn in his childhood and loved so much . We were not able to buy these in Australia without actually having them especially made . Phil 's foot size is normally 14 wide , so we opted for the size 15 US . Absolutely perfect and for a very reasonable price.We are very happy and even though some items are way out of our purchase league due to the varying shipping costs , we are still very fortunate to have discovered Amazon .
 These all black Chuck 's are my favorite All Star model ! It is no small task to find them at a regular retail store-most often your best bet is to buy online . They shipped in a timely fashion . Great Kicks , good deal .
 We bought the Chuck Taylor high tops for our 14 year old daughter for Christmas . The mall had the same produce for $ 85.00 ! We cut our cost almost in half , and she was THRILLED with the gift ! Great service . Great product . Great results . Her response ? `` Now I need to go get them dirty ! ''
 I enjoy my purple chucks a lot . I get lots of comments on them when I where them . It is fun to see peoples reactions .
 This was the second time we ordered Pink Converse Shoes for my daughter , the first time I did n't get the size right . I returned them to `` Shoes R Us '' I think it was called and they took care of my mistake very quickly . Unfortunately they did n't have the size I needed so I ordered a replacement pair from Last Pairs . They came quickly , fit perfectly and were reasonably priced , the same as our local mall , without the hassle ! Very good experience overall , would recommend .
 Lord , could Converse have got it any more right ? One thinks not . The Converse All Star Chuck Taylor canvas shoes are everything one could need from a shoe and more . They are stylish , available in colours that vary from orange to pink , the more comtemporary leather versions , low cut and high cut . These baby 's contour the foot so well , it 's almost like walking on air ! The canvas hugs the ankles , providing support ... but the most important features of the shoes are that they are unisex -LRB- they look great on guys and girls -RRB- and they can be dressed down with jeans , or elegantly dressed up with a pair of tailored pants . These shoes are definitely to die for .
 The shoes ordered on this web site are satisfactory . Thanks for sending the order promptly and in perfect condition .
 The shoes are great , and the shipping time was reasonable , as was the price . A warning
 It 's the first time when I bought this type of shoe , but I 'm telling you , I love it ; comfortable , cool , nice , I ca n't take eyes off them ; Yes I 'm talking about `` CONVERSE '' by Chuck Taylor , baby .
 I have every color known to man , and am always looking for more . I teach , so I am on my feet all day ; I 'm comfy and happy in my Converse All Stars ! I must say that in my old age -LRB- 40 -RRB- I prefer the lo tops over the hi tops .
 Converse 's are classic . they are the shoes people are always going to wear . i like the high tops better though
 This was a very good deal and was a fast delivery . I highly recommend this seller to all .
 It is nice to slip in to a new shoe and get the feel of a firm but comfortable fit . Lots of value here for the money.In my size they look like navy gunboats ... and I love them !
 I was so happy with this purchase . I purchased this just days before Christmas . These came on time and were exactly what I wanted . Thanks for the great service .
 Buen producto , por el precio excelente , envi&oacute; oportuno , en empaque adecuado , recomendable !! Buen producto , por el precio excelente , envi&oacute; oportuno , en empaque adecuado , recomendable !!
 buy these shoes because they were very comfortable lei really are beautiful but sometimes I use are cute very pleased with this purchase .
 I have wore these since I was a kid , but now sadly these are hard to find . If you are looking for both quality and a product made in the states then these are the shoes for you . The nice thing is that Chucks come in a variety of colors so you can get different ones if you want to have a certain look .
 Could n't find this particular color/design combo in stores , so was very happy to find it here at a great price!Converse shoes run a bit big , so make sure you order a good half to one size smaller than you would wear
 This shoes came in and i feel in love with them , they are in great condition . Just what i wanted and expected ! the color is great . They came in the box and they looked stunning . I totally recommend them !
 This review is very deserving of 5 stars . My boyfriend needed a new pair of chucks for work that matched his uniform ... we do n't wear many other types of shoes . . Love chuck taylors ! 5 stars for fast shipping , and low price . Thanks !
 Chucks are always awesome and this one came in an awesome condition ! My only qualm about this line of converse is that it provides no support as do most converse .
 this product is ok , i recomended , the service is fast , all rigth , the price is the exact . very very good
 Just came back from shootin ' hoops with my new Chuck Taylor Hi Tops . Been wearing them since '64 - as good now as they were then !
 Paid prioty post for this as had no choice . It cost $ 50 . Double the price of the shoes . The shoes above I paid for the slower postage . It cost $ 19 for the three pairs . Was told they would arrive in about 3 weeks . The boots in 3 to 4 days . The boots arrived as said and three other pairs arrived the very Next Day !!!!! Felt totally ripped off in regards to the boots !!!!! '
 I love my converse . WHo needs Nike or any of the rest when you have something as light weight and comfortable as converse Chuck Taylor . You can not go wrong with this shoe . They last and last .
 I got mine from a Converse store in a mall near St Louis for $ 20 . I 've had them for 2 and a half years and have worn them everywhere . I ran a 10 minute Mile and a half in them twice for my Air Force PT Test . I 've worn them in Iraq , Kuwait , Arizona , Florida , Washington . they are a part of me . Truly an epic shoe . They 're also a great driving shoe , with a nice rolled heel after some wear , and great pedal feel . Would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice all around , everyday shoe .
 awesome love them as always !! Just a reminder ... get converse two sizes smaller than you usually would :-RRB- ex if your size 9 , get size 7
 What 's not to like about these things . They 're comfortable , simple , and just look good . They can truly be worn by everyone , kids , adults , men , and women . They have been in style for as long as I can remember and I do n't see them going out any time soon . When I go out , I 'm either wearing these or my crocs . My only problem is that I wear them so much that I seem to go through them pretty fast . The good thing is that unlike most other shoes , these still look pretty good all beat up , so I typically wear them till they fall off my feet . Bottom line , you ca n't go wrong with chucks .
 Compr&eacute; un par de estos zapatos hace un mes y estan muy cheveres , fue un regalo para mi esposa y le gustan mucho .
 My neice 's them !! They were her favorite color.Very stylish and comfortable!Would recommend to anybody that likes this style of shoe .
 Very nice shoes , true to size and nice colour . I got a lot of compliments for them . I strongly recommend them to young people .
 Exactly the same as what I was expecting . Size and color was perfect . It is nice to wear with skinny jeans .
 great sneakers ! look great and fit perfectly . can wear with anything!the best for skydiving : -RRB- will definitely buy again , maybe different colors.thank you .
 Do n't know how many pairs ive owned over the years but I keep buying more . Comfy , stylish and cool to boot . I 'd give a 5 but i wish they werent as expensive ...
 I have worn chucks for several years now and have always been pleased with the shoe , but this was my first purchase from the seller and I am very pleased with the service and quick shipment of the order ...
 Love the shoe . . comfy and cool . . but . . no so happy with the color . . if I bought again , I 'd chose a different color . . but to each their own I guess
 I Loved The Right From The Start.I Bought Them In White Color And They Are Beautiful.I 'm Planning To Buy More In The Near Future .
 I brought this for a gift to my brother and he 's very happy , his really a good shoes !!!
 Great price and delivery for Chuck Taylors . Very happy and so was my daughter !
 This pair of converse was just what I expected ; they were one my son 's Christmas presents . The colors available were more varied than those I 'd seen in local stores and the price was better . This item arrived sooner than promised , too . Needless to say , my son was pleased .
 These Chucks are top of the line , very comfortable , still rocking my cons five years strong , the great thing is you can walk in these cons all day with no discomfort or pain . GET THEM !
 My son loves Chuck Taylor Converse All Stars , and these are so durable ! He wanted the high tops this time , so I got these for him . He loves them , and they came so quickly even though it was during Christmas season rush .
 They came in a timely manner , in the little Converse box . They 're just as the should be
 These shoes were 20 $ cheaper than the sale price on the converse website . The shoes seem to be authentic . Shipping was fast .
 the shoes are great , they were in mint condition when i received them . i could n't be happier
 My fiance wanted some new converse shoes for his birthday , so I searched the internet for awhile trying to find the best deal , this was definitely it ! It was the best price paired with free shipping , and they came within a week , so that was great ! They 've also held up very well , and he loves them , so they get quite a bit of use !
 I ordered these for my 18 year old son . He LOVES them . Has a purple shirt that he wears with them - bought them about 10 months ago and he has worn them so much that they are almost worn out - that 's how much he likes them . I would buy him more , but he is going into the military soon . Love Lo Purple Chuck Norris Converse ! Thanks Amazon .
 I love my Converse . A Chuck Taylor is always stylish !! And they always look good with casual clothing .
 I am a 20-year-old female , and I was first introduced to Converse All-Star shoes in the 7th grade . Since I was a young child , I have always had trouble buying shoes due to the size of my feet . My feet are small length wise , but none of the shoes in my size are ever able to accomodate the width of my feet . I normally wear a size 7.5 in shoes , but I always have to go up to a 9 or 10 just to make up for this discrepency . Converse are the first shoes I found that are true to size , and I no longer have to go around with floppy clown feet . The shoes are unisex , comfortable for extended wear , and , though they get dirty very easily , a quick wash on the delicate setting in the washer will make them like new again . I have never had to `` break in '' a pair of these shoes like most new shoes require , so my Converse collection will likely continue to grow . I now own a pair in black , monochrome black , navy , pink , purple , and green . As soon as they wear out -LRB- which takes awhile -- I am currently wearing a black pair that I bought in 2005 and wear several times a week -RRB- , I will be sure to invest in more .
 I have been looking for a black pair of Chucks for a long time and I love these shoes !
 Hello , I knew this Converse on `` I Robot '' movie , I was looking for it on internet and finally I found and bought them here , I received it today , I 'm very happy with transaction , It has been clear and really quickly.Thanks and regards from Spain.PS
 THIS SHOES I AM USING TO MY WORK , MY HOUSE , TO GO TO UNIVRSITY AND TO ALL.I AM FROM DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND I KNOW THAT CONVERSE HAS SUPPERED MY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SHOES , I RECOMENDED YOU THAT BUY IT THIS BRAND BECAUSE IT THE BETTER AND IT IS BEATIFUL
 Fuer alle die auch ein bischen deutsch koennen.Der Service von dieser Firma ist schnell und perfect.Our next pair of Chucks we will get from this companie again
 I was Larry Bird for halloween and what better way to complete the costume then with Green Chucks ! They were fantastic !
 These converse came just as I expected , since I wear converse I knew what to expect . I usually wear a 9.5 in women but go down half a size in these guys and they fit perfect -LRB- 7 in converse -RRB- . Good price too , cheaper than usual .
 These shoes were exactly what my son wanted for Christmas . He loves them . They run true to size and they are comfortable . He has a hard time keeping the tongue straight on the shoes . When he tightens the laces , it will stay in place .
 My teenager loves these Chuck Taylor 's and he is so happy that he received them for his Christmas present.He says they are very comfortable and they look good with his skinny jeans too!Also a great price too .
 These were a Christmas gift for my son in Kentucky . He is a photographer and does a lot of work with breast cancer survivors and did a photo project with the women before and after treatment . Always wears the pink sneakers so people will ask him why . His other pair was quite tatered so I was extremely happy to find a replacement .
 I knew what I was buying , it was an OK price and it arrived , new , clean and on time . Been wearing them for 50 years .
 My granddaughter asked for these at Christmas . She thinks they are awesome and ca n't wait to wear them to school in the new year .
 I bought these for my daughter and she loves them ! The sizing seems to run a bit big though . She normally wears a 7.5 - I got her a 7 and they fit perfectly . Shipping was quick and price was good .
 Bought as a replacement for kid brother . Item as describe ! Size is true and recommended for teens since shoe does not go out of style .
 These are my sons favorite shoes . He wears them with everything -LRB- including his tux -RRB- and they always make a statement
 Ive worn Converse Hi-tops for 26 years , since I was a 13 year old skater.I saw my heroes growing up wearing them also-The Ramones , Stray Cats , The Dead Boys , etc. & various skateboarders of the 80s & 90s . Theyve been around for decades , & the design hasnt changed much.They are the most comfortable shoe in my opinion , and the Hi-tops give great ankle support for whatever sport or slampit its put thru .
 I love the all black - so far they fit well . We will have to see how they wear in the long run but chucks are usually durable
 Just what you would expect if you owned a pair of these 10 , 20 , 30 years ago , except with a custom peace sign logo on the outside only.They do sure highlight however just how far shoe technology has come by comparison to a pair of ASICS running shoes - in terms of support , comfort etc. . They are 30 year old or more shoe technology.I hoped that logo would be on both sides but the inseam side of the shoe bears the traditional converse chuck taylor logo.Still , 5 stars from my view . They are what they are supposed to be .
 I got these shoes for my boyfriend , and there was absolutely NO other place that had these in his size !! I ordered them , and they came in WAY earlier than I expected ! Even earlier than the shipping expectancy ! Ill buy Chucks from here for now on !
 I got these shows and began to wear them right off to break them in . I have to say if you stand for a long period of time dont wear them . If you are weight lifting with them then they work great . They have no real arch support because they were originally made back in the day before they had arch support . But great shoes !!
 What can I say ? I 've had mine for about 4 years and still wear them . They are quality made and extremely comfortable . They go great with just about everything . They are kinda my go-to shoe when nothing else I have matches .
 The shoes arrived a bit earlier then they were supposed to which was nice . if you followed the chart for normal converse shoes then the size shouldnt be a problem . they are quite heavy but quite comfy . and the plastic is ... . interesting shall i say . id recommend them to people just not friends
 Came perfect without any problems , they were the size I ordered and everything was exactly how it was suppose to be . I bought them for my girlfriend and she loves them !
 EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND GOOD SERVICE PROVIDED BY YOUR TEAM , THEY ARE TRULY RELIABLE AND TIMELY I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PROVIDER AMONG MY FRIENDS .
 We could not find these anywhere in the stores for under $ 60.00 . I was very happy with the price and the delivery was right on time . They were a gift and it was exactly what she wanted.Thanks , Theresa
 This was one of the smoothest deals I have ever dealt with , and I will do business again in the future . The service was great .
 Very cool shoes , decent price and a very quick shipper . what more could you ask for ?
 ordered for christmas for teen daughter , could n't find anywhere in stores , so thanks ! Appreciated the fast shipping too !
 Converse All-Stars are the all-American shoe , and the black monochrome goes with everything . Seriously ; I 've worn these to the opera .
 I really like these shoes . I use them for weightlifting/running . My only warning is that they run quite big . I had to order 1.5 sizes smaller than I usually do , but they work fine . My first pair got torn up a lot around the lace-holes , but I think that was because they were too big . My current pair has no problems so far .
 i have not to much to say , this product is nice and i like it to much
 These shoes are light and comfortable to walk around in all day . Thier sizing is a little confusing . These run about one size larger than most shoes . I recommend using extra or replacement insoles .
 I stand on my feet for 7 hours at a time in a professional job . This is my shoe w / a walking insole inside I work it out just fine and no one notices I have on sneaks ! I am on my fourth pair and looking for several replacements . Works great w / slacks or khaki pants . -LRB- make sure if you are getting them as an alternative to a ladies dress shoe get the all blk w / the all blk gumsole and all blk laces -RRB- Most dress shoes for ladies are very very uncomfortable even though they are fashionable and this one does both very well . The fact that I can machine wash makes them even more likeable .
 excellent converse all star . the product was well described and satisfied my needs . the shipment has been quick
 The shoe itself is cute ! Very bright colorful ... and well pink . The only worry/complaint i have is that maybe its a bit too big ? Maybe the reviews i read after i bought the item scared me making me wish that i would have gone down a size . So instead of an 8 maybe a 7.5 would have been nice ? Well what can you do ... you cant shrink em and they are cute . Im sure i can work it all out ! The delivery estimate of the package was right on time . The seller was awesome ! So all in all its pretty good : P
 Thanks for the service , is very good!The product buy is of good quality , y arrived in the estimated time , I 'm very happy with the service ... Thanks ! and '' Happy New Year 2012 `` Sincerely ; Angel Clark.Puerto Ordaz , Venezuela .
 These shoes are what I was looking for . . but , they do run a little big . So be sure to get a size down from your regular size . I wear 10 1/2 But i could probably wear a 10 or even 9 in this shoe . . They are comfortable and you cant beat the price . . shipping was pretty face as well .
 Greetings , the purchase was made as effective as I have in my hands the product without any sort of trouble . Completely safe.Saludos , la compra fue efectuada de efectiva , ya tengo en mis manos el producto , sin ningun tipo de inconvenientes . Completamente seguro .
 Thank you for sending this fast and correct ! These are my daughter 's favorite shoes and when her old pair finally got holes in the soles she put these on her Birthday list . She unwrapped them and immediately they were on her feet !
 Hi , Can anyone tell me how to buy the item ? I can only select the size or the color , but never both , so I can not buy the item . And I do n't know how to contact the seller . Thank you !
 This is standard issue footwear for anyone who wants the `` look '' of indie rock -LRB- the others are t-shirts that look to be from a redneck bar circa 1978 but really came from a suburban Old Navy circa 2010 and those `` washed-out '' blue jeans that were purchased at the same Old Navy -RRB- . The shoes are grossly unfit for any athletic activity -LRB- I do n't know how the heck I survived playing street hockey in these things as a teenager -RRB- , provide no protection against the cold or stepping on sharp objects , begin to smell horribly after 9 + months of use and have a tendency to have the sole tear away from the rest of the shoe after those 9 months -LRB- if the smell has n't destroyed them yet -RRB- . But their coolness factor will never , ever be replicated by any footwear , past , present or future -LRB- the Roman sandal gave them a run for their money in the 1980s by the garage punk band Thee Mighty Caesars , but that 's another story -RRB- . Everyone should own a pair of these shoes at least once in their lifetimes .
 The Last time I wore a pair of these , my codename was Roadrunner , fastest boy in the universe ... lol.I bought these more for the nostalgiathan anything else.I have no complaints
 The shoes are very cool . And so is the price . Fast shipping also .
 It was here in no time , we appreciate the speedyness especially when your little daughter is expecting it , it came the day it was suppose to ... . maybe one day earlier . Thanks !
 the chucks , of course their cool , comfy and fun . I love the color , have n't seen anyone else walking the street with these yet ! My only complaint is that they are a little to big . I usually wear a size 8 and would be pushing it to be in a 7.5 . I want these for comfort so I ordered an 8 . Too long . Looks a little goofy . Order a size smaller than you usually would or they will likely be too long .
 What can I say ? These shoes are insanely comfortable and go with everything . The more worn they get the better they look .

 I 'm a huge sneaker freak and have to say these shoes are some of my favorites . Comfortable and stylish they look great with my 511 skinny leg jeans . I will always keep a pair of these in my collection .
 Lots of people complain about the forty dollar price for Converse Chuck Taylor shoes but BELIEVE me they are worth it ! I have been wearing the same two pairs of black hi-tops and blue hi-tops since March of 2002 and while they are `` broken in '' they only look better with age and the comfort level is very high.When I bought these shoes in 2002 they were the first `` Asian Converse '' I had owned and I feared that they would n't hold up as long as the Made in USA Chuck Taylors that I had grown up wearing ... that fear was in vain because they have lasted as long as I could have hoped for . I also have a pair of white low-tops made in the 1990 's before production left the USA that I wear on a regular basis and a pair of Converse One Star Low-Tops from the same era which show no signs of wearing out.During the `` Converse will stop production Scare '' before Nike bought the brand I went and bought six new pairs of converse and four of these are still unworn in the box so at age 40 I very possibly have enough Converse to last the rest of my life if the service I have gotten from these black and blue Hi-Tops is any indication : -RRB-
 My grandson loved them , he has a hard time to find shoes , because of his foot size -LRB- 14 -RRB- , so he was glad when I found them.The price on these are very reasonable & fast delivery .
 Great product ! I bought them for my power lifing training and they are great so far !
 I have these shoes in brown . I have been complimented several times on these shoes , and they match everything . I do n't dress for comfort , but these are pretty comfortable . The only problem is that they look old quickly .
 I used to have a pair of Chuck Taylor 's as a kid -LRB- and that was a while ago -RRB- as great cheap knock around shoes . Price has gone up a fair bit , but these monochrome shoes look great ; classic styling , updated a bit.One small caveat ; these shoes have little internal padding and have a lot more room inside than normal software in the same size . The retailer I purchased from mentioned they are about a 1/2 size larger than other shoes .
 Awesome !! Around for years , with no reason to change !!
 the shoes were awesome quality , shipped very quickly , but i guess that style runs big , i usually wear an 11 , ordered that . they were huge , had to send them back .
 I have been wanting these shoes for some time now but when I would go to buy them , they didnt carry my size . People would just tell me that chucks didnt come in half sizes and would want me to by a size that didnt fit me . I knew better went online and got them cheaper and with free shipping . I love the internet
 I bought these for my nephew 's birthday and they were exactly what he wanted . They arrived in the right amount of time and in perfect condition . Would recommend this seller to anyone .
 A great shoe with a classic look . These are nicer for wet days than the canvas and are lasting longer . They look great & are well made .
 These look so nice . I was trying to imagine them in leather when I ordered them for DH 's Christmas present . He wears them all the time and they still look new . He reports they are very comfortable . Loves 'em ! PS I 'm not a kid , just did n't want my name all over the net .
 An old school shoe , with style . How did our feet survive these things ? Oh , that 's right , they did n't .
 I 've been wearing the black , classic low converse for several years now and it came that time I needed a replacement pair . Beals Florida shipped it faster than the other items I had ordered from Amazon that same day . Was definitely worth it for the price , and of course the shoes are one of life 's little necessities for some of us .
 EXCELLENT BUY . I 'M ENJOYING MY SHOES AND I 'M FEELING LIKE WILL SMITH , JE JEEEEE . I RECEIVED MY SHOES IN THE OFFICIAL CONVERSE BOX . THEY ARE ORIGINAL AND TOTALLY NEW .
 Great pair of shoes with a lot of history . the only crappy thing is that i lost them ... : Cthe shipping was quick and with a low price and yes ... they were not avaliable for super saver shipping ... Highly recommend them for everyone
 I 've been wearing these shoes since I was 12 years old . They are in my opinion the most comfortable and stylish shoes ever made . Unlike other shoes that give way to much support . These shoes sometimes feel like you 're actually not wearing shoes at all . A good way to feel the ground underneath your feet . Great for all occasions but not really recommended in the snow or heavy rain .
 Came fast , look great , a great experience . The fit is amazing , the color is vibrant , and to know that it 's a -LRB- red -RRB- product is awesome . Will defiantly recommend and buy from again .
 Product arrived early , in good condition , and as described . This shoe does run larger than the size you normally wear . I read somewhere to order one size smaller but I ordered 1/2 size smaller and inserted a cushioned insole . It fits perfect and wears nice .
 I got as a casual peice and also to wear to work they are half a size to big but I will live . Great Buy
 I bought these for the sole purpose of weightlifting . Excellent ankle support and flat bottoms without much heel make these an ideal shoe in the gym . These shoes provide very firm footing and i would highly recommend them to bodybuilders on a budget .
 Black All-Star High-tops ConverseHonestly these are the best shoes I have ever owned . I bought a pair for school , and I instantly knew that these were the shoes that would last me through the school year . And so far they have . My dad told me `` You should get the smaller size . '' I asked why , and he said `` You ruin and ware down shoes easy . '' But I have proved him so wrong . It 's been 3 months and not even a single scratch . What I love about these shoes is they do n't try to be special because they already are special . The makers do n't add glitter or sparkles to make them stand out . If you are looking for normal this is the way to go.You should know there is only one word that can describe these shoes
 There are a lot of hard core Chuck Taylor addicts out there and after ordering my first pair I can say I 'm still outside that bubble . They look good and the high top does n't squeeze my ankle or anything like that . The sizing was dead on so do n't order a half size larger thinking it 's a good idea ! My 9 's were dead on . The Chucks are a seasonal shoe I would n't wear them in the extreme cold , or really rainy days . As for soles and support they 're flat . I 've owned Vans and they 're even flatter than that with less support . It might just be I 'm not a kid anymore , or I 've got the wrong type of foot but I 'm not so sure . I 'm expecting these to be my pair of Chucks to last a while because I 'm not gon na be wearing these every day . So , they 're definitely good . . and everything that other people love , but I think I 'd rather wear Vans .
 In that classic converse style -LRB- edgy plum purple color -RRB- tennis shoes.I have wore Converse shoes since High School mid-sixties ; and they have proven more durable over the years!Of course , you have to purchase white pair for summer ; purple or black for winter.Enjoy the wear and feeling of being part of a classic brand !
 How can you go wrong with a pair of classic black Chuck Taylor 's . Just keep in mind that the shoe sizes run BIGGER . I wear and 11 and ordered a pair of 11s . A whole size to big for me . I do n't mind returning , but just keep that in mind .
 I 've been wanting Converse high-top tennis shoes for years now , and my husband just recently purchased them for me for my birthday . I have weak ankles from years of hiking , past injuries , etc. . The high top style gives my ankles more support . I only wish they had arch support and then I 'd be in complete heaven . However , these are tops in my book , plus they look stylish ! I love how they stay in style no matter what ! Thanks !
 What else can you say about a sneaker that has been around for over 90 years . These sneakers are simply great !!! I got the classic black high top and am very pleased with them . They are comfortable , durable and stylish . On a hot summer day the do n't heat up like a bread oven , like some sneakers do , keeping your feet cool and comfy . If they do get dirty or funky you can simply toss them into your washer and bada bing like new !!! They offer enough support for me to last for a long day of walking around town or work . One of the coolest things about these sneakers is that they offer a `` back at ya '' response to the more expensive and mostly ugly `` skater '' and basketball sneakers . A great sneaker at a great price . I love mine !!!
 My son absolutely loved this shoes . They came in perfect condition . The best part was I did not have to hunt them down locally .
 So glad they make them in a size 16 . . I do wish there was a larger selection to choose from but after size 13 the selections naturaly dwindle .
 These shoes are great . I value a lightweight , sturdy , hightop shoe for playing basketball -LRB- prison rules style -RRB- with the 11 other firefighters I work with . They require a tough foot , but if you can hack it they will save you some money .
 What else can I say ? Converse 's Chuck Taylor High-Tops have been tried and true for decades . They are comfortable , fun and in my case , red . I am 51 years young and I receive more compliments on these shoes than any other item of apparel that I own . Love them .
 Chances are that if you 're reading this , you 're already an urban hipster or musician so you wo n't really care what I have to say . BUT , I would just like to let everyone know , I tore the heal on mine , and after three months of owning them the sides of the toe are coming unglued . -LRB- Granted I 've worn them everyday since I got them -RRB- Not exactly worth the price , but still a darn comfortable shoe !
 Very smooth purchase , excellent price - the best anywhere and believe me I searched , very fast delivery , really good communication . Thank you
 These shoes are worn very regularly by most of my family for nearly barefoot comfort . We like the colors and the look of them . I like the pink ones , because when I was a kid my mother told me I could be invisible in pink sneakers . I have 2 pairs of the high tops , one pair is 5 years old and while they are limp and a bit faded , the soles are still in decent condition . I also have a pair of the oxfords in raspberry rose which is just a fantastic pink color , and does n't seem to be fading fast . My daughter loves her Skydiver Blue pair.They do n't offer any support and they do run large . But as long as you are n't doing a lot of walking , they are very comfortable and light weight . I use my oxfords as slip ons with the laces tied a bit loose .
 you know the shoe and you know the star . the comfort level is the truth and they feel so good and have much style and Profile then as now . I have bought Chucks all through the years and they are always chill and they got style . real nice , real nice .
 As always converse well never let you down with these silver boots ! I love tham and use them all the time !
 These Chucks are comfortable and look even cooler than the regular canvas style . I think I first saw them in the movie I , Robot and got a pair shortly after . It 's been a few years and they 're only showing slight wear . Everyone who sees them likes the leather too . Highly recommended !
 The shoe fit me well , and it came in the original condition - no damages , and it came on time .
 Ive been wearing converse all stars for over 20 years and still love them . Ive also found they make a nice driving shoe because there thin and you can feel the pedals . If youve never had a pair its time to try .
 They looked great when i got them and are still holding up good . This coming from someone that wears out shoes like no other . haha
 ... Chuck Taylor All Stars are good for doing squats . That 's why I buy them . A lot of athletic shoes have a good amount of padding on the bottom , which is fine for running , but while doing squats , makes my feet feel slightly wobbly . The Taylors allow my feet to stay firmly planted , which helps me maintain proper technique .
 This company was excellent to deal with . When we received the shoes , they did n't fit properly . Exchanging them was a breeze and another size was promptly sent to us at no extra charge to us . Very efficient .
 They are a great shoe and my granddaughter loves them . I got them in plenty of time to give them to her for her birthday .
 Quality , classic style , comfort ... you ca n't go wrong with a pair of Chuck Taylors . Great for weightlifting/powerlifting . Thin sole is good for dealifting .
 Good . Cheap . Classical Chuck Taylor allready . Buy them.Enought comment . Remember to pray for the Converse . Kiss you dude.Bye . k ?

 I gave this snikers to my 15 year-old son and he loved . It has a juvenile color and it can use it daily , are confortables , the color is durable . Their friends have liked it . I recommend it
 muy buen producto y muy buen vendedor , todo me salio como yo esperava y hasta ahora todo esta muy bien .
 Very good sneakers , the most comfortable ever . And also one of the cheapest ! I 'd like to try some of the new Converse models
 Bought these for him and he enjoyed them . Very flexible and easy on your feet . I own a pair of these myself , and although the sole can get scuffed very easily , it 's still a great shoe in regards to running or when you need black shoes for your outfit . Runs a half size bigger than usual so know your size before you order onlinel
 Bought the book as a gift and the receiver loved it . The item came quickly and as described , great deal .
 These were a gift greatfully received as they are hard to find in larger sizes . Thank goodness of internet shopping .
 An all year kind of sneaker shoe that can be worn from all . Really comfort for every day use . There is a wide variety of colours which can cover all needs
 I bought these for my eleven year old . She loves these , so , I do n't really know how conforable they are because she really cares more about how they look . The price was the same as other vendors . It was just easy to order on-line .
 I would be very greatful if u can let me know if the white chucks is one size bigger then nornal sizing cause I didnt see the remarks like on the black ones.Thanks
 UPDATE !! Though I did n't get what I originally purchased , Extreme Footwear was wonderful in that they rushed the correct pair to me . Since they were an outside vendor Amazon could n't ship me the correct pair they could only do the return . Extreme Footwear took the iniciative do to that for me and I am a happy customer . The shoes are exactly what we hoped for . More importantly , My son is happy !
 Chuck Taylors are my favorite shoes . I have used them for years because they 're comfortable , casual and have character . I replace them when they get too worn . I 've been buying them online for a while . I found them here for under 40 bucks which was a steal . I received them in just a few days . I could n't be happier with my new chucks .
