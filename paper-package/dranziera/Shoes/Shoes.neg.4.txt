 They are not comfortable and you ca n't adjust them to fit right either.Because they are cheap so I do n't want to waste my time to return them .

 Having read so many glowing reviews for Danner boots for so long , I concluded that they must be the best US-made boots money can buy and determined to try a few . Having done so , I feel I can safely conclude that my assessment was correct , but that is as far as it goes , as I can also safely conclude now that those who are enamored of Danner boots are the type who insist on buying US-made products in general . Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .

 This shoe does not look like the picture online . It is much longer which makes the shoe look oversized and unattractive . You can barely tell that the shoe is blue as well .
 These shoes would be very comfortable if they were sized correctly . They felt okay when I first put them on , but after walking about a mile , my toes curled up . It is usually easy to tell when a walking shoe is too small , but it was n't with these shoes until I walked for a while .

 The outside of the purse looks nice . The purse itself is heavy . It is difficult to find anything inside as there is only one handle and the opening is small . There is one huge compartment so finding things makes it even more difficult . There are some pockets on one side but they are not deep enough to hold anything without them eventually falling out while looking for something in the main compartment . There is one zippered pocket on the other side . I 'm going to buy another person and stop using this one .

 Dansko 's have a great reputation but buying them on line is a bad idea . Dansko 's need to be tried on as they are individually made and sizes are very difficult to judge . I ordered a pair that I thought would fit perfectly , they were too small and I had to reorder my shoes . And return the original pair . I made my initial order on August 29 , 2009 . Today is September 29 , 2009 and I have not received my shoes . All of my friends that wear Dansko 's love them but have urged me never to buy them on line again .
 This was my second pair of Dansko professional clogs and again , they did n't fit properly . I wear a size 10 and therefore purchased a size 41 on my first purchase . They 're extremely tight fitting across the top middle section of my feet and my feet were actually NUMB after wearing them for just an hour . I could n't stand it any longer than that and did n't want to risk permanent nerve or some type of circulatory damage to my feet . My feet also slipped out of the heels frequently . The second purchase was even worse ! I purchased a larger size , 42 , thinking that it would alleviate some of the problems and ended up barely able to even put my foot into the right shoe and could n't even get my foot into the left shoe at all . They were extremely tight and unforgiving . I HATE DANSKO 'S ! I could n't give them anything less than one star and would actually give that star for the way they look . I actually loved the color and style . They 're just poorly made for the price . I ended up buying Klogs brand which look very similiar to Dansko 's and cost about $ 10 less on average .
 They started out comfortable especially since I travel and work on the hospital floor supporting physicians and nurses during EMR implementations . I had a pair of reliable flats , but I needed something with a heel . It all went south when I went to pick up my rental car in San Francisco . Walking on the pavement , I sprained my ankle and fell in the lot . I simply attributed it to clumsiness and the slanted driveway . It was n't a bad sprain and I wore the shoes without any issues afterwards.That was until I parked my car in the cobblestone driveway and wiped out again when I hit the incline . This time it was a little more bloody . Ended up with a swelling , bloody knee , a tetanus shot and grounded by the Medical Clinic at the airport for three days . I concluded that I could n't possibly be that clumsy . I realized that the only thing that changed was my shoes and both times I wore them walking in a driveway , I went down . So if you must have them , be sure to stay on level ground.Mine went back to the store and I have an appointment with an orthopedics specialist .
 Was disappointed that these Dansko 's are not as comfortable as my other pair of Dansko 's . These run a little big and slide on my heel . Also , the top rubs the top of my instep and something about them makes the top of the bottom of my left foot sore . Will still try another pair of Dansko 's later , however .
 My wife ordered these to wear to work . She is on her feet almost continually . When they did n't fit as well as the REAL Dansko 's she was replacing , we looked inside and saw why . MADE IN CHINA was stenciled on the uppers . We got our money back but no wonder they were such a good `` bargain '' . Always make certain they are not knockoffs when you buy . The original Dansko 's are great shoes for working people .
 I work in restaurants , so I 'm on my feet for 6-14 hours a day , and I heard so many good things about Danskos I thought I would buy a pair . They were really comfortable for a long time , but the first pair I bought was patent leather , and the leather was tearing around the toe and it was squeaking while I walked . So I returned those and got a plain ol' leather pair , and those too were ok for a good 6 months . Now , not even a year later , the colour on the inside of the shoe is rubbing off on my socks , turning my white socks nearly black , and even going through and staining the soles of my feet . On top of that , I come home every night and my feet are stiff and swollen , and I 'm starting to have aches in my knees . I got some gel inserts and they 've helped marginally . I understand I may be putting quite a bit of stress on these shoes , but I think a 120 dollar pair of shoes that markets itself as `` occupational shoes '' should not be doing this in less than a year of use . I wo n't be buying another pair in the future , to save my knees and my back .
 I decided to replace my old Dansko clogs with this style and color . After wearing it for an entire shift at work , I developed blisters . I felt that the insole were hard . I was disappointed with this particular style . I like the color .
 These shoes were advertized as being very comfortable . Nothing could be further from the truth . They were so uncomfortable that I can no longer wear them . I even tried to have them professionally stretched twice , to no avail . They are very tight over the top of your foot . OUCH !! What a waste of $ 100 .
 I used to buy them for my whole office but , we have noticed a big difference in quality . The company use to be a lot more personably and cared about each customer . I had a very bad experience with one of the managers there . There are plenty of really good shoe companies so , bye bye Dansko .
 I bought the Dansko Pro in a wide width because I needed a great pair of sturdy , comfortable shoes to work in . I have owned another pair in the past and was really happy with them , so I did n't even question my decision to order this shoe . No place in my area carries this brand , and the closest place does n't carry the wide width , so I ordered them online . Big mistake on my part!One shoe fits great but is n't nearly as comfortable as my other pair had been , but the other shoe barely fits . It 's really tight all the way around and makes my foot go numb . I realize that they 're handmade , but there should be some way for the company to ensure that both shoes are made similarly enough that they can actually fit as a pair . I was so disappointed that I had spent so much money on a pair of shoes I ca n't wear , for multiple reasons . I had to buy a different pair of shoes and they 're more comfortable , but I still have n't found any that offer what I 'm looking for or what my first pair of Dansko shoes did .
 SanFran Jo says : I , too , noticed a difference in fit and also that the pair I recently purchased was made in China . I had to return my pair because they were not comfortable . I already have two other pair of Dansko Professional clogs , and they are very comfortable . I am disappointed in the comfort of the most recent pair I purchased . I have noticed that some of the clogs do say by Danita . Thanks to happy mommy mentioning Sanita , I googled Sanita clogs . Below is a statement found online from the Original Clogs website : For the last 17 years , all Dansko Professional clogs and all Dansko Stapled Clogs have been manufactured by Sanita in Europe . The relationship between Dansko and Sanita ended in August 2007 . Since then , Sanita entered the US market and is now distributing their products directly . If you are looking for the Original stapled clogs with patent number 0060240 stamped on the bottom -LRB- made by Sanita exclusively -RRB- , then look no further as our website features Sanita Clogs ' products exclusively.I ordered the `` original '' clogs by Sanita and they fit as comfortably as the two other pair I have . The number mentioned above is stamped on the bottom .
 first off for $ 120.00 there should not even be any vinyl on them but the plastic vinyl covering the piping is coming off after 1 month of use so i will need to use a black marker to hide it dansko was great till they left sanita now they are cheaply made in china , hungry , italy , and they dont even fit these are some of the problems i have found over the last 3 months i have tried aprox 50 pairs of dansko cabrio professional i should be waring a 37 -LRB- us size 7 -RRB- but now i cant , i need a 38 and most of the 38 are too small also 1 shoe bigger than the other in some pairs the left is tight and the right shoe feels great and in some pairs the right is too tight and the left feels great then after of 3 months and 50 pairs of trying on the pair i did keep the VINYL piping is coming off dansko is no longer good i will now only buy sanita COME ON DANSKO YOU ARE TAKING THE CHEEP AND EASY and you soon will loose customers
 2 consecutive blow outs of the Dansko oiled Cutter style shoes . The first pair split one of the soles at 10 months of use . This was in July of 2009 . Took them back to the store where they were purchased and they sent them back to Dansko to see if they would honor a replacement . They did , although the process took 4 months before I got the replacement pair . Fast forward to last Sept 3 2010 . After less than 9 months of usage one of the soles on the replacement pair not only split completely across the sole but separated on both sides . Plenty of usable tread on the soles so they were not worn out at all . So of course I take them back to the store they came from . Manager of the store calls me today and says they can not help me because now Dansko only has a 6 month warranty on failures and I have to contact them on my own . I 'll see what happens . Dansko = ExpensivePoorly made in China .6 Month warrantyEPIC FAIL !
 Dansko 's quality has continually declined since their split with Sanita a few years back in 2007 . Sanita made the Dansko clogs for years until Dansko went their separate way and decided to produce their clog elsewhere , so now Dansko 's are now made in China , whereas Sanita 's are still made in Europe . The quality difference is VERY evident.Not realizing that Dansko was n't held to the same standard as it used to be I ordered a Dansko professional and the professional XP as well . They were so clunky , huge and heavy , I felt like a child wearing my dad 's shoes !! Plus the sizes on the Dansko 's were so inconsistent I was n't able to find a size that fit , even when I went to the Walking company store and tried on several different pairs of the same size , one 38 was almost right , the next was way too tight , one 39 was way to wide , the next just plain huge in every way.Dansko will accredit it to the hand made feature but those of us who have been wearing hand made clogs for some time can attest to the fact that it is so much more than that , Dansko is just not the same shoe that made it famous in the first place . Now it 's just poor quality . I wear a 7.5 US , sometimes an 8 which put me perfectly in a size 38 . Whereas a 38 used to fit me perfectly now they are too short and my big toe smashes every so slightly up against the end to the shoe when I take a step , well no biggie , I 'll just order up one size . So i ordered the 39 which was so huge it flopped off with every step , even with thick socks there was just no way to make them work . 38 's too small , 39 way to big . why the huge jump ?! I have a normal foot , never worn or needed to wear a narrow or wide ever in my life so when these shoes fit so incredibly wide and clompy , I knew that it was n't my foot but their shoe.But the most disappointing point of all was that the quality had noticeably declined.I had the same issue with the XP 's . And a little known fact about the XP memory foam version is that the memory foam base will only last a few months TOPS before going flat , and the cost to replace just the inserts is $ 40 a pair ... ouch ! So after I realized that Danskos would n't work anymore , I decided to search for another clog , that 's when I did some research and discovered that Dansko had made the break from the original maker of the shoe -LRB- sanita -RRB- . I did n't realize that you could actually order Sanita 's until then . That 's when I decided to try a pair of Sanita clogs instead . SOO happy that I did !!! Now I have the quality I remember in a size that fits perfectly . So for those of you on the fence ... try Sanita 's instead . THey were the makers of Dansko that made them famous in the first place . They are better quality , better materials , not made in China , and not so wide you can barely keep them on without sizing down to the point where they are way too small . You wo n't be disappointed . However , due take note because when I went to scrubs and beyond to try the KOI clogs -LRB- made by Sanita as well -RRB- to get an idea of sizing , I did chose to size up so now I wear a size 39 , but who cares ... the quality is back and they actually fit !!
 I was SHOCKED at how uncomfortable these shoes were , after having worn and loved Dansko brand for many years . I found out that the company changed manufacturers -LRB- made in China now -RRB- and the quality of both fit and comfort is so much more obviously underpar ... I literally could not believe how these shoes could pinch and hurt my feet so much in one evening ! I mean , we are not talking about high fashion platform shoes here.I have attached this info from the Sanita shoe website -LRB- the old Danish company that USED to make Dansko clogs -RRB- : `` For many years Sanita manufactured clogs for Dansko . The Sanita and Dansko relationship ended in the Fall 2007 . Since then , all Sanita manufactured products sold in the USA have been sold exclusively under the Sanita brand . `` There you have it . Save your money and your feet . Sanita still makes clogs , thank goodness . Dansko on the other hand ... same high price , but NOT the same shoes .
 I work in a pharmacy and I am on my feet up to 12 hours a day . I had heard so much about how great Dansko shoes are . I got this pair and I was so excited because they are a very nice looking shoe . I wore them 1 day and decided that there was just no way I could keep them . They are way to heavy . I was trying to find a shoe that would help reduce the swelling in my ankle an old injury I still have trouble with -RRB- . My feet were aching and my BOTH ankles were very swollen . Maybe it was just this style ? I have spoken with many nurses that love Dansko and would n't put on any other kind . But for me , I 'm going to have to go back to the Born Toby . Sorry ... I really wanted thee to work out .
 I like these shoes but recently they have gotten tight !! Or my feet are swollen I wear them with thin socks and they still are a pain
 the clogs would have great if they were the correct color and came on time . I paid for expedited shipping and should have gotten them in 3 days . It took over a week and they were the wrong color . The shoe company was very nasty and refused to refund my shipping , and when i returned the shoes , they refused to give me a credit , claiming they never got them . UPS sent me the name of the person who signed for them at their store !!! This company is horrible , I would never order from them again . The seller was Shoes Central . Do n't order from them , they are awful . I would give them zero stars but that is not an option
 I have heard nothing but good things about these shoes but when I bought a pair and put them on , I just could n't stand them . I bought a half size larger because I have a wider foot but they just dug into my instep like a torture device . Perhaps they are only for people with narrow feet and low insteps .
 I ordered this shoe , , , the quality is great ... but sizing is WAY off . . I ordered a size 11 ... . however ... there is a discrepancy on the EURO sizing ... I have made many attempts to buy Euro sizing in other brands ... too risky and not standard . I have an American foot .
 I have bought white pair few years ago and loved it so much I wanted another pair . However , I have recently tried 3 new pairs of Dansko clogs -LRB- all dark colors -RRB- and they all dye my socks . They are extremelly comfortable but I hated to see my white socks dyed after few hours of wearing the clogs . I returned the shoes -LRB- black and blueberry colors -RRB- and ended up with Dansko Nubuck in light blue . The inside is light brown . That too does dye my socks , but at least it is not black.It is still the most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned , but be ready to see your white socks black .
 I have n't even received my order and am furious with Amazon ! I was charged twice for my order by Amazon and when I called Customer Service I was told the first charge was a pre-authorization and I should contact my bank about getting it credited back . So I did call my bank and was told that if Amazon would send a fax explaining what had happened the bank would credit my account for the $ 99.99 . I again spoke to an Amazon Customer Service rep and was told they could submit my request to billing but it would take at least 3 days for my request to be processed . Word of wisdom
 I have worn Dansko 's for over 20 years and never had any problems . They have always been my favorite most comfortable shoes and well worth the cost . In the last year I have had 3 pairs of Dansko 's less than 3 years old fall apart suddenly . It is like the soles just disintergrated . I store my shoes in boxes w / silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated . I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly . I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also . I gather Dansko has changed the material for the soles in the last few years and it is common for this `` dryrot '' issue to occur .
 I bought this for my wife . I ordered brown , and I received old brown.She is a surgeon and needed to replace the previous right away . Because she needed the clogs NOW , and she could n't afford to wait another week for a replacement , she will be stuck with the wrong pair for a while .
 Do n't buy these from Amazon . My wifes pair arrived packaged nicely in the original box but it was clear that the shoes had been worn before . The leather on the left shoe was stretched by someone walking in them and they missed a spot when they wiped off the bottom . White is a hard color to clean dirt from so it was obvious . There was also a nice sweat/dirt line just inside the left shoe . If this pair would have been offered at a shoe store I would have asked for a different pair or a discount . I will no longer trust Amazon for a new shoe purchase .
 I can not see if `` made in China '' is stenciled in the upper and there is no serial number , but the shoes I bought from Footsmart could n't cut an 8 hour shift . I wore them around the house the day they came in the mail and they seemed fine , but after I wore them the following day at my busy waitress job , I felt crippled . The stitching around the sides dug into my feet and worse , the ball of my right foot is still sore 30 hours after having taken them off and my toes on that foot are still numb . I ca n't believe these are the same Dansko shoes so many rave about and just maybe they are not . After one wearing , they would not allow me to return them nor would they send me a different right shoe . Now I 'm just $ 100 poorer and have a pair of shoes I will never wear again in my closet . Great . My suggestion is that you buy Dansko 's from a company that takes returns in the event it does n't work out for you . I wish I had .
 I decided to get a pair of Dansko clogs because I 've heard and read so much about them , and I do have significant foot problems , which limits the kinds of shoes I can wear . This basic model comes in a narrow , and it fits my foot well , as described . I like the way it rolls forward as you walk . The shoe has a bit of a platform bottom , so it puts you up a little higher than `` flats '' . I thought it was a nice change from my usual Birkenstocks and sneakers . I am leery about rolling an ankle in them , as many have reported , though , as I am a bit accident - prone . I was also leery about the hard foot bed , and my foot did seem sore after wearing them off and on . But my foot problems also can be off and on -LRB- but REALLY on when wearing the wrong type of shoes -RRB- . Overall I liked the look and feel of the shoe pretty well , and really wanted to love them . But after wearing them on a long day with a lot of errands , my soles were so extremely painful that I had to put lidocaine patches on them and take pain meds . So disappointed . The fit is good , and I ca n't get my orthotics into them . Maybe there 's a thin insert that would help ... suggestions ? Apparently my case is unusual , but I would like to see Dansko either 1 . Offer a `` soft footbed '' version , as Birkenstock does for some of its styles , or 2 . Make the insole removable , in case customers want to use their own custom orthotics.Meanwhile , I strongly recommend that if you have foot problems -LRB- mine are plantar fasciitis and tendonitis , aggravated by lupus -RRB- , and you want to try these clogs , do wear them around your house as much as you can for a couple of days , and see how your feet feel , before you decide whether to keep or return them . I wish I had known this , it would have saved me a lot of money and pain , so I Hope this helps someone ! -LRB- actually , this item IS available ; do n't know why it is listed as `` not available . -RRB-
 I seriously am not understanding the positive reviews on these shoes , but I fell for them and now I 'm sitting here with sore feet . I think some of the problems are unique to my situation while others could possibly be more universal , i.e. something for everyone to consider when thinking of dropping $ 100 + on these shoes . I 'll break the review down into `` universal '' and `` unique '' issues.Universal : - The bottom , i.e. insole , is hard . Maybe if this were n't the case , these shoes would be less painful for me . There just is not cushioning on the inside . I do n't get it . How are these shoes comfortable to anyone with no cushioning , and why do n't they have any ? - These shoes seem to come at least a size or half a size smaller than normal . This makes it difficult to reliably order online , and I am glad I did actually go to a store and try shoes on . Originally , I had called the store up to get the plain Dansko professional leather shoes set aside for me to pick up , told them my size and they held them for me . I got to the store , and those shoes were just too small and uncomfortable . Went a size up , and still ... could barely get my left foot in the shoe -LRB- my left foot is slightly larger than my right foot -RRB- . I asked if they had any Danskos not leathered and they said no ... leather , to me , makes shoes less comfortable because leather is more rigid , harder to stretch out and such . The salesman suggested the oiled Danskos , and they did work better ... but still felt a little too small , even a size up , particularly on the left foot . The salesman stretched out the left shoe , and it eventually felt doable , though not the most comfortable . But I 'd read there was a break-in period , so I went with it . Um , it seems like every time I take the shoes off and put them back on again , they have gone back to being as uncomfortable as the first time I put them on , i.e. they just do n't seem to `` break in . '' At least not quickly , i.e. within a week.Unique -LRB- and these things , as well as some positives about the shoes , are why I give 2 stars and not one -RRB- : - The shoe is uncomfortable , sometimes painful , across the top of my feet , particularly my left -LRB- larger -RRB- foot . I 've seen others say this , too , but I admit to having big , wide feet . I do not have little dainty women feet . I maybe should have asked for the men 's Danskos ... honestly , I do order men 's shoes at times because I have big feet and it 's hard to find women 's shoes in my size at times . But because I had to go up a size with these shoes , I ended up getting the largest size they come in for women ... and I feel like that size is still actually too small for me . It 's actually a little difficult for me to even get my left foot in the shoe , depending on the kind of socks I 'm wearing . Maybe if I could have gotten a better fit for these shoes , they 'd be more comfortable . With the shoes being not quite the right fit , I ca n't really even get cushion-y inserts into them that do n't make the shoes even more uncomfortable . Something to keep in mind for women with big feet.-The shoes are generally fine for about 3 hours or so , but then they start getting more and more intolerable . I work a job where I basically STAND in the SAME SPOT for 8 hours . Most reviews , if not all , I see on these shoes where people are being positive ... are from people who probably are walking and moving about for hours and hours . I do think these shoes are more comfortable when I 'm on the move , though I 'm still not sure I 'd be able to say , if I moved in these for 8-12 hours , things like I see other people writing , i.e. `` my feet feel as good as they did when I first put them on 12 hours ago . '' I really doubt it , especially with , again , the rigid leather material and the hard insole . But I ca n't at all say they feel as good as 8-9 hours before work , with a job where I stand . Again , 3 hours is the ultimate for me . 7 hours in , my feel are hurting to the point where it 's tough for me to concentrate , and all I do is think of excuses I can make in order to sneak off and sit down somewhere . One day , I actually changed out of these shoes and finished my shift in regular shoes because it was so uncomfortable . I have gotten to the point where I take the shoes off regularly during my shift and just stand in my socks/try to stretch out the muscles in my feet . Keep this in mind if you have to stand for hours and hours , and are considering these shoes.-I pretty much always feel as if I 'm going to fall when I wear these shoes . It 's not really the issue others have mentioned , i.e. the heel bouncing up and down in the shoes . It 's how they feel like high heels . If you 're not used to wearing heels ... I 'm finding it just odd . I feel like I do n't have control of my own balance.-I think it might also be important to note that I 'm overweight . It might very well be the case that neither these shoes nor any other are going to help anyone who is putting a lot of weight on their feet for a long time.Positives-With every other kind of shoe , my feet are not the only thing hurting at the end of the day . My back , my legs , even below my stomach area all hurt . I do n't get that with these shoes -- nothing hurts but my feet when I wear these shoes.-I feel completely debilitated after work with other shoes , i.e. I can barely stand or walk for hours after work . With these shoes , my feet do hurt bad after work -LRB- for hours -RRB- , but I can still manage to get around ... I just would rather not ...
 I love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel . I get great arch support and there is plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around . They are fantastic for long hours on your feet.BUT , they are terrible for my ankles . When I wear these shoes I roll my ankles all the time and have fallen a couple of times . They are especially bad for me in a hospital setting where there are cords and such that I risk stepping on . I am also afraid to walk/run in them because I am afraid I will wipe out and fall down.I really want to love these , but I feel that the base of the sole needs to be a bit wider for stability .
 I just recently purchased a pair of the Dansko professional oiled leather clogs . When they arrived I tried them on , it was difficult to get them on they felt a full size smaller . The feel was stiff and hard not comfortable at all.I have a pair that I purchased in 1997 that were the same size as the new pair that fit perfectly and oh so comfortable.I put the 2 pairs together and it was quite obvious the new pair was a few inches shorter.I contacted Dansko and spoke with 2 different representatives who really had no explanation and suggested that I just return them and exchange them.My concern is was it that particular pair or has the sizing changed.I decided to do some research and have read that the new clogs are manufactured in China and the quality is not the same . I checked inside the shoe and it is printed made in China.I think my best bet is to return them .
 They are not comfortable at all really do n't like them . If I knew how to send them back I would .
 The shoes were very uncomfortable , hard , blistered my feet . And i discovered that the shoes of the same size and make are do not fit the same , maybe i should have bought them from a store . Never again
 I bought the brown oiled leather Dansko 's for a vacation to the UK and returned them promptly after getting back home to the US . I thought since I 've heard great things about these shoes and since Danskos are so ugly , they have to be comfortable . I was totally wrong !! These shoes proved to be the absolute worst choice in footwear for European travel and for those that have low arches!The Dansko 's work great for people with high arches , but I felt like I had a river rock jammed in my arch and the aftermath left me with intense pain in my arches and heels days after switching to my Crocs for the remainder of my vacation.The Danskos also have a thick , stiff arch which is a disaster when walking on uneven pavement or cobblestone as the shoe does n't give . I rolled my ankle countless times while walking on cobblestone and ended up with a mild sprained ankle on the first day of my vacation . I have very strong ankles , excellent balance -LRB- I 'm a yoga instructor -RRB- , and I 'm a lightweight so I 'm not the type of person that takes a step wrong or prone to rolled ankles.Last time I vacationed in Europe , I wore $ 20 clog Crocs and walked 10 + miles everyday without experiencing any problems over the cobblestone . I do n't think I 'll experiment with other shoes such as Danskos for the next vacation I take .
 I was so excited to finally purchase a pair of Dansko 's but I 've tried on clogs before and they always seem to run small . Given that information I went ahead and ordered a size larger than I normally would have . I wear a standard size 10 in US Women 's shoes , I ordered a size 11.5 US -LRB- 42 EU -RRB- in these and there is no way they are this size . I also have several pairs of Birkenstock shoes at size 41 that are longer than these . I wondered if perhaps they sent the wrong size in the box , but it is stamped quite clearly on the bottom of the shoe size 42 EU . It simply is not possible for me to fit my smaller foot -LRB- my left foot is smaller by about half a size -RRB- into these shoes . I am so disappointed as I really was looking forward to having my first pair of Dansko shoes that I 'd heard so many great recommendations on . It is my opinion that at the larger sizes these shoes run very small . I think perhaps one size larger may fit , however I still have n't decided if I 'm going to try a larger size . If I do , I will update my review with how that turns out .

 Having read so many glowing reviews for Danner boots for so long , I concluded that they must be the best US-made boots money can buy and determined to try a few . Having done so , I feel I can safely conclude that my assessment was correct , but that is as far as it goes , as I can also safely conclude now that those who are enamored of Danner boots are the type who insist on buying US-made products in general . Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .
 These shoes would be very comfortable if they were sized correctly . They felt okay when I first put them on , but after walking about a mile , my toes curled up . It is usually easy to tell when a walking shoe is too small , but it was n't with these shoes until I walked for a while .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

Having done so , I feel I can safely conclude that my assessment was correct , but that is as far as it goes , as I can also safely conclude now that those who are enamored of Danner boots are the type who insist on buying US-made products in general . Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .
 Could n't tell you how the shoes are , had to cancel my order as apparently 2 weeks is an acceptable shipping time to these people . You pay $ 20 for 1-3 day expedited shipping and they still ca n't get them to you in any sort of timely fashion . I ordered at 7 am Monday morning , best they could do is Friday afternoon of next week.Sorry , I need these for work , and saving $ 1.50 compared to the local shoe store is not worth a 2 week wait.Try and be a bit more professional with your turn around time .
 Remember Steve Martin 's `` Cruel Shoes '' ? These are them . I bought the black patents and got four blisters in four blocks . It 's now five days later and I still have band-aids on my feet . I 'm actually afraid of these shoes . The leather ones might be fine , and the patent ones certainly * look * pretty , but I 've developed a facial tic at the thought of wearing them again .

 I was very disappointed with these moccasins as they were very loose/wide -LRB- even though I wear a medium and they say they are medium width -RRB- . When I walked around the house in them -LRB- had to put socks on so they 'd stay on my feet -RRB- I could feel my feet sliding to the side . Lengthwise they were perfect but even wearing socks , I knew I 'd be in trouble if I walked around in these even a brief amount of time .
 I 've had these shoes for about 4 months now . I have these in black and they are cute and for the most part comfortable . The price is also very good.But I give these 2 stars because the cons way outweigh the pros.The cons
 I really wanted to love these shoes , they 're really cute and comfy . BUT , I wore them one time and the front seam ripped , exposing my big toe on the right side . The left side seam was starting to come undone too . These are not too tight , in fact they fit loosely , so they did n't break from over stretching . These are not constructed well , even though the leather seems to be good quality . Just be aware , these are not the high quality moccasins that Minnetonka used to produce . Not worth the extra money for the name . I had to return my pair , I hope Amazon comes through with the refund .
 The one they sent me is soft sole and the product description said they would be rubber sole !! Feel soo disappointed !!! Fix it ASAP !!!!!!
 I bought a pair of these very pretty , reasonably priced mocs last year and was delighted with them - until : - the beading around the soles separated,-the toe stitching blew out,-and the inner soles separated.While they are lovely to look at and have a really nice range of colors , I suggest you stay away from them .
 This is my first time buying goods in Amazon , however it is n't a pleased result . Both the picture and the description on the Amazon website show it is a Hardsole shoes , rubber sole shoes . When I receive the shoes , it disappointed me a lot cause it is softsole . I ca n't wear them outdoor . I really hope shoebuy could give our customer a pleased feedback . Unfortunatly , it has ' t been solved now .
 Be very careful ordering these shoes ! Some of them are not as pictured ! Most pictures show a rubber sole . I ordered one where no sole was shown -LRB- only the top of the shoe was shown ... which excluded showing that no sole was included on this particular pair -RRB- . Very deceptive and I 'm pretty mad about it . If one of the shoe options is not the same as the others shown in the options then hiding the difference is dishonest . I 've applied for `` approval '' to return these shoes but have not yet received it.Buyer beware -LRB- and seller , if you 're offering a different version of these shoes hiding the difference is deceptive and only leads to bad reviews and not happy customers -RRB- .
 I was sent a pair of soft sole moccasins . The top of the shoe looks very cute but I can not ever wear these outside so whats the point , I did n't buy slippers . The description and picture of the shoes , in all colors , shows a rubber sole . I 'm really dissapointed since I had to return . Please correct your site and descriptions , very misleading .
 I returned this - I just could n't get over the feeling that I looked like an old lady wearing these ... They were ok comfortable , but not over the top comfortable where I could have gotten over the fact they did n't look good on me . If they felt more like a supportive slipper , I probably would have kept them .
 We were looking forward to receiving these moccasins for my wife but were very disapointed when we found defects in the lacing near the tongue . The top holes for lacing were torn on both shoes and the lacing had pulled out . Obviously a manufacturing defect which should have been caught at the factory ! I guess the Chinese are not really up to par on quality control these days . Very disapointing !
 I ordered 3 pairs of Moccasin shoes for family members -LRB- upon their request -RRB- . However , two pair did not work out . I called to ask for their return policy . On their website , they stated that after 30 days , you will need to pay $ 5 for each pair to return . If in any way you damage their shoe boxes , you will need to pay another $ 5 for the shoe box . Please , who in the world charge people for shoe boxes ???? I will NEVER shop for their shoes again . Also , they make shoes that have no soles . Who in the world wear that kind of shoes ???? Very bad business practice . I do n't know why people give their product such good reviews . Run the other way will be my recommendation .
 Shoes are fine , look nice . Here 's the rub , I bought these for my wife for Xmas not knowing that apparently they run big . She tried them on a few weeks later and they were too big . I emailed Footnation and they would n't exchange them for another size b/c of their 30 day return policy . Since I purchased them the beginning of Dec , by the time I gave them to her it was already 20 + days into their 30 day policy . Ridiculous . I can understand not RETURNING the shoes after 30 days but to refuse to EXCHANGE them for another size ? You 've got to be kidding me . In this market you would think stores would bend over backwards trying to keep customers . Wake up retail world , its no longer a booming economy ! I would have purchased more shoes from them , but no thanks . I 'll find a store that appreciates my business .
 the moccassins arent as described when they came they were softsole when the picture and desription described hardsole moccassins they need to fix this asap
 I rated these shoes one star because I just do n't believe any shoe should look this beat up after 3.5 months . I have very rarely worn the shoes outside , mostly just around the house . I do n't think they would exist if I ventured out in them . They look sloppy and overrun because the width has stretched so much . And , they stretched width-wise very soon after I started wearing them.I do n't think anyone with a slightly narrow foot could wear these . My width is between B and C and these are probably at least a D now . Both of the ties have ripped off , and I probably only tied them a few times . They 're comfortable because they 're such a wreck they 're barely touching my feet anymore . I need to buy new mocassins , but I definitely wo n't be buying these again .
 I bought these hoping I could find a shoe to wear around the house . But after owning these for a few months , they have stretched out so much I can no longer wear them . The big toe area has a big hole in the leather , the ties keep coming apart and never stayed tied . I will not buy Minnetonka shoes anymore . Such a shame because they use to be quality made , now they are a piece of nothing . Maybe they are this way because they are n't made in the USA anymore .
 I ordered the gray pair of these moccasins , and could hardly wait to get them . I was expecting a wonderful pair of shoes , considering I already own them in brown and in purple . I have never been more disappointed with an order received from any online company . They were absolutely terrible . One shoe has a rounded tip around the toes , the other is more pointed . They are two different shades of gray . One is a more stiff leather the other not so much , AND one is bigger than the other -LRB- and both say size 8 -RRB- . And to top it off Amazon customer service was horrible . I ca n't see myself ordering from Amazon.com ANY time soon , if ever again . Very , very disappointed .
 i wore these shoes for years and now they are made very differently . too big and wide for my narrow foot .
 I recieved the shoes promptly btu man where they in bad shape . One shoe was twice as wide as the other ! Really strange .
 Purchased for my daughter for Christmas . She does n't love them and we want to exchange . Unfortunately , we accidentally discarded the box . Customer service will not respond to our inquiry about if we can return or not . So , we have n't been able to do anything yet and it 's been nearly a month .
 I bought this shoe four months ago . I paid fifty dollars for them , but they did not prove to be worth the money . Unfortunately , after two months the interior bottom started detaching itself from the rest of the shoe ; this makes wearing them very uncomfortable . Also , the shoelaces come undone every fifth step , so extensive walking is out of the picture if you do n't want to be highly inconvenienced . Overall , the shoe did not meet my basic expectations , and was utterly overpriced for the quality .
 What i ordered is Minnetonka Women 's Kity Moccasin `` DUSTY BROWN '' and what i got is a black one with tiger print on the top front . . though on the box its written dust browngetting a wrong order cost me a lot cause i live outside the US so i have to pay shipping plus customs and returning it via any courier will cost me triple its price ... i will think twice next time if i thought of ordering anything from Minnetonka !!! as i order a lot of things from others and get exactly what i order !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 These shoes run small , so make sure you order at least a half size larger than you would normally wear . I did n't like them at all . The material is very hard , very stiff . It never gets better , and I wore them through 3 seasons of bowling leagues before finally purchasing a different brand . I much prefer the type of bowling shoe that is just like a tennis shoe . A pair that looks and feels just like your favorite pair of sneakers , but with the bowling-shoe sole added on .

 Having read so many glowing reviews for Danner boots for so long , I concluded that they must be the best US-made boots money can buy and determined to try a few . Having done so , I feel I can safely conclude that my assessment was correct , but that is as far as it goes , as I can also safely conclude now that those who are enamored of Danner boots are the type who insist on buying US-made products in general . Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .
 Just like I said with the other Tour Master products , these are not waterproof . I went for a ride and had to poor the water out when I was done .

 These shoes would be very comfortable if they were sized correctly . They felt okay when I first put them on , but after walking about a mile , my toes curled up . It is usually easy to tell when a walking shoe is too small , but it was n't with these shoes until I walked for a while .

 I bought these shoes in May 2011 . By the middle of June , the soles and heels started to disintegrate . I had the same problem with a pair of Ecco shoes I bought about 8 years ago ; the company acknowledged that there was a problem with the rubber compound and said they had corrected the problem . I suspect that the `` New City '' shoes are new old stock since they are not in the Ecco catalog , and the sole looks the same as the one on the earlier pair that disintegrated .
 ... SOLES DISINTEGRATED IN LESS THAN 5 WEARS . - AND I WASNT JOGGING IN THEM , I WORK AT A DESK ALL DAY . SENT THEM BACK TO JOHNSTON AND MURPHY FOR A REPLACEMENT . HOPEFULLY THE NEW PAIR WONT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS . BUT AFTER READING ONE OF THE TWO OTHER POSTS , I AM NOT HOPEFUL .
 the sole of the boot is comprised of three layers of rubber . three months in and they 're already starting to peel apart . might as well buy the $ 50 made in china pair .

 These shoes would be very comfortable if they were sized correctly . They felt okay when I first put them on , but after walking about a mile , my toes curled up . It is usually easy to tell when a walking shoe is too small , but it was n't with these shoes until I walked for a while .
 Would not recommend these if you have a normal foot because the shoe does not grip around the middle enough so that the foot ends up sliding forward and hitting the big toe ; not good . Also , the softness gives it a fuddy duddy `` old lady '' look and feel . The cushiness on the sole/instep does n't do a thing for comfort since the toe hits the front of the shoe . These might be really nice for those with wide feet . The dark blue ones are not a true navy , they are lighter and `` bluer '' .

 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 They must have a different definition of `` XW '' than I am used to . These shoes were not even close to Extra Wide . Another downside to buying clothing online .

 The sole on these boot wore slick about a year after puchase . I love danner for the comfort I will get a black sole next time for durability .
 The product is great ; but I got sent the wrong color . It was listed as black/blue and turned out to be black/purple and shiny silver . Someone must be color blind .
 Just got these and was so disappointed ! I 've loved reefs all my life and was so excited for this pair , but what came in the mail was not what I expected . I wear 7.5 , 8 tops and since they dont have half sized I got an 8 . What I got was a 6.5 or a 7 max . Although all the stickers say 8 . Not in this world ! Also , the tread is plasticy crap that 's slicker than socks . SHAMEE !!!
 I 've owned at least half a dozen pairs of these sandals over the years . Typically they are excellent . These , however , were much more flimsy and cheaper than my older pairs , and the bottom tread looks completely different compared to my others . They are also too small , even though I 've always worn the size I ordered . Either Reef has gone incredibly down hill , or these are fake shoes .
 The comfort of reef sandals are great -- i have owned several pairs but the metallic colors are plain ugly . oxy-moronic styling in a beach flip-flop . Amazon 's color selection is very limited -- these metallic colors and all black are the only choice . Reef has lots of additional colors -- would be great to see them offered on amazon .
 Ordered these for my daughter . She normally wears 7 1/2 - 8 Medium width . I ordered 8M for her . When she got these they were smaller than any of her 7 1/2 sandles and MUCH narrower . Totally unusable . Marking on the back was US 8 . NOT ! Also the quality , look , and feel was on par with the $ 3.99 stuff you see in Walmart , et al. . Not worth the trouble of returning . Amazon ... I trusted you and you let me down !!! Amazon should screen their suppliers better , are they trying to grow too fast ??? Reef - you need to watch your quality better - do n't lose your image just trying to make your quartlerly numbers . BTW - the label said `` made in Indonesia '' .
 I wear 8.5 to size 9 . 9 's were an entire size too small . They do n't issue exchanges , by the time I would return them I 'd lose half of what I 'd paid in shipping costs , deducted and what I 'd have to pay to return . They feel pretty flimsy also !
 The big toe divider on these flip-flops were much too long for my small feet and I could n't keep them on my feet . I returned them . I also did n't like the curved sole -- which made walking harder .
 I bought these flip flops to wear at the health club pool . It appeared from the picture that the straps were stiff so I could slip them off and on easily . They are n't . The ` thong ' straps are fabric and they flop so that you have to use your fingers to situate the straps on your foot . Be fine if I was wearing them all day , but I 'm putting them on and taking them off and it 's annoying , especially when your feet are wet .
 I have purchased speedo flip flops many times , these are awful . They are like what you buy in the dollar store , no arch support and a sole that catches and folds up under your toe . I do n't believe these are really speedo 's . Do n't buy .
 The pair I ordered was defective and I had to return them . The strap was placed to far back on the shoe bed , so it did n't fit the contour of my foot correctly . I 've since purchased this shoe elsewhere and I 'm very happy with it .
 I just received these reef sandals in the mail and was totally disappointed . First all they do not resemble any of the other reef sandals I have purchased , in look or quality . They look and feel cheap . Secondly , this is not a great price for them -LRB- $ 19.99 -RRB- , this is the sticker cost , I have since found out .
 I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them . I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material . It used to be dense rubber with some weight to it . The arches were what i loved the most and the durablity . The new material is lightweight and doesnt hold up well . The arches arent as good because the rubber is so soft . I wore them around the pool and they got a bit wet and I left them in the sun . When I returned the sole was acutally curled . I am so disappointed . I can only hope that they go back to using the old material or I will need to find another brand to replace them with .

 I was disappointed , since obtaining AAA width shoes can be a challenge -- the right shoe was AA width while the left shoe was AAA width -LRB- what I ordered -RRB- ! Wo n't waste my time and money with this brand again !
 Nice looking shoe for work/walking . However , it was too short . I wear a size 10 in most every shoe I 've ever bought , but my toes pressed right into the tip of this slip-on .
 I used to wear the Softwalk La Palma Shoes for work and they were extremely comfortable and wide . Unfortunately , Softwalk stopped making this style of shoe , so I purchased the Adora 's as they appeared to match the style . However , these are very narrow shoes , even in a double wide size . Needless to say , I returned these shoes immediately .
 I work for an airline and walk all day on the airplane . I had a shoe from softwalk similar to these shoes , and they were fabulous , however , this was the same type of shoe , but not as comfortable . I ordered a 1/2 size larger than what I needed , and it was still too short . I sent this shoe back because it broke in the wrong place when you took a step and it rubbed all day . I ordered another shoe from softwalk with a longer top on it , and hopefully it will work well .
 This shoe is probably good if it fits you properly . Although the width seemed correct at the balls of my feet , something about this design pinched my feet where the upper portion of the shoe ended.However , since the poor fit was immediately apparent , I had no problem returning these shoes .
 These shoes , Softwalk Women 's Adora Slipon , did not fit me . That may not be the shoe 's fault but none the less I ca n't wear them . They were an extremely good price with the company discount and my points earned . I had tried to wear them on 2 occasions so I could n't return them . However , they fit my daughter very well and she loves them . They got a 4 star rating from her .

 The shoe runs a little narrow , so if you need a wide , order up a 1/2 size .
 These could have been good shoes but they fall off when you walk . Not because they are too big , but the heel is to loose . I wear a 10.5 and that 's what I got . They fit comfortably but am falling out of them when I walk . Glad they where cheap , if I where not so horribly lazy would have tried to return them .
 I ordered size 10 and I could n't get my feet into them . I would suggest that if you have swelled or just large feet that you order a higher size . Because there is no elastic , the top of the shoes just does n't have any give at all . The shoes were long enough for me but just could n't wear them . My feet are n't all that big either .
 These were a comfortable shoe for the first month or so . Then I started noticing a weird popping sound accompanied by a mild snapping sensation in the sole . Could n't see any sign of trouble at first . During the second month of ownership , the popping got worse and cracks started developing . At the end of 2 months , they were unwearable . You can flex the soles and see a spider web of cracks that literally go thru to the insole . I live in Colorado and wore them in the first couple of months of spring . Did n't wear them in the mountains on sharp rocks . No 130 degree asphalt . I 'm not obese . I just wore them on the weekends and some evenings for working around the house . No reason for the soles to go to pieces like this other than it 's just a very bad rubber formulation . These are complete junk . You 're better off spending more money on some Merrell mocs . I just ordered a pair for $ 66 here on Amazon . They 're more than double the cost but at least I know they 'll last at least a couple of years versus a couple of months .
 I think the shoe is fairly comfortable , but a little too clunky and heavy around the sole area ! Eccos are better !
 I have had several pairs of slippers in the past and all have been comfortable at size 10.5-11 .5 . The Acorn Men 's Highlander slippers were a 10.5-11 .5 on the label but were not even close to fitting me . My guess is that they were closer to 9.5 - 10.5 . I gave them away to a friend with smaller feet . I do n't know if Made in China had anything to do with the bad sizing but they were n't even close to proper north american sizing . I were a standard shoe 10.0 to 10.5 depending on the width .
 Appealing design but the sizing is misleading . The item was returned because they were too small ; I could not simply exchange it as the vendor requires one to return and re-purchase .
 THE SHOE HORN WAS JUST THE PERFECT GIFT FOR THE INTENDED . GREAT QUALITY FOR THE PRICE . BUT , EVEN THOUGH THE DELIVERY WAS PROMISED WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE REQUIRED DATE IT DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL WEEKS AFTER IT WAS PROMISED . DO NOT TRUST AMAZON DELIVERY DATES . REPEAT DO NOT TRUST AMAZON DELIVERY DATES . WOULD RATHER BUY FROM THE STORE AND HAVE IT IN HAND .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 The style is so attractive that I really wanted them , but the left and right were two different shades of red so I returned them .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 I tried them on at a shoe store , they seemed fine . I bought them on line . They were too tight . I called the Mephisto website . The lady told me that they should be more comfortable after the 2nd time I wore them -- REALLY -- WELL NOT REALLY ! So I tried wearing them -- the 1st day -- an hour or so . Did not hurt much but TOO tight ! Pain on my insteps and my RIGHT arch ONLY -- after wearing them a little the second day . I 'd return them but I unfortunately stumbled and scuffed them . So now -- the shoe stretcher and investigating how to push down the right arch support enough , but not too much . Anyone , know what I should do ? They are nice looking shoes but I think I 'm the mouse caught in the mousetrap of beauty . Also , they soil easily on the suede like nubuck . So far a big disappointment !

 Liked the looks and washability of these shoes , but they were too hard to get on especially with socks . I have these in a slide and love them , but these were not comfortable .
 I ordered my usual size , and these shoes were too small . I did not order a larger size because the width was fine - the length was not - and I did not want a larger , loose shoe . I also expected more of a cushioned feeling based on the other reviews . These were very firm , and I did not think they would be comfortable for a full day of walking on cement floors .
 I thought this style would be comfortable ... looks are deceiving . It felt like I was wearing a Plastic shoe . It made my toes pull together ... the heel area is high and rubber my tendon . No comfort here !!
 The shoe is comfortable except that the right shoe rubs in the back . Maybe I should not have ordered a wide . I might have to put a lift in the right one . I was very surprised at how light it is . I will probably save it for more dressy wear since it is very attractive .
 I have two diffrent sized feet and I ordered 4 pair -LRB- to make 2 pair for me -RRB- of Propet shoes from Street Moda . Two of the pairs came the wrong size . Not that they ran small or anything , they were n't what I ordered . I wrote to Street moda to find out what to do and they told me to send them back with the enclosed return label . I searched and search and could n't find the label . I told them so and - no response . Then I finally found the label - it WAS BLANK ! I scanned the blank label and e-mailed it to them . No response , no acknowledgement that they received or looked at the label.I mailed the shoes back via USPS Priority mail and sent the blank shipping label with it , and I wrote down the replacement sizes I neaded . 3 WEEKS later , I got an e-mail from street moda that they had reeived my retirn and processed it . I had been waiting for my returns by then . A couple days later I got an e-mail notifying me that I would n't be charged a restocking fee if I USED THE RETURN SHIPPING LABEL THEY GAVE ME !!??? I asked if this was some sort of joke , and the woman wrote about how sorry she was and she 'd make sure my return got sent out imediately , less the handling time -LRB- yes , she said that -RRB- . A week and a half went by and I e-mailed again asking if there was any news about my shoes , which is when another woman appologised and promised to fix this immediately , less the regular handling time , of course . Street Moda does n't keep Prpet in stock , they have all orders drop shipped . They 're employees do n't follow up on anything , and they make common mistakes that - should - be followed up on . Buy your Propet directly from Amazon , or another vendor .
 My wife had her right hip and knee replaced so she spent a lot of time researching for the best shoe to aide in her recovery . These shoes were touted as the best . As soon as she put them on she had to remove them . They were extremely uncomfortable.They have no arch support what so ever . And before she put them on we both commented on how poorly they were constructed . Also the size was way off . We think they sent men 's size rather than woman 's . One of our criteria for buying anything is made in the USA . Before we ordered these shoes I asked if they were American made . I was informed that they were made in Canada . Of course , we trust the craftsmanship of our neighbors from the north . However , the label inside this shoe states that they are made in China !!! I feel bad to have to write a negative report but I do n't want you to be disappointed if you purchase them .
 As an avid gardener and also a fan of Propet shoes which offer sizes in Wide width , I was looking forward to the wash and wear feature . However , just one look right out of the box and the constricting feel in putting them on , I immediately repacked and returned them .
 These shoes run large , and are not as comfortable as described . I would n't dare wear these for work . They are large/loose in height and length , but still narrow in the front just behind the toe box . I 've bought much better , much more comfortable footwear for less money than these shoes cost.I like the color and texture of the material , but do n't know how they will look & feel after washing . They look OK , but they feel cheap on my feet , and I wo n't buy another pair . I wish I had returned them , but thought that if I bought better insoles they would be comfortable , but they really are n't , and I have to wear extra thick socks with these although I still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes . I regret that I threw out the box and can not return them . They are a waste of my money .
 I was so excited about this shoe from all the good reviews . But when I got it , not only did I realize the shoe ran REALLY big - it would n't even stay on my foot ! - but it also had a very `` plastic '' look to it . Honestly , it just looked really cheap and very old fashioned for this 35 year old :--RRB- I could never give prophet 1 star because honestly , they have a lot of great shoes , but this just was n't one of them .
 I returned these shoes . They were way too long in the toe and the heel slipped in my regular size . Not what I expected , but they are a nice looking shoe .
 I ordered these for a friend , who picked out the particular size . The sizing options listed were a bit confusing , and of course the ones she received were too long despite being her usual size . She is returning them , not trying to exchange for another pair .
 I was so looking forward to wearing these shoes.But the heels were much too loose , and the shoe did n't fit properly around the ball of the foot.I walked in them for 5 minutes on my carpeted floors and decided that no additions or adjustments to the liners would make these shoes fit correctly .
 I was pleased with these shoes when I first tried them on . They fit perfectly . Then I wore them for about an hour . I have never worn such uncomfortable shoes in my life . Even the cheapest shoes I ever owned did not hurt like these . There is n't enough padding in the front and the balls of my feet ached terribly , and this has never happened to me before . I got a blister on my instep , and blisters on both heels . I have bunions and hammer toes , and as long as I buy shoes wide enough at the toe area , they do n't bother me . There was so much room , my toes kept overlapping and squishing my toes together , so that caused even more pain . I have been wearing easy spirit for about twenty years , and it looks like I will be wearing them another twenty . Now those shoes are comfortable .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 Do n't buy Acorn products . I 've had my last pair of Acorn slippers for 10 years , used to think pretty highly of their products . My wife just bought me a new pair and evidently they 're all made in China now ! My old ones were made in the USA . If they want to make them in China , let them stay there . The quality has definetly gone down hill ... a lot . These new ones will not last like the first ones I had , the liners and stitching are crap and the soles will be worn through in no time . We 're returning them for something of better quality made here in the U.S. Do n't support these greedy companies that export jobs and make inferior products , buy quality , buy American . It may cost a little more but you 'll have something you wo n't be a shamed of .
 Unlike other reviewers who find this a long-lasting slipper , I have not and therefore ca n't give it high marks . I like the slipper as it 's comfortable and because it has a back works well for me , as I need to wear orthotics . I have had two pairs of these , and neither lasted a year . In both cases the sole has separated from the upper . For a slipper of this price , that is unacceptable.Subsequent to writing this , I bought a pair of Isotoner slippers that are the same style as the Acorns . I 've had them nearly four months and find them equal to the Acorns at a lower price . If they last a year or more -LRB- at which time I 'll report back -RRB- I would recommend them over the Acorns .

 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .
 I bought this product as the price was right it is true you get what you pay for . I followed directions as stated on the bottle . The cleaner left dark spots when dried , the white bar did n't work at all just left a big mess on the table . I am a little scared to use the Protector . I will not recommend this product .
 This is the worst suede care kit I have ever used . Horrible by any measure , Kiwi should be ashamed at putting out such a bad product .
 These slippers are very uncomfortable . They are also made of cheap fabric and are not the least bit warm . I will not waste the money to return them , since I have already wasted enough money .
 The shoe is so wide my feet slide around in them in a very uncomfortable way . I wore them once and never again . Look elsewhere .
 They must have a different definition of `` XW '' than I am used to . These shoes were not even close to Extra Wide . Another downside to buying clothing online .
 The leather and warmth on these boots are awesome comfortable nice boots but the sole wore out and fell off in one month . I called the company . They told me nothing they could do about it and to return them to the place I bought them . I thought I would have these boots for years !! Not just one monthThanks for nothing I will never buy a product from this company again.Look around for a better Boot
 All of the other reviews must have been after they recently bought these boots . They are comfortable . The outsoles and leather are durable , but the insole has completely deteriorated in 6 months . I wear these boots on a regular basis for work , so they get good wear . I had a pair of red wings that I had for 10 years . These did not make the cut . Also the stiching is starting to come apart on the boot straps and upper trim .

 From Amazon , I usually buy shoes size 8.5 and sandals size 9 , whatever the brand . Shoes size 9 are a bit big for me . This is why , after reading previous comments , I thought these shoes in size 9 would do . Big mistake . For these shoes you 'd need to get a pair not one size bigger but a size and a half at least . I wonder , was it that difficult for the Tsubo brand people to check and follow the sizes at their manufacturer -LRB- s -RRB- back in China ?
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 The shoe is so wide my feet slide around in them in a very uncomfortable way . I wore them once and never again . Look elsewhere .

 I have the exact same feelings as William Hunicke in his review . I also do not have knee problems , but after running with these even for short distances now , my knees hurt . I have had them for probably a year now and I just ca n't take it anymore . I 'm on here to buy a new pair of shoes.I actually think they may have had a bad long term effect on my knees . Seriously , look elsewhere . They might look cool , but that is the only thing they have going for them .
 4 miles onto the first run in these shoes I developed a fore-leg tendon injury that took 4 months to heal . I have been using other running shoe brands for years with no problems.I realize it may just be my specific build/running mechanics , but hey , I will not touch these shoes with a 10-foot pole ever again-Tom
 These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes . The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact . I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them . I returned them and plan to try something else .

 The left boot had a leak right out of the box , not a big leak but enough to make my sock wet . Made in China tells the story . At one time LaCrosse boots were well made and had a long life , now I get anywhere from six months to one year use out of them .
 I was able to get a full two years out of this boot . Now , at about 6 months they start to develop cracks around the ankles and at 7 months they leak in ankle deep water . I wear rubber boots in the fields every day , 365 days a year . in the summer , I take them off after the dew is off the grass , and I wear them any time I 'm outside working the cattle or such . So I need a boot that will last . But regretfully , this is n't the boot I 'm after . They raised the price , and used cheaper materials i suppose . I 'd be willing to pay more for a better boot . But where can we find a USA made rubber ankle fit boot today ? I 'm very disappointed .
 Do n't waste your money these boots SUCK ! I have owned a pair for a month and now a stick has went through the top of the toes -LRB- where your metatarsels would be -RRB- ! Rendering them the most expensive piece of s *** I 've ever bought ! As a duck hunter I would n't recommend these boots for anything . Lacrosse 2 thumbs down !
 This shoe is very cute , but I believe it was an older style Clarks sandal , and it ran small . Although I own many Clarks sandals in the same size , this one was so snug , I had to return it .

 my 2 boys are crazy for their boots , however , after wearing them 3-4 times a week for 2 months they started ripping apart all over
 I bought these shoes for my four year old son , and they became an instant favorite . He wore them almost everyday . Unfortunately , after about a month of wear , the `` teeth '' are wearing away and the seam down the back of the boot has ripped . After the application of a little super glue , he can wear them again , but next time I buy rainboots-which will be soon considering these are coming apart at the seams-I will look for another brand .

 They hurt to wear -- the soles create pressure points all over , inherent in the design .
 I agree with the other review , you initially do n't find the ridges to be that uncomfortable but the more you wear it the less comfortable it becomes , it always makes a lot of squeeky noises on my flooring and loves to collect hair on the rubber `` gills '' on the bottoms . The only thing good about these is they do breathe and dry off quickly , they 're good for the shower , pool or gym and they look cool but just are n't comfy . I would n't recommend for the beach , I can just imagine these things kicking up sand behind your legs and getting sand grains stuck in the mesh and irritating your feet lol ...
 These really are not at all comfortable to wear . I tossed them out after I brought them on vacation .
 I bought these shoes at regular price , in my regular size , at another website . When they arrived , they were clearly too small , either cut skimpily or missized . The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened . I could n't even walk in them . I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand , in my regular size/width . No problem.Later , when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com , I ordered them again -LRB- the price was so low , how could I not ? -RRB- , this time a half size larger . STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe , a bit snug for the ball of my left foot , the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff , awkward , and clunky . At best , they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time . A flexible , supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that , IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size , anywhere .
 Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several , however this particular model # 3902 runs large . Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size . My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes , only the sizing . Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct , they do !
 The sneakers arrived in great condition , packaged well , so I do n't fault the distributor at all . BUT , when I put the shoes on my feet , they were like boats . I still have an identical pair of Propet 's -LRB- same model # / size -RRB- and they fit but are worn out . Probably a quality control issue at the shoe factory .
 This sneaker was a big disappointment . Ordered wide and they hurt . Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great . I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie .
 I ordered the same size -LRB- 10M -RRB- I 've worn at least 5 years . Shoes too narrow , especially in the toes . Really scrunched them up . Wo n't try another size , as I 'm afraid they will also not fit . Also , shoes not nearly as cute as in photo.I wear orthotics , so most slip-ons do n't work for me . Because of my arthritis , I 've been trying to switch to shoes with velcro straps , instead of ties . Very big disappointment . Now I have to deal with returning them , too .
 I like velcro type shoes , but this was too tight when I use the velcro to close it and cause major itching on top of foot . It restricted air to top of foot and when I took feet out of them it cause red pressure/look on top of my feet -LRB- major itch -RRB- . These shoes are the first to make my feet itch at the top soooo badly . Do n't recommend these . I tried them out twice for walks and now I 'm stuck with these shoes . Going to buy some other shoe now .
 My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years . When she received her latest pair , it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed . These 61/2 d 's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds . The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long . Quality control very poor .

 These glasses - the yellow and the grayish - hurt when worn as they do not fit around the ear and I 'm a standard size
 I thought the blue one looked cool so I got it.These things hurt ! The metal that goes around the ears really hurts the back of my ears plus they do not fit well . Seems they fit little kids ok but not grownups . Look at the picture and see how small the things that go around your ears are ! Just to small and they hurt and always pull on your ear trying to snap back into their curled position.You will need to get some sort of covers that go around your ears , that 's if they even fit correctly . I 'm not sure where you buy the covers but the expensive real ones come with the covers to protect your ears.The gold sweat band thing at the top is real cheep plastic that does not touch your face so it is pointless unlike the real ones where it balances the glasses and keeps sweat off your face on a hot day.I ca n't wear mine because they do not fit and they hurt my ears when I put them on . I own around 30 sunglasses and I have never had a problem with any but this one is full of flaws so I give this 1 star out of 5 .
 The vendor of these Air Force style sunglasses offers very good and responsive customer service , but the product itself is not high quality.When he sent the sunglasses the described case was not included . I contacted the vendor , and he readily and quickly gave a partial refund which was most appreciated.What marred my experience was the fragility of the sunglasses , which soon broke during normal use after only weeks .

 The sneakers arrived in great condition , packaged well , so I do n't fault the distributor at all . BUT , when I put the shoes on my feet , they were like boats . I still have an identical pair of Propet 's -LRB- same model # / size -RRB- and they fit but are worn out . Probably a quality control issue at the shoe factory .
 This sneaker was a big disappointment . Ordered wide and they hurt . Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great . I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie .

 I bought these shoes at regular price , in my regular size , at another website . When they arrived , they were clearly too small , either cut skimpily or missized . The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened . I could n't even walk in them . I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand , in my regular size/width . No problem.Later , when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com , I ordered them again -LRB- the price was so low , how could I not ? -RRB- , this time a half size larger . STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe , a bit snug for the ball of my left foot , the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff , awkward , and clunky . At best , they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time . A flexible , supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that , IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size , anywhere .

 I like velcro type shoes , but this was too tight when I use the velcro to close it and cause major itching on top of foot . It restricted air to top of foot and when I took feet out of them it cause red pressure/look on top of my feet -LRB- major itch -RRB- . These shoes are the first to make my feet itch at the top soooo badly . Do n't recommend these . I tried them out twice for walks and now I 'm stuck with these shoes . Going to buy some other shoe now .
 I ordered the same size -LRB- 10M -RRB- I 've worn at least 5 years . Shoes too narrow , especially in the toes . Really scrunched them up . Wo n't try another size , as I 'm afraid they will also not fit . Also , shoes not nearly as cute as in photo.I wear orthotics , so most slip-ons do n't work for me . Because of my arthritis , I 've been trying to switch to shoes with velcro straps , instead of ties . Very big disappointment . Now I have to deal with returning them , too .
 My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years . When she received her latest pair , it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed . These 61/2 d 's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds . The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long . Quality control very poor .
 Very good-looking piece , but the spoon is completely backwards , and is convex instead of concave , making me bend into an awkward angle to position it properly . I deal with it , but in retrospect it should have been returned with a big question mark .
 the plastic horn snapped in two after a few months . For the price , I was hoping for something sturdier . To be fair though , since I ca n't bend to tie my shoes they need to be pre-tied before they go home .
 After a Knee replacement that went wrong , I have a knee that wo n't bend properly ... I ordered the shoe horn thinking it would help . . Wrong!The spring makes it very difficult to put my shoe on ... it should be more rigid ...
 I bought this shoe horn thinking it would make my life easier . While the quality is excellent and length is just right , I believe it has a big design issue !! while I thought that the spring would make wearing my shoes easier , it actually made it very difficult to control and put my shoe on , It 's too flexible to stretch the knee of the shoe which makes the shoe always win the struggle.If you you 're looking for a good shoe horn , I recommend going for a classic one that does n't contain a spring . Putting a shoe on needs something that is very sturdy and rigid not `` FLEXIBLE ''
 Bought a long shoe horn at IKEA several years ago for just a couple of buck . Absolutely love it and , of course , they do n't carry it anymore . Have been looking for another and bought this one largely based on the reviews of others , even though it 's a lot more money . It works OK , but I like the IKEA one better . The shape of the horn seems awkward and I 'm not convinced the spring adds anything . You have to be careful not to get it too far down into the shoe because it does n't come out easily .

 These were too small for their stated size , 11.5 . I wear 11.5 in Nike shoes and have a pair of white Lunar Control shoes in the same size . These were too short and narrow . Amazon took them back with no problems .
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 While the Earth Lazer is a lite weight shoe and free of animal materials it has poor arch support . There is virtually no lateral arch support and there is no heel cup support . The negitive heel causes to much stretch for the foot and ankle . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone . I think the Birkenstock brand has a great deal more arch support for the entire foot and ankle and keeps the foot in a neutural position .
 I 've been trying to wear these maryjane croc during the summer months for the past 3 years . I am finally giving them up as worthless for me . Before I explain what has not worked I will say that Crocs are great indoor/outdoor messy chore shoes being protective of my toes , waterproof and easily cleaned . Because they 're cushiony and easy on/off -LRB- especially with the heel strap removed -RRB- I liked to wear them as house shoes . For this use , I was content with the style since I wear a womens size 10 and the the maryjane is definitely less bulky than clog style.Unfortunately , if I wear these shoes any extended length of time for walking or standing such as grocery shopping , cooking and washing dishes , etc. . I end up with aching feet . I mean painful ! As shock absorbing as they seem to be , I guess the support is just not there . It 's not like they 're flat either , they have some built in arch . I never had this problem with my feet with any other sandal or flip-flop before . Not sure if that 's coinciding with the onset of middle age and being more susceptible to plantar fasciitis or the fact that I tried to wear these shoes alot because of their benefits . Another drawback I tolerated for too long is that the bottom of this shoe tends to `` grab '' on a hard or tile floor and can cause a trip or fall while walking . Definitely annoying if not dangerous!I 'm sure the plastic they 're made of will last forever , so I feel really guilty about putting them in trash , but for me the cons of crocs outweigh the pros .
 These crocs are too narrow for my feet , I have another size 8 pair and they are wider , what 's UP ? The seller did not say they were a narrow size .
 Does not produce results as expected . I have had better , not sharp Would have expected more from Martha Stewart . Sorry
 I BOUGHT A PAIR OF THE MARY JANE STYLE HOPING THE STRAP WOULD HOLD THEM ON MY FEET.THEY STAY ON BUT THEY LOOK RIDICULOUS . I HAVE AN A2 FOOT AND THESE CROCS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE PERSON WITH LESS THAN A MEDIUM OR WIDE SIZE FOOT . TOO BAD FOR ME AS I WOULD BUY SEVERAL COLORS . OH WELL - I TRIED .
 Mary Jane Crocs showed up with a torn strap and when I went to send back and re-order , none were available in the size and color I wanted . was refunded money with shipping costs .
 I was very excited about receiving these Crocs , until I was sent two left feet in the mail . What a disappointment ! If it was n't for having to return them , I may have enjoyed these as they felt comfortable -LRB- on the one foot -RRB- and are not as bulky as the original model of Crocs .
 material looked faded -LRB- definitely not as deep of a black as picture and felt stretched out . Also right shoe straps keep coming unclipped which is very annoying .
 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .

 My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years . When she received her latest pair , it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed . These 61/2 d 's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds . The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long . Quality control very poor .
 I ordered the same size -LRB- 10M -RRB- I 've worn at least 5 years . Shoes too narrow , especially in the toes . Really scrunched them up . Wo n't try another size , as I 'm afraid they will also not fit . Also , shoes not nearly as cute as in photo.I wear orthotics , so most slip-ons do n't work for me . Because of my arthritis , I 've been trying to switch to shoes with velcro straps , instead of ties . Very big disappointment . Now I have to deal with returning them , too .
 I like velcro type shoes , but this was too tight when I use the velcro to close it and cause major itching on top of foot . It restricted air to top of foot and when I took feet out of them it cause red pressure/look on top of my feet -LRB- major itch -RRB- . These shoes are the first to make my feet itch at the top soooo badly . Do n't recommend these . I tried them out twice for walks and now I 'm stuck with these shoes . Going to buy some other shoe now .
 This sneaker was a big disappointment . Ordered wide and they hurt . Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great . I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie .
 I bought these shoes at regular price , in my regular size , at another website . When they arrived , they were clearly too small , either cut skimpily or missized . The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened . I could n't even walk in them . I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand , in my regular size/width . No problem.Later , when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com , I ordered them again -LRB- the price was so low , how could I not ? -RRB- , this time a half size larger . STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe , a bit snug for the ball of my left foot , the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff , awkward , and clunky . At best , they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time . A flexible , supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that , IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size , anywhere .
 Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several , however this particular model # 3902 runs large . Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size . My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes , only the sizing . Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct , they do !
 The sneakers arrived in great condition , packaged well , so I do n't fault the distributor at all . BUT , when I put the shoes on my feet , they were like boats . I still have an identical pair of Propet 's -LRB- same model # / size -RRB- and they fit but are worn out . Probably a quality control issue at the shoe factory .
 I bought a pair of these for my boyfriend because I wanted him to have a decent pair of flip flops that offered some arch support . When I got them , I pulled them out of the package and could immediately tell that they were going to be too narrow . The size 13 sandal was barely wider than my -LRB- female -RRB- flip flops . I checked other reviews that mentioned that the width was as expected , which leads me to believe that no matter what size the sandal is , the width is the same size . This is probably find for someone with a smaller foot , but I was disappointed to then find out that these come in one width , M.
 I received the order in the time promised HOWEVER , i ordered these shoes hoping for a men 's 8 which fits me . BUT the shoes I received were women 's shoes and were way too small . Very disappointed .

 Did n't care for these boots , built well but a major opertation to get on and off , way too narrow at the top and the zipper on the side does n't help much and in opinion should have been put in the front , might be all it would take to make this go on and off easier . Not an expert but have wore them ocassional for the last two winters and would not buy them again.This is my story and I 'm sticking to it !
 This was my first online shoe purchase and I thought it would be a great buy since it had such good reviews . At $ 25 , the navy blue seemed like a good deal and looked like it would match well with a lot of my wardrobe . I was very disappointed , though , when the shoe turned out to be a much lighter blue than the picture - a bit darker than regular blue but much too bright to be considered navy blue . Also , the fit was very awkward , especially in the front toe area . It showed too much toe -LRB- not just toe cleavage - more like you can see two toe nails , which is n't attractive -RRB- and the outside of my foot below the pinky jutted out . The fit is also on the tighter side - I 'm usually a 7 or 7 1/2 , so I got the 7 and it was very tight ! Two stars instead of one because the leather was quite nice , but I 'm definitely sending them back . My advice
 I got these shoes to match a theme wedding where the bride , groom and other participants wore All Stars with their dress clothes . I thought slip ons would be easier than lace ups but I was so wrong . It took a lot of pushing , pulling and whining to get these on my son 's little feet . He never wore them again .
 Tight fit and very difficult to put onto kids feet without giving a real tug to back tag of shoe.Not my favorite . Not practical .
 The boots had a strong chemical scent , my daughter did not like them , so I returned the boots . It cost me $ 18 to ship them back and then the company charges $ 8 to reshelf them ... so I paid $ 26 for an item that was returned . Needless to say , will stay away from this company in the future .
 found it very very hard to reach anyone in customer service to return the item . of course they had all excuses . i wo n't shop again
 THESE BOOTS ARE MUCH TOO DIFFICULT TO PUT ON AND TAKE OFF . I HAVE RETURNED THEM FOR A REFUND .
 Had to return these . I purchased these for my wife in a size 10 , she wears a9 1/2 , and they were so tight she immediately sent them back.Wish we could have something positive to say about them , but ... not possible .
 The boot looks just as it is shown and the fit was true to size . No extra room , so there is no forgiveness . If you really need the next size up , by all means order it . It 's a fairly good imitation of the name brand `` U '' , however , the suede is not as soft as sheepskin and somehow misses the mark as a result . I did like the non-slip soles , but the thickness tends to weigh down the boot . All in all , the boot is OK , but I sent it back . I will probably keep using the boots I have now and look for a less trendy , classier style next season .
 I purchased these boots and wore them from october to december . This is not very long and on my right foot I have a huge hole in the sole now I can no longer wear them .
 They look good and qualilty appears decent , BUT they run small ... I wear 8.5 and the 9 is tight . In addition , the top portion , which reaches the calf is too tight and mind you I 'm 5 ' 6 '' about 145 lbs , so I am very average in size . You have to be a stick figure to wear these boots ... very disappointing .
 I typically wear size 6.5 in women 's shoes but at times I 'd order a 7 because my feed are wide . I ordered a 7 in these boots and felt my toes crammed against the tip of the boot . This has never happened to me before . I had to return the boot and end up paying for shipping . I was n't allowed to exchange for a bigger size .
 Was totaly surprized by the quality of these boots !! MAYBE THEY ARE KNOCK-OFFS ! A Bearpaw box I have never seen too ! Flimsy is what they are !! I have alot of Bearpaw Boots - these are crap !
 Well , i returned them , they suppost to run small so I ordered one size bigger , but they were too big for me , in the calve they were too tight and the sole were kind of soft . Did n't like them at all .
 The sizing is off on these boots . I usually wear a size 9 , but these were too small for me in size 9 . They were also too big for my daughter who usually wears a size 8 . I think the size 10 would be too big for me . So , these boots just do n't fit at all .
 my mom wears 6 or 6.5 , I ordered 7 , still tight ... returned it annd I had to pay for the return shipping because Amazon decided it 's my fault that I chosen the wrong size ... . disappointed !
 I love my boots but almost returned them for another pair as the stitching on one side of them is not right there is a coupe inches on the side seam that is white and they should be all black . I had already returned a pair of the taller boot as they were to tight around my calves so got the shorter one which I love . I guess I will just try to color in the stitching as I really do n't want to return them again and wait for another pair ... even tho I still have not worn them . But I do love them ! Thanks
 This shoe is very cute , but I believe it was an older style Clarks sandal , and it ran small . Although I own many Clarks sandals in the same size , this one was so snug , I had to return it .
 These Look like they are built well , but I ca n't wear them . I have wide feet , and the hard safety toe rubs on my big toe and my pinky toe . I can stand wearing them for about an hour , and then they bother me.Consensus ? Probably good for narrow footed people , but not for me .

 BLISTERS !! ouch !! Also my feet were sweaty , as there is no way to wear socks practically . I 've had to wear band aids on my heels for the first two weeks . They are great in the non-slip department .
 one of the shoes was totally deformed and was not cut right , not at all what i was suppose to be buying . sadly my dog ate them b4 i could return them , they were not wearable anyway .
 I bought my skechers for work , because in my professionyou need to wear slip resistant , comfortable closed-in shoes . In the detaileddescription they were advertised to be slip resistance . However , onthe first day of wearing them I stepped outside on a very wet footstep -LRB- as it was raining -RRB- and what do know my foot slipped and I would havehad a very bad fall if my husband had not been there to catch me . Iwas very disappointed to say the least . For appearance I would givethem five stars , but for everything else one and a half stars . It was alsovery expensive.Skechers for Work Women 's Hobbie Mary Jane
 The worst pair of shoes I have ever purchased . The size is incorrect . It 's extremely big for a size 7.5 plus the ` sizing info ' is incorrect . Will never buy from this buyer again . Not happy .
 The shoes are beautiful but the store sent one shoe clean and the other dirty .
 See that big bulge in the rubber on the top of the toes ? When edging , that bubble flexes & lets the shoe stretch & slip backward . The toe of the boot actaully elongates when under stress.I wear a size 10 -LRB- US -RRB- running shoe & bought these in a 9 . The lenght & width are properly snug but that stretch is unacceptable . If you live at Indian Creek & do nothing but climb pure cracks , these may be ok . Otherwise , they 're sketchy on even a moderate edge.The upper shoe material is a bit stretchy & quite comfortable . Since they 've been worn outside -LRB- 1 day -RRB- , Second Ascent policy wo n't accept the return . I 'm currently emailing them and 5.10 in an attempt to return as a design flaw . If unsuccessful , they 'll make a comfy gym shoe & that 's about it . At least , until I get back to Indian Creek .
 The shoes are very comfortable and the price was great but the shoes squeak whn i walked . the left one started first then both squeaked . it was embarrasing to walk down the hall . i guess it was the rubber soles had somethine inside them that moved around or something . i wouldnt buy these again .
 I wore my Mephistos occasionally for three years and found them heavy but very comfortable . Then the leather strip around the laces separated from both shoes . They want $ 75 to `` refurbish '' - sounds better than repair - and add new laces . I bought a tube of Shoe Glu for $ 4.00 and did the job myself . When you buy Mephistos , you really do n't get what you pay for .
 I purchased a pair of these a number of years ago expecting them to last . They did not . They are moderately comfortable , yes , but so are many shoes . I would have expected at this price for the soles to hold up for at least a year of moderate use . They did not . For something so expensive that calls itself a `` Walking Shoe '' , this is inexcusable . I walked with these shoes approximately 15-20 miles per week in good weather on sidewalks and pavement . Within 9 months the outer rubber had worn through the on both heels and under the balls of both feet . At 12 months , the holes at each section had grown to the point where dirt and water were easily getting into the shoes and walking was downright uncomfortable . I 've owned shoes that were $ 300 less expensive than these and that lasted 5 times as long . These are , without question , the most overpriced and terribly constructed shoes I have ever owed .
 The arches of these shoes are much too high for me . I could not wear them and I gave them away . I am very disappointed . I will not buy Mephisto shoes again .
 Like many of the reviewers , I thought a long time before spending so much money on these shoes . Unlike many reviewers , I am very disappointed with the Mephisto Match . While true to size , after almost a month of wearing them , I do not find them comfortable . I have had to trim the insert in the right shoe to keep it from rubbing a sore spot on the side of my foot . In addition to the discomfort , a close look at the construction puzzles me regarding all the `` hand operations '' claimed by Mephisto . I have worn far more comfortable and supportive shoes for two-thirds the cost.A costly poor choice.On the positive side , I did pay less for these shoes through Amazon and , as usual , Amazon provided excellent service.Update . I realize now that I should have waited before my review of several weeks ago complaining that the Mephisto Match was an uncomfortable shoe . Having continued to wear them , they have become a pleasurable pair of shoes . Perhaps in my case , the shoes took a long time to break-in . Or perhaps it took time for my 75 year old feet to adjust to a `` proper '' shoe . At any rate , it is only fair to Mephisto to now say I am pleased with the shoes .
 The shoes are very comfortable and the price was great but the shoes squeak whn i walked . the left one started first then both squeaked . it was embarrasing to walk down the hall . i guess it was the rubber soles had somethine inside them that moved around or something . i wouldnt buy these again .
 This shoe is a pure running shoe , not a cross trainer as indicated in the title . It fits extremely tight and is very uncomfortable . I returned them immediately .
 These were cute online but I was n't able to see if they were cute on my feet because I could n't get my foot into the very small opening and was not willing to break my ankle trying so I returned them . They seemed like a nice boot though .
 I had heard that Acorn socks were not the same and were being made over seas . It 's true they are not as good as the original product . They are thinner , shorter and not as warm and to top it off , one pair had missed stitching on the seam which left a 3 '' hole in the sock . Sorry that the REAL THING is no longer made and will try to make my old ones last !!!! They were never cheap but they are now over priced for the quality !!
 The fit is very narrow in the foot and lower leg . Also , size runs small in general - I am a women 's size 6.5-7 shoe , I ordered size 7-8 and it was short . Had to return them . AND the return process was difficult .
 My husband has nerve damage and experiences very cold feet , his last fleece socks lasted probably 10 + years so I wanted to get him another pair . He only wore them a few times and they tore at the toe , not along the seam , the fabric just ripped . If they had cost 50 cents I would n't have cared but I wish I had n't wasted my money on these . So very disappointed . Cheap , not well made , not worth it . Buyer beware .
 These boots are very poor quality and not the standard for this manufacturer . No wonder the price was discounted . They are no what was promised in the ad .
 Timberland has always given me the most durable boot I 've ever owned.This model , however , is falling apart after two weeks . The eyelets for the bootlaces are a flawed design , and two different eyelets have popped out with minimal use or stress on the product . The nature of the disintegration is easily identified -- they 're simply poorly designed , and appear to be an endemic problem which is likely to reoccur.The eyelets are n't really repairable . This makes my purchase a giant loss . Unfortunately for me , I purchased multiple pairs of Timberland boots one year ago , and these have been waiting in storage in mint condition . So no warranty or returns for me.This particular issue does n't happen with other models of Timberland boot , I 've found , and I still recommend Timberland as a brand above all others .
 VERY POORLY MADE . Bought for winter use . I do n't work outdoors so use was very light . They were comfortable and waterproof for almost 1 and 1/2 months . At that time the welt began to separate . Bought some shoe goo and will try to use these until spring , then into the trash can . I have bought very cheap boots at discounter that have lasted longer than these .
 I was really disappointed with these Timberland 's . Bought generally on name / past experience . When I tightened them up -- eyelets dug into my foot making for an uncomfortable feel . Tried locally , a smaller size -- same thing . I 'm shocked that what they -LRB- general -RRB- and pushing off as ` winter boots ' lately -- all cloth . That 's crazy for the snow . I appreciate trying to get lightweight , but cloth is useless . I liked these because the leather uppers and good looks . Just a bad design . Returned them and still looking . Fogdog shipped quickly & promptly .
 Nice looking boot , however the insoles of both the Timberland boots that I 've purchased have been lacking in comfort and support .
 I spent a good week looking and reviewing all kinds of work boots . I was impressed from what I read of the Timberland White Ledge Boot and the price . I 've been wearing them for two weeks now and have blisters on top of my feet . I will be retuning them asap .
 I got these for my son who wears a 14 M , but he said they were too small . We sent them back .
 I do not have a problem with Amazon they returned the first pair of these boots becasue they were not waterproof as stated in the product information . The second pair is not waterproof as well . If you are looking for a boot that you can use in the field please look for other brand . This boot is a boot that you can use for work around the house on a sunny day but not a boots built for field use .
 Yup . You read the title right.I spent a whole weekend wearing wet shoes because I walked over a patch of wet grass while hiking.They leak terribly and if you 're looking for good shoes to hike in the stay away from these.On the side where the gray rubber meets the leather I now have a gap . All around on both shoes.It took all of 4 days of light hiking for this to happen.So all in all they are crap , poorly made and a big waste of your money .
 I bought those boots in December 2008 and was very disappointed by quality . I did not like that shoe-tongue made from nylon and it can be ripped off easy . Second my feet were sweating and when temperature get below 32 F it was cold to wear . And they are hard not soft.I always liked Timberland brand but those shoe `` Timberland Men 's White Ledge Boot '' can be made better .
 These boots were two to three times and the seam across the sole is already coming apart . They are not sturdy at all . If it were n't passed the 30 days for returning them , and having to pay shipping , we would have returned them . NOT HAPPY AT ALL , especially for the paying what we did for them .
 Imade a couple of mistakes buying these hikers-first I did n't look too closely at the construction , believing I was buying a qualty product because of it 's former reputation . In exactly .47 miles , according to my Garmin GPS , I felt my boot loosen , the laces were loose -- the grommet pulled completly out of the punched hole in the leather . The grommet ring on the underside was 1/8 '' in diameter , of course it pulled through.These grommets are of course cheaper and look fairly good from the outside , so they sacrificed quality for more profit . The boot it 's self was made in Vietnam , and is a good looking boot ; but if you want to take a little hike through low-bush blueberries , better buy something made in America . The second mistake was buying these from a store that tried not to refund my money , but offered to give me another pair of these clunkers , like they may last for an entire 1/2 mile . This was the Shoe Store in the Nittany Mall State College Pa. . I 'll NEVER have anything to do with either again.Joseph R. Eckley
 Do n't be taken in by the smart look of these Timberland boots . They do look great , are light weight , but they are badly made with little support , cheap soles , and an overall bad fit . Like wearing plastic boots . Seriously .
 I bought these to replace my aging HiTec Altitude leather boots . I looooved those boots.But I thought I 'd try these as I figured they 'd be the same , and because they 're Timberlands , maybe even better.In every way they 're worse . Where do I start?The sole is flimsy ... I can feel rocks thru it when I 'm hiking . HiTec were much betterThe laces are terrible . They 're always coming undone . Really ? I 've had good and bad laces and how can it be they give you slippery bad laces?Not comfortable . They 're just not.I did a 5 day hike in these things -LRB- and yes they were broken in at that point -RRB- and my feet were a wreck afterwards.Wish I 'd gone with my old reliable HiTec 's . Ah well.On the good side
 I wore these boots one day to work and on the second morning when tying the right boot the grommet at the mid stress point just popped out . I had a pair of hiking boots in the 70 's as a Boy Scout that did the same thing . After a couple of returned pairs my parents moved on to something else . I will be doing the same . You would think that any shoe mfg would know that a 1/8 inch rivet through the outer leather upper will not hold . The two upper loop/grommets do go through the entire thickness of the upper and have substantial heads .
 BUYER BE WARE !!! The worst pair of boots I 've ever owned . Tag sizing is irrelevant to actual shoe size . A left and right Wolverine boot may not be the same size even though they are tagged as the same . Overall , Poor workmanship and OVERPRICED . Contacted Wolverine with no response . Would recommend purchasing Redwing boots instead of these . BUYER BE WARE !!!
 which they do n't make anymore ... this shoe is supposedly made with the same last , but it is nowhere near as comfortable ...
 bad shoe for sure . it is not for running . but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work . this may do
 this product is strong and durbale just like any lanyard should be . no complaints with the durabilty and usefullness but the letters were incomplete and were missing many spots . for example the d in United doesnt have a bottom , it looks like a big lowercase n
 The GREEN Woodstock TWIN-GORE shown as being for sale IS NOT what comes on the screen when you click on it . A different Woodstock rubber shoe - navy blue with yellow trim AND LOW BACK is what appears . Navy item does n't have gores . It 's not the same item !!
 It did made a cushion feeling when I 'm wearing it . Other than that if you expect theseto cure back pain/pain in feet just buy expensive orthopedics . These add and inch to your hightnothing else .
 I thought I was buying a lanyard that had SECURITY printed on it . Imagine my dismay when it came in the mail and was plain black .
 Great boots when in warranty - but after , not so much!Some of the Asolo materials selected ` degrade ' and break down over time and they will NOT warranty them!The soles of my $ 300 boots literally broke off from the boot!They do NOT stand behind their product !
 I have been wearing these shoes for a year and a half and am disappointed with the quality . I paid nearly 300 $ for them and the sole is starting to fall apart . I dont hike a ton probably 10 miles a month for the last 18 months and these are falling apart . I have had other asolos with many more miles which held up much better than these . They were comfortable and never had any blister probems , but I think they should have lasted longer.Pros
 Two words
 Have worn these shoes for year . Am only sorry that they do n't come in wide and are no longer in stores .
 I wrote to Matisse Shoewear and enclosed the shoes . They never contacted me . Very poor customer service .
 I bought these to replace a pair -LRB- by the same company -RRB- that I loved . These particular shoes were not a good buy . The beading and sequins fell off and the sole separated from the upper part of the shoe within a month . I got lots of compliments on how attractive they were in the first week I had them , but after that , everything started to fall apart .
 poor craftship when it came to the stitching . they look an feel good but , they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly .
 The picture shows a tan shoe . I have ordered this a second time and the two tone shoe arrives . It also arrived as a gift , but no way to ship it back . I see the color says tan/beige , but the color on the picture is only one color , beige.I need to return this item and would appreciate help in that process , as well as finding the correct Sperry.THank you so much , Sharon Ellis
 My son specifically wanted this style and we could not find it locally . Ordered and it was exactly as described !
 The shoes are not genuine and are made of cheaper material . The toe of the shoe is separating after only wearing them twice
 Hello , I have purchased sperry billfish 3 eye shoes for the last ten years . I have not had a problem until my recent purchase at Peltz shoes . The shoes I received were defective beyond belief . I did get a refund with the help of Amazon.com
 The shoe is ok minus the fact that it started to fall apart after just several uses . Then planet shoes actually had the guts to tell me that it was from normal wear in tear . For a product that is supposedly high quality I would recommend just buying the shoes from the sperrys website that way you do n't have to deal with stupid companies that have terrible customer service . Worst customer service ever .
 I read great reviews and raves about these shoes . They are touted as the `` Original American '' boat shoe . When I take them out of the box the writing on the tongue says it all
 I ordered shoes for our aniversary for my husband , and those are all he wears , well they came and were blue with flat bottoms , not sperry billfish , so i had to return them and needless to say i was without aniversary gift for my husband , first time i have been disappointed with ordering online . . my husband loves the sperry 's and this type is all he will wear ... he wears them till they are pitiful and i make him get a new pair ...
 They have a wrong picture . If you click the shoes that looks like beige , in description , it says tan/beige . And now it looks like I have to charge for refund .
 The top-siders I received had frayed laces . The inside was not as soft and smooth as the last pair I purchased .
 I 've been trying to wear these maryjane croc during the summer months for the past 3 years . I am finally giving them up as worthless for me . Before I explain what has not worked I will say that Crocs are great indoor/outdoor messy chore shoes being protective of my toes , waterproof and easily cleaned . Because they 're cushiony and easy on/off -LRB- especially with the heel strap removed -RRB- I liked to wear them as house shoes . For this use , I was content with the style since I wear a womens size 10 and the the maryjane is definitely less bulky than clog style.Unfortunately , if I wear these shoes any extended length of time for walking or standing such as grocery shopping , cooking and washing dishes , etc. . I end up with aching feet . I mean painful ! As shock absorbing as they seem to be , I guess the support is just not there . It 's not like they 're flat either , they have some built in arch . I never had this problem with my feet with any other sandal or flip-flop before . Not sure if that 's coinciding with the onset of middle age and being more susceptible to plantar fasciitis or the fact that I tried to wear these shoes alot because of their benefits . Another drawback I tolerated for too long is that the bottom of this shoe tends to `` grab '' on a hard or tile floor and can cause a trip or fall while walking . Definitely annoying if not dangerous!I 'm sure the plastic they 're made of will last forever , so I feel really guilty about putting them in trash , but for me the cons of crocs outweigh the pros .
 I BOUGHT A PAIR OF THE MARY JANE STYLE HOPING THE STRAP WOULD HOLD THEM ON MY FEET.THEY STAY ON BUT THEY LOOK RIDICULOUS . I HAVE AN A2 FOOT AND THESE CROCS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE PERSON WITH LESS THAN A MEDIUM OR WIDE SIZE FOOT . TOO BAD FOR ME AS I WOULD BUY SEVERAL COLORS . OH WELL - I TRIED .
 Mary Jane Crocs showed up with a torn strap and when I went to send back and re-order , none were available in the size and color I wanted . was refunded money with shipping costs .
 Does not produce results as expected . I have had better , not sharp Would have expected more from Martha Stewart . Sorry
 These crocs are too narrow for my feet , I have another size 8 pair and they are wider , what 's UP ? The seller did not say they were a narrow size .
 I was very excited about receiving these Crocs , until I was sent two left feet in the mail . What a disappointment ! If it was n't for having to return them , I may have enjoyed these as they felt comfortable -LRB- on the one foot -RRB- and are not as bulky as the original model of Crocs .
 material looked faded -LRB- definitely not as deep of a black as picture and felt stretched out . Also right shoe straps keep coming unclipped which is very annoying .
 I also ordered the loafers and received sandals . When I tried to return them , I could only exchange them even though my size was out of stock . After three very long calls to customer service , I was allowed to return the sandals for a refund , but had to pay the shipping myself . If you order these shoes and get the sandals , it might be best just to keep the sandals . For me , at three hours of my time on the phone , plus twelve dollars in shipping , it would have been cheaper to keep the sandals .
 I ordered the loafer and got the sandals . I will keep the sandals , they are not bad , but I wo n't order from Propet again .
 The sandals are okay , not terrific , too much of a hassle to return . Probably wo n't order again .
 Propet Women 's Comfy Walker LoaferI also purchased the loafers for $ 34.90 but received sandals instead . Must be a mixup with the photo/item number . Easy return process by printing pre-paid return label . Original shipping charges also to be refunded .
 This shoe runs very narrow in mediums . I usually wear a medium but this felt more like a AA . Had to send it back . Unfortunately the Peltz Customer Service Rep informed me that I had to do so at my own expense which was very costly . They were not willing to meet me half way .
 Horrible quality . Took them out of the box and could actually see the glue marks and glue strands as if the shoes were just put together with a hot glue gun ! They also looked a little yellowed / stained on the sides . I sent them back ASAP for store credit . This is very unusual for his vendor to have ugh poor quality .
 I bought a pair of these for use as a firefigter/EMT under a year ago , and had the zipper on one boot fail during duty . I have the 6 '' version of these as well , and both zippers are starting to tear away from the uppers . Very comfortable , lightweight boots , but the zippers are terrible ! If you do n't need quick on/off , buy the non zippered version of these , and you will probably be fine .
 This shoe is as cute as can be , but seems to run about 1/2 size or more too small . Not sure if this typical of Sugar Shoes , but I wo n't be trying any more of them by internet until I 've tried them on in person .

 These jazz shoes are the kind that easily scuff and wear . The leathery outside rubs away easily , leaving a greenish scuff underneath . They probably wo n't be very durable for much longer . Also , I could n't tell in the picture , but this is the kind that does not have the fabric middle . It is leather all the way from toe to ankle .
 I purchased this exact shoe -LRB- Capezio -RRB- only to receive a brand called Dance Now . The description said to order your normal street size . This is wrong . You need to order at least a half size , if not a whole size larger . I ordered them for my daughter and they are too small . I am real disappointed . I am now stuck with a shoe that my daughter has to wear too small .

 I like the shoe , nice look and feel.But , First it scuffs easy and for some reason is a white underneath the brown , which obviously shows up.Second , the biggest part is the orange pad on the bottom will start peeling off the very first day . I meen BAD . terrible , terrible way to attach the sole pad . anyways , if you can not scuff them and superglue the bottom , then you may like . I would never buy anything from this maker again though .

 I tried them on but there was something digging in to my toes that I could feel through my sock ! After putting my hand in the shoe I could tell that the way they were built leaves pieces of the hard synthetic fabric sticking out inside the shoe . Not for me . Amazon took them back but charged me freight both ways .
 I ordered a pair of these shoes on September 6 , 2006 and later I received a notification from Amazon that they did not have the shoes and cancelled my order . On September 22 , 2006 , I saw that the shoes are in stock , so I placed the order again . I am a member of the Amazon Prime so thought I should get it in two days . It 's been 7 days and the shoes have not shipped yet . I am confused . Amazon should either have the shoes or not have the shoes . It can not have the shoes in stock and not sending them .
 Ok ... I like the shoes but something on the left side of the shoes seem to hurt the top of my foot ... I ca n't figure it out ... I have searched the shoe but I think it is something in the manufacturing ...
 I was sent the wrong size , NOT MY FAULT ... but my money was refunded . I was disappointed because the shoe is truly GORGEOUS !!!!!!!
 I bought that pair of shoes because they were `` big bargain '' . But what I really doubt is how an expensive pair of shoes has its slingback made of ... Rubber band ! yes , Rubber band , not covered , not painted , a simple rubber band like the one you use at office and for packing purposes !
 Never have I loved boots so much , and yet been so disappointed with them . Considering these are $ 300 boots , I expected them to last more than 2 seasons -LRB- a season being from November to March -RRB- . The leather ripped so that I have holes in the boots where they crease from walking so they are not water proof at all.That being said , they look FABULOUS !!! But not for very long : -LRB-
 I bought theseS shoes with anticipation of wearing them to work . I came to find out that they run small and that a 40eu did n't fit . i was very disappointed . i gave them away
 I was wanting some red shoes for an upcomming event and these seemed perfect . The website showed a red smooth patent leather shoe and I loved the heel heigth . However , when the shoes arrived they were rough in texture , not patent leather . I would have been ok with them if they had been the red croc skin ones also avaiable , but they were neither of the red shoes shown on the site . I was extremely dissapointed , so I have returned the shoes . Amazon was quick to refund the money , but I had to quickly look elsewhere to find the red patent leather shoes I had thought I was receiving from Amazon . The heel heigth and the Berry style look great , but not in the color and texture I received . Do n't trust the picture , because it is extremely missleading .
 My order took way longer to get to me than I expected and longer than any order I have placed with Amazon previously . The shoes themselves run small and I did n't have enough time to break them in before the event for which I ordered them . They are more pointy than I expected , the pictures do n't really reflect how long the toe is . I still have n't even worn them and regret having ordered them .
 I have several pairs of Bandolino shoes in this exact style -LRB- Berry -RRB- which I love . This pair turned out to be all man-made material -LRB- synthetic -RRB- rather than leather , like my other 3 pair , so shoes were less comfortable or breathable.The synthetic material had a strong chemical odor , which might have dissapated over time but I did not want to take a chance on that . The styles which state they are leather would be a better purchase .
 These shoes looked very nice on the web . But when I got them out of the box , I knew right away that they would not feel good . The toe is too pointed , so there is not much room for your toes to be comfortable . I usually wear a 7.5 , but these were too small , felt even smaller with the pointed toe , and were also stiff.I do not recommend these unless you only plan to wear them for short periods at a time .
 I own three pairs of these shoes . I purchased them repeatedly because I have a job that requires lots of walking around in a formal setting . The height of the heel is just right , saving my feet from the awful feeling of having walked in heels around the office for 10 hours each day ... . In a nutshell here are the pros
 This shoe was not to size . I ordered in wide and could not even get my foot in it . Wide was more like med B size .
 I like the shoe shape for variety in my shoe collection but I was disappointed that the right shoe was slightly lob-sided ie . when wearing it , the right feet ` wobbles ' abit . Looking at the shoes , one can see that the right side is lob-sided . I would have returned them to Amazon/the seller had it not been for the shipping costs . I live in Asia and it cost way too much . And I must add that it 's a pity when sellers sell and send out such inferior products . I hope Amazon do take note of such complains .
 great sneakers ! ca n't believe you can only get them in two colors !?! that 's absurd ! these sneakers back n the day looked great with red stripes , green stripes or any dope sneaker color for that matter ! now you can only get them in black or blue ? lame !
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 I have not yet received this product , the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month . And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem
 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .

And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem

 Love KSwiss but this product proved to be a big dissapointment . Glue showing all over the sneaker and when you walk in them there is a horrible squeaking noise . Kept the sneakers thinking once they were broken in it would be better but unfortunately it was not .
 This shoe is narrow across the toes , and definitely needs a better arch support . I 'm truly disappointed with this shoe , but wanted an all white leather tennis shoe .

 Since I bought these in Reno , Nevada and live in North Carolina I ca n't return them but working with the Ariat company . Two weeks into the boot and there already stretched out . The 12 D 's should have been a 11 1/2 D but the 12 's where tight to start with . I 've avoided ARIAT , never bought a pair until now because I thought they where made in China . This pair was made in Mexico and after looking for an hour in the store comparing , I decided to try them out . Then the toe box whee it ends closes to your ankle started hurting -LRB- knifing -RRB- the tops of my toes on both left and right . All my other boots are lined in the vamp with leather , these have some sort of cloth and that does n't provide protection from that # @ * @ toe box . Styling I give it the highest rating , performance and construction the worst . Sorry ARIAT I gave them a try and now I 'll probably be out the full price of the boots .
 I do n't normally leave feedback , but my experience buying these shoes is worthy of print . I wanted to tell amazon how unhappy I was with my purchase , but they only allow 200 characters to explain the reason for return -LRB- and ITEM WAS USED is not one of the catagories to choose from -RRB- . That being said , I have decided to list here what I would have said to amazon had I been given the chance : You should have another choice under reason for return
 I have tried to order from you on 3 different occassion for a pair of sneaker 's and I you never seem to have the item that i am chossing from your sites if the product is not available then it should be removed . I still have a gift refund credit but everytime I think about going on line to us it I think is the let down worth it.I do not give you anything but a 1 for poor customer service ... Sorry but I can go to the store and buy it with less hassle ... BIG PAIN in my side ... Sincerely yoursDiann

 Like so many other reviewers , I 'm disappointed in the way these shoes slip off my feet . Something about them is also really uncomfortable , and I have other high strappy sandals that do n't have this problem . I wear them sometimes because they are cute , then I end up regretting it because my feet hurt and they slip off . My advice - keep looking ...
 I loved the look of the shoes - but the heels are high and the straps hardly keep them on your feet . I am usually good at walking in heels but felt very unsteady in these .
 After a few uses -LRB- 4-5 times -RRB- the `` leather '' started to peel and also one of the straps got apart of the sole.I really hate these shoes and would not recommend them at all . Zolibeth
 I ordered these shoes for a wedding , but I had to return them . I tried them on for about 3 seconds and my feet were hurting . Since the heel is pretty high , you foot slides forward and there is not much shoe to hold your foot in place . This one strap right across my toes was bascially squeezing my foot into the shoe and it hurt !
 These shoes were ok at first but now the straps around the back of your foot wo n't stay up - no matter how tight you make them . Very disappointing because they are very cute .
 First , let me say that I LOVE Nine West shoes . It 's practically all I own . So when I bought these , I was very excited to wear them out on the town ... unfortunately , I did n't even make it out of the house . Because they are SO adorable , I tried everything to get them to stay on my feet
 Super cute , and they run true to size , but they NEVER stay on my feet !!!! I made the mistake to wear them to a wedding , so I walked around with my shoes `` flip-flopping '' all night . They were a total waste ... I never ever wear them .
 I have these in black . They are one of the sexiest pairs of shoes I own . I truly feel beautiful when wearing them . One problem though , they wo n't stay on the backs of my ankles ! They slip right off with every step . So even though I bought them for a wedding , I could n't actually wear them there or anywhere else either.I was very disappointed because I am a Ninewest fanatic . I have so many pairs and they all fit wonderfully . This has been the only exception .
 First , the strap on the back of the foot slips down constantly . Because of that , I fell down the stairs at work and got hurt . I 'll never wear these again . I love NW shoes , but I 'm super disappointed with these .
 these heels are adorable . i bought them for a wedding and after a while my feet were hurting so bad . would not recommend .
 I wear 8.5 - 9 , usually 8.5 in sandals like these . I have wide feet and if you do as well I would NOT recommend these . I love Nine West but these heels can be worn for about 10 minutes before you 're ready to go bare foot .
 I also ordered the loafers and received sandals . When I tried to return them , I could only exchange them even though my size was out of stock . After three very long calls to customer service , I was allowed to return the sandals for a refund , but had to pay the shipping myself . If you order these shoes and get the sandals , it might be best just to keep the sandals . For me , at three hours of my time on the phone , plus twelve dollars in shipping , it would have been cheaper to keep the sandals .
 I ordered the loafer and got the sandals . I will keep the sandals , they are not bad , but I wo n't order from Propet again .
 The sandals are okay , not terrific , too much of a hassle to return . Probably wo n't order again .
 Propet Women 's Comfy Walker LoaferI also purchased the loafers for $ 34.90 but received sandals instead . Must be a mixup with the photo/item number . Easy return process by printing pre-paid return label . Original shipping charges also to be refunded .

 They must have a different definition of `` XW '' than I am used to . These shoes were not even close to Extra Wide . Another downside to buying clothing online .

I never received the order , and just today -LRB- October 13,2003 -RRB- I get an e-mail saying that a credit was coming to me for the order . The only other communication I received was a very lame voice mail asking me why I was being negative about the situation !!!! As I said , the product may be OK , but the company selling it is horrible . AVOID THEM IF YOU CAN ... buyer beware ... you 'll be kept waiting too

 I bought these for my 2nd grader at the begining of the school year and within 6 weeks he had a huge hole in the toe area . I thought Pony would be better quality . Maybe it is my son being too rough on his shoes ? My 5 year old has the same shoe and his are n't as bad .

 I think that they are a load of ! $ % @ ! They are over-priced and my child does n't even fit in them !! I HATE THOSE BOOTS !!
 These are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned . I have worn Timberlands for years , and purchased these because they were on sale . I ca n't believe all of the good reviews that people are giving these shoes talking about how comfortable they are , there is practically `` zero '' padding in these shoes .
 I just threw a pair of these shoes in the garbage after owning them less than a year . Not only do the soles have the appearance and durability of cheap , spongy rubber , they wore so badly that I was experiencing foot and knee pain from wearing these shoes . I switched to a pair of New Balance service shoes and the relief was immediate .
 Rockport is supposed to be known for comfort , but these bad boys do n't deliver . I suppose since Rockport got taken over by New Balance and then Adidas , quality is being sacrificed to boost the bottom-line . If you lift up the insole you will feel underneath it is like a piece of steel . There is literally no give to the shoe . I bought them thinking they were Rockports -- known for quality -- however Rockport is n't the same compnay today . I probably could get more comfort from a $ 30 pair of shoes in a baragin bin , then these overpriced clunkers !
 What 's missing from the box these shoes arrive in is a little rubber nose and a rainbow wig . These are clown shoes!I ordered these based on the reviews and lovely picture ; unfortunately when they arrived I could n't get over how cheap they looked -LRB- big , bulbous , and plastic looking -RRB- , as if meant as part of a clown 's costume . They are also feather light , which to me means `` cheap . `` I work in a casual office environment but people would laugh at me if I were to wear these . I 'm returning them and I hope they will find a happy home in some circus ...
 I 've had rockport shoes for years and thought they were all very comfortable with durable soles.These shoes were the complete opposite.The back of the shoe that rides above your heal has no padding so it wears against your foot.It was more like my shoes were breaking me in instead of me breaking my shoes in.I had to buy padding to put in there since my foot was getting raw each time I wore them.The soles are already worn out but I 've only owned them for 9 months!Horrible shoes ! Very disappointed .
 I had an identical pair of these shoes that I bought 6 years ago . At least , I thought they were identical , because the two pairs look identical down to the last stitch . However , they could not be more different . The original pair was incredibly comfortable , and gave great arch support to my flat feet . They were snug and stood up to long periods of standing or walking without any problems . After six years of wear , however , the back of heal was starting to wear , making them less than appropriate for work or leisure . I ordered a replacement pair right away.The replacement looks the same , but they do not fit nearly as well . After even a brief 20 minutes of walking my arches start to ache terribly . The back of the shoe is constantly slipping , which causes my heal to slide slightly out of the shoe and rub back and forth as it slides back in . This is not only uncomfortable but will no doubt cause the same wear and tear my old shoes suffered , but in a much shorter span of time . The slipping heel also means that I have not been able to alleviate the sore arches problem with insoles , because putting even the thinnest insole in cause the back of my foot to permanently reside half in and half out of the shoe.I have been wearing the new shoes for about three weeks now , so I ca n't imagine they will get much more broken in . I am very disappointed that my go-to Rockport shoe has seen such a decline in quality .
 I have bought a Rockport Men 's Northfield Oxford pair of shoes recently . I have known these shoes for about six years since I bought two pairs in London , UK . However when my order arrived from Amazon I noticed one thing immediately . The shoes were very stinky . -LRB- In UK they were not stinky at all . -RRB- I have been airing them since then . Another thing was discovered today . The shoes I bought in UK have a stamp , each of them . However , there is no stamp at all in the shoes bought from Amazon . I am very disappointed and I am not sure whether I bought a fake pair of shoes or not .
 I did n't like the quality of these boots at all they were not made out of leather but what almost appears to be plastic or something of that nature . I expected allot better quality boots for what they claimed to have been worth.I saw boots for 15.00 at walmart as good as these .
 I had a pair of BB 's before , liked them very well and I wore them out . I purchased this pair that is a slightly different style . In a matter of 2 mos the seam on the uppers along side the laces has separated ... on both shoes . I am very disappointed . I thought these would last awhile .
 Buster Brown is supposed to be a quality and durable brand . However after wearing these shoes for 3-4 days the sole separated from the rest of the shoe ... talk about embarrassing for my son ! Not sure if this was just a bad pair in the assembly line but I am very disappointed .

 I love Easy Spirit shoes , but I was dissapointed with this , and I 'm glad I did n't purchase more than 1 pair . The front of the shoe cut into my feet . I 'm hoping that it will stretch enough so that I wo n't have to suffer !!
 the non us size `` extra wide '' is not the same as us size extra wide
 Take it from someone who has very tough feet to make happy ! This Leo shoe is way too stiff for someone with bunions or bad feet . It ca n't compare with the Capezio 700 t-strap which worked well for me once I got it stretched a little .

 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .

 I read the reviews and thought I would give this a try and ordered a bone one . I was so disappointed when I received it . The materail was thin cheap plastic that started to discolor/yellow after a few weeks even when not using it . The design was good but not the material and the super thin lining and it looked cheap on the outside . Not worth the price . I do not know about other colors but for sure would not recommend this bone .
 They canceled my order because was out of stock , I really wanted the navy one ! So sad ... . So I cant review the product sorry !!

 SKeetcher 's excursions are a very cute sandal/shoes ! May be great for biking but for walking no . I 'm not sure why . Could be the lac of instep support . Perhaps not the right shoe for thos of us with fallen arches . After walking five minutes , my feet hurt and I had blisters . SO I 'll just wear them for going out to dinner or such where I wo n't be walking much . The price is a bit high . I would recomment hghly Keens brand for walking shoes if you 're looking for a good walking shoe . I have a pair of those and they 're wonderful ! -LRB- Excellent arch suport and comfort . -RRB-
 After having these as long as I have , I got 2 pairs expecting something more . They are not as comfortable & the elastic over the ball of the shoe does n't have much give .

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 My shoe size for leather shoes is 9US . I ordered the 9.5 M US hoping that with the .5 allowance , the shoes will fit fine . Guess what ? I should have ordered a 10.5 . The shoes are too small -LRB- like an 8 -RRB- . I managed to put my feet inside but I could no longer walk . But even with the right sizing , I will not recommend the shoes as they are as hard as wood , almost as hard . Perhaps if you 're looking for a weapon , buy them and they will do just fine .

 I think that they are a load of ! $ % @ ! They are over-priced and my child does n't even fit in them !! I HATE THOSE BOOTS !!
 These shoes are cute , yes . But they are rather poorly made and not even of the quality of say , the Keds brand . Also , the colors do n't exactly go together . The striped band is very dark/vibrant colors , while the print upper of the shoe is done in muted , nearly pastel colors . It is quite offbeat in appearance and difficult to match .

 The toes are too tight , the heel is too wide , the all of stitching is falling out and you can feel the wind thru all of the holes in the stitching , the inside is balling up and falling apart . Not to mention the rubber is peeling and not even cut right for the boot . Do n't see how this could be water proof if you can feel the wind thru the stitching holes .
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...

Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes

 This case DOES NOT look like it 's advertised . I bought the white case , but the actual color of this product is a nasty yellowish-gray ; it has a cheap black ! plastic clip that looks like it will break in a week . And I agree with previous reviews , it looks like it was bought at a 99 cent store . Of the pictures posted , the one of the red case looks like the product you get .
 The case is bulky and feels like you have a phone tied to your hip . This might be inpart due to the size of the Zen . You have to decide weather to wear you cell phone or the zen . The case is also not good when you want to go to the gym .
 Not my favorite shoes by any standard ... heavy and Klutzy ... but costs more to send back than it would be to keep them .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I do n't normally leave feedback , but my experience buying these shoes is worthy of print . I wanted to tell amazon how unhappy I was with my purchase , but they only allow 200 characters to explain the reason for return -LRB- and ITEM WAS USED is not one of the catagories to choose from -RRB- . That being said , I have decided to list here what I would have said to amazon had I been given the chance : You should have another choice under reason for return
 I have tried to order from you on 3 different occassion for a pair of sneaker 's and I you never seem to have the item that i am chossing from your sites if the product is not available then it should be removed . I still have a gift refund credit but everytime I think about going on line to us it I think is the let down worth it.I do not give you anything but a 1 for poor customer service ... Sorry but I can go to the store and buy it with less hassle ... BIG PAIN in my side ... Sincerely yoursDiann
 i found the pictures are misleading that they are confusing , they are shown as strapless , which is like threadless , no tighing , on go shoes but today when i received it is like as normal shoes tighing shoes , i am not satisfiedwith these purchase

 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I clicked on size 5.5 but received a 7.5 I 'm a girl so this was a little big . The shoe was great , but because of the sizing issues I ended up giving these to my niece -LRB- whom they would fit -RRB- and bought a similar shoe through Journeys .

 I bought these Sanuk 's for my 11 year old son -LRB- first pair -RRB- he was so excited when he got them . The comfort is great but on these the front sole has seprated . It has a big gap and I have tried to mend it with glue which lasted one school day . Love the brand but disappointed they fell to pieces so quick - -LRB-
 Not to my liking . Therefore I returned . Picture did NOT do the shoe justice . Was disappointed when I opened the box .
 I really like the idea/concept , because I love just strolling around in sandals . But the problem for me was my feet got too sweaty inside . This is n't a problem for regular sandals since there 's a lot of air , but when it 's enclosed like a shoe it gets all sweaty . Suppose you could wear socks , but that defeats the purpose of sandals .
 I was surprised how huge these made my teen son 's feet . Looked like clown shoes ! We returned immediately for another brand .
 My issue is simple.I was told that I would receive my product by a certain date and I did not . In this case , punctuality was important since I needed this product for a trip I was taking . I was very clear with Red Rock customer service that I needed them by a certain date -LRB- I have the correspondence to show this -RRB- . They did not deliver as they said they would . To make matters worse it was only after I reached out to them asking for a shipping update that they informed me that in fact my package would not arrive in time.With all the options I have as a consumer I choose not to do business with a company who does not deliver on the expectations they set with customers - especially when my request was more than reasonable . Proceed with caution and be careful as their shipping estimates are not accurate .
 Hideous looking when worn . Very uncomfortable with no foot support . I guessI should have known not to buy footwear sight unseen and especially without firsttrying on .
 Title says it all . I really wanted to like these . They 're super lightweight and very comfortable , but just wearing them around the house for a half hour in bare feet , my feet were sweating . They might be great with socks , but I bought them specifically for the summer to wear in bare feet . Returned them the same day .
 So these are by far my favorite pair of shoes -LRB- sandals . -RRB- I also own the Kingstons and the I Got Your Backs . And I will probably buy more because they are comfortable , easy and look so tight . But I have the same two issues with all three pair.First and foremost , as the author of one of the two-star ratings pointed out , the front of the soles separate after a minimal amount of time . For the price they charge , you would think the soles would last more than a year and half . I also tried to glue them , epoxy them etc. . . nothing held them together . It is a design flaw in my opinion.My second issue is that these sandals do not provide great ventilation . I realize that is a problem inherent with any no-sock-shoe or sandal , but for the price , you would think there would be something to address the issue besides a couple of eyelets ... like maybe a material for the insole that doesnt get all slippy when your feet are sweating and you try to walk ... But again , I will be buying more .
 I have had several pairs of this brand shoe before and have loved them . This recent pair is noticably tighter than the previous size 13 that I usually purchased . Not sure if they have changed something in their sizing or it 's just the Vagabond model . Hopefully they will stretch out as they are not the usual super comfortable shoes I love from Sanuk .
 THIS IS A TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL SHOE . HOWEVER THE SHOE SEEMS TO RUN SMALL AND THE QUALITY IS COMPARABLE TO TARGET OR PAYLESS . THANK GOD IT IS ON SALE .

 This is a cheap shoe ... construction is terrible ... worn twice and threads started letting go ... terrible product . . would never order again , and they should have refunded my money
 I was not impressed with this shoes , very uncomfortable and they are not especially flattering on the feet . They look better in the magazine or on the screen !
 I have been wearing New Balance sneakers for over ten years and this is not their finest product . I purchased these for just strolling around the park with the kids , no long distances , but they were quite annoying . The sole is recessed and there is an odd portion on the end of the shoe that rubs your heel as you step . Unfortunately , I tried to go up a size and had the same result.They look really nice but they 're not worth the discomfort . I suggest that you take a good walk around a footwear store with these on before you add to the unwanted shoes in your closet .
 The plastic edge of this thing is too high so slight pressure on the sponge pushes it down and all you get is plastic on leather . Took forever to shine up one pair of shoes and had to get rid of it .
 the sponge detached from the plastic holderwhen you buff the leather , the plastic hits and scratches the boots , dont buy this
 i have been using this product for a while but the product I got from amazon did not gave me the same feeling as the sponge was very dry and did not show much effect after rubbing it on my pair of shoes .
 I originally bought a shine sponge like this one at Jos Banks and it worked great for almost a year in my travel bag . I then bought this and while it was the same thing , it dried out in the first week . The case does not stay closed and all the juice that shines the shoes melts or evaporates and then is gone ... did n't work for me ...
 i like teva shoes and sandals but this one is tight . my little one can hardly push his toes in front .
 I bought my son Teva 's and before the summer was over the velco would no longer stick it had worn out . I emailed Teva 's customer service and I got no response so I emailed them again and again NOTHING ! I no longer buy Teva anything and my whole family has switched to Keen . Last summer my active son 's keens held up so well they can even be passed down to his little brother . Keens cost about double but they are worth it because they last all summer and then some .
 Honestly , folks , people would buy these sandals if you would give customers a chance to indicate the desired size !
 I bought two pairs of these for my girls and , when I first got them , I loved them . They go from hopping and skipping down the garden path to puddles like a dream . The problem ? Five weeks after I bought them , my youngest 's soles started separating from the bottom -LRB- both pairs -RRB- at the toes . Since I bought them online and Teva is a good name , I figured perhaps she 'd scuffed her toes or something and just Shoe-Gooed them back together . Two weeks after that , the SECOND one 's soles started doing the same thing . I Shoe-Gooed THOSE back together as well . Three weeks after that , the BACK soles of the first kids were coming apart . More Shoe Goo . And now , as I 'm putting away the summer gear for school shoes , the older kids heels are also now coming apart . I think I spent more money on Shoe-Goo than I did on these over-priced sandals.I have a pair of Teva that have lasted through some pretty rough hiking on rocky terrain . It surprised me these were so poorly constructed , especially as my kids only used them for normal use , not the rough backwoods hiking my own pair has gone through and lasted several years . At $ 25 a pop , I expected a LOT more from these shoes . At least a full season ! The cheap $ 7.99 leather sandals I bought at WalMart have gone through all three of my kids!Teva should know better than to tick off it 's customer base by selling shoddy sandals that fall apart . Now not only am I not going to buy any more sandals for my kids , but when my $ 80 ` old faithful ' pair which is finally beginning to show heavy wear kicks the bucket sometime next summer , I 'll be looking at another brand for MYSELF as well . If I wanted cheap ` made in China ' stuff that falls apart , I 'd have BOUGHT sandals from Walmart !
 I have recently purchased two pairs of shoes by this company , and both were way too narrow ! I do n't have wide feet and have never had to were a wide width shoe in my life and my foot was hanging off the side . Otherwise , they are like wearing nothing . Great for someone with a small foot and or narrow ankles/heels .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 The sole on these sohes have started to come off after 3 weeks of wear . Bad product !!! I asked Foot Locker for a return they told me to buy a new pair .
 I will never buy anything from this company again . I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law 's wedding , they were not what she wanted , we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge . Boy they are reaaly making money off customers .
 I am not happy with these shoes at all . In fact I am sending them back . They actually look like seconds . It was hard for me to think Yellow Box would actually let these go out of their company . The fit is fine , but the beads are missing so bad especially on the left shoe . I have many Yellow Box sandles and have always been satisfied . This is the first time for me to order on line Yellow Box shoes.I have been planning the boots that I have been viewing , but I am going to think about it . I have been unable to find a retailer here in Cincy that sells them . Maybe you could give me that info . Do I have free postage on this return ? I have ordered many items from Amazon & will continue to if this is made right by me . I love Amazon since I got my Kindle Fire back in January , they have made it easy for me to order . My husband hates for me to order on line , thinking it is unsafe . Thank you for giving me this opportunity to do this review.Sincerely , Donna Pacetti
 The shoes are cute , but they rub alot on the heels . They are not comfy to wear for a long period of time . Also , I ordered the natural ones , which look tan from the picture , but were yellow when they arrived .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes .

 I HAVE E-MAILED AMAZON SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT MY DISSATISFACTION WITH THE CREDIT CARD PROMOTION . I GUESS THE LESS RESPONSE YOU GUYS GIVE THE MORE I WILL FORGET . NOT GOING TO HAPPEN . I 'VE MADE MY LAST PURCHASE WITH AMAZON . I CAN PROVIDE THE DETAILS IF YOU CARE , JUSTIN

 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 My son loves the appearance of the shoe , but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description : - leather-Soft , calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper . I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising .
 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .

 The item arrived quickly , exactly as ordered . Unfortunately , the shoe runs large . The 6S fits like a 6 1/2 B . Since the shoe was inexpensive , on sale , it 's not worth returning . This is apparently a manufacturer 's sizing problem . Finding a true 6S has become almost impossible from any manufacturer , at any cost , from any supplier

 I 'm afraid I must disagree with the other reviewers . I owned a similar pair of these which I bought almost nine years ago . They were the best shoes I ever owned . I used them for walking and in everyday use . They felt like high quality , comfortable shoes from the moment I put them on . They were made in the UK where they should have been made , and you could tell in the fine quality . This new pair was made in China and they feel like it . They are cheaply made , though the materials may be good . For the air cushion -- they forgot to put in the air apparently . They are really not good for walking . For everyday use they may be ok , but if you want a comfortable shoe for walking buy something else . I would not have bought these at half the price if I had any idea how poorly they would feel . Clarks shareholders may be happy with their Chinese products , but I certainly am not . Save your money and buy somnething else made by a good shoe manufacturer ... if you can still find one . Very disappointing .
 It is rare that a product can provoke a sour note but this one sure did . I had an original Clarks pair made in the U.K. . They were well made but the bottom sole eventually split on one shoe and cracked on the other . The shore store described that as `` closet rot '' . They were not brand new , only a couple of years old and worn very little on a few full days at work . The shoe store offered to send them to send back to Clarks to see if they 'd stand by their limited warranty , which they did . It just took over 2 months . What they sent back was a new pair made in Communist China . These replacements are truly nothing like the old pair and what 's worse is the hard insole , sloppy uppers , and rock hard soles . An expensive orthotic did not help much so it 's the last Clarks pair . I would take them back for full refund if I could . This series is just plain awful and I would n't be the least bit surprised to see better made shoes at the discount shore store . In this case , you do NOT get what you pay for . It is disheartening to see such a once well made shoe become so bad , yet another brand to sell out to poorly made mass production . If not for the warranty , these would not be in the line up . What 's really upsetting is that there is no replacement for a shoe I could be on for 8 hours or more with little fatigue . If you know of a good shoe with such great support , comfort , and softness as the original CLarks Air series , please comment . Bottom line ; pass this one up . It 's not the original . Not even a poor imitation .
 The old time goods made in England were so good I am filled with sadness to think that I did n't buy ten pairs in the various colors before they stopped producing there and moved the manufacturing to China . I especially liked a lighter saddle color , and wore a pair of those many hundreds of times . Had I known at the time they would not be replacable , I would have kept them and tried to have them somehow restored . Very sad what has happened to this brand , ... that now sells crap . Poor quality , stupid designs , overpriced , with the type of promotions in their owm strip mall outlets that are insulting to ones intelligence , and making a full time business model out of cashing in on their previously fine reputation . Even if they did move it back to England now , I am sure the workmanship would not equal what had once been when their prestigious brand was known as Clarks of England . What has been done to this company in the pursuit of profits represents such poor judgement that their senior management should be criminally prosecuted . If I knew how to give less than one star , they would not have even gotten that .
 These shoes have not lasted long . After a year the stitching has come loose . They are made in China . Clark 's I have purchased in the past were made in Italy and lasted lots longer . I wold not buy these again .

 My sister gave me these shoes because they were a lot smaller than she expected , even though she ordered them in her size -LRB- 7 -RRB- . I wear a smaller shoe -LRB- 6.5 -RRB- and they fit me exactly . The shoes are cute and VERY comfortable -LRB- they actually feel amazing considering the height of shoe -RRB- . I wore the shoes for the first time today at work , on carpet , and the sole of one of the shoes is already starting to peel off . Note that I did not wear the shoes from my car in the parking lot to the office . I put them on once I arrived in the office , and I sat at my desk for the majority of the day . I 'll pull out the superglue , but it 's still disappointing that I have to repair brand new shoes after only wearing them once .
 I was SO DISAPPOINTED when I received this shoe . I ordered size 7 and when the shoe arrived , I could not even slide my foot an inch into the shoe -LRB- I am not exaggerating -RRB- . My husband and I were ready to swear that they sent me the wrong size -LRB- probably a 5 -RRB- , but the box and the shoe were , sure enough , labeled with a 7 . Consider ordering at least 1 full size -LRB- maybe even 2 sizes -RRB- bigger in this shoe . RIDICULOUS !!!

 These should be fine shoes . The leather is wonderful and the soles are very comfortable.The bad news , which is my mistake , is that they are made for people who use orthotics , and thus run `` deep , '' which also seems wide and long to me . I bought my usual size and have needed to wear thicker black casual socks rather than my thin dress socks . Wearing the thick socks is comfortable , but is actually still not enough to fill them up . I am switching from the 3/4 length spenco arch supports to a full length arch support . It should do the trick . I would not buy a pair without without trying them on in a store -LRB- where you will pay much , much more for them -RRB- . The AE website has a description of each of their 8 lasts , which is helpful to compare their different shoes , if you have tried on a pair before.One year later -- I have been wearing these about twice a week . No long walks , just around the office . At the toe , the leather upper sole is clearly separating from the rubber sole on both shoes . If it gets worse , I guess I will send them in to AE . I have friends who have had the same problem with this brand . Kind of pathetic .
 Definitely try this shoe on first at a store to find your size , it runs extremely large , and thus your foot 's placement is off which leads to it being very uncomfortable .
 I have been successful ordering 11.5 wide oxford lace-up shoes from Johnston & Murphy or Bostonian for the last 10 years . I happen to be hitting a dead patch with zappo 's and shoebuy in trying to find a new pair of casual shoes to go with the dockers , which is what I wear a lot , so I figured I would take a crack at these since they were cheaper than any other web site . The shoe is too long - I have about 3/4 inch dead space between my big toe and front of shoe - and the heel area is way too big . There is actually a bit of open space all around the heel . I assume the heel size will only change if I order a regular width , but my big toe is already pressed up against the side of the shoe , so a narrower size will get me in the situation I was in with regular sizes . Too bad , it is obviously a very nice quality shoe , but the last it is built on is weird -LRB- for me anyway -RRB- . I may have to go to an AE store and have them figure out what last my foot is compatible with and then try to order online .
 Honestly , folks , people would buy these sandals if you would give customers a chance to indicate the desired size !
 I bought two pairs of these for my girls and , when I first got them , I loved them . They go from hopping and skipping down the garden path to puddles like a dream . The problem ? Five weeks after I bought them , my youngest 's soles started separating from the bottom -LRB- both pairs -RRB- at the toes . Since I bought them online and Teva is a good name , I figured perhaps she 'd scuffed her toes or something and just Shoe-Gooed them back together . Two weeks after that , the SECOND one 's soles started doing the same thing . I Shoe-Gooed THOSE back together as well . Three weeks after that , the BACK soles of the first kids were coming apart . More Shoe Goo . And now , as I 'm putting away the summer gear for school shoes , the older kids heels are also now coming apart . I think I spent more money on Shoe-Goo than I did on these over-priced sandals.I have a pair of Teva that have lasted through some pretty rough hiking on rocky terrain . It surprised me these were so poorly constructed , especially as my kids only used them for normal use , not the rough backwoods hiking my own pair has gone through and lasted several years . At $ 25 a pop , I expected a LOT more from these shoes . At least a full season ! The cheap $ 7.99 leather sandals I bought at WalMart have gone through all three of my kids!Teva should know better than to tick off it 's customer base by selling shoddy sandals that fall apart . Now not only am I not going to buy any more sandals for my kids , but when my $ 80 ` old faithful ' pair which is finally beginning to show heavy wear kicks the bucket sometime next summer , I 'll be looking at another brand for MYSELF as well . If I wanted cheap ` made in China ' stuff that falls apart , I 'd have BOUGHT sandals from Walmart !
 i like teva shoes and sandals but this one is tight . my little one can hardly push his toes in front .
 I bought my son Teva 's and before the summer was over the velco would no longer stick it had worn out . I emailed Teva 's customer service and I got no response so I emailed them again and again NOTHING ! I no longer buy Teva anything and my whole family has switched to Keen . Last summer my active son 's keens held up so well they can even be passed down to his little brother . Keens cost about double but they are worth it because they last all summer and then some .
 I never received this item because was sold out , they debit my credit card and I have n't the credit in my credit card yet .
 Although I liked the design of the shoes , this came to me damaged . Even with it being damaged , Amazon still charged me for shipping it back .
 I had bought a pair of the white no lace Skeechers . When I saw the tan ones at Amazon and even cheaper than I paid , I jumped at the chance . I only wish for them in black & brown .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 This boot is FAR inferior to thew other boots that 5.11 produces . I have owned several paires of 5.11 boots and have never had to think abouth what size I am ordering . I get the boots and put them on and they fit , NOT the case with these boots ! I got them out of the box the other day , put them on and imediatly had to take them off ! Not only were they nowhere near the 12 that I have worn for the past 3 years , but the construction of these boots was nothing like the other 5.11 boots . Nedles to say Amazon can keep this boot and I will be getting a pair of the ATAC Storm , or ATAC shield !
 I have had these boots for about a year , at first I was wearing them for a couple hours at a time , mostly sitting in a classroom environment . Recently I have been wearing them for the hands on portion of the class and I have to say these boots are horrible . You may possibly get away with wearing them for 3 to 4 hours at the most . But , if any longer than that be prepared to buy some insoles -LRB- which is absurd to consider when paying 100 bucks for a shoe -RRB- . The actual insole in this boot is a joke . NO cushion at all . I 'm about 5 ' 3 115 pounds so I 'm pretty sure its not a weight thing nor have I ever had any issues with boots like this before . The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the outside of the boot and otherwise how the boot has held up is pretty well . No issues with the zippers like some people have mentioned or any kind of issues with the leather . This boot would be perfect if only they could figure out how to make it more comfortable for people who are actually working 12 hour shifts on their feet .
 I wear 10.5 and trying them on when they arrived today they are at least 1/2 to maybe 1 full size to small . I love the boot but trying to exchange for a larger size amazon is sold out of 11 and 11.5 so i guess i will be bootless for awhile longer .

 The shoe looks great , but is one of the most uncomfortable I 've worn.Leather sole is really hard and there is almost no cushioning inside . The heel started wearing out in a few weeks time.These shoes seem to run a 1/2 size larger than marked .
 I excited to replace my older white ben sherman sneakers with these ones only to be disappointed . The shoe feels ok , but definitely runs small , I had purchased my former pair at size 11 and figured it 'd be the same for these ones ... nope . Should have been 12 . Quality is n't as good as I 'd like and the design looks better in the picture than in real life .
 This sneaker really looks so great . But , it really does run small . I bought for my husband in his regular size . It cut off circulation to his toes . Unfortunately , had to throw away in the end . If you buy this shoe , definately go a size larger .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .

 This shoe was exactly what I was looking for , or so I thought . While it is adorable - the colors , the style - so cute , this is the most painful shoe I 've ever worn . I had n't even left my apartment before the back of the shoes were literally peeling the skin off of my heels . I 've worn stilletos more comfortable than these shoes . I 'll be returning them ASAP ! Such a disappointment .
 They are marked 9 , which I wear , but I ca n't even get them on . I 'm assuming they were mismarked as to size.I have 2 other size 9 pairs of Sketchers that fit me perfectly and are my favorite shoes .
 I would not buy this product again . It hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end !
 apparently there is an error in the item description . these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive . I new they probably were not waterproof when I put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway ... stupid me .

 The Cole Haan Calhoun shoe is super sharp and offers excellent all day comfort . I receive lots of positive feedback , especially from former-military colleagues . The reason for the 1-star rating is because twice Cole Haan has sent me `` restored '' shoes instead of brand new shoes . The shoes look brand new but there is a small insert in the box indicating that they have been `` beautifully renewed '' through Cole Haan 's restoration service . The sole is also slightly different from those in the store . After only 4 months , the soles of both shoes developed nickel-sized holes near the ball of the feet . I 've never had shoes to both wear out so quickly like this . I called Cole Haan on a Sunday evening and got a live person . The Cole Haan representative was shocked to hear about my experience and vowed Cole Haan would make it right . The second pair I purchased at Macy 's and they allowed me to return them . Bottom line , just because they are Cole Haan , and sold as brand new , double check to make your `` new '' Cole Haan Calhoun 's are not really pre-owned or restored shoes .
 Within two seconds those shoes had creased in the front and bubbled . Real leather would never do this . I think there was cardboard under a thin layer of whatever the material is . It looked awful ! Those were returned immediatly . I lost over $ 15 shipping them back and forth . Do n't waste your time and money !
 Got these and had the same issues as ithers with the toes . Tons of issues with stiffness in the toe on the right shoe . I gave it a week to break in , but now the sole started to separate on the right shoe and they 're showing wear like they 're months old.I have two other pairs of Cole Haans that have been great for nearly 2 years , but these are awful.It 's a slick looking shoe , but no way I can recommend it to anyone . It 's surprising these are viewed so positively on Zappos . It makes me wonder if different retailers get different stock .
 There was a definite difference in the quality of this shoe . The fit was different , and the leather was too . They were just not as comfortable as I expected , and one of the shoes slipped off the heal . I have several pairs of Cole Haan 's , and they all fit perfectly from day one . Not these . The price is good , but not worth it .
 just like one of the other reviewers , I wore these shoes to work one day , within a few steps the front had creased really bad , the material is kinda made of patent leather , but not as shinny . i have to return these due to how the leather wears

 I have to say I was very disappointed - I would not buy another pair of Earth shoes again as these are not comfortable at all .
 This product . Is very comfortable but makes you look like your wearing a grandma slipper . -LRB- No offense to the grandmothers of the world -RRB- . This shoe has a good length . If you have longer feet it will be a good pick . However , the shoes is fairly wide and the strap does not do very much to keep your foot securely in the shoe . The leather is a fine quality . The price and the style just do not measure up .

 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .

 They are marked 9 , which I wear , but I ca n't even get them on . I 'm assuming they were mismarked as to size.I have 2 other size 9 pairs of Sketchers that fit me perfectly and are my favorite shoes .

 Love KSwiss but this product proved to be a big dissapointment . Glue showing all over the sneaker and when you walk in them there is a horrible squeaking noise . Kept the sneakers thinking once they were broken in it would be better but unfortunately it was not .
 This shoe is narrow across the toes , and definitely needs a better arch support . I 'm truly disappointed with this shoe , but wanted an all white leather tennis shoe .

 I love the way these shoes look , but they are not very comfortable . I wore them for a wedding this past weekend , and had to take my shoes off when the dancing started because the toe strap had cut my toe open .
 I so looked forward to getting this shoe . It was shipped on time , but I never received it . It came to within 10 miles of my address and then simply disappeared . No one has any idea of what happened to it . Hopefully , it will show up one day , though , highly unlikely .

 I loved these shoes , and the way they looked , but the second time I wore them , they started a very loud squeaking in the soles of both shoes . I tried them several times , and each time I took a step in them , there was a loud squeak . I ended up sending them back . It could have been a default in just this pair , but I do n't think I would try them again .

 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 This shoe is narrow across the toes , and definitely needs a better arch support . I 'm truly disappointed with this shoe , but wanted an all white leather tennis shoe .

 My wife bought these clogs so she will now write the review . I thought maybe these clogs since they looked so much alike would be comparable to Dansko clogs , which I love . However they are definaly not ! They hurt my feet over the arches and my legs are so fatigued by the end of the day that I hardly want to walk . However , they do look nice and give me the extra height that I want .
 The Cole Haan Calhoun shoe is super sharp and offers excellent all day comfort . I receive lots of positive feedback , especially from former-military colleagues . The reason for the 1-star rating is because twice Cole Haan has sent me `` restored '' shoes instead of brand new shoes . The shoes look brand new but there is a small insert in the box indicating that they have been `` beautifully renewed '' through Cole Haan 's restoration service . The sole is also slightly different from those in the store . After only 4 months , the soles of both shoes developed nickel-sized holes near the ball of the feet . I 've never had shoes to both wear out so quickly like this . I called Cole Haan on a Sunday evening and got a live person . The Cole Haan representative was shocked to hear about my experience and vowed Cole Haan would make it right . The second pair I purchased at Macy 's and they allowed me to return them . Bottom line , just because they are Cole Haan , and sold as brand new , double check to make your `` new '' Cole Haan Calhoun 's are not really pre-owned or restored shoes .
 Within two seconds those shoes had creased in the front and bubbled . Real leather would never do this . I think there was cardboard under a thin layer of whatever the material is . It looked awful ! Those were returned immediatly . I lost over $ 15 shipping them back and forth . Do n't waste your time and money !
 Got these and had the same issues as ithers with the toes . Tons of issues with stiffness in the toe on the right shoe . I gave it a week to break in , but now the sole started to separate on the right shoe and they 're showing wear like they 're months old.I have two other pairs of Cole Haans that have been great for nearly 2 years , but these are awful.It 's a slick looking shoe , but no way I can recommend it to anyone . It 's surprising these are viewed so positively on Zappos . It makes me wonder if different retailers get different stock .
 There was a definite difference in the quality of this shoe . The fit was different , and the leather was too . They were just not as comfortable as I expected , and one of the shoes slipped off the heal . I have several pairs of Cole Haan 's , and they all fit perfectly from day one . Not these . The price is good , but not worth it .
 just like one of the other reviewers , I wore these shoes to work one day , within a few steps the front had creased really bad , the material is kinda made of patent leather , but not as shinny . i have to return these due to how the leather wears
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .

 This is a very cute shoe and seems to be comfortable when you try it on . However , it is extremely hard to walk in because the heel constantly slips off . I tried putting rubber pads in the back , but the front has such little coverage that the back slips off all the time . I got a lot of compliments on the shoe , but I had to get rid of them because I could n't walk 5 feet without it hurting . The shoe fits true to size but there is no grip .
 I have been wearing New Balance sneakers for over ten years and this is not their finest product . I purchased these for just strolling around the park with the kids , no long distances , but they were quite annoying . The sole is recessed and there is an odd portion on the end of the shoe that rubs your heel as you step . Unfortunately , I tried to go up a size and had the same result.They look really nice but they 're not worth the discomfort . I suggest that you take a good walk around a footwear store with these on before you add to the unwanted shoes in your closet .

 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 I find this shoes a little bit too complicated to put on , it actually took me 30 minutes to figure out which strap goes to the other . Not so pleased with it .

 Wide at the front , with a too tight elastic ankle strap . Not my favourite colour at all , have n't worn them much , will probably give them away .

 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .

 I 'm afraid I must disagree with the other reviewers . I owned a similar pair of these which I bought almost nine years ago . They were the best shoes I ever owned . I used them for walking and in everyday use . They felt like high quality , comfortable shoes from the moment I put them on . They were made in the UK where they should have been made , and you could tell in the fine quality . This new pair was made in China and they feel like it . They are cheaply made , though the materials may be good . For the air cushion -- they forgot to put in the air apparently . They are really not good for walking . For everyday use they may be ok , but if you want a comfortable shoe for walking buy something else . I would not have bought these at half the price if I had any idea how poorly they would feel . Clarks shareholders may be happy with their Chinese products , but I certainly am not . Save your money and buy somnething else made by a good shoe manufacturer ... if you can still find one . Very disappointing .
 It is rare that a product can provoke a sour note but this one sure did . I had an original Clarks pair made in the U.K. . They were well made but the bottom sole eventually split on one shoe and cracked on the other . The shore store described that as `` closet rot '' . They were not brand new , only a couple of years old and worn very little on a few full days at work . The shoe store offered to send them to send back to Clarks to see if they 'd stand by their limited warranty , which they did . It just took over 2 months . What they sent back was a new pair made in Communist China . These replacements are truly nothing like the old pair and what 's worse is the hard insole , sloppy uppers , and rock hard soles . An expensive orthotic did not help much so it 's the last Clarks pair . I would take them back for full refund if I could . This series is just plain awful and I would n't be the least bit surprised to see better made shoes at the discount shore store . In this case , you do NOT get what you pay for . It is disheartening to see such a once well made shoe become so bad , yet another brand to sell out to poorly made mass production . If not for the warranty , these would not be in the line up . What 's really upsetting is that there is no replacement for a shoe I could be on for 8 hours or more with little fatigue . If you know of a good shoe with such great support , comfort , and softness as the original CLarks Air series , please comment . Bottom line ; pass this one up . It 's not the original . Not even a poor imitation .
 The old time goods made in England were so good I am filled with sadness to think that I did n't buy ten pairs in the various colors before they stopped producing there and moved the manufacturing to China . I especially liked a lighter saddle color , and wore a pair of those many hundreds of times . Had I known at the time they would not be replacable , I would have kept them and tried to have them somehow restored . Very sad what has happened to this brand , ... that now sells crap . Poor quality , stupid designs , overpriced , with the type of promotions in their owm strip mall outlets that are insulting to ones intelligence , and making a full time business model out of cashing in on their previously fine reputation . Even if they did move it back to England now , I am sure the workmanship would not equal what had once been when their prestigious brand was known as Clarks of England . What has been done to this company in the pursuit of profits represents such poor judgement that their senior management should be criminally prosecuted . If I knew how to give less than one star , they would not have even gotten that .
 These shoes have not lasted long . After a year the stitching has come loose . They are made in China . Clark 's I have purchased in the past were made in Italy and lasted lots longer . I wold not buy these again .

 Very Disappointed . I purchased the navy blue bag -LRB- s -RRB- thinking they were to be the same dimensions as described -- 21 x 16 x 7 -- but they were undersized and measure to be approximately 10 x 13 x 4.5 inches .
 Supposively these are Reef brand shoes . My b/f wore them for a month , usually just on weekends . The sole of the shoe just kept falling apart until his heel was actually touching the ground . I will never order these kind again , but I guess I wondered why they were cheaper than the brown pair , maybe its quality .

 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .

 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .
 I have not yet received this product , the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month . And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem

 These have to be sent back , I 'm very disappointed , I ordered extra wide , but they are super narrow ... I wonder if it 's the brand ? , this is the second pair of extra wide Propet brand shoes I 've bought and I 've found them both to be very narrow ... I 'm sure it 's not me ... I 've got other shoes from a differant brand ... same size , and they are excellent ... wo n't be ordering Propet any more !
 I ordered this shoe in a 7.5 D width , twice . Each time it came as a 7.5 B width.I was extremely disappointed that I was not able to procure the correct shoe either time , as I was really looking forward to this cute red shoe to go with a summer dress that I have .

 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 but the ones that I received were brown laced oxfords!right brand , wrong shoes

 these shoes are so cute but not comfortable . they are also too low for me . I gave them to my daughter who has n't worm them yet .
 These shoes are cute but they gave me the worst blisters I have ever had . They 're honestly too painful to wear .
 I was expecting cute flats for everyday wear . But to be quite honest these are n't that cute . . more leaning towards granny looking shoes . The shoe is also VERY hard . Not quite sure about the comfort level yet since I have n't worn it outside , but I doubt it will be super comfortable . I do n't really like the heel of the shoe either . I will wear these for work . .
 These shoes are really cute , well made , nice looking , etc , but eventhough they are not tight -LRB- they 're true to size -RRB- these shoes are so hard they make your feet hurt ! I got them at full price months ago and now they 're really cheap , but I would not recommend them at all .
 The shoes are very cute and very well priced but uncomfortable to wear it for more than one hour .
 I thought these shoes were such a good deal , nine west flats for 20 dollars , I consider that a steal . But it isnt worth it . The first day that I wore them I developed horrible blisters on my heals . The shoes are also extremely hard . These shoes are definitly not everyday shoes , I am very dissapointed . Dont waste your money its not worth the pain and discomfort .
 If you 're looking for comfort , look on . I am still trying to break these babies in after 3 weeks . I even installed heal guards and they still rub terribly .
 This shoe only looks good on display . It is very uncomfortable . I wear eight and half but I bought a nine . The front is very narrow and upon wearing it for the first time it blisters the back and sides of your feet . What 's funny is that a co-worker of mine wore the same shoes and I ask her how is it , she took one foot out and oh my boy there were so many blisters on her feet . Yes ! I wondered why is she still wearing it , she said she bought it from another store and paid 3 times as much compare to amazon so she had to wear it . Do not buy this shoe . Not even good for charity .
 I had to send this item back because the sizing was way off . Normally I wear a size 8 in easy spirit -LRB- I have many pairs of easy spirit shoes -RRB- These fit like a long and narrow 9 on my foot . They had to be returned . and I was out the shipping money .
 I order this shoes !! thinking they where brown like show 's in the picture !! but what was my surprise when i open the box ! and found a BLACK shoe !!

 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 I have been wearing these shoes for about 4 months . They are good looking but feel cheaper than the shoes I replaced made by Nike Air -- which also was more expensive than this pair of Adidas . I would probably not buy this shoe again.Nothing compares to a great running shoe with cushion inside to protect your foot as it hits the pavement . I feel like this Adidas has no cushion and that my foot is not protected . Also , the Nike shoes were purchased at a running store which is the really best place to buy them .
 It was not the kind of sandal you expected , the finishes seem to be for women and not men .
 The idea of having your flip flop hold some ounces of liquid is a fun idea , however , after wearing the sandals for almost a month off and on , the container shattered and the area that is right under your arc became very uncomfortable . I would stick to the sandals with the bottle top opener .
 This is exactly why we now have TSA agents making everyone take their shoes off before boarding a plane . . honestly , why would you sell these ?
 I ordered these back in May of 2008 , and these are still very comfortable and mostly in one piece . The only problem with these were within the first couple of months of wearing them , the container inside actually cracked and broke , rendering the whole `` idea '' useless.You 're paying the extra dollar for the gimmick of being able to carry liquids in your shoe , but if the container is n't durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of everyday life , then I ca n't recommend these shoes.And even if the containers were durable enough , their capacity is very limited .
 I have several pairs of Reefs ... hands down the best sandals out there . . but I will be darned if these things leaked after the first fill up . . didnt know till I was headed to the Pearl Jam concert ... filled a little Jamesons in there . . and put them back on ... drip drip drip ... other than that , they are a very comfortable sandal ... but reef makes better utility sandals ... the bottle opener ones , stash box , fuzzy and the golf ones are way better and useful than the flask ... shop around ...
 First , let me say that I 'm a fan of Reef sandals and own several pairs but these sandals disappointed at every turn . I know the flask is a novelty but less than 1 oz . per shoe ... Really ? Come on!The bigger problem arose after only several days of wear when the plastic -LRB- flask part -RRB- on both shoes cracked and crumbled , so even if I did want a drink fit for a lilliputian it would not have been possible.I know what you 're thinking ... And no , I 'm not fat , this is just a terrible product that should have never made it to market .
 I have bought two pairs of Drams for myself and one for a friend and they have all leaked the liquid , not from the screw caps . It is the most comfortable and cushioned Reef flip-flop yet , but `` the Dram is not worth a damm ! ''
 Was so excited to get these . . ordered a pair , fit great , but RIGHT foot leaked , because it was missing the seal , returned to get another with the other shoe leaking this time ... also , cheap plastic , pain in the but to fill , and it barely holds one shot ... cool - but bad design
 I thought these sandals were the sweetest thing when I first got them 2 months ago . However , in the past week the flask on both sandals cracked . They are very comfortable and if I were to buy another pair of reefs i would go for the original sandals or the fannings . Please beware when spending $ 50 on a pair of sandals with a flask .
 These sandals are basically well made sandals - nothing fancy , other than you can sneak alcohol into a concert in them . Unfortunately , each sandal only holds about 1.5 ounces of liquor , or a total of two weak drinks . If you are really desperate enough to need the buzz , let someone else drive and drag you along . If you really want the age-old secret , here it is - fill a small `` clean '' cooler with ice and vodka with your unopened orange juice inside . Nobody can tell .
 I bought a set of these and they 're a cool novelty , being the guy who has flask sandals . There 's a couple problems though , one sandal leaked all 1 shot of booze out . The other sandal , even after many washings with dish soap , still make whatever alcohol I put in them taste nearly unbearable , even when poured into a mix . Not worth any amount of money spent on these , do not buy them .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I generally wear a 6.5 or 7 in shoes . I ordered these in a size 7 and they were way too big . I did n't exchange them because they are also wayyyyyy too flat , had no arch -LRB- unlike my other flats -RRB- , lacked any type of cushioning whatsoever , and look almost cartoony in person . Sorry to offend those who might like or even own them , but these shoes were definitely not for me .
 I am a 6 ' 1 '' female and ordered a size 12 . The actual shoe part fit fine , however , I could have fit both legs into one boot . The sizing was utterly ridiculous . You will also be charged 20 % restocking fees for any returned merchandise . Do n't waste your time .
 I am a larger thighed girl and have bigger calves so I was hoping from all the reviews that these would work for me . Sadly , they are n't for us midwestern build girls . Great boot but just did n't fit me .

 They look nice but the slouching looks weird . They do no fit my calves at all .

 I bought these because they were the highest rated and the best selling at the time . As cool as these are , the little flap that goes between your big toe and your middle toe on the size 10 pair I received hurt . I 've worn them around on the beach and around several city blocks thinking the flap would loosen up ... alas , the flap is n't any softer and they still hurt . My wife tried them on as well and agreed .
 I have been wearing these for 4 months now doing all the things you hope to do in a sandal . The comfort is amazing , A + . Their demise is that they stink , literally and it is becoming unbearable . It maybe the leather strap after so many wet/dry cycles that is causing it or the rubber sole soaking in all the foot juice but I have never had a sandal stink like these do . After a lot of reading about how to remove it everyone has their own suggestion with no real cure out there . Some seem like a lot of maintenance for a sandal that is IMO supposed to be pretty much maintenance free.They look cool , they feel cool but unless you work on a farm you wo n't smell cool in these shoes .
 The sandal looks fantastic , but my foot did not even come close to fitting in these . It was like stuffing a sausage through a pinhole . I gave it two stars for the cool bottle opener feature .
 For what these cost I would expect them to be great but the fabric that goes between your toes causes pain and they are also a bit too tight a fit for my regular size that I wear . So , I will be returning these and getting sandals that cause no discomfort between my toes .
 I have a different model of Reef sandals that are very good and extremely comfortable , but these are not . I do n't know if the strap is different material , or if it has been sewn differently , but wearing these gave me blisters and rubbed holes in the tops of my feet around the toes . I am not able to put my finger on exactly why , maybe because they were new , but in five days of wearing these on vacation , I never felt comfortable , and was often conscious of the discomfort . I try to be optimistic , maybe I got lemons , or maybe Reef missed on this particular design .
 BAD QUALITY , the leather from inside hurts me + the leather from outside is like a plastic !!
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable .

The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 These would not stay on my son 's feet . The faux-fur lining is very slick , and the slightest wriggling will knock them loose.These may work for a kid who 's very , very still , but if they like to move and kick , you 'll be lucky if the first bootie stays on long enough for you to put the second on their other foot .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 Making a two star review for these shoes pains me , because I had really high hopes for them . They 're a great design , they 're comfortable , you 've got movement even with the meta-tarsal cover ... they 've got an all black version that makes perfect Batman shoes ... but something happened . Something that is n't supposed to happen with shoes that cost over $ 100 . About a week and a half into wearing them , inside on a concrete floor , the bottom sole -LRB- it seems like there 's two main layers to it -RRB- that makes contact with the ground , starting coming off . Probably like a good 60 % of one shoe . Just one . When I looked at it , it was like the assembler did n't use any glue . So , here were my brand new shoes falling apart.Luckily I had a buddy who had some really strong glue that he uses in his auto glass business , and I smothered that stuff in there . So far , so good.A person should n't have to repair a pair of shoes they just bought for $ 112.98 . Nautilus ' Quality Control needs to step it up before they let one bad worker or two ruin them .
 OK , I was looking around for a better shoes because my old ones were from Walmart and were uncomfortable , So I came across these and I read the reviews so I went ahead and ordered them.The first day
 Buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe . The real shoe has an ankle strap . Also , the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller . I had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs .
 The picture of the shoes was deceiving . Did not want ankle strap . You could notgo by the picture . Which is how you do online shopping . Returned the shoes .
 These are very cute , however , the sizes they place on these are nowhere near real sizes ! Be careful when ordering & be sure to choose a size or two bigger than what is decribed . Also , made for skinny feet .
 I have a pair of Clark 's that I 've had for 4 years that I love and are still holding up . When I saw these online , I expected them to be the same quality , comfort and sizing ! I purchased the same size as my previous pair , and they were huge ! They also lacked any kind of arch support and seemed generally flimsy . Perhaps it 's just this line of Clark 's that 's a shodier quality .
 bought this awhile ago in size 5 . runs a bit small and definitely does n't fit my ankle !!! how can anyone have ankle that small ??? material is n't that great either . had to return with some percent taken off due to restock !
 The shipping was excellent once again . It got here in record time . It would have been nice if it had been my order . I received the wrong color boot . I got a red boot with a black heel . Not what I ordered . When I contacted the company by phone they said they had them in stock . I still have n't received the return label and have contacted them multiple times . I wo n't order from them again .
 Honestly , folks , people would buy these sandals if you would give customers a chance to indicate the desired size !
 I bought two pairs of these for my girls and , when I first got them , I loved them . They go from hopping and skipping down the garden path to puddles like a dream . The problem ? Five weeks after I bought them , my youngest 's soles started separating from the bottom -LRB- both pairs -RRB- at the toes . Since I bought them online and Teva is a good name , I figured perhaps she 'd scuffed her toes or something and just Shoe-Gooed them back together . Two weeks after that , the SECOND one 's soles started doing the same thing . I Shoe-Gooed THOSE back together as well . Three weeks after that , the BACK soles of the first kids were coming apart . More Shoe Goo . And now , as I 'm putting away the summer gear for school shoes , the older kids heels are also now coming apart . I think I spent more money on Shoe-Goo than I did on these over-priced sandals.I have a pair of Teva that have lasted through some pretty rough hiking on rocky terrain . It surprised me these were so poorly constructed , especially as my kids only used them for normal use , not the rough backwoods hiking my own pair has gone through and lasted several years . At $ 25 a pop , I expected a LOT more from these shoes . At least a full season ! The cheap $ 7.99 leather sandals I bought at WalMart have gone through all three of my kids!Teva should know better than to tick off it 's customer base by selling shoddy sandals that fall apart . Now not only am I not going to buy any more sandals for my kids , but when my $ 80 ` old faithful ' pair which is finally beginning to show heavy wear kicks the bucket sometime next summer , I 'll be looking at another brand for MYSELF as well . If I wanted cheap ` made in China ' stuff that falls apart , I 'd have BOUGHT sandals from Walmart !
 i like teva shoes and sandals but this one is tight . my little one can hardly push his toes in front .
 I bought my son Teva 's and before the summer was over the velco would no longer stick it had worn out . I emailed Teva 's customer service and I got no response so I emailed them again and again NOTHING ! I no longer buy Teva anything and my whole family has switched to Keen . Last summer my active son 's keens held up so well they can even be passed down to his little brother . Keens cost about double but they are worth it because they last all summer and then some .
 I wish I could give them -5 stars.I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $ 170 should be really good . I could n't be more wrong . The lining of these shoes started falling apart just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day !!! Stay away at all cost !

 These boots are way too narrow . I ordered a 11.5 Medium D.Not even close to a fit . I really tried to like these bootsbut was very disappointed . Toe is too pointy too.They were n't a price bargain either .

 This product never arrived . Customer service was not able to explain the cause . They also were unable to correct this error . They did refund my money , but by purchasing the item it believe it was clear that I would have preferred the item over the money .
 very poor sizing . . very disappointed when i recieved my boots . i read the other reviews to make sure the sizing was true to size the shaft of the boot is soooo . . off im a thick bottom girl thick thighs and booty . . howver i am a size 8 in boots the 8 was like a 6 5 `` 6 about 145 pds these boots are not worth buying poor quality as well .
 I never even recieved the product and NO ONE is doing anything to remedy the situation . This bites ...
 I ORDERED THESE BOOTS FOR MY WIFE THEY BILLED MY CREDIT CARD AND NEVER SENT THE BOOTS . NOW THEY REFUSE TO REFUND MY CARD .
 I looked at several different 6 inch horse hair brushes listed and these were described as a top quality model . They are not . The finish on the wood is absolutely horrible and the bristles are mediocre at best . I purchased two of them and one has a crack running about 3/4 the length of the handle that you can tell was there before it was finished , but they passed it on through like that . Unfortunately , it would be more effort than its worth to go through a return so I 'll simply add some screws to draw the crack closed.Overall I 'd say these are worth about three dollars each and no where near the twenty I paid.Not recommended - look elsewhere .
 I was a little disappointed to find out that my sandals were made in China ; I doubt they 're feeling the `` sanuk . '' Kind of throws a kink in the company 's stony vibe . I figured they were so expensive because they were made here without slave labor . And why not offer a hemp or bamboo model - something sustainable ? They need to get with the program and quit being posers . If I 'm going to drop fifty bucks on some flip flops , I 'll buy them from a company that rocks it like they talk it.I think their advertising is very misleading . `` Working hard in Cardiff unless there 's surf ? '' Tell that to the people making your shoes in a sweatshop a world away . Posers .
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 This is my second pair of these flip flops . I loved the first pair , however I made the mistake of going to the beach and then leaving them in my car overnight . One of them shrunk a FULL SIZE ! That is completely unacceptable ! They are now in the trash . I wore them 10 times and they were perfect . My second pair -LRB- 1 year later -RRB- is NOT the same as my first pair . The quality has diminished greatly . They were comfortable while they lasted . Very cheap rubber . I took a picture , but could n't figure out how to upload it . Seeing is really believing !
 My first pair was the best flip flop I ever had . Then I bought a new pair and it caused red marks from rubbing the top of my foot.I could not figure out why the first pair was so good and the 2nd pair so bad . Turns out they shortened the band between the toe by 1/4 inch . Now the top rubs my foot constantly , removing my skin and irritating it.I called Crocs and they measured another 12 or so pairs and they were all 1/4 inch shorter in the band so it was not a defective pair that I had received but a change in the way they make them.So even though there are a ton of 5 star reviews I assume this is for the pair I had originally as I also rated it 5 stars on Crocs Website . Beware on this new cut because it might rub the top of your foot constantly.I have noticed other Crocs products have had the same issue including their flagship sandal . Reviewers have complained that they loved their original pair and then they bought a 2nd pair that was produced in a different country from the 1st pair and they were not comfortable at all because they were sized differently . It seems Crocs has a quality control problem with their manufacturing .
 Loved flip flops and have many , used these lightly one summer and the strap pulled out of the sole ? Company , Shoes.com , returned them to me , stating they could not `` re-sell '' them . Well duh , they were defective . FYI , This is not a stand behind it LLBean type company .
 After I purchased these flip flops , I wore them around the house for about two days . They were comfortable at first then irritation on my upper left foot began and in a few hours the pain became unbearable to wear them . I also purchased a pair of these exact flip flops from Shoe-buy for my wife -LRB- Amazon did not have her size -RRB- and had to return them due to the discomfort felt immediatly upon her trying them on . My advice is try them on in a store first .
 I had purchased this sandal August 2011 , because it received such good reviews . My review/update is based on 6 months of use which is mainly at home while taking shower . Over the past couple months , I had noticed that the sole or foot bed of the sandal is getting unglued . I do n't know if this is because I used it in shower or it is due to other issues . But for this problem , the sandals are comfortable . My experience might be of help to others considering my use case.I would have like to attach a photo attachment , if it was possible . I will see if I can do so on the product link page .
 I had such high hopes for these , but I was so SORELY mistaken . They are light , not heavy or clunky which was nice but they are in NO WAY shape or form comfortable or at all supportive . Sent them back and bought what I should have gotten in the first place , another pair of SKECHERS Reggae Rasta 's .
 When you use this flip flops it hurts you feet and then you can-t use any flip flop for some days . They have ruin my beach holidays !!
 Preliminarily , I note that never before have I written any review of any product - neither positive nor negative , but Crocs has now given me the incentive to do so.I used to be a fan of Crocs ' flip-flops and sandals , having owned a few pair over the past 4 years . HOWEVER , the new pair of Modi flip-flops that arrived directly from Crocs last week have seriously cutup both of my feet between the 2 large toes , similar to the consequence of wearing $ 2.99 flip-flops . Further , my calls to Crocs to discuss the matter have gone ignored - i.e. , I have called twice and each time was told that only 1 individual within Crocs could deal with this , 2 messages have been left for such person , and still no response . So much for Crocs ' Customer Service . The flip-flops are garbage , as it , it appears , Crocs ' concept of Customer Service . It seems their product , and their company generally , have become a croc of ...
 Crocs do n't come in half sizes , and thats where I had problems with them , I ordered the next size up , mens 8 womens 10 , and they made my feet hurt , were extremely uncomfortable , they kept sliding around on my feet , a smaller size would n't have fit either.I 'll never buy any crocs products again .
 Amazon sent the wrong article : The model that I bought was `` Crocs Unisex Modi Flip Flop ; color
 I was looking forward to these based on other reviews . After wearing for less than a mile stroll down the beach I had a blister on the top of my left foot . due to poor quality control the place the toe thong is glued to the foot straps is miss-aligned making them unwearable .
 Order it for my man . It is our first Crocs . I order a size larger due to the previous reviews . But I should say I am wrong . I can not compare with other Crocs and never own it before . But compare with the regular shoes , they are true to the size . It is probably because my husband 's foot is narrow . But I do love the quality and price . Since it is a flip anyway , I will keep it.update
 These shoes , which are bought for $ 35 , are very cheap -LRB- yes , i got what i paid for -RRB- , especially for kenneth cole Reaction . made in china . Totally uncomfortable . Thin soles .
 I purchased these shoes on a gold box special . They looked fine and were comfortable but poor quality . I wear dress shoes infrequently , maybe 4 or 5 days a month and the shoe has already separated from the sole . I only got about 40-50 days wear out of the shoes over the 9 months I 've had them . Apparently Amazon 's return policy does n't allow me to return these now . I thought this brand would have a better quality product .
 I bought these shoes when the came up as a Gold Box deal . Only about 35 bucks . They just were n't worth it even at that price . Found them very painful to wear , especially on outer side of each foot . The length was not an issue , it was the overall design and width . I 'm also not a fan of this particular style , but to each his own.I definitely recommend that potential buyers know in advance how Kenneth Cole shoes fit before buying here . I know that I wo n't buy another after this.I know from experience that Ecco shoes fit me right out of the box regardless of style . They 're almost as comfortable as sneakers . These Kenneth Coles ... not even close . As soon as I can pick up a pair of Eccos at the nearby factory store outlet these are getting donated to a thrift store .
 I received the shoes in a timely fashion . However , upon opening and examining the shoes , I received a defective shoe . The left foot looked accurate to the description , while the right foot was missing details that would have matched it to the left thus making a pair of shoes . That 's what I thought I was purchasing , a pair of shoes , not one left shoe and a different right one . I was disappointed to say the least .
 I was really looking forward to wearing these shoes . The price made the purchase very attractive.However , when I tried them on , I could n't get them on my feet!I wear a size 12 and they felt like a size 9-10 -LRB- seriously -RRB- . This may be a brand you would be better off trying on at a shoe store .
 I never got my purchase , never got a mail telling that the were returning the slides , so I think this is not a serious shop and Amazon is losing points with their clients .
 These boots were very nice looking but , unfortunately , turned out to be heavier than expected when received . They would have been used for work but my husband was unable to use them and they were returned .

 The Asics Gel Cumulus VII is the worst running shoe I have had in over 30 years of running . I wear a size 10 street shoe and have always used 10.5 for running . The Gel CumulusVII 10.5 is too small . I have blisters on top of my toes on both feet . I have never had blisters in over 30yrs . I have a pair of Asics 2090 and NB 991 both 10.5 and I use a sorbothane insole in both and very good results . The cumulusVII is too small without an insole . I bought them because they are supposed to be a `` cushion '' shoe , but they provide very little cushioning . They are just all around uncomfortable and I will probably give them away .
 These shoes were so uncomfortable that I had to return them for a refund ! The leather -LRB- felt like faux -RRB- was very hard and stiff . They also were not as cute as they looked in the picture.Save your time and $ $ $ $ .
 THE SHOES WERE NICE BUT THERE WERE BLACK SOLE MARKS ALL OVER THE SHOES.I WAS NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE .
 I purchased this Donna Sharp Sunset Boulevard Lori Tote Quilted Handbag Purse by Quilts by Donna and was very disappointed in the quality of the workmanship and the material in which it was made . I have other Donna Sharp quilted handbags and this was definitely did not meet the standards of other bags I have purchased .
 OK , I was looking around for a better shoes because my old ones were from Walmart and were uncomfortable , So I came across these and I read the reviews so I went ahead and ordered them.The first day
 It really is a gorgeous shoe . Unfortunately , the manufacturer 's sizing is way off ! I ordered a size 9 . My size 8 friend could barely squeeze into them . So , I sent them back . If you order really consider going up a couple of sizes .
 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 The product is very simple ... The photo shows a good quality product and the real product is with low quality
 Laces up awkward , poor traction on the fore foot area , and just a big `` still gangsta '' shout out to all his thugs back home . You should be ashamed Kevin .
 These shoes looked so pretty.I was happy to wear them to a wedding.Standing on them was so hard.They are nice looking but my feet hurt so bad.Ieven soaked my blisters in foot bath but it did n't help quick enough.I ca n't recomend them because of the comfort thing .
 These shoes Do Nothing to flatter a woman 's legs.Sometimes a man 's opinion is good to have.Men like delicate or dainty shoes on a lady . In these shoes you might as well wear a big robe and house slippers.I do not recommend these sloppy , chunky wedges .
 These boots have no tread . Do n't be fooled by the picture or else you 'll be fighting FOGDOG to send you a return slip as I am doing now . Made 5 calls and have finally had to file an A-Z claim thru AMAZON . Huge hassle .
 Though these boots are very warm , they LEAK ! After the first snowfall my bf said one foot felt wet . We were in denial and decided his sock was wet before he put the boots on . . but alas , both boots leak ! Not sure from where , but we pulled the linings out to dry and the inside souls were sopping . Very disappointed since bf said they are comfy and warm , but do n't stay warm once wet ! They are also a little clunky when walking and he tended to scuff along in them . What a bummer of a Christmas gift : -LRB-
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 The shoe box containing the boots was ripped and taped back together with scotch tape . The leather upper of the boots looked old and worn and contained flaws , especially on the buckles which were discolored , frayed and droopy . One boot lining was ripped . I had to return these sadly . I was looking forward to them , but dissappointed .
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I have the exact same feelings as William Hunicke in his review . I also do not have knee problems , but after running with these even for short distances now , my knees hurt . I have had them for probably a year now and I just ca n't take it anymore . I 'm on here to buy a new pair of shoes.I actually think they may have had a bad long term effect on my knees . Seriously , look elsewhere . They might look cool , but that is the only thing they have going for them .
 4 miles onto the first run in these shoes I developed a fore-leg tendon injury that took 4 months to heal . I have been using other running shoe brands for years with no problems.I realize it may just be my specific build/running mechanics , but hey , I will not touch these shoes with a 10-foot pole ever again-Tom
 These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes . The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact . I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them . I returned them and plan to try something else .
 I recieved a wrong color . The box said Black but inside the shoes was brown .
 The categorical I do not advise to buy these goods ! Very much poor quality ! The leather is painted and erased very quickly !
 They say you get what you pay for , in this case it was very true , this item by no means can honestly be referred to as a purse of any kind it barely does justice as a wallet . Most of the items I 've purchased online have been more than what I expected as to good quality for a fair price & in most cases I 've gotten better quality for a better price .
 I am shocked and dismayed by the blatant disregard for their customers by Amazon to even allow this kind of vendor on their site!I was charged for 10 bags PLUS Shipping for 10 bags and then 5 bags shipped.These are for Christmas gifts and it is almost impossible to communicate with this vendor so I am out $ 127 for NOTHING as I can not give the 5 bags to 10 people!Rest assured that I will not rest until everyone knows about this theft !
 I ordered these bowling shoes and when I received them they were not what I expected , they were to small . I called the company got a return authorization , returned the shoes over a month ago and still have not received my refund .
 I got this pair home and immediately thought it looked `` cheap . '' Tried it on and it also felt `` cheap '' -- too light weight like the heel would break -LRB- and I 'm not a heavy-set person - about 5 ' 6 '' and 130 lbs . -RRB- Great price , but I 've seen shoes at Charlotte Russe that are just as cute and for about the same price !
 ouch ouch ouch ouch ouchThey 're stiff . They rub in wrong places.I 've had to invest in a few boxes of callous remover .
 The Birkenstock Milano sandal came highly recommended . I doubt it will be worn very frequently for the following reasons
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 Beautiful shoe but it didnt fit and had to be returned . The shoe toe box is narrow and the heel is wide . I thought it was my feet and gave it to my daughter , she said the same thing . Too bad , it 's a beautiful shoe .
 I ordered these bowling shoes and when I received them they were not what I expected , they were to small . I called the company got a return authorization , returned the shoes over a month ago and still have not received my refund .
 I ordered these for winter . We have a lot of snow and ice in our region.They were much wide and long . I was surprised as I wear clarks shoes almost every day .
 Right away , one can tell the quality of this boot . It is made WELL.Also right away one can tell that this boot looks HUGE when worn . Bigger even than my army boots . They felt clunky and clumsy , like I was going to trip over my clown-feet . The color was darker than in Amazon 's images.A shame since they look so good on the website . I had to return them .

 I have not yet received this product , the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month . And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem
 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .
 I 'm sure the boots are fine , but do n't buy from PapaShoe . They do n't ship the item and you will get the runaround when you contact them . I purchase alot of items from Amazon and have never had this much problem with one of their retailers . They should not be allowed to sell at Amazon.com .
 I had a set just like this . The glue that holds the sole/heel on failed . The 1 year warr is worthless . Rockey will not email you back or call you back . I wore my boots a total of 6 times over 10 months . Junk . Made in china junk . Save your hard earned money and get another brand .
 Comfortable slipper . Top construction is well made and put together but sole material wore out too quickly wearing the slipper around the house and outdoors on occasion to walk out to get the sunday newspaper . Would not purchase these slippers again .
 These shoes were MUCH smaller than the stated size . I wear a 13 and a half shoe , but knowing that house shoes need to be loose , I ordered them in a size 14 . They were SO small , I could n't force my feet into them . And if the seller -LRB- different than the manufacturer -RRB- really had a `` bend-over-backwards '' policy as they state , they would offer a fedex or UPS label so I could send them back for free . / This is exactly why I dislike buying cloths from the internet or by mail-order . But , it is getting harder and harder to find local stores that have the larger sizes -LRB- even big and tall stores -RRB- . I guess I 'm just screwed .
 I wear a size 10.5 D . After reading other reviews here saying these shoes are &#34; true to size &#34; , I ordered a size 11 . I received them and they ar at least a full size too small . This is the last pair of house shoes I will try to buy on line . I know from trying them on in store that you just ca n't trust their sizing . I do n't know why that is , but i 's been the case ith Every pair I 've bought . I happened to be able to give this pair away or a Christmas present instead of having to return them . That said , I regret buying them ... wo n't try it agin .
 I ordered these for my Dad for Christmas , but he was n't able to get his feet in them . They were very small .
 These were sold as mens size 11 , both my son and my husband wear a size 10 1/2 shoe , neither of them can wear these slippers . They are at lease 1-2 sizes too small . The shipping was slower than advertised as well . The slippers themselves are solid and warm with a sturdy sole you can wear outdoors without fear . The only problem is they are much smaller than the marked size .
 cloth on bottom sole not good for hardwood floors , knobs on bottom of sole with cloth glued to them offers even less area for grip . doubt the knobs will be comfortable , but time will tell . solid build and warm for ankle and once fabric on sole wears out and offers some grip -LRB- what where they thinking ? -RRB- it might be comfortable but will definately be warm , if it doesnt make feet sweat ... -LRB- just got them so unknown , but looks like the dearforms inner fabric , sorta . -RRB- if not for the knobs and cloth on bottom , this could get a five .
 I threw them out ! the most cheaply made piece c. . p I ever had . Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
 Having read another review that said these slippers ran small , I ordered the next size up but it was too small . I returned them for the next size but they are out of the next size bigger . This is the only style slipper my husband likes and it is impossible to find them anywhere .
 Do n't order these unless you have tiny little feet . I ordered a size larger than my husband normally wears and he could n't even get them on . If you order them , you better try TWO sizes up than normal .
 normaly this would be my size.could barely get my foot in them . i think this was the only size available.looked well made but jusy wouldny fit . gave yhem to the needy .
 The slippers were ok except the opening is too small to get your foot into it without considerable effort . That made the slippers unusable for me .
 I tried on these slippers on precisely one time , then returned them to the box . They were n't horrible , just not real comfortable , and I got the feeling they would n't be particularly warm . But to be fair , I did n't wear them long enough to judge their thermal efficiency . I just did n't like the feel of them.For my money , better to pay a little more and get better quality .
 Good Quality ... But opening for foot way too small ... My huband couldn &#34; t get his foot in the slipper ... Other wise nice slipper shoe
 I ordered the recommended one size up . The toe box length and width is tight , but the back half of the slippers and sides are a bit loose . A full size increase to a 9M from the size , which I ordered -LRB- 8M -RRB- would be too large and the sides would definitely be too loose . As other reviewers noted , these slippers do loosen up and I hope that the toe box becomes more comfortable . The 3/4 '' rubber raised soles appears adequate . As I write this review , my feet are becoming quite warm , after about twenty minutes , with my athletic socks.After an hour , my feet are roasting in these slippers . Would I purchase again ? Difficult to say , if the toe box does n't loosen up for comfort .01 / 25/2012 UpdateI replaced this pair from DSW -LRB- Designer Shoe Warehouse -RRB- with two pairs , which fit . My feet were never comfortable with this pair . Would not recommend .

 I bought a medium-sized AmeriBag bag because i 've hurt my back a couple times recently with my traditional backpack . The bag was great for my back since it put almost no weight there.However , all of the weight was placed on one shoulder , and it was just too much . I do n't think I carry all that much stuff around with me -LRB- a book , PDA , cell phone , wallet , mini umbrella , a couple pens , sunglasses , some ibuprofen , and the like -RRB- . The heaviest individual item i have at any given time is usually my book.Unfortunately , the AmeriBag was n't quite up to the task . I 'm going to have to go back to a traditional two-shouldered backpack and will hopefully be able to find an ergonomic one . My shoulders just ca n't handle the AmeriBag!If you carry very little around , the AmeriBag will probably work out well for you .

 I ordered these shoes a long time ago . When they finally arrived , one shoe was broken . I returned the pair and was sent a replacement ... broken again . Nevertheless , I have given up . Maybe you will have a better chance .

 this stretcher is way too large . I ordered one that is supposed to fit size 8 1/2 to 11 -- but can not get it into my boots sized 11 and 11 1/2 . Also , the company failed to respond to my questions for information .
 This boot stretcher simply will not work in a western boot . For the handle to turn and expand the foot it must have two -LRB- 2 -RRB- universal joints .
 I bought these shoes to do aerobics in . They look good and are comfortable , but only to walk in . There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground . There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics . My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones , but I ca n't use the old ones . The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes . They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt . I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location . Now I have to look again .

 I ordered these bowling shoes and when I received them they were not what I expected , they were to small . I called the company got a return authorization , returned the shoes over a month ago and still have not received my refund .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .

When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 Adidas makes some great shoes . So I thought these Adidas sandals would be great , too ! The concept is intriguing
 Do not by this product.Five days after I bought it , I went to my friend house and leaved it outside under the sun for about 2 hours -LRB- about 90 degree -RRB- . It melted and deformed.It is a bad product from Adidas . I hope they improve this product soon
 I bought these for my son but returned them because the pegs that make up the sole of the sandal hurt his feet . He wo n't wear them .
 These are pure torture . I can only hope the nibs start breaking down . These are only tolerable with socks . Buy something else you wo n't be sorry .
 I tried them on for size in the store . When I got home and walked around they really irritated my feet . I returned them . My daughter has the Calissage so I 'm getting those .
 I hate these shoes . There are just painful . I thought the rubber nubs were soft , but they are very very hard . It 's like walking on spikes . It is a little less painful wearing socks , but those spikes make these sandals useless .
 These sandals are ridiculously uncomfortable . It feels like having a bunch of tiny knives stabbing at your feet with every step . These are the worst sandals I have ever purchased . Do yourself a favor and buy a different model .
 I bought these thinking the little adissage would feel nice but after trying them the first time my feet were in pain after 30 minutes . Then I tried to wear them again another day but with thicker socks and found that I could only last 1 hour walking in them . What I would compare them to is walking bare foot on small pebbles if you can handle that and enjoy it then these are for you but if you have sensitive feet like I do you might want to buy the non-Adissage .
 The first time I wore it , it seemed fun but the novelty wore off very soon . Also , this was too costly
 After eight months use as shower shoes one of the straps disconnected from the sole . Crap Crap Crap Crap Crap .
 adissage are total crap ! i have been an exclusive adidas customer for many years and am completely pissed ! the footbed of these sandals come apart with minimal , around the house wear in under 3 months , besides they are not that comfortable . adidas has no desire whatsoever to replace them or acknowledge the crap quality . i 'm so pissed that i will never buy adidas products again . -LRB- ... -RRB- , ok , but i 've spent thousands on adidas products over the years and deserve better treatment over a crap , cheap product . pass on these and buy some birkenstocks !
 These are some nice sandals . They look cool , can be worn with just about anything , and are very popular . They are also rather comfortable , once you get used to standing on hundreds of little bumps . However , I hardly ever wear them , because I have a very hard time keeping them from sliding sideways under my feet . I 've tried tighteing them , loosening them , and altering the angle at which I velcro them , but nothing seems to help keep them from becoming crooked after just a few steps , especially if I 'm walking at a brisk pace . I do n't know how people wear these things around without having a problem with them sliding sideways . I would not recommend them , unless you can somehow keep them straight on your feet . If you can , they are great .
 Do n't buy these sandals ... I purchased a pair of these five years ago and they were great . The nobs did not come off ... the strap finally broke loose after three years of use . I just purchased a new pair in June and by August most of the nobs are off already . They are almost unusuable at this point.I wrote to the Adidas to let them know that the quality had gone downhill and got a ` corp-speak ' response but no answer or even willingness to admit they have a bad shoe now . See update below : Recently , a friend of mine bought the Adidas Men 's Calissage , with the clear nubs , and they have not lost any nubs in over three months . They seem to be about the same as this version , just better made nubs . I would recommend going with the Calissage ... if you can find it in your size . I checked on Amazon and they were out of many sizes .
 I have only had mine for just over 3 weeks , and already the nubs are falling out like crazy . They 're all over the house . Very poor quality . Adidas has gone downhill .
 These are very low quality sandals . I got these a couple of months back . The nobs started shedding immediately and now has several patches at all the places that matter . I have used this type of sandals previously and they lasted me several years . These sandals do n't have the same quality . Most certainly not worth the price .
 As another reviewer reported , I had an older pair of these sandals that worked well for years , until the strap broke off . On the newer version , the nubs started breaking off immediately , quickly leading to large nubless patches under the forefoot and toes . They do provide great relief of muscle stress and soreness while they last . At first , the nubs become painful after about 20 minutes of wear - but they become more comfortable as the foot gets used to them .
 Because I have been robbed and assaulted.First off , the quality is terrible . Like others , the nubs started popping off nearly from day one . I own a lot of adidas products and this is by far the worst I 've ever purchased . Thanks for stealing my money.Second , my feet have never felt worse . The soles of my feet feel like they 've been stabbed to death to the point that I had to ice my feet to feel better . I bought these in hopes of `` massaging '' my feet after running , as I was led to believe by the product name . Instead ... OUCH.I 'd like to note that I am an average size guy . No one -LRB- well , in America at least -RRB- would refer to me as fat or obese . My doctor whines at me to drop some weight , but I 'm not heavy enough for these sandals to be falling apart and causing severe pain . I should have gone with the Callissage as I had those before , however I found the `` massage '' effect of those to be nonexistent .
 Very comfortable , feet love the massage from the nubs . Quality has gone south . The massaging nubs break off at an unreasonable rate . Be prepared to buy replacements often once you get addicted to these .
 We liked the idea of these massaging sandals . However , they are poorly designed because the tiny massaging pegs came loose and broke off not long after we started using them . My wife and I are not overweight people -LRB- athletic build -RRB- and only use these sandals around the house -LRB- not for hight impact activities -RRB- . We were both very disappointed with this product from a name brand company like Adidas . We would not recommend this product for anyone since they begin breaking so soon .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .

 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .

 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 they are very shiney and but not very comfortable at all and the arch is funny
 I do n't know if it 's my nine year old grandson who lives with me or just a gliche with this pair of shoes . I purchased this shoe six or seven months ago for school purposes and the toes lasted 2 months . I gave it one more try but this time they lasted 6 weeks . I decided to pay for a more expensive boot because the cheap ones did n't last very long so I figured more money , longer lasting . I ca n't recomend these boots . Not after purchasing two pair.Twice poor Gramma from Murphys .
 hey am not satisfied with order i order a big kid size for my son and when i receive it , it was way to small it was for my son who is 10 year , s old i have to go get him one more pair

 I ordered these bowling shoes and when I received them they were not what I expected , they were to small . I called the company got a return authorization , returned the shoes over a month ago and still have not received my refund .
 Ok , I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother . I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color . I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes . Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones , The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2 . WTF ? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time . Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift . The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA .
 A few years back -LRB- though it seems like forever ago -RRB- , I was in graduate school for anthropology . I was the studious type and had gone straight from college to grad school , so I 'd never had time for a girlfriend . Sure , I 'd had my dalliances , but when it came down to it my only sustained love was anthropology . It was Spring Break , and I 'd gotten a grant to travel to the Oaxaca region of Mexico and study the indigenous Zoque tribe . Figuring I 'd need a sturdy pair of sneakers and impressed with the rubber shell toe design , I ordered a pair of Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoes -LRB- White/Black -RRB- on Amazon . They arrived the morning of my flight.That day I flew to Mexico City and then took a bus to the city of Oaxaca , where I transferred to another bus to get to the base of Monte Alban . I then climbed Monte Alban to reach the peak , where I 'd read the Zoque tribe could be found . At this point I 'd been on my feet for nearly 16 hours , but I had nary a blister or even a foot ache to speak of . I was beginning to really like my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . But they were caked in dirt and I was getting tired , so I decided to take a break at the summit . As I was about to wash my sneakers in a puddle of water , I heard a rustling of leaves . I looked up and all of a sudden 10 Zoque warriors were surrounding me , spears drawn . I knew a few Zoque phrases from my studies , so I told them , `` Tuk ` ay Tum , '' -LRB- `` I am your friend '' -RRB- but perhaps my dialect was off because that only enraged the warriors more . Soon , the Zoque Chieftan had his spear within an inch of my throat . At that moment , I was certain I would die right there in my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs.But just then , a female hand grabbed the spear and threw it on the ground . I looked up , and standing in the golden sunlight was the most beautiful girl I 'd ever laid eyes on . Her tawny skin glistened like a lake on a cool summer night , her jet-black hair was so soft it made horses jealous , and her eyes were like two perfect almonds . `` I Almika , '' she said , gesturing toward herelf . `` I Dan , '' I timorously replied , awestruck by her beauty . `` Why joo here ? '' Almika asked innocently . `` Study , '' I answered . `` Joo study Zuque ? '' Almika continued . I nodded in the affirmative . At this , Almika 's eyes beamed with excitement . She said something in Zuque that made the warriors lower their spears.Relieved and relaxed , I strolled with Almika toward the Zuque encampment . Between her limited English , my limited Zuque and some hand gestures , we were able to communicate with one another . I learned that she enjoyed weaving and playing traditional Zuque songs on her ocarina , and more importantly that she was looking for a man but was having trouble finding one in her tribe . It was important to her that a man be brave and strong , as many men in her tribe were , but she also wanted a man who was cultured and could show her the world beyond Monte Alban . It was clear to her that I was worldly , but in order to win her heart I knew I 'd have to prove that I was brave and strong . So that night as I fell asleep on my straw bed in the encampment , my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs still caked in dirt , I resolved to show her that I was tough.I rose early and quickly learned that the Zuque men were setting out to fetch firewood . I waved to Almika and then followed them into the woods . Fortunately , I 'd had some experience gathering wood for the fireplace at my parents ' country house in Massachusetts . So I quickly noticed the dry pieces of wood , which impressed the Zuque men . When we returned to camp at midday , I had a haul of firewood in my hands as I espied Almika roasting a cob of maize over a tiny flame . `` Better fire '' I said , and threw some of my wood onto the fire . The sudden burst of flames frightened Almika and she dropped her maize on the ground . Without flinching , I picked it up and held it near the enlarged fire . When it was perfectly crisped , I proudly handed the cob of maize back to her . Beaming , Almika bit into the maize and exclaimed `` Ees tasty ! `` The rest of the afternoon was spent helping the Zuque men fix up one of the elders ' adobes . My repair skills honed on D-I-Y projects with my Dad at our country house in Massachusetts came in handy here . I impressed the Zuque men by patching up a small hole in the roof using some Trident chewing gum I 'd brought in my backpack . When we returned to camp at dusk , the men relayed tales of my handiwork to Almika , who smiled and locked her piercing brown eyes with mine . She walked toward me and we sat on two boulders around the fire during the communal tribe dinner of rattlesnake stew , flirting and laughing all the while.As dinner was winding down , I had my arm around Almika and was about to suggest we take things to an empty hut on the periphery of the encampment . But just then , we heard the shriek of a Zuque child . I looked over and racing toward us was a gigantic jaguar galloping at full speed . Instinctively , I grabbed a bow that was lying next to me and loaded it with an arrow . I 'd learned archery at day camp near my parents ' house in Massachusetts . My parents did n't want me to go because they thought the camp was run by a bunch of ne'er - do-well Hippies , but fortunately I convinced them to let me go . I pulled the bow string back , and released . It was so dark I could barely see what had happened . But then I heard the noise - first a whisper and then a full-on chant `` Dan ! Dan ! DAN ! DAN ! DAAAAN ! '' and when I looked closely , I saw that I 'd hit the jaguar squarely between the eyes ! Almika ran up to me and gave me a bear hug . I held her and just wanted to be with her , but jaguar blood was everywhere - on my arms , on my legs , and on my already dirt-caked Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .
 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 These are cute shoes but very uncomfortable . I have normal width feet but the front strapes and ring detail dig into your skin .
 For a shoe that had so much promise going in , I would definitely not recommend them . While they have a nice look to them , the sole wears out much quicker than it should . If you live in a city like I do -LRB- NYC -RRB- where walking everywhere is a way of life , please go in a different direction .
 I 've never reviewed an item on Amazon before and I just want to help someone else not make the mistake I made in buying these shoes . I bought them in August 2011 and really liked them - comfortable , looked great , easy on/off , etc. . After three months , in which I 'd estimate I wore them approximately 25 times , there is now a crack/hole in the left sole . I did n't notice this until today , the first day I wore them in the rain - my foot got soaked due to water coming in the sole . For $ 75 these should definitely have lasted longer than 3 months of not even every-other-day use . Too late to get a refund or anything so hopefully someone else reads this and avoids the same issue !
 One shoe was a dark colored brown that was properly packed , and the other shoe was lighter in color , and was scratched with no packing for arch support , its obvious I received the display model .
 I looked long and hard for a pair of substantial and rugged-looking slip-ons and found these Roper shoes . I normally wear a 7.5 M , but I had to return them for a size 8 . The first pair was too short and too tight , especially around the opening . It felt as if I had a rope around the ankles . The size 8 fit nicely , but the right foot was still a bit uncomfortable around the ankles , and I do n't have unusual or deformed feet . I think they 'll break in before long . These shoes are heavy like boots , handsome-looking , with textured leather . I like them alot even if the footbed can use more cushioning , but some low-profile shoe inserts will fix that . I suggest that if you have meaty feet -LRB- I have bony feet -RRB- that these are not for you because you 'll have trouble getting them on and your ankles will feel constricted even with the padded opening . Other than that , the shoes will stay on securely and not feel like they 're falling off when you 're in motion , which is important if you live in a big city and never know when you 'll need to run for it.Update
 I have been dissapointed in the place I was sent to order these shoes from did not get them and have not been able tofind what happened to the order .
 This is the second pair of White Mountain Sandals I have purchased and my last ! While I love the look , style and comfort of the sandal , it does not hold up . I purchased these sandals specifically for a one week vacation . During this one week trip the bottom , inside of the shoe loosened and began bunching up under my foot . Once it loosens there is no way to keep the material flat under your foot again and it becomes very uncomfortable . The first pair I purchased also did this but I thought it was a fluke and I tried a second pair . Great price but poor quality !
 When I saw these sandals on line I thought they looked similar to the pricierBirkenstocks.They were however not as comfortable and the uppers cut into my feet . In this case it was not ` you get what you paid ' because a few days later I happened to be in Walmart and got a pair of similar sandals by Faded Glory and they are ` glorious ` they were also on sale for the bargain price of $ 5 !! . I had to go back and buy all the colors they had .
 The area where the big toe has to fit its fabric height is to low that the big toe does not entry on the saldal
 These are not worth buying . They are flimsy and not at all like Birkenstocks which they seem to want to be .
 this bag is beautiful

 Awaiting a return slip . These shoes are a poor fit and are very uncomfortable - sorry
 Have worn Clarks for a long time because the last , are comfortable , and look great , but these are a disappointment -- have only had them two months and they are falling apart .
 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .

 I 've been wearing a size 12 for almost 30 years , so I ordered a size 12 , but could n't begin to get my toes in it . I have normal feet -LRB- no wide width shoes in my closet -RRB- . This shoe was incredibly cramped at the toes and loose at the heel . I boxed them back up and sent them back to Eastbay within an hour . I 'm now out $ 26.90 for shipping -LRB- to and fro -RRB- , and do n't even own a pair of shoes yet .

 I purchased these boots and they were very uncomfortable.The heels wore out after wearing only a handful of times . I would not recommend these .

 This is the third pair I have bought over the course of 5 + years . I order the brown/brown color.First pair was 5 stars , the next 4 stars . This one three stars
 I 've worn Timberlands of various kinds since the mid-1970s . They used to last seemingly forever , but a pair of boat shoes I bought in 2008 was worn through at the heels in a year , and my next pair was shot even worse after a few months , plus the inner soles decomposed in a matter of weeks . Both pairs , however , showed little wear on the upper leather , and the stitching remained intact . Unfortunately , excellent uppers on crummy soles still makes a crummy shoe . No more Timberlands for me .
 These shoes cost about $ 90 and Timberland can not even cough up the $ 2 to waterproof them . To add insult to injury , the footbeds are as thin as a piece of paper.One could buy Rockport , Nunn Bush , Florsheim , Deer Stags , etc. all for a lower price and all of them would be more comfortable and waterproofed !
 Fit is loose . Outer soul is very thin and flimsy . Looks cheap for this brand . I ended up buying a `` comparable '' shoe from Docker , that was much more comfortable , with far better looks and durability .
 This was my first time buying shoes online . I got the shoes + they were too big , I wore them about a day to see if I could get used to them , but I could n't because they were slipping off too much . I emailed Footsmart about this , informing them that I have wore them . They emailed me back saying go ahead and return them . So I paid for the postage + everything , but I did n't get the money back and they had the shoes for about a week now . So I contacted them again , now they are saying they ca n't give me a refund , because the shoes have been wored , but I stated that in the email . I ask for a supervisor to give me a call back -LRB- because the rep said she was n't able to help me with , that a supervisor would have to get involved -RRB- . That never happen , after me calling back four times , I demanded to speak to a supervisor , without having to wait . The supervisor pretty much told me that the email I had from them , saying that I could go a head and return them , was useless . That the rep that sent the email back to me , probably misunderstood me . I have it in writing that I can return them , so up the ladder we go . Be very careful ordering these shoes through .
 Keep in mind that :1 . I really like Geox shoes . I have a pair of Geox hiking boots that amazingly keep my feet dry despite the boot-ness of the shoe .2 . I meant for these shoes to be `` slip on at work '' so I can wear Crocs or sneakers to work , but still be business-professional at workOK - so the design of the shoe has two neoprene-like inserts that in theory should allow you to pull the back of the shoe straight backward in order to allow you to `` slip '' your foot into the shoe.In reality , the neoprene does not stretch far at all , and what you are left doing is a tug of war with a hold loop which is much too small for anyone 's finger in order to hopefully get the shoe on . I actually fell down out of my chair doing this for the very first time.The only solution is to take a pen -LRB- preferably a sturdy one , I would recommend a small metal bar without any sharp edges or ends -RRB- , loop the neoprene pull loop around the pen , thus giving you enough leverage to shove your foot into the shoe.I now understand the reason why this shoe is discounted on Amazon Outlet . If I had paid full price for this I would have brought it right back . Actually , I would have never purchased it in the store because I would have been aware of the effort required to put the shoes on.I hope the designers of this shoe have done a better job since this shoe was released . The two stars I 'm giving it are solely for the fact that the `` breathing '' does work in this shoe as well .

My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .
 there are nice shoes but , if you buy your correct size ... the back of your foot will hang off.the suede is decent quality and the rubber soles are VERY well made . . but , as the footbed is molded at the backif they do not fit the bottom of your foot exactly . . you will not be able to wear them .

 This is the third pair I have bought over the course of 5 + years . I order the brown/brown color.First pair was 5 stars , the next 4 stars . This one three stars
 I 've worn Timberlands of various kinds since the mid-1970s . They used to last seemingly forever , but a pair of boat shoes I bought in 2008 was worn through at the heels in a year , and my next pair was shot even worse after a few months , plus the inner soles decomposed in a matter of weeks . Both pairs , however , showed little wear on the upper leather , and the stitching remained intact . Unfortunately , excellent uppers on crummy soles still makes a crummy shoe . No more Timberlands for me .
 These shoes cost about $ 90 and Timberland can not even cough up the $ 2 to waterproof them . To add insult to injury , the footbeds are as thin as a piece of paper.One could buy Rockport , Nunn Bush , Florsheim , Deer Stags , etc. all for a lower price and all of them would be more comfortable and waterproofed !
 Fit is loose . Outer soul is very thin and flimsy . Looks cheap for this brand . I ended up buying a `` comparable '' shoe from Docker , that was much more comfortable , with far better looks and durability .
 This was my first time buying shoes online . I got the shoes + they were too big , I wore them about a day to see if I could get used to them , but I could n't because they were slipping off too much . I emailed Footsmart about this , informing them that I have wore them . They emailed me back saying go ahead and return them . So I paid for the postage + everything , but I did n't get the money back and they had the shoes for about a week now . So I contacted them again , now they are saying they ca n't give me a refund , because the shoes have been wored , but I stated that in the email . I ask for a supervisor to give me a call back -LRB- because the rep said she was n't able to help me with , that a supervisor would have to get involved -RRB- . That never happen , after me calling back four times , I demanded to speak to a supervisor , without having to wait . The supervisor pretty much told me that the email I had from them , saying that I could go a head and return them , was useless . That the rep that sent the email back to me , probably misunderstood me . I have it in writing that I can return them , so up the ladder we go . Be very careful ordering these shoes through .

 Cute as a bug . But the sole is so thin , so useless , like a sheet of plastic.walking on hard floors in these shoes made my feet sad . Seriously , it was like those cheap chinese mary jane slippers , as far as padding under the feet . For this much money , i think Tsubo should give a darn how they feel.I wo n't buy this brand again .
 These shoes run very small . I had an old pair that was a 39 and fit me perfectly , but this new pair of 39s was so small I had to return them .

 Was very disappointed in these shoes . They appear to be `` Distressed Leather '' which looks like crackle leather to me . They are not a bright bronze as pictured but muddy bronze . They need a better description for these shoes . If you like that look great . Would go with the type of clothing that looks worn - holes , rips etc. when new.Maybe for a teenager , not for me .
 Kill your feet , chew at your toes , feet slide out when you are walking . Not comfortable and wish I could send back , but just waited too long . : -LRB-

 First couple times wearing these sandals hurt like crazy . The support piece along the back strap cut the skin right at ankel level on both of my feet . I have since cut that piece off of the back and the sandals are now fine , but I would n't recommend buying a shoe you 're going to have to mutilate just to keep from injuring yourself .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 They are VERY cute but not at all comfortable . They are very hard and they hurt my feet !
 poor craftship when it came to the stitching . they look an feel good but , they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly .
 The picture shows a tan shoe . I have ordered this a second time and the two tone shoe arrives . It also arrived as a gift , but no way to ship it back . I see the color says tan/beige , but the color on the picture is only one color , beige.I need to return this item and would appreciate help in that process , as well as finding the correct Sperry.THank you so much , Sharon Ellis
 My son specifically wanted this style and we could not find it locally . Ordered and it was exactly as described !
 They have a wrong picture . If you click the shoes that looks like beige , in description , it says tan/beige . And now it looks like I have to charge for refund .
 The top-siders I received had frayed laces . The inside was not as soft and smooth as the last pair I purchased .
 The shoes are not genuine and are made of cheaper material . The toe of the shoe is separating after only wearing them twice
 Hello , I have purchased sperry billfish 3 eye shoes for the last ten years . I have not had a problem until my recent purchase at Peltz shoes . The shoes I received were defective beyond belief . I did get a refund with the help of Amazon.com
 The shoe is ok minus the fact that it started to fall apart after just several uses . Then planet shoes actually had the guts to tell me that it was from normal wear in tear . For a product that is supposedly high quality I would recommend just buying the shoes from the sperrys website that way you do n't have to deal with stupid companies that have terrible customer service . Worst customer service ever .
 I read great reviews and raves about these shoes . They are touted as the `` Original American '' boat shoe . When I take them out of the box the writing on the tongue says it all
 I ordered shoes for our aniversary for my husband , and those are all he wears , well they came and were blue with flat bottoms , not sperry billfish , so i had to return them and needless to say i was without aniversary gift for my husband , first time i have been disappointed with ordering online . . my husband loves the sperry 's and this type is all he will wear ... he wears them till they are pitiful and i make him get a new pair ...

 Despite the relatively low heel , this cute little number is uncomfortable for walking more than a few feet . Fine for sitting down and looking nice .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I am an Adidas lover but for I am very disappointed of this particular shoes . It leaves your foot still moistured and the shoes wear out really fast . Do not wear it if you run on wet surfaces because the clima cool texture allow the wet inside your feet will get soaked in no time . Additionally the shoes lack support .
 Well , I was very excited to get these shoes because I had seen them in the mall , and they looked super cute , but I had never tried them on . Now , I have big feet , a size 11 , but pretty much every pair of 11 's that I 've tried on/bought have always fit.Anyway , I decided to purchase these , because I needed a nice and simple black pump . When they came in the mail , I ripped through that box so quickly -LRB- I was really excited to get them -RRB- , and I think I spent a good couple minutes trying to cram my foot into this VERY narrow and tight shoe . I thought , `` It 's okay , they 'll stretch out . '' So I walked around the house in them for a bit.Two things I noticed :1 -RRB- The point of the toe is so long , that when you walk , the empty part of it actually bends , leaving a bit of a crease . It seemed like this crease would only get deeper and deeper , making the shoes much less attractive .2 -RRB- I went to walk on the carpet , and I slid around all over the place -LRB- just so you know , I have a LOT of experience walking in 3 , 4 , and even 5 inch heels/pumps -RRB- . It was very awkward , and something I have never had a shoe do before.And beyond all that , they just plain hurt . They felt like I was cramming them into a size 9 . I do n't think that they would have ever been comfortable , broken in or not.Sadly I ended up returning them . I really wanted to try to make it work , but for $ 67.00 , I had to LOVE them . They looked great online , but not on my feet .
 I love the look of these but they are very uncomfortable and run small . I ordered an 8 which usually fits but was tight in these shoes .
 These shoes came as a rec . from a friend who swears by them . As a girl who has to dress in business professional attire everyday for work I was excited to try these . I have not even had them for 2 weeks and the metal is already worn through the heel , mind you I am 5 ' 11 '' and thin . I have shoes from Target that are better made than these ! The heel looks chewed up and the bottoms are almost worn . I am not on my feet a whole lot so I ca n't see why these shoes would already be as worn as they are , except for being cheaply made . Other than that , the out side of them looks nice ... but if I could return them I would . Not impressed BCBG !
 I 've bought these heels several times the last time I bought them I was very dissapointed when I received them . They are not the same material feels different definitely not as soft as the ones I 've bought before like I said I 've both the same shoes before . It says they 're BCBG but I do n't know I 've bought them before and they do n't feel the same not as comfortable as before . Months after they are still in my closet -LRB- almost new -RRB- and now I find myself looking for them again . It is how I came across this review I had written . I 'm glad I recognized my renew since I wrote it before I actually got the heels thinking I would like them . I 'm definitely not buying them from here again .
 I have purchased many BCBG Katchen Shoes on line from Amazon . This is the 3rd pair of this shoe I have purchased in the last three years . I wear them as daily work shoe.Unfortunately , thie entire sole of this last pair came off within 3 weeks of wearing them . It was neither snowy or rainy . It was surprising as this shoe has always performed very well for me and BCBG is top quality . I wonder if Amazon had very old inventory in stock where the glue on the sole was separting.I was quite disappointed . But if you can get a normal quality pair , they are great . They look good and are very comfortable . I have never had an issue in the past and would still recommend them for women working in the office .
 Size ran large . Very disappointing . I had wanted it so much . Had to send it back . The two stars are for product quality only .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I have bought many Sesto Meucci shoes . These boots do not have the normal quality of Sesto Meucci shoe brand . I am very disappointed with the workmanship of these boots .
 While the Earth Lazer is a lite weight shoe and free of animal materials it has poor arch support . There is virtually no lateral arch support and there is no heel cup support . The negitive heel causes to much stretch for the foot and ankle . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone . I think the Birkenstock brand has a great deal more arch support for the entire foot and ankle and keeps the foot in a neutural position .
 I bought this when Amazon had it on sale for $ 29.40 . Seemed like a nice bag and for the price could be a steal . It reminded me a lot of the B. Makowsky Oxford Satchel -LRB- which I happen to already own -RRB- . When the package arrived and I looked at the bag , I was not impressed . While the design and style looks nice , the fake leather material looks like pleather and does n't feel good at all . In addition , the color is horrible as well . The bag looks cheaply made and is not worth buying . Sorry Amazon and Rampage , this bag is going back .

 I bought a pair of these boots last january . Around November the outside of my right foot totally blew out . They were very comfortable but did n't even last a year . If you want a pair of boots for show , these are great . If you want a pair to actually work in , look elsewhere .
 When I saw these sandals on line I thought they looked similar to the pricierBirkenstocks.They were however not as comfortable and the uppers cut into my feet . In this case it was not ` you get what you paid ' because a few days later I happened to be in Walmart and got a pair of similar sandals by Faded Glory and they are ` glorious ` they were also on sale for the bargain price of $ 5 !! . I had to go back and buy all the colors they had .
 This is the second pair of White Mountain Sandals I have purchased and my last ! While I love the look , style and comfort of the sandal , it does not hold up . I purchased these sandals specifically for a one week vacation . During this one week trip the bottom , inside of the shoe loosened and began bunching up under my foot . Once it loosens there is no way to keep the material flat under your foot again and it becomes very uncomfortable . The first pair I purchased also did this but I thought it was a fluke and I tried a second pair . Great price but poor quality !
 The area where the big toe has to fit its fabric height is to low that the big toe does not entry on the saldal
 These are not worth buying . They are flimsy and not at all like Birkenstocks which they seem to want to be .

 I was hesitant about buying running shoes w/o trying them on first or getting fitted , but these were true to size and oh so comfortable . You really can feel the difference . Their return policy -LRB- 60 days , used -RRB- also reassured me that if they did not work out , I was n't stuck with them . * UPDATE * I 've had the shoes for a few months now -LRB- well passed the 60 day return period -RRB- and the rubber at the bottom is starting to become unglued -LRB- towards the sides of the shoes -RRB- . I most definitely do n't run everyday so this is quite disappointing to see happen already . Substracting some stars ...

 Sanuk Poncho Flip Flops are about as durable as soft cheese . The canvas started rubbing off the sandal in less than a week and has accelerated its deterioration since . These sandals fall apart quickly . Sanuks are weak sandals . And do n't expect any help from Sanuk customer service . They want you to pay for shipping for an exchange . And what are you going to wear in the mean time ? Well , maybe some hard cheese strapped to your feet with twine . That might last longer .
 These were nice and comfy , except a little break in the surface kept irritating the bottom of my foot . When you peel off the part sticking up , then walk it rips more , and basically every time I wear these there 's a bump sticking into my right foot that is very irritating .
 Really wanted to like these flip-flops , as they are as comfortable as can be just standing in them . But the day after wearing for an extended period , the bottom of my foot hurt . After recovery , I tried again with the same result . No more for me - off they go to the thrift store.Also , due to the cushy foam layer , I would not recommend using near or in water - they act like a sponge and dry in about the same length of time . No fun walking around on a wet sponge ...
 when I purchased them , they were comfortable and thought I had made a good purchase but within two weeks the bottoms seperated and have rendered them unusable ... peeling from the toe back . . too bad . . so cost me 10 bucks a week to wear them
 These shoes are tremendously ugly . The online product looked so much better than the ones I received . I purchased the white patent leather and they came looking like yellowish and extremely cluncky and narrow . Maybe it looks better in the other colors , but it 's definitely a narrow short fit .

 These shoes are very tough and hurt my feet . I 'm sorry I bought them . A waste of money as I dont think I can wear them again.Sandra , Florida
 Shoe is cute , but after 1 wear they streched out so much that I ca n't wear them anymore . Consider ordering half a size smaller to make up for it .
 I loved the image on the screen when I ordered them and I was not disappointed when I received them , visually that is . they were more the size of and 11.5 than 13.5 that i ordered , and I blame this on quality control issues at over-seas manufacturing sites . But the question must be asked , `` why is it that when you buy a basketball sneaker of the same brand , the sizing is more than adequate , but horribly off in a soccer shoe ? '' I am a life - long fan of Adidas sneakers but found this item to be all flash and poor execution . If you are looking to purchase these online , I would either go an extra size up , or better yet , buy the original Sambas , which are still true to size .

 I bought size 9 M and they were too long for me , but I liked the quality and style , so I ordered another 8.5 M pair . However , they turned to be too narrow . Apparently , I had to buy 8.5 W or even 8 W , but I usually buy shoes of medium width , sometimes even narrow ones . I hope I will be able to stretch the second pair out .

 there are nice shoes but , if you buy your correct size ... the back of your foot will hang off.the suede is decent quality and the rubber soles are VERY well made . . but , as the footbed is molded at the backif they do not fit the bottom of your foot exactly . . you will not be able to wear them .

 these shoes are super cute , I 've seen them in the store and my size wasn ; t available , so I bought them on Amazon . I bought the green . They came and they are indeed a lovely fun shade of bright green but the texture is matte and unfinished . I put them on and they definitely run a half size small . I wore them all morning around the house with socks to stretch them a bit . The cut of the shoes is such that it is cut just a bit low , and right on the bunion joint . I don ; t have bunions or wide feet but this is a bit of painful squeeze . It did ease up with the socks stretching them , though . There is NO support in these whatsoever , I wouldn ; t walk around town in them , maybe just at work or somewhere I don ; t have to walk alot -LRB- and I live in Brooklyn and walk EVERYWHERE . -RRB- The WORST thing is - I did wear them out yesterday and it rained a bit and they got wet . THE GREEN RAN ALL OVER EVERYTHING , my feet are GREEN and sheer pink polish on my toes is GREEN , and I can ; t wash it off . I put the socks back on with them and now the socks are GREEN too . The only thing I can think to do is to rub them with an oil-based leather protectant , it 's going to turn the leather darker but so what , because now they are all water-spot-stained anyway.If I ca n't make them better , they 're going back to Amazon , because shoes that ca n't withstand one day of actual wearing should not exist , not at a price of $ 90 !!! Who knew I 'd have to treat them like glass slippers . Save your money . Pretty but TOTALLY non-functional .
 So I bought these right after x-mas waiting for spring to come . I finally wore them out today and they are made very poorly . Living in Seattle ... it rains and once these got wet they turned a funny color and started tearing tiny lines into whatever kind of material these are made out of . They are cute ... they run really small . If you live in a place where they wont get wet go for it , but I would n't buy these again . They get two stars just for looking nice on .

 After wearing Skechers Sport Men 's Drainz Slide for several months , I can say this , its a pretty decent footwear for wet sandy beaches . The traction is good thanks to its aggressive soles but I ca n't really recommended for day to day walking around . Much of this has to do with the drainage system of this slide . While its pretty good for draining away water and some sands , it also great for leaving imprints on bottom of your feet and when you slipped and slided as you will in footwear of this type , also great for creating red spots , sores and blisters as well . Carrying this pair of slide may not be a bad idea until you hit the beach but do understand that for a footwear of this type , this slide does weight quite a bit due to amount of rubber it uses in its construction.Overall , I am pretty sure that there are many footwears who can do a better job for your feet than this pair of slides . Drainage concepts appears to be a good idea but unless you got Hobbit 's feet , discomfort will probably outweight the concept in the long run .
 I have been using Sperry Top-siders for about 40 years , always size 9.5 . These shoes arrived , marking inside said 9.5 , but there was no chance they would fit . Too small ... return . Replaced them with a pair of Timberline shoes from Amazon size 9.5 , they arrived yesterday , them fit fine .
 I 've been wearing Sperry Top-Siders in 12 wide since the early 1980s , and for well over a decade in the color Sahara.Though I specified Sahara , and what arrived was labeled Sahara , these appear to be shipped mislabeled and are actually Oatmeal -LRB- from what I can tell by comparing to online colors -RRB- . They say Sahara on the box but are not.Worse still , though they say 12 wide , my last pair was roomy in width and just right in length . This pair is tight in length and tight in width , but worse still , the left one is MUCH tighter than the right , and though I tried breaking them in for two days to see if they would stretch , this only resulted in pain and my left foot swelling up.Are they making these in China now ? That would explain so much.These are not the Sperry Top-Siders we have all worn for decades . Something is seriously wrong when a company is suddenly shipping out mislabeled products -LRB- the wrong color shoes in a box labeled as being a different color , and that most likely are also mis-labeled in size at the factory before being boxed . That 's two major errors ? I will never buy these shoes online again with these kinds of quality control issues , and will instead give Sebago boat shoes a try , ending a 30 year run with Sperry .
 I was extremely unhappy even at first when I received the shoes and saw that the insole only extended to the mid point of the shoe . It reduced support and made the inside feel rough and not very comfortable . I wore them for a time over the summer and the sole on both has split in the mid point of the front . I had owned Topsiders from Sperry before and they lasted for years , dealing with salt water from my sailing and other activities.It will be a long time before I can be convinced to buy a Sperry product again . They have obviously totally taken quality out of the equation .
 Got shoes within 2 days the whole insole cracked . It 's like there extremely old and dry rotted . Will never buy sperrys through amazon again .
 Purchased shoes in late May 2010 . Did not wear them until mid 2011 . Left sole began delaminating from the shoe after 3-4 months of wear . Continued to use them and attempted to glue sole back with Shoe Goop -LRB- tm -RRB- . Did not work . Finally gave up and sent an email asking if poor quality stitching problem had been resolved since I would like to buy another pair . I have owned at least 15 pairs since 1975 and all of them have failed after 3-4 years of extremely hard wear and never once has the sole come apart . The leather usually cracks after repeated wet and dry cycles -LRB- over many years -RRB- . In other words normal wear . The latest pair very prematurely failed . Shipped them back to Sperry -LRB- at my expense -RRB- for evaluation . I do n't expect much .
 I have owned several pairs of the AO Sahara . This pair is much , much lighter in color than past purchases . I am not sure why it is not even close in color to others I have owned and those seen in stores .
 These shoes are very uncomfortable . I was extremely disappointed with what I thought would become a favorite shoe of mine . If support is what you need in footwear , search elsewhere .
 Disappointing is the word I 'd use to describe this purchase . I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old . They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft . Also , there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them . I 've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I 'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I 've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem .
 The Sperry shoes are fine , but be careful in that what Amazon shows -LRB- a reddish brown leather with white sole -RRB- is not the shoe that is actually sent as that one is a tan shoe with a brown sole . Got these for my son 's birthday and was disappointed that what I thought we ordered was n't what we actually got . Went back and double checked to make sure I did n't just select the wrong pair , and now see that the small thumbnail image does n't match the original product page .
 The wrong size shoes were in the correct box , box said size 11 which is what I ordered but the shoes inside are a size 13 and the seller has not got back in touch with me . Not very happy here and I paid alot of money for them .
 This shoes are not worth the price or the quality.Ive used them probably 5 months now and they seem to be breaking apart ... the shoelaces especially are most likely made out of chalk or something.Ive ordered other boat shoes from amazong without any problems at all and get complimented all the time!This just dont match up , Get another one . .
 The Sperry Top-Sider in Amaretto was a far darker color than the photo on Amazon . I did not try them on , and instead , returned it hassle-free and that went well . I chose a brown/brown replacement as it looked like my next best choice , but the size seems to run small . It 's an uncomfortable fit -LRB- I decided to tough it out and not do a second return -RRB- . My feet are not hard to fit as I have bought several pairs of shoes from other manufacturers on Amazon in this same size and they fit perfectly .
 The shoe I received must have been a second or a knockoff . Quality was not that of sperry . Very disappointing . Could not return it as my son left for college the next day and needed them .
 Ordered the Wide width expecting to shoe to be at least a bit wider than an average shoe . In fact , the shoe was so narrow through the ball of the foot , felt like my foot was being squeezed . Returning this shoe immediately . Also , did n't care for the brassy gold color of the shoe lace grommets ! Very disappointed !!

 The Sperry shoes are fine , but be careful in that what Amazon shows -LRB- a reddish brown leather with white sole -RRB- is not the shoe that is actually sent as that one is a tan shoe with a brown sole . Got these for my son 's birthday and was disappointed that what I thought we ordered was n't what we actually got . Went back and double checked to make sure I did n't just select the wrong pair , and now see that the small thumbnail image does n't match the original product page .
 This shoes are not worth the price or the quality.Ive used them probably 5 months now and they seem to be breaking apart ... the shoelaces especially are most likely made out of chalk or something.Ive ordered other boat shoes from amazong without any problems at all and get complimented all the time!This just dont match up , Get another one . .
 A pair of shoes arrived that did n't meet my color expectations -LRB- shoes were suede not brown leather -RRB- . I requested a return from the vendor and have been ignored to this point .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 The Sperry Top-Sider in Amaretto was a far darker color than the photo on Amazon . I did not try them on , and instead , returned it hassle-free and that went well . I chose a brown/brown replacement as it looked like my next best choice , but the size seems to run small . It 's an uncomfortable fit -LRB- I decided to tough it out and not do a second return -RRB- . My feet are not hard to fit as I have bought several pairs of shoes from other manufacturers on Amazon in this same size and they fit perfectly .
 The shoe I received must have been a second or a knockoff . Quality was not that of sperry . Very disappointing . Could not return it as my son left for college the next day and needed them .
 Ordered the Wide width expecting to shoe to be at least a bit wider than an average shoe . In fact , the shoe was so narrow through the ball of the foot , felt like my foot was being squeezed . Returning this shoe immediately . Also , did n't care for the brassy gold color of the shoe lace grommets ! Very disappointed !!
 These shoes are very uncomfortable . I was extremely disappointed with what I thought would become a favorite shoe of mine . If support is what you need in footwear , search elsewhere .
 Disappointing is the word I 'd use to describe this purchase . I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old . They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft . Also , there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them . I 've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I 'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I 've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem .
 I have owned several pairs of the AO Sahara . This pair is much , much lighter in color than past purchases . I am not sure why it is not even close in color to others I have owned and those seen in stores .

 The wrong size shoes were in the correct box , box said size 11 which is what I ordered but the shoes inside are a size 13 and the seller has not got back in touch with me . Not very happy here and I paid alot of money for them .

 I have been using Sperry Top-siders for about 40 years , always size 9.5 . These shoes arrived , marking inside said 9.5 , but there was no chance they would fit . Too small ... return . Replaced them with a pair of Timberline shoes from Amazon size 9.5 , they arrived yesterday , them fit fine .
 I 've been wearing Sperry Top-Siders in 12 wide since the early 1980s , and for well over a decade in the color Sahara.Though I specified Sahara , and what arrived was labeled Sahara , these appear to be shipped mislabeled and are actually Oatmeal -LRB- from what I can tell by comparing to online colors -RRB- . They say Sahara on the box but are not.Worse still , though they say 12 wide , my last pair was roomy in width and just right in length . This pair is tight in length and tight in width , but worse still , the left one is MUCH tighter than the right , and though I tried breaking them in for two days to see if they would stretch , this only resulted in pain and my left foot swelling up.Are they making these in China now ? That would explain so much.These are not the Sperry Top-Siders we have all worn for decades . Something is seriously wrong when a company is suddenly shipping out mislabeled products -LRB- the wrong color shoes in a box labeled as being a different color , and that most likely are also mis-labeled in size at the factory before being boxed . That 's two major errors ? I will never buy these shoes online again with these kinds of quality control issues , and will instead give Sebago boat shoes a try , ending a 30 year run with Sperry .
 I was extremely unhappy even at first when I received the shoes and saw that the insole only extended to the mid point of the shoe . It reduced support and made the inside feel rough and not very comfortable . I wore them for a time over the summer and the sole on both has split in the mid point of the front . I had owned Topsiders from Sperry before and they lasted for years , dealing with salt water from my sailing and other activities.It will be a long time before I can be convinced to buy a Sperry product again . They have obviously totally taken quality out of the equation .
 Got shoes within 2 days the whole insole cracked . It 's like there extremely old and dry rotted . Will never buy sperrys through amazon again .
 Purchased shoes in late May 2010 . Did not wear them until mid 2011 . Left sole began delaminating from the shoe after 3-4 months of wear . Continued to use them and attempted to glue sole back with Shoe Goop -LRB- tm -RRB- . Did not work . Finally gave up and sent an email asking if poor quality stitching problem had been resolved since I would like to buy another pair . I have owned at least 15 pairs since 1975 and all of them have failed after 3-4 years of extremely hard wear and never once has the sole come apart . The leather usually cracks after repeated wet and dry cycles -LRB- over many years -RRB- . In other words normal wear . The latest pair very prematurely failed . Shipped them back to Sperry -LRB- at my expense -RRB- for evaluation . I do n't expect much .
 These shoes are adorable but they absolutely do not stay on your foot if you are swimming or walking through deep water . It 's a pity because they are adorable .
 the water shoe is really comfortable but if your looking for protection this may not be the shoe for you . This shoe will not stay on your foot if your looking to kayak and find yourself swimming in some tuff current .
 So I bought these shoes for a white water rafting trip ... let 's just say once wet these guys just slip right off . . I lost one of them to the river . . would n't buy them again . . not very comfy either

 I bought these shoes because I loved the color and I enjoy Reebok clothing . These are awful shoes ! Playing basketball is literally impossible . These shoes also dig into your feet , and they hurt after awhile .

 these are soooo pretty and when i got them i was thrilled , until i tried them on.they are soooo high and have no ankle support . it was like wearing a pump that just had a sole and no sides to hug your foot.at first i thought maybe it was just too big , but the length was right and the width was normal for me ... they are just really high , which i do n't normally have issue with ... something just was n't right ...
 These boots , I guess , were not made to be worn everyday for work . After 2 1/2 weeks the footing inserts are falling apart and the leather is splitting . If you want tough work boots do n't buy these . These are made just to look good .
 More than a month later I have not yet had the pleasure of using this item . I ordered boots and received shoe . The return process was cumbersome and ineffective , till this date this issue had not been resolved . I have had to pay out of pocket in order to return this product .
 Awaiting a return slip . These shoes are a poor fit and are very uncomfortable - sorry
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 The Sperry Top-Sider in Amaretto was a far darker color than the photo on Amazon . I did not try them on , and instead , returned it hassle-free and that went well . I chose a brown/brown replacement as it looked like my next best choice , but the size seems to run small . It 's an uncomfortable fit -LRB- I decided to tough it out and not do a second return -RRB- . My feet are not hard to fit as I have bought several pairs of shoes from other manufacturers on Amazon in this same size and they fit perfectly .
 The shoe I received must have been a second or a knockoff . Quality was not that of sperry . Very disappointing . Could not return it as my son left for college the next day and needed them .
 Ordered the Wide width expecting to shoe to be at least a bit wider than an average shoe . In fact , the shoe was so narrow through the ball of the foot , felt like my foot was being squeezed . Returning this shoe immediately . Also , did n't care for the brassy gold color of the shoe lace grommets ! Very disappointed !!
 The wrong size shoes were in the correct box , box said size 11 which is what I ordered but the shoes inside are a size 13 and the seller has not got back in touch with me . Not very happy here and I paid alot of money for them .
 This shoes are not worth the price or the quality.Ive used them probably 5 months now and they seem to be breaking apart ... the shoelaces especially are most likely made out of chalk or something.Ive ordered other boat shoes from amazong without any problems at all and get complimented all the time!This just dont match up , Get another one . .
 A pair of shoes arrived that did n't meet my color expectations -LRB- shoes were suede not brown leather -RRB- . I requested a return from the vendor and have been ignored to this point .
 The Sperry shoes are fine , but be careful in that what Amazon shows -LRB- a reddish brown leather with white sole -RRB- is not the shoe that is actually sent as that one is a tan shoe with a brown sole . Got these for my son 's birthday and was disappointed that what I thought we ordered was n't what we actually got . Went back and double checked to make sure I did n't just select the wrong pair , and now see that the small thumbnail image does n't match the original product page .
 These shoes are very uncomfortable . I was extremely disappointed with what I thought would become a favorite shoe of mine . If support is what you need in footwear , search elsewhere .
 Disappointing is the word I 'd use to describe this purchase . I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old . They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft . Also , there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them . I 've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I 'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I 've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem .
 I have been using Sperry Top-siders for about 40 years , always size 9.5 . These shoes arrived , marking inside said 9.5 , but there was no chance they would fit . Too small ... return . Replaced them with a pair of Timberline shoes from Amazon size 9.5 , they arrived yesterday , them fit fine .
 I 've been wearing Sperry Top-Siders in 12 wide since the early 1980s , and for well over a decade in the color Sahara.Though I specified Sahara , and what arrived was labeled Sahara , these appear to be shipped mislabeled and are actually Oatmeal -LRB- from what I can tell by comparing to online colors -RRB- . They say Sahara on the box but are not.Worse still , though they say 12 wide , my last pair was roomy in width and just right in length . This pair is tight in length and tight in width , but worse still , the left one is MUCH tighter than the right , and though I tried breaking them in for two days to see if they would stretch , this only resulted in pain and my left foot swelling up.Are they making these in China now ? That would explain so much.These are not the Sperry Top-Siders we have all worn for decades . Something is seriously wrong when a company is suddenly shipping out mislabeled products -LRB- the wrong color shoes in a box labeled as being a different color , and that most likely are also mis-labeled in size at the factory before being boxed . That 's two major errors ? I will never buy these shoes online again with these kinds of quality control issues , and will instead give Sebago boat shoes a try , ending a 30 year run with Sperry .
 I was extremely unhappy even at first when I received the shoes and saw that the insole only extended to the mid point of the shoe . It reduced support and made the inside feel rough and not very comfortable . I wore them for a time over the summer and the sole on both has split in the mid point of the front . I had owned Topsiders from Sperry before and they lasted for years , dealing with salt water from my sailing and other activities.It will be a long time before I can be convinced to buy a Sperry product again . They have obviously totally taken quality out of the equation .
 Got shoes within 2 days the whole insole cracked . It 's like there extremely old and dry rotted . Will never buy sperrys through amazon again .
 Purchased shoes in late May 2010 . Did not wear them until mid 2011 . Left sole began delaminating from the shoe after 3-4 months of wear . Continued to use them and attempted to glue sole back with Shoe Goop -LRB- tm -RRB- . Did not work . Finally gave up and sent an email asking if poor quality stitching problem had been resolved since I would like to buy another pair . I have owned at least 15 pairs since 1975 and all of them have failed after 3-4 years of extremely hard wear and never once has the sole come apart . The leather usually cracks after repeated wet and dry cycles -LRB- over many years -RRB- . In other words normal wear . The latest pair very prematurely failed . Shipped them back to Sperry -LRB- at my expense -RRB- for evaluation . I do n't expect much .
 I have owned several pairs of the AO Sahara . This pair is much , much lighter in color than past purchases . I am not sure why it is not even close in color to others I have owned and those seen in stores .
 This is a hilarious piece of garbage . I ordered three of them ; one did n't work at all and one was reversed so your device lay face-down on the table . It is a nice idea but the Macally 30 Pion to USB 3D Adapter is designed and built better.Update
 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .
 I was gutted to find I was sent 1 bag instead of 4 I had ordered . Then was shocked to see I was charged $ 26 for postage on a $ 3.50 light as anything bag , and in comparison a large box of wooden hangers I 'd purchased elsewhere cost me $ 14 for delivery - ripped off : -LRB- I attempted to resolve this via Amazon and this company as I believe each to be at fault but no luck . I guess I will use paper bags for my bridesmaids in my wedding in March : -LRB-

 I 'm usually ok with most of the pain that comes with heels . This bends the foot to an awkward form . The hole in the middle just cuts into my foot . It 's pretty though ... !!!
 I hoped to solve the cold-foot problem of standing in Minneapolis waiting for the bus . I thought these boots were promising . They are fine in temperatures above freezing but when it gets down to 20 degrees F , they are not warm enough for bus travel . I think they 'd be sufficient if you were driving everywhere . Otherwise they are practical , comfortable and maintain their appearance .
 The boots fit well and are attractive but they are not waterproof . My feet do not get soaked , but in the front of the shoe -LRB- toe area -RRB- the boots allow water in and as a result , they leave my feet cold and damp . I now wear plastic bags over my socks to keep my feet dry when I wear these boots . Very disappointed .

 Daniel Green has such a wonderful reputation that I did NOT hesitate to purchase their Thong slipper -- Since I 'm a Type 1 diabetic , I must be very careful regarding the care of my feet -- the `` thong '' is too hard and hurts inbetween the toes . This is a huge disapointment to meI 've tried washing them several times and -- to date -- it has NOT gotten any softer.Bought a CHEAP pair of slipper thongs and the thong is made of a SOFT SOFT material that does NOT hurt inbetween the toes .
 I am disappointed with the quality.Pros
 I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style . The other color fits wonderfully but this pair , due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching . If your feet are medium , these may not be the shoe for you . It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched .
 I wear a standard 7 medium . These shoes were TOTALLY not a typical 7 medium . In fact , after 2 painful attempts to wear them in 1 year -LRB- hoping beyond hope that they would stretch some -RRB- , I gave them to my friend who wears a 6-6 .5 . She could barely wear them . Buyer beware !
 I bought these to wear to work for daily use and was very excited to get them on sale . They were very stiff when I initially took them out of the box to try them on . They have not loosened up at all in the three months I have had them . The push on the tendon above my heel and squeeze at the buckle . I wore band-aids to help with the blisters they caused , but it got to the point that I hated putting on my shoes to go out the door in the morning . I should have sent them back at the beginning when I felt how unyielding they were , but naively I thought they would adapt to being worn . Now , they sit in my closet , gathering dust .
 I received this shoe and was not pleased . The shoe was attractive but I will stop with that . The biggest issue I saw was that the right show was a 1/2 smaller than the left . To a point that when they were side by side your could tell they were n't the same size . The inside of the shoes showed that they were the same size.The heel of the shoe was too rounded and felt like I was balancing on a ball . I have never bought clarks before , heard great things about them , but will think twice before trying this overpriced shoe again.I will stick with Sofft !
 Ordered this product with high hopes . I was extremely disappointed . I ordered size 11 . The right moc was over a size 12 and long and narrow . The left moc must have been a size 9 or less and was extra wide . The left moc also had something that looked like spray paint or spray glue on the top of it . The left moc had an insole insert that was much larger than the moc and overlapped on to the heel part . Both mocs had tissue paper stuck to the the glue between the moc and the bottom of the insole . I returned the moccasins at a cost of almost $ 10.00 for shipping . I am shocked and disappointed in Minnetonka 's product and think Amazon does a disservice by offering this product . I would not recommended this product to ANYONE !!!
 The bottoms on thes mocs are not of a good quality material . After only 2 months they started to rip away from the leather . I had the other driving mocs from Minnetoka and they lasted me for several years . I have been buying Minnetonka mocs for 20 years and I sorry to say that these mocs are the first ones that I have owned whose quality is a zero .
 these shoes are horrible ... the rubber pads push up on the front part of your foot putting it at an unnatural angle ... I wore them for 4 hours & my feet hurt & continued to hurt for 3 days ... it was a complete waste of my $ 60 ... I usually do n't give my opinion about products but maybe this will keep someone from wasting their money
 This mocs do not look like the image . These are sized way too big . The cowhide has a cheap house slipper look .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .
 I do not believe these boots were properly advertised . Not my idea of Wellingtons
 The shoes fit great and were very comfortable for about 2 weeks . Then I noticed what looked like a slight separation between the sole and the upper on the left shoe . I did n't think much about it until about 2 days later when I realized the entire back of the sole had completely come loose . So much for these sneakers.Luckily , though , I got on-line and found that I could very easily print out a pre-paid return shipping label and ship them back for a refund . No problem , I 'm just glad they fell apart when they did . No , I 'm not going to try for another pair , just a refund . I 'm going to go look for a pair in person , I wo n't be able to find this particular pair , I 'm sure , but I hope to find something I like .
 I have worn only Easy Spirit shoes for 20 years now , due to feet and back issues . I have never bought a pair I have n't liked . They are always comfortable and durable . These shoes do not even feel like Easy Spirit 's . They had no padding and cushioning in the bottom . I had to buy some insole inserts just so I could wear them . After less than 2 weeks , the rubber bottom started coming apart from the leather part of the shoe . Within another week , the heel is coming apart . So , 3 weeks into wearing them , they are falling apart . If these are `` real '' Easy Spirits , and I am not sure they are , they are the worst shoe they have ever made . DO N'T BUY THEM -- YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED !
 I was excited when I bought these shoes -- I have a very narrow foot and was happy to finally find narrow walking shoes . However , my excitement quickly turned to dismay
 I bought this shoe 3 months ago . It is already falling apart !! The rubber sole is torn off to the middle of the shoe and the sole near the toes is also pulling off . I thought Easyspirit shoes had good arch support , that 's why I bought them , but the arch support is n't very good . I am returning them and wo n't buy another pair . Now , I ca n't say that I 'll buy anything from easyspirit !!!
 I have been wearing Easy Spirit shoes since the early 90 's and this is the worst pair of shoes I 've ever had . They have no support , I can feel every rock or twig that I step on . I will look for another name brand in the future .
 I bought 2 pair of Easy Spirit Walking Shoes over the internet . I have a very narrow foot so I have a hard time finding shoes . This shoe is attractive but supplies very little support if you are a serious walker and have trouble with you feet . Both shoes are setting in the closet not being used .
 I just love these shoes , but there has to be a design flaw with the heels because I have purchased several pairs and the heels always crack in the same place . I do n't know how to solve this problem because I just love the way the shoe fits my feet !
 Looks like what your well dressed fashionista witch would wear on her feet . A very long , very pointy toe makes the shoe look like it belongs to a costume found at your local I-party store.It was marked down for a reason-be afraid , be very afraid !
 Do n't waste your money , no matter how little . I ordered 2 pairs , paid almost more on shipping . I was looking for something comfortable to wear indoors , nothing fancy ; I am very partial to straw bottoms . When they arrived , the thongs were plastic and they caused pain between my toes . I had to send them right back . I paid more and purchased a better-made straw flip-flops .
 I bought this hoping that it would be a comfortable pair of shoes . Yes they are comfortable but not as comfortable as my generic 20 dollar skater shoes . Quality product no doubt and it is stylish too but not worth my money . If you have spare dollars to waste buy this . 63 dollars for this is ridicilous ...

 I completely agree with the other reviewer . This bag is massive . It looks nice in the picture - but no - it 's huge . I decided to test it out and put my laptop in it - the bag was so big my 15 '' laptop moved from side to side and up and down . I went to Target - found a lovely , smaller , tote bag for $ 25 - padded just as well as this one and holds my laptop better in place . Remember too if you 're someone that does carry a lot of things this bag only has three compartments so you can not use that extra space to a great benefit .
 As the other reviewer said , it 's a very elegant shoes , i love its design , but it 's very uncomfortable , the manufacturer stated `` lightly paded for comfort '' gim me a break . i cant stand wearing it for any special occasions , 1 hour and my toes hurt because of the ultra tight strings . trust me it looks nice , but maybe you should go look for a more comfortable shoes !
 I love stilletos ! But these were so uncomfortable and awkward !! Ive been walking in heels since I was 8 but maybe these were to cheaply made for my feet because they were not comfy
 These shoes are terrible ! First , my feet are black ... They have literally turned my feet BLACK ! On top of that , the hard piece material that goes up the back of my leg not only has scraped the skin off of the back of my leg , it makes it almost impossible to bend my ankle . My advise is to spend a little extra on a pair of shoes that are n't trash .
 The shoes are really cute , but the first time I wore them the little peg on the heal fell off before I got out the house . : o -LRB-
 poor craftship when it came to the stitching . they look an feel good but , they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly .
 The picture shows a tan shoe . I have ordered this a second time and the two tone shoe arrives . It also arrived as a gift , but no way to ship it back . I see the color says tan/beige , but the color on the picture is only one color , beige.I need to return this item and would appreciate help in that process , as well as finding the correct Sperry.THank you so much , Sharon Ellis
 My son specifically wanted this style and we could not find it locally . Ordered and it was exactly as described !
 They have a wrong picture . If you click the shoes that looks like beige , in description , it says tan/beige . And now it looks like I have to charge for refund .
 The top-siders I received had frayed laces . The inside was not as soft and smooth as the last pair I purchased .
 The shoes are not genuine and are made of cheaper material . The toe of the shoe is separating after only wearing them twice
 Hello , I have purchased sperry billfish 3 eye shoes for the last ten years . I have not had a problem until my recent purchase at Peltz shoes . The shoes I received were defective beyond belief . I did get a refund with the help of Amazon.com
 The shoe is ok minus the fact that it started to fall apart after just several uses . Then planet shoes actually had the guts to tell me that it was from normal wear in tear . For a product that is supposedly high quality I would recommend just buying the shoes from the sperrys website that way you do n't have to deal with stupid companies that have terrible customer service . Worst customer service ever .
 I read great reviews and raves about these shoes . They are touted as the `` Original American '' boat shoe . When I take them out of the box the writing on the tongue says it all
 I ordered shoes for our aniversary for my husband , and those are all he wears , well they came and were blue with flat bottoms , not sperry billfish , so i had to return them and needless to say i was without aniversary gift for my husband , first time i have been disappointed with ordering online . . my husband loves the sperry 's and this type is all he will wear ... he wears them till they are pitiful and i make him get a new pair ...
 I got these shoes from some other website , not amazon.Let 's say , they are super uncomfortable!I decided to return them after wearing for 10 minuts ... BAD ! BAD ! BAD !
 terrible friction against lower achilles tendons ! the shoes do not seem to be ergonomically designed . or at least i do n't recommend wearing it sockless .
 Item looks nothing like picture and it hurts the heels of my feet as well as the back of my foot .
 These shoes dig into your lower Achilles tendon whether or not you 're wearing socks . Very uncomfortable . I ca n't even wear them .
 This was my original review with `` 4 stars '' : I like these boots . I had checked other websites and decided this was a better deal . I was not pleased with the packaging of the boots . It was shipped as if you were at a shoe store and many had already tried them on . I also ordered one size down from my regular size and yet the boots were still too big . Have to wear socks otherwise they flop on my feet . *** EDITED *** -LRB- 10-28-09 -RRB- I have only worn these UGG boots about 3 times since purchasing in December 2008 . I got this pair out of the original box -LRB- stuffed & wrapped properly -RRB- and decided to treat the suede today . I had purchased a great protectant/treatment spray . The other UGGS boots I treated were purchased from UGGS official website and another pair from a high-end department store . I had no problem with brushing the nap of the suede and applying the spray on these boots . BUT ... the one pair I purchased from this seller ... the nap started shedding -- awfully ! I know these are NOT AUTHENTIC REAL UGGS BOOTS .
 The picture shows a tan shoe . I have ordered this a second time and the two tone shoe arrives . It also arrived as a gift , but no way to ship it back . I see the color says tan/beige , but the color on the picture is only one color , beige.I need to return this item and would appreciate help in that process , as well as finding the correct Sperry.THank you so much , Sharon Ellis
 My son specifically wanted this style and we could not find it locally . Ordered and it was exactly as described !
 poor craftship when it came to the stitching . they look an feel good but , they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly .

 They have a wrong picture . If you click the shoes that looks like beige , in description , it says tan/beige . And now it looks like I have to charge for refund .
 The top-siders I received had frayed laces . The inside was not as soft and smooth as the last pair I purchased .
 The sole on these boot wore slick about a year after puchase . I love danner for the comfort I will get a black sole next time for durability .

 I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style . The other color fits wonderfully but this pair , due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching . If your feet are medium , these may not be the shoe for you . It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched .

 My son specifically wanted this style and we could not find it locally . Ordered and it was exactly as described !
 After reading all the good reviews on these slippers I went ahead and ordered a pair for my mother thinking she too would love them , unfortunately NO she did n't . We thought they would be soft and easy to walk on , but NO they 're not . The inside of the sole is alright , but the bottom sole to walk on is very hard , like a shoe.If you 're looking for a regular bathroom type slipper that 's flat and cushy , then do n't get these . It you want a heavy indoor/outdoor slipper-shoe , then these are good for you.Yep , my mother said these slippers were like walking on `` Clodhoppers ! '' They 're very heavy . So we 're returning them .
 I chose this style with the tabs with velcro because I thought they would accommodate any size of foot . However , the size was correct , but the tabs with the velcro were not long enough for my friend or me to keep the slipper on while walking . The tabs just barely reached to stay . My friend is heavy and her feet swell ; however , I 'm a small person . The slippers were the same on both of us .
 These slipper a soft and fuzzy but they do not hold my foot like the ones I replaced . . the top is so soft that my foot slides off sideways .
 I was so happy when I first put these slippers on - they were so comfortable . After one month they started to look really worn out and the material at the toe and heal started to get holes . Definitely not worth the money .
 I have narrow feet and find it impossible to find slippers that are n't too wide . Daniel Green makes narrow slippers , but they are so poorly constructed I sent both pairs back.I thought if I ordered these I could tighten up the velcro . Unfortunately , the sizing runs really big , so not only are they way too wide , they are way too long . I wo n't be ordering Acorn again unless they add narrow to their sizes.On the plus side , they are super soft and light weight . Hmmm ... . who do I know that Santa can give these to this Christmas ?
 Easy on , easy off and comfortable too ! Can wear outside or in and a great price to `` boot . '' No pun intended !
 Similarly to the other reviewer for these slippers , I , too , hear them all day . Except I found this a good reason to give them only one star insead of five . I mean , I 'd give them five stars if the crooks who broke into my house last week wore them and I awoke because of the loud noise these slippers made . Yea , that would get 'em a pretty hight rating . But as the bums who ransacked my pad did so while I slept soundly not 10 feet away , they get a low rating from me . The theives surely wore footwear of a better quality .
 I intend to send the two pairs of Stretchies shoes that I purchased from Foot Smart . The sizing is off for my foot size and these slipper colors bleed off on to my socks.I have only worn these shoes a few times and I am quite disappointed with this product . They do n't fit and are not very comfortable because they are simply too loose.Don ' t waste your money by purchasing Stretchie Slippers from Foot Smart .
 I bought these as a comfortable shoe ; one person wrote looks good with jeans . I thought I could wear them to airport , shopping , and dress down Fridays . They look like slippers though , and expensive for just slippers . And they 're huge so if you still decide to get them , order down a size . What was I thinking - that they would shrink ? If I had n't worn them , I would return them !
 I bought these shoes because of the stretchie fabric ; I chose the blue color . The very thin insole crinkled up at the toes and made the shoes uncomfortable . When I called the company , they did not have replacement insoles available and had no suggestions for making the shoes more comfortable . Also , the blue color got very dirty very quickly , and the shoes look terrible ; I would n't wear them anywhere now but at home . I would not recommend these shoes , as now they are both uncomfortable and dirty .

 The sole on these boot wore slick about a year after puchase . I love danner for the comfort I will get a black sole next time for durability .
 I bought these to take to Jamaica . I had read all the reviews and they sounded like a great pair of shoes.I put them on and in a few minutes of just standing my feet were hot . I could n't believe how hot my feet got just standing in one place . I walked back and forth across the room and my feet were cool as long as I was walking.The the footbed of the shoe was hard and slightly pebbley . After I took them off the bottom of my feet were tender.I was a little disappointed in them . Since the shoes were not cheap I decided to return them.That same day I ordered a pair of Teva Omnium shoes . The Tevas arrived a few days latter and I love them.My recommendation is pass on these shoes and for about the same money buy a pair of Tevas .
 I returned the pair I bought - Sizes run way smaller than normal - You are best to try them on for sizing in a regular walk-in store first
 I bough these as a gift , but was surprised when the recipient mentioned an uncomfortable lump in the sole of the left shoe . This is something I might expect in the $ 15 Wal-mart shoe , but not in this shoe which retails for $ 95 .
 Keen Newport SandalMy first Keen sandals lasted years . I actually wore the heels out of the soles through many years of wear . My newest Keens , bought in march 2011 , suffer stitching failures on both sides of the ankle , both sandals , where the back ankle strap attaches underneath the logo flap on the sides of the ankle . Sadly , as both sandals failed in the same area , this is a quality issue . These sandals have proven to be not worth the cost . I will ask Keen to replace them and if they do , I will be satisfied . if they do not , I will not shell out this amount of money for a sandal that does not last five months .
 They were my size in length , but so short in height at toes , that they smashed my toes and they were very heavy for a sport shoes . I bought Sperrys and love them .
 I 've owned these sandals for a couple of years now . They may be an excellent dry-hiker sandal but they are not good in mixed environments.I have found that the soles of these sandals become an almost frictionless surface on moist rocks , stairs , etc. . I took a bad fall in a tidal pool in Costa Rica two years ago and almost lost it on some wet stairs next to a swimming pool in Rio this year . I know , it takes me some time to learn a lesson . Thus , if your intending to get these for water/boating shoes , you need to look for something with a Vibram sole or some soft material , not these !
 I bought a pair of these exact same shoes -LRB- size 10 -RRB- 2 years ago . They lasted two whole years and are still very wearable . I 've just worn the tread off.I ordered a new pair with great confidence , and waited for delivery . That is where the pros end . The pair I received in the mail were MUCH MUCH smaller , AND two different sizes ! The left one did fit , very tightly , but I figured it was because they were new . The right one did not fit at all . I compared them to each other and the two shoes were different sizes . They were both marked US size 10 . I then compared them to the old ones that were considerably larger and also marked US size 10 . My old ones were also marked as made in the U.S.A. and the new ones were from china.I called a friend that had also recently bought a pair of Keen shoes from REI.com . They were two small for him as well , and he said one was smaller than the other ... Keen , what has happened ? You went from AWESOME to LAME in two years ? I will not be buying anymore Keen products anytime soon . I have returned these shoes to amazon , and can not review these as positive in any way .
 My H2s were very good on a Grand Canyon river trip a couple of years ago that included maybe 20 miles of hiking and a fair amount of stressing of the shoe . At day 9 the stitching began to loosen . Fortunately , that was at the end of the trip . I did n't consider repairing them myself ; it was pretty clear stitching all over the shoe was loosening . I got a refund and would need confirmation that the manufacture of Keens had changed and improved before buying any more of them .
 The last pairs of Keen sandals I bought , for my wife and me , were thoroughly appreciated as to durabilty and comfort , but said to say , the ones we ordered this time were inferior in every respect . The sizes were marked the same , unfortunately they appeared to be meant for children . The material was overly lightweight and strange , definetly unlike the ones we had bought originally , which were made in the USA.Yours truly , Dennis Mora
 I 'm in the process of returning the second pair . The stitching pulled out in exactly the same place on both pairs . The first pair made it 25 days . The second did n't make it 2 weeks . Completely out performed by a pair of Walmart Earthshoes . Beyond that they collect any loose material under the toes . Walk through a field of grass in seed and after 2 steps they 're full .
 i purchased the Keen Newport H2 and within the first 2 weeks of use the stitching started unraveling through out the sandal-i contacted Keen directly and they chose to insult me because i mispelled a word in my response to them.If you research Keen -LRB- Google
 I bought these shoes for a Grand Canyon River Trip . I liked the comfortable footbed , the rubber cap over the toe , and the siped soles . I broke them in on a 3 day San Juan River trip , and they were fine . They gave good traction on wet rocks and worked well for a 2 mile hike.Then I took them on a 16 day Grand Canyon Trip . After a few days , the shoes stretched and I had to pull the shock cords tighter and tighter to get them to hold my feet . The loose ends of the shock cords dangled so long I sometimes tripped on them.The real kicker came on Day 10 . The stitching that connects the straps around the ankle came out . There was no reason for it , the thread was not worn or abraded . It looked like the stitches just pulled through . I noticed it on one side of one shoe a stitched it back together . Then I looked at the other shoe and it was falling apart in the same spot , but on both sides of the ankle . The January 18 , 2011 review by Tom explains the problem perfectly.These shoes cost nearly $ 100 and lasted a total of about 15 days . The Keen web site says these shoes are designed for `` Hiking '' , but they are not dependable . I could have been 5 miles up a side canyon when the shoes failed.A companion had a $ 12 pair of Ozark Trail river sandals from Walmart , and they were still in great shape when the Keens fell apart.Keen and they absolutely refused to provide a refund , their warranty only offers to replace defective shoes . But I do n't trust their shoes anymore.DON ' T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE SHOES .
 These began to make my feet smell in the first week and have now begun to come unstitched . Did n't have this problem with the first pair I had for five or more years . Whatever corners they are cutting now make them a rip off .
 I am a great supporter of Keens . However this model is cut differently than the last two pair I bought and is not comfortable .
 I was n't to conviced but I was talk into getting them by my girl as she heard they were great shoes . I wore them for a week or two and loved them . Great sandle but then the stitching started to come apart . I 'll sew them up myself . Almost does n't pay to have to ship them off this time .
 I like the Keen concept , but they are cheaply built and unacceptable as a beach sandal . I have the black model and they have turned a dark purple . The sun or salt water may have caused the change . I wore them everyday during my Culebra vacation . The shoes are not sturdy enough to use on a gravel beach . When I hiked a rocky path , I had to be careful or I would twist my ankle . My companion wore Teva sandals they proved to be a better casual sandal .
 Three days after ordering this product , so I 'm not sure if the product is good or bad , but the vendor surely is something to be desired.Here it is 7 days since I 've ordered this item and the shipper has yet to give any idea when this will ship . Funny there was only 1 pair left when I ordered and something tells me that 2-3 weeks into waiting I 'll get an email they were out-of-stock .
 I ordered this pair of shoes for my husband 's birthday . He is a 10W so I ordered a size 10.5 thinking it would be plenty big . My son has a pair of Keen 's and they ran true to size . Well I was wrong . So I followed the instructions on the shipping label I got from Backcountry -LRB- an Amazon vendor -RRB- to exchange them for the next size up . Backcountry credited the return , but did not notify me that they received/processed the exchange . When I called to ask if the larger size was on the way , they said since it was purchased through Amazon they would not pay the shipping on the way back . So now I 'm out $ 12 for return shipping , no shoes , and very disappointed at the lack of coordination between Amazon and its vendors . I will not be ordering anything like this on Amazon again !
 I loved my Keen sandals , mostly due to nice fit , they were a little sweatty though . So much that I bought the shoes -LRB- very good -RRB- , bought the work boots -LRB- steel toed also very good -RRB- , bought the socks -LRB- not so good -RRB- . I do n't honestly wear the H2 sandals that much , maybe had them about a year -LRB- bought them last late summer/fall -RRB- , but live in the northeast so its mostly a summer shoe , 4 -5 months a year or so . So we went to Grand Tetons , these were my `` off hiking day '' shoes for the trip . We did a 6 mile flat hike and the backs ripped out of one of them . By the way the socks have holes in the sides -LRB- not heals or toes like you might expect -RRB- . Used to be all their products seemed to have 5 star ratings ... me thinks the expansion to all kinds of shoes may be causing some kind of performance issues.So not much use , the treads on the bottom frankly look brand new but the heels ripped . I dunno if I will get another Keen shoe , I am seeing some of their newer stuff has some bad ratings . Still I 'd take them over almost anything Teva , but not at full price . I guess I would take another shot for $ 50 or $ 60 ... but for $ 100 they need to last more than a season .
 I bought these shoes for a 2 week hiking vacation in Utah . I only wore these shoes during the trip . I was happy with the comfort of the shoe however the quality was subpar . Also at the end of the day my feet really smelled bad . I felt that with sandals my feet would get enough air to breath unlike full on hiking boots . At the conclusion of the trip the stitching on the back strap of the shoes had come undone and was very loose . Not something I would expect for a shoe in this price range . I was pretty happy walking through water in these shoes . They never came off and the grip on the bottom held up pretty well .
 Great concept , but poor quality . Tore apart at the seems after one use ; a moderate 8 mile hike in the woods . These would be such a better product had they had better craftsmanship . Definitely not worth $ 100 if you plan on doing any actual hiking with them .
 First off these sandals are insanely comfortable and wonderfully versatile . By the look of them you 'd think they were well made and rugged ... and the soles are , the upper however is not.The nylon webbing that looks as though it crosses at the ankle to provide strength actually stops just under the fake suede and spandex and is only held on by those 2 rows of thread . Because of this my pair lasted less than a week of mixed use on a boat and on land walking 5 miles at most before the heal webbing tore off.If the webbing actually met and crossed in the ankle they 'd be perfect , unfortunately they chose not to do that . I 'd call this a design flaw but it was clearly done on purpose though I ca n't imagine saving 1 inch of nylon webbing would make or break the cost of the Sandals.At least the return policy is great , there was absolutely no problem getting my money back , customer service was wonderful .
 This past summer , while wearing ` open toed ' water sandals , I accidentally pulled off the nail of my big toe while wading my kayak out of some shallow rapids just above Cochran Shoals on an urban stretch of Atlanta 's Chattahoochee River . Several of the other paddlers regularly wore Keen shoes and highly recommended them . So , although expensive , I took the plunge and purchased a pair.On the first pair I ordered and received at the end of August 2012 , one of the pull loops above the instep was only sewn on the bottom of the loop , not the top . I returned those and promptly received a new pair . Since then , I 've worn the replacement pair 6 or 7 times paddling other sections of the Chattahoochee River , basically getting in and out of the kayak at the put-in and take-out , as well as casual wear at home and around town 3 to 4 times a week for the past 3 1/2 months . They 're very comfortable and I really like the support and , of course , the toe protection.However , yesterday while eating lunch , I noticed the stitching on the left shoe was loose and pulled out where the outside foot-bed tab meets the back ankle strap just below the ankle.These expensive shoes -LRB- $ 104.95 including original shipping -RRB- have not seen any strenuous use like hiking or extensive creek walking , etc. . Given the first pair had a manufacturing defect right out the box , and this second pair starts falling apart in less than 4 months of casual use , while comfortable and great while they lasted , I recommend you find an alternative manufacturer 's product.Because Amazon 's full refund return date has expired , I 'm out the $ 104.95 , I 'm unsatisfied with Keen 's products , and now I need to find and purchase a replacement product in time for our traditional New Year 's Day paddling trip .
 I bought these to go canyoneering and hiking . My Teva 's did n't have toe protection and the font of my foot would pop out.The sandals fit a bit tight at first and have become more comfortable as I wear them . I have a wide foot and these fit great for wide feet . They do n't dry as quickly as I had hoped . They do n't grip wet rocks as well as I had hoped either.These have become my go to sandals for outdoor activities.New Comments 2.22.11 The seams tear out easily . I wish KEEN had a better warranty .
 I 've had these sandals for about a year . My brother swears by them and is on his second pair . First , they are very comfortable , and you forget you have them on . I like the closed toe design , which helps keep stones and sticks from getting in under your feet . That said , I will never buy another pair of these . Why ? They smell more than any other sandal I 've worn . I 'm 60 + and have had my share of sandals . These are the worst regarding smell . On a recent road trip w / my wife and brother , if one of us took our Keens off in the car , the windows went down and complaints went up ! We laughed about it , but it was irritating nonetheless . Sure , washing them helps , for awhile . Depending on how often you wear them , you may need to wash them weekly . The ` anti-microbial ' treatment of the sole is a laugh . I 've had Merrell 's that have never had this problem . And my leather-insoled sandals never smell . I 've read so many other complaints about the smell of these sandals , that I know it is a problem . And I do n't think we need to hear about washing/powdering our feet as a solution . The solution for me is to look for a different brand of sandals .
 Nice sandal . But buyer be aware . These run ridiculously small . I 'm on the small size of a 10 and could n't even get my foot into the sandal . Took a size 11-1/2 for a decent fit . Before you buy try a pair on at a local merchant for correct sizing . Amazon 's prices are low for this product but these Keen 's run at least one size smaller than labeled .
 I bought this Sandals for the sole purpose of kayaking which i do n't do that often , the soles are not even starting to show any use and the sewing is coming a part in 4 places , I 've probably used this sandals 20 to 30 times not more .
 poor quality . not like prior keen items i have wornwrong colorreturned.lalalalal la la la la la la
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...
 The sole on these boot wore slick about a year after puchase . I love danner for the comfort I will get a black sole next time for durability .

 Shame on me twice for getting a shoe that has a hard mid-foot . The first was recommended by a Footaction 's salesman for an Asics Gel shoe . He said I was flat-footed and need a pair of shoe with arch support or a mid-foot stiffener . After my first jog my arches were hurting me . I thought it was a new pair and needed to be worn in . Tried it a couple more times and it did n't get any better . So back to Nike 's Air Max.After great successes and comfort of Adidas MegaBounce and AS Trail , I shifted alliance with Nike to Adidas and decided to get the more cushioned Supernova 6 over the cheaper Orbed . For me with a flat foot and the left feet having the tendency to roll inward , this became extremely painful . More pain on the left , but not too much on the right foot . So I guessed it more of my physical makeup then just the shoe.The ShoeThe shoe itself is fairly awesome and extremely padded on the sides and cushioned in the front and rear foot . Again I do n't like the mid-foot Torque system . I have likened the wider foot design of Adidas and Asics over the narrower Nike design ; typically I had to buy a one size longer for Nike shoe . The upper mesh is one of the best ventilated materials out there . Plus the looks of Adidas shoe design are more pleasing in my eyes then the extravagant Nike 's deigns . I can still use this shoe for walking , because it is quite comfortable like what I did with the other Asics Gel.Just not for my feet .

 I have had these for a while now , and I have yet to wear them . I figured I 'd post a review in case anyone found them , liked them , and decided to look for them on another site . Definitely not recommended .
 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .
 I had to send them back 2 times because the sizing is n't correct . I had a pair preaviously that were the same size and fit fine . I is like these were made in China .
 two months on foredeck they were sliding all over the foredeck.sailing shoes they are not.they sit in the cupboard but may use for walking the dog

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 That this was a man made material boot or I would of passed ! Very comfortabke for work though but that is about it
 Nine West Shoes usually fit me very well but these boots just did n't look right on my feet . I sent them back .
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' .

 These will keep your feet dry but the box they came in would fit about as snuggly .
 These Duck boots are worthless . I ordered a size 11 , which the length was fine , but the width was almost big enough to put both feet in . You ca n't tell which is the right foot or the left foot . They seem to be made for either foot.I just feel I wasted my money . Glad they were not too expensive .
 A nice shoe for the price when I got them in July 2006 , But by November 2006 both shoes leak.I wear them 15 minutes per day to walk my dog and both shoes have splits in the upper portion that make them leak .
 I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style . The other color fits wonderfully but this pair , due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching . If your feet are medium , these may not be the shoe for you . It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched .

 Unless your feet are super wide , these boots DO NOT fit well . Initially , I ordered them in my regular size , which is 10 and they they were huge on my feet . I exchanged them for a size 9 and those were no better . The boots are made very wide and the ties do not help to keep them snug on your feet . When I walked with them my heels kept coming out of the shoes so I gave up trying to MAKE them fit . They are now sitting in my closet collecting dust . Next time I buy duck boots I 'll stick to LL Bean.Two thumbs down for these duck boots .

 I hoped to solve the cold-foot problem of standing in Minneapolis waiting for the bus . I thought these boots were promising . They are fine in temperatures above freezing but when it gets down to 20 degrees F , they are not warm enough for bus travel . I think they 'd be sufficient if you were driving everywhere . Otherwise they are practical , comfortable and maintain their appearance .
 The boots fit well and are attractive but they are not waterproof . My feet do not get soaked , but in the front of the shoe -LRB- toe area -RRB- the boots allow water in and as a result , they leave my feet cold and damp . I now wear plastic bags over my socks to keep my feet dry when I wear these boots . Very disappointed .

 In addition to this shoe , I ordered the Maris slide and both of them are just far too narrow in the straps -- the footbed is the right size and width but way too tight on the top . As a reference , usually my foot is slightly narrower than a medium width ! Cute shoe and great price but you just do n't know what you 're going to get .
 Based on previous experience , it 's a very good sandal.The pair I received , however , was mis-marked , i.e. , it was approximately1/2 inch longer than my existing Clarks sandal , also marked 7M . I wassorry to have to return the shoes , which had been tried on priorto shipping to me . The store should have known from that customer ` sreaction that the shoe was a larger size than marked .

 I have been wearing this style of Clark 's sandal for years . Am generally disappointed in Clark now since they seem to have abandoned most of their classics so was happy to see these offered on Amazon . However , the shoes I received are NOT the Clark 's I bought a year ago . These are sized differently and cut differently . Did n't look or feel like the Clark 's sandals I purchased last year . Then I noticed these sandals are `` Made in China . '' In the past they were made in England . The final irony is that the name is now `` Clark 's of England '' whereas before it was just Clark 's .
 These shoes are so soft . They would have been perfect for me , except that the size 10 I ordered was more like a size 8 . Since I am not living in the US , I was unable to return them . I was truly disappointed .

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes

 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .
 First off its Not attractive looking . and it feels stiff and bulky and FLAT . Arch support really ? I do n't feel it at all.It hurt my foot after I wore it a little in the house -LRB- did n't even walk around whole much -RRB- . Very uncomfortable . Ca n't believe the price !!! If this is what Reef offers for all other sandals and it 's considered one of the best ones they have , I say REEF SUCKS .
 These are really nice looking flips . . would give five stars for looks but they are very loose . I only wore once so I do n't know if they will stretch out or wear well . You would need to have a very large , round foot or I received an anomaly .
 They looked good on paper , but when I received them I noticed that the white parts had a shimmer to them , which was n't what I was looking for . Also ordered an 8 , but needed a 9 .
 Are the sizes mis-marked ??? I 've never tried on a pair of shoes that ran this small before!I wear a size 5.5 M , purchased up a size to 6M , and they run very , very short . My heel was at the very tip of the edge which is incredibly uncomfortable!Usually size sixes are a little large on me no matter the brand , but I make due . These sandals are cut incredibly short in the foot length , and have lots of extra room in the band across the foot . Even if they fit me in length they 'd be flipping on flopping right off my foot , they are so wide ! They are kind of cute on , but do n't even come close to fitting ! The shoe is a whopping 4 '' wide!If you have a medium width foot , and wear the same sizes all the time , I say run away from these shoes . They will not fit ! I will tell you that it 's kind of a hassle sending back for a refund . I had to actually call Amazon Customer Service , as the online auto return said I had to pay for return shipping out of pocket ! I called them , and they made everything right by emailing me a return label . Free shipping is n't free if you are out for returns ! And these shoes must be mis-marked ... Buyer beware !
 The wrong color was sent to the house . The picture showed one thing but that sure wasnt what we got . they seller blamed amazon . im not sure who is actually responsible .
 For years I have worn Reef sandals on the recommendation of my foot doctor . These have always had a raised arch support . I assumed this was a feature of all Reef sandals . When they arrived and did not have this feature I sent them back and requested that the supplier send me a sandal that did . I specified that it could be any style and any color but at the same price , otherwise I requested a refund . I got the refund but was out $ 13.50 because of shipping costs both ways . Since the shoes cost less than $ 25 to begin with I felt this was a steep price to pay . Wo n't make that mistake again .
 I love Reef flip flops . I bought this pair to replace a pair that I have nearly worn through . Just like my original pair these are incredibly comfortable . However they do run small . I normally wear an 8 1/2 or 9 . The 9s are a bit small for me , wish I 'd ordered up a size . The real problem with these is that they squeak when I walk ! Not right away but after a little while they start to make a definite and loud squeaking noise . It 's awkward and embarrassing and unfortunately I had to wear them all day so I wo n't be able to return them .
 I take a size 6.5 / 7 and the strap on this flip is just too tight . Using effort I can barely get the sandal on my foot , and you can see the pressure from the strap . At the same time I ordered this flip I ordered several Teva sandals with straps across the foot similarly placed and they fit just fine so I know my foot has not suddenly jumped up several sizes.Too lazy to return so will go to the GoodWill box . Will not buy this brand again .
 Ordered my size , but was too small to fit . Ended up giving it to my mother in law , who wears a size smaller than me.Seemed like comfortable sandals , but order a size bigger .
 The website said size 6 Mens , the shoes were actually size 6 Womens , and the return process was designed so that I could n't actually return them for shoes in the right size .
 Just do n't bother unless you 're standing still . The clear plastic mold on the pink heels is much too soft and easily malleable to wear longterm .

 So I have had other Pony shoes and they were decent but this one was made with cheap materials . It also ate up the back of my ankle when I would wear no show socks with them . F - for me .
 The title says it all . The shoes look cool , but are made cheaply . Their most bothersome aspect is that the mid soles are not rubber or some other type of material and are instead wrapped around with some sort of tape thing and sewn . crap .
 I 'm sure the boots are fine , but do n't buy from PapaShoe . They do n't ship the item and you will get the runaround when you contact them . I purchase alot of items from Amazon and have never had this much problem with one of their retailers . They should not be allowed to sell at Amazon.com .
 I had a set just like this . The glue that holds the sole/heel on failed . The 1 year warr is worthless . Rockey will not email you back or call you back . I wore my boots a total of 6 times over 10 months . Junk . Made in china junk . Save your hard earned money and get another brand .
 Most uncomfortable boot ever . Soles have no cushion deff not made for standing any length of time . inside finish is very hard at seam locations and VERY uncomfortable even when worn as loose as can get . I hope they -LRB- break in -RRB- some and are tolerable otherwise these will go in the trash . JUNK JUNK JUNK
 i had thee most worst experience with this purchase ! it was for a job that i was unable to do due to getting the wrong item i purchased . . which put me behind in bills since i was unable to work & no not a stripper job !! it was a concert event ! and wasent happy at the fact that i have to pay the shipping to return the item !! im basically paying for someone elses mistake !!! very unfair !! i dont think i will purchase through amazon again !
 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .
 Having read so many glowing reviews for Danner boots for so long , I concluded that they must be the best US-made boots money can buy and determined to try a few . Having done so , I feel I can safely conclude that my assessment was correct , but that is as far as it goes , as I can also safely conclude now that those who are enamored of Danner boots are the type who insist on buying US-made products in general . Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .

 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...

 I have owned several pair of Stacy Adams shoes and have been pleased with all of them until now . These particular shoes seemed cheaply put together and not made of a very good material . The shoes did not fit true to size in my opinion and I had to send them back because they were too small .
 The shoes had the following defects :1 . Dark stain on the front of the shoe ... supposed to be brand NEW ! 2 . Inside sole ripped ... . look like someone had already worn it3 . General maunfacture of the shoe was very POOR.Do not waste your money on this item .
 My daughter had a pair of these for over a year . When she outgrew them , we ordered another pair . The sole on one slipper ripped after < 10 uses , so I returned the latest pair . I would 've given this one star , but the first pair was just fine .
 I 'm very disappointed with these slippers . After a few weeks of wear , they fell apart . We have the `` puppy '' slippers as well from the same company and they did the same thing . It 's too bad because they were very cute .
 These shoes appear to be yellowing - literally yellowing - on the shelves in stores all over New York City . I do n't know what they made the white part of the soles from , but they should consider changing it because it actually turns yellow with age like the plastic on an old computer , except apparently much much faster.I ca n't speak to their comfort , however , because Amazon/FootLocker sent the wrong size , so I had to return them to a FootLocker that had stopped carrying them .

Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .

 The leather and warmth on these boots are awesome comfortable nice boots but the sole wore out and fell off in one month . I called the company . They told me nothing they could do about it and to return them to the place I bought them . I thought I would have these boots for years !! Not just one monthThanks for nothing I will never buy a product from this company again.Look around for a better Boot
 All of the other reviews must have been after they recently bought these boots . They are comfortable . The outsoles and leather are durable , but the insole has completely deteriorated in 6 months . I wear these boots on a regular basis for work , so they get good wear . I had a pair of red wings that I had for 10 years . These did not make the cut . Also the stiching is starting to come apart on the boot straps and upper trim .

 These shoes appear to be yellowing - literally yellowing - on the shelves in stores all over New York City . I do n't know what they made the white part of the soles from , but they should consider changing it because it actually turns yellow with age like the plastic on an old computer , except apparently much much faster.I ca n't speak to their comfort , however , because Amazon/FootLocker sent the wrong size , so I had to return them to a FootLocker that had stopped carrying them .

 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .

 I wear a size 10 -LRB- US -RRB- in almost EVERY running shoe made . These are a size 9 at best and , yes , they are `` racing flats '' and my run a bit smaller but , hey , NOT THAT SMALL ! Thought this was a `` good deal '' @ 20 bucks and it turned into `` Caveat emptor `` I contacted the company to return/exchange them and NADA . Anyone want a pair of size 9 Saucony racing flat ? I 'll give you a good deal ...
 Having read so many glowing reviews for Danner boots for so long , I concluded that they must be the best US-made boots money can buy and determined to try a few . Having done so , I feel I can safely conclude that my assessment was correct , but that is as far as it goes , as I can also safely conclude now that those who are enamored of Danner boots are the type who insist on buying US-made products in general . Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .
 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .

 I was forced to buy these things called shoes . Wearing these shoes for more than an hour caused blisters and raw skin . I even took them to get stretched before the wedding out of fear this might happen . Your foot sweats , slips , bleeds and screams for you to sit down ... no joke , it really screams ! Your foot turns white where the plastic is , really attractive and quite classy , I know . All the bridesmaids had those things off before the bride and groom could say ' I Do . ` They made it to the reception , in a plastic bag and thrown under the table . I was hoping to never see them again ... unfortunately they turned up again on my front porch . Someone thought they were doing me a favor . I threw them right in the garbage . I would n't give those things to someone if they paid me ... which is why I do n't have them posted on E-Bay right now.Big whoop , you can fill the heel in with ` funfetti ' or pretty shiny beads , wooooowwwwww ... it does n't make up for the cost in band aids and Neosporin I had to purchase the next day . My feet will never forgive me for that one .

 have the black and brown pairs . i do walk heavy , however , in little under 2 years , i wore holes through the soles of these shoes - both pairs !!!
 I ordered this pair of slippers and the hole for the foot on one of them had such tight elastic that I could n't even stretch the slipper into a flat position -LRB- like in the pic -RRB- - It would stay curled up from being too tight . I exchanged them for another pair but had the same problem . There was really no way to get my son 's foot in it properly .
 First off its Not attractive looking . and it feels stiff and bulky and FLAT . Arch support really ? I do n't feel it at all.It hurt my foot after I wore it a little in the house -LRB- did n't even walk around whole much -RRB- . Very uncomfortable . Ca n't believe the price !!! If this is what Reef offers for all other sandals and it 's considered one of the best ones they have , I say REEF SUCKS .
 These are really nice looking flips . . would give five stars for looks but they are very loose . I only wore once so I do n't know if they will stretch out or wear well . You would need to have a very large , round foot or I received an anomaly .
 They looked good on paper , but when I received them I noticed that the white parts had a shimmer to them , which was n't what I was looking for . Also ordered an 8 , but needed a 9 .
 Are the sizes mis-marked ??? I 've never tried on a pair of shoes that ran this small before!I wear a size 5.5 M , purchased up a size to 6M , and they run very , very short . My heel was at the very tip of the edge which is incredibly uncomfortable!Usually size sixes are a little large on me no matter the brand , but I make due . These sandals are cut incredibly short in the foot length , and have lots of extra room in the band across the foot . Even if they fit me in length they 'd be flipping on flopping right off my foot , they are so wide ! They are kind of cute on , but do n't even come close to fitting ! The shoe is a whopping 4 '' wide!If you have a medium width foot , and wear the same sizes all the time , I say run away from these shoes . They will not fit ! I will tell you that it 's kind of a hassle sending back for a refund . I had to actually call Amazon Customer Service , as the online auto return said I had to pay for return shipping out of pocket ! I called them , and they made everything right by emailing me a return label . Free shipping is n't free if you are out for returns ! And these shoes must be mis-marked ... Buyer beware !
 The wrong color was sent to the house . The picture showed one thing but that sure wasnt what we got . they seller blamed amazon . im not sure who is actually responsible .
 For years I have worn Reef sandals on the recommendation of my foot doctor . These have always had a raised arch support . I assumed this was a feature of all Reef sandals . When they arrived and did not have this feature I sent them back and requested that the supplier send me a sandal that did . I specified that it could be any style and any color but at the same price , otherwise I requested a refund . I got the refund but was out $ 13.50 because of shipping costs both ways . Since the shoes cost less than $ 25 to begin with I felt this was a steep price to pay . Wo n't make that mistake again .
 Ordered my size , but was too small to fit . Ended up giving it to my mother in law , who wears a size smaller than me.Seemed like comfortable sandals , but order a size bigger .
 The website said size 6 Mens , the shoes were actually size 6 Womens , and the return process was designed so that I could n't actually return them for shoes in the right size .
 I love Reef flip flops . I bought this pair to replace a pair that I have nearly worn through . Just like my original pair these are incredibly comfortable . However they do run small . I normally wear an 8 1/2 or 9 . The 9s are a bit small for me , wish I 'd ordered up a size . The real problem with these is that they squeak when I walk ! Not right away but after a little while they start to make a definite and loud squeaking noise . It 's awkward and embarrassing and unfortunately I had to wear them all day so I wo n't be able to return them .
 I take a size 6.5 / 7 and the strap on this flip is just too tight . Using effort I can barely get the sandal on my foot , and you can see the pressure from the strap . At the same time I ordered this flip I ordered several Teva sandals with straps across the foot similarly placed and they fit just fine so I know my foot has not suddenly jumped up several sizes.Too lazy to return so will go to the GoodWill box . Will not buy this brand again .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 The leather and warmth on these boots are awesome comfortable nice boots but the sole wore out and fell off in one month . I called the company . They told me nothing they could do about it and to return them to the place I bought them . I thought I would have these boots for years !! Not just one monthThanks for nothing I will never buy a product from this company again.Look around for a better Boot
 All of the other reviews must have been after they recently bought these boots . They are comfortable . The outsoles and leather are durable , but the insole has completely deteriorated in 6 months . I wear these boots on a regular basis for work , so they get good wear . I had a pair of red wings that I had for 10 years . These did not make the cut . Also the stiching is starting to come apart on the boot straps and upper trim .
 I would rate these a lot higher if I could wear them . I used to wear Stans all the time , when a pair would wear out , I would go to the store and pick up another pair , size 11 1/2 . I did n't have to try them on , just buy them and go . Beware of doing that with these . I got 11 1/2 and they run narrow , the length is ok , but they are narrow , and squeeze my feet . I could wear them , and they might break in , and stretch , but I would bet they would also blow out in short order where the upper connects to the sole.I have tried to contact the sell Midwest Sports , to get the issue resolved , but the email came back , and when I contacted the website , it did n't get answered . This is a buyer beware situation . The look good , but I do n't want to look good and feel terrible . I would not buy these online , go to an old brick and mortar store , and try them on .
 I suppose that it 's inevitable , but I was hoping that the shoes would be the same as I remembered as a kid . They are not . To say the quality is inferior is being kind . The sizes run small as well -LRB- about a half size -RRB- and A * com will charge you shipping to return it .
 I bought the shoe and they are ok but they are NOT Stan Smiths . Just a bland old no name shoe .
 When I ordered the shoes , I thought there would be a screen to change to shoe size or else let me cancel the order . It did not , so I had to return them and have not yet received my refund
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 Before buying these sandals , realize that they have less cushioning than past seasons . So , if you are looking to replace last year 's favorite Teva sandal , think again!This season 's sandal lacks the quality and performance of past Teva products , and they do not care . I contacted customer service to return the sandal and they refused to pay for return shipping - even though their product is the problem . They acknowledged , though , that the design did change from last year.For the price , you would be better off buying a cheap pair of sandals at your local Walmart , or finding a more reliable high-end flip-flop .
 The sandals are O.K. but very overpriced.I ordered them for my daughter for Christmas so she can give you a better review at the end of Dec. .

 For the price I paid , these flip flops were disappointing . The distinctive Teva strap was good-looking but the sole was just like that of a flip flop you could buy at your local dollar store . I needed them as part of a gift basket and did n't have the time to return them otherwise I definitely would have .
 I always bought the Ulani 's and needed a new pair so I purchased the Toolanis thinking they would be of similar quality . They are n't even close . BUYER BEWARE . I wore them less than a week and was able to feel the ground through the bottom of the sandal . I contacted Teva to let them know and see if it was my pair or if it was simply that they were that poorly made . I was met with an unfriendly staff and a denial of any quality issues . Very poor service and VERY poor quality . I would recommend Reef for a higher quality product of similar fashion appeal .
 I love Vaneli and I 've been wearing them for years . These are wonderfully comfortable and chic looking shoes . The style really makes an outfit pop!They are available either online or at Marmi Shoes . I loved these shoes the moment I laid eyes on them.However , this is the first time I have had a problem with any of their shoes . The colorful buttons applied to the shoes are glued on rather than stitched on like Vaneli 's of old.I wore them out to dinner and by the time I got home I had buttons missing from each shoe . Mind you I just sat and had cocktails and nibbles . I did n't move my feet other than to sit , stand , and walk to the little girls room.These wonderful Italian shoes are no longer produced in Italy , but China -- and it shows . I 've compared my older Vaneli 's -LRB- 73 pairs -RRB- to my new Vaneli 's and there is a significant difference.The sole is cheap leather rather than the thick durable leather found in their early versions . The sandal straps on the new Vaneli 's are sown under the liner rather than at the foundation . Making them easier to break.I 'm very disappointed . These were no sale item . I paid full retail .
 These shoes are very cute and are very high quality , however there is absolutely no padding on the shoe . Very uncomfortable when you walk . I returned them because I could n't imagine wearing them for a long period of time .
 I have been wearing Vaneli shoes for many years . . Own many pair . . purchased the Vaneli Bice Slide approx . 1 - 2 months ago and they are already pulling apart around the mesh binding . I have really enjoyed the shoes and was going to purchase in several colors . . but not now !!! Very Very Disappointed .
 My sons wear rubber boots -LRB- Muck Boots -RRB- at school all day where they get wet and muddy , and water gets inside from an awesome day splashing in the Alaska fall rain.The dryer just does not get the boots completely dry inside . Warm , sure , but after 2 weeks nightly use they have never come out dry.The boots are on the dryer a minimum of 12 hours a night , usually longer . Going to buy a Peets dryer locally and see if that style works better .
 I purchased 5 of these and mounted them in my unheated garage to heat and dry the family 's ski boots after a day of skiing . Even after leaving the product on from 4pm to 8am the following morning the boots never got warm . While they were dry they were a bit cold . i guess the radiant heat these produce is n't quite hot enough to overcome my garage cold temps . This should work fine for a heated mudroom but not for a colder atmosphere . I 'll have to go with a commercial unit for my particular application .
 I bought this product after reading the reviews . Well maybe it works good for basic usage , but I work with landscaping and snow removal . This product will not dry your boots off in time to get to work after you have soaked them . I thought it worked great when I would get home from work and my boots would be dry but I was doing work on a pond and had to get in the pond , so my boats where soaked . I put my boots on it at 6pm and tried to put my boots back on at 6am the next morning and they were still wet . Really wet in the heal ... Do n't buy this product if you are depending on it ...
 We ordered four of these Boot Dryers . They arrived on time but one of the packages had a missing Plastic Saddle clamp , so assembly was not possible .
 I 'm a little disappointed in this dryer . I use it for ski boots that get almost daily use . A dryer with heated air would be more effective . It 's also quite noisy , and lacks a timer . Though it ca n't use much power , I wish it would turn itself off after several hours ' use . it gets the job done , but spending another $ 10 would have been money well spent to get heated air and a timer . There are better options out there . The 12v power would let you run it from a car , motor home , or boat , whcih may be useful to some people .
 Returned both of these due to excessive noise . I have built similar units out of computer fans and pvc pipe and they are quiet . I was hoping these would be quiet but they were not .
 The dryer does its job , but it started to deform just after the 2nd use . The plastic lost its shape . The dryer is still functional , but I would n't recommend it to anyone .
 I worked outside in the rain on August 21st , Saturday , for the Browns Game here in Cleveland , Ohio . It poured that day for hours . After working , my boots were soaked and that night I plugged in my DryGuy Circulator Footwear Dryer for the first time . I followed the simple directions and made sure that the unit was working . It did produce a small amount of heat , but NOT enough to dry my boots . I had to work again 24 hours later , and my boots were NOT even 10 % dryerer after 24 hours of using the DryGuy Dryer . It was totally useless . I left the DryGuy Dryer in my boots Until Wednesday August 24th -LRB- Today -RRB- and my boots were still damp . They basically dryed on their own , NOT with the help of the DryGuy Dryer.I never would have bought this unit , if I had not stepped on and accidentally broke my PEET shoe dryer . I wanted a more compact dryer , but this purchase was a total waste of money . My PEET shoe dryer was absolutely great at drying my boots and gloves within 8 hours . I will be ordering another PEET shoe dryer right now , after I post this review . My PEET shoe dryer worked GREAT for many years with 100 % satisfaction until I stepped on it.I have also contacted Amazon to get information on how to get a full refund . I will post an addition to this review if I have any problems with receiving a refund . Please do not waste you money on this item .
 I bought the Circulator from another vendor but thought to share my experience of the product . It 's compact as described however from the moment I plugged it in it has never worked . I tried several outlets -LRB- in case it was just me -RRB- and still nothing . I contacted the company I bought them from and they sent me another new pair . Same results from the second set . . nothing when plugged in.Don ' t take this review to reflect poorly on all Dryguy products though as I 've had a pretty good experience with their wide body boot and glove dryer , which I 've already written a review for .
 If you can imagine the smell of a burnt circiut board and dead fish then you can imagine owning these ! I was afraid they were going to catch my new $ 300 boots on fire , whaaaaaat !!!!!
 Clever and portable design . But right out of the box one of the plugs -LRB- there are two separate blowers powered by two separate power plugs that run off the same 120V AC power supply -RRB- was defective ; the unit would n't run . The other unit worked for about 10 minutes while I was fiddling with the 1st , but then its plug worked loose inside the housing and would n't run either . Maybe I got a lemon but this is headed back for Amazon return in favor of a different model ...
 While preparing for a week long ski trip to Utah spent decided I really wanted a way to dry out my boots overnight , however I needed something that would fit in my boot bag . This compact boot dryer looked the most promising
 I got these for my husband whose a tank wagon driver delivering fuel throughout the winter months in Iowa , he tried them out and was very disappointed ! He said that they shifted in his boots and would n't stay in place on top of just not working to keep his feet warm . It has n't been an extremly cold winter but it 's cold enough for him when he has to be in cold most of the day . He definetly does n't recommend these and suggests that you do n't waste your money trying this method out !
 These foot warmers are a joke ! They are overpriced for what they are ... If they worked it would be ok but they dont work.They also came off & got all crimpped up in less than 2 weeks.These things are junk !!!
 DryGuy ShoeDry Boot . Instructions state this unit not intended for heavy boots . Unit is much too light for anything but light shoes or gloves .
 I expected warm air would be emited from the boot dryer and was disappointed when it did not . I take responsibility for not doing more research prior to purchase . My previous boot dryer emited warm air for faster drying .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 Great look , great fit , comfortable . However I had these for three weeks and the webbing on the back heel frayed . Returned to Chaco for warranty , they would not honor warranty - said it had to be my fault ? Shoes were never worn camping , just city . Good news is they did repair , bad news they charged me for the repair . Next time I will buy Teva 's .
 Cute design and length was perfect . I do not think that I have abnormally big toes but my big toe would not fit into the opening at all . Finally got it in but tight and uncomfortable when walking .
 This shoe is too clunky and the arch is way to high . It gives me blisters on my arch and my big toes are going to fall off . They are good for outdoors and a great concept . I wish they were more dainty .
 In the summer of 2008 I wanted to buy a comfortable , supportive sandal to wear on our trip to Disney World . I read a lot of reviews on Chacos and read about the technology behind the design . I was sure that Chacos would be a perfect choice and bought a pair for myself and my teenage daughter after being fitted by a REI salesperson . We both wore them to Disney and we both had problems right away . Both of us complained of pain in our big toe joints and we had problems with the strap tightening around the toe while we walked . At some point during the trip I had lost all the feeling in one big toe and had a deep indent where the strap was . It felt like when you get a shot of Novocain and your lip feels numb when you touch it . -LRB- I had no feeling at the tip of my toe for three months ! And then it gradually got better during the fourth month . -RRB- My guess is that the strap damaged a nerve . During the summer of 2009 I wore the sandals again for short periods of time with no problem , so I decided to take them again to Disney with the intention of constantly checking the strap and keep it very loose around my toe . I was successful , but at the end of the first day my toe started to feel prickly . That 's when I retired my Chacos and bought a pair of FitFlops which were extremely comfortable and gave me no problems for the rest of the week . My daughter ended up giving up her Chacos also . She felt they were very uncomfortable and ended up buying another sandal at Disney that worked well . We really wanted to like our Chacos and gave them a good chance . Unfortunately they did n't work for us .
 I love these shoes in theory . The sole bed is super comfortable but some of the straps are not adjustable and those loops were too big for me . I tried going down a size but then the foot bed is too small . Ugh - I really wanted to keep these shoes but had to send them back
 I clicked on the blue shoe , 5th in line on this page , and it was entitled `` Garden '' and I received green shoes . The green shoes that the official chacos website considers `` Garden '' . I am very upset because if I am going to spend this much money on a pair of shoes , I expect to receive what I ordered and I did not .
 These are very uncomfortable . I bought them because of already having feet issues/pain , but these only made it worse . The imprint ridges are very annoying .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .

 The left boot had an issue with the buckle . It caused irritation on my leg . I had to send itBack
 I could not wait to get these shoes . It is such a stylish and good looking shoe . However , the quality did not hold up . I wore them once , and the plastic tore away from the leather . The idea was nice , but it just does n't work .
 A good shoe , as the title says , but so narrow that my son 's normal-width foot is too wide . Disappointing for us , but probably good for kids with very slender feet .

 This shoe is very cute , but I believe it was an older style Clarks sandal , and it ran small . Although I own many Clarks sandals in the same size , this one was so snug , I had to return it .
 I actually found these quite uncomfortable . Which is weird since I pretty much have like a million different pair of Skechers . This company selling them is not Amazon so be careful . I have n't been able to have any communication with them . I really suggest buying them directly from Skechers which has them at $ 50 -LRB- less than I paid for them -RRB- . You 'll be really sorry if you have to make any returns so just wanted to give a warning !
 Within 2 weeks of purchasing these , the little `` eyes '' started falling off . On closer examination , it was clear they were poorly made -LRB- and I see I 'm not the only person who 's had this issue with them -RRB- . When I contacted Skechers , all I got was a runaround and a typical `` we 're a big , wealthy corporation - who the heck are you ? '' response . Skechers so-called customer service personnel could n't have cared less . Run away from Skechers products , but do n't do it in these shoes .

 Having read so many glowing reviews for Danner boots for so long , I concluded that they must be the best US-made boots money can buy and determined to try a few .

Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .
 Like many of the reviewers , I thought a long time before spending so much money on these shoes . Unlike many reviewers , I am very disappointed with the Mephisto Match . While true to size , after almost a month of wearing them , I do not find them comfortable . I have had to trim the insert in the right shoe to keep it from rubbing a sore spot on the side of my foot . In addition to the discomfort , a close look at the construction puzzles me regarding all the `` hand operations '' claimed by Mephisto . I have worn far more comfortable and supportive shoes for two-thirds the cost.A costly poor choice.On the positive side , I did pay less for these shoes through Amazon and , as usual , Amazon provided excellent service.Update . I realize now that I should have waited before my review of several weeks ago complaining that the Mephisto Match was an uncomfortable shoe . Having continued to wear them , they have become a pleasurable pair of shoes . Perhaps in my case , the shoes took a long time to break-in . Or perhaps it took time for my 75 year old feet to adjust to a `` proper '' shoe . At any rate , it is only fair to Mephisto to now say I am pleased with the shoes .
 I wore my Mephistos occasionally for three years and found them heavy but very comfortable . Then the leather strip around the laces separated from both shoes . They want $ 75 to `` refurbish '' - sounds better than repair - and add new laces . I bought a tube of Shoe Glu for $ 4.00 and did the job myself . When you buy Mephistos , you really do n't get what you pay for .
 I purchased a pair of these a number of years ago expecting them to last . They did not . They are moderately comfortable , yes , but so are many shoes . I would have expected at this price for the soles to hold up for at least a year of moderate use . They did not . For something so expensive that calls itself a `` Walking Shoe '' , this is inexcusable . I walked with these shoes approximately 15-20 miles per week in good weather on sidewalks and pavement . Within 9 months the outer rubber had worn through the on both heels and under the balls of both feet . At 12 months , the holes at each section had grown to the point where dirt and water were easily getting into the shoes and walking was downright uncomfortable . I 've owned shoes that were $ 300 less expensive than these and that lasted 5 times as long . These are , without question , the most overpriced and terribly constructed shoes I have ever owed .
 The arches of these shoes are much too high for me . I could not wear them and I gave them away . I am very disappointed . I will not buy Mephisto shoes again .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 This shoe is very cute , but I believe it was an older style Clarks sandal , and it ran small . Although I own many Clarks sandals in the same size , this one was so snug , I had to return it .

 I had to buy several sizes to try to get one that fit . They put a stick in the shoes that stretches the shoes over time and alters the size . The 10.5 was too small and the 11 was too large . I initially bought the 11. , which is the size of all of my other shoes , and that was way too large . I ended up returning everything and buying nothing .
 In spite of ordering a 1/2 size smaller than what I normally wear based on owner reviews , these shoes are still way too long for me -- but oddly enough , also too narrow . I also find the quality to be poor -- especially the inner padding directly under your feet . It seemed to be saturated in silicone or something which made it slippery . In addition , pads are starting to slide out of position inside both shoes after wearing periodically for only 3 weeks . Unfortunately , the original packaging got thrown out and I do n't want to pay for return shipping -- so no more Minnetonka shoes for me .
 These slippers are a small fit and need considerable breaking in . They are not warm and to top it off I had to return them as the sole came away from the shoe upper.Extremely dissapointing as I will be out of pocket due to the cost of return post from Australia.Amazon will pay `` UP TO '' $ 4.98 ... for the return freight , but it cost me $ 44 in freight to return them , plus the $ 22 plus to send them in the first place.Very expensive pair of slippers which fell to bits and I had to pay.Hardly seems fair , I thought Minnetonka was a quality product . I was mistaken .
 I love Moccasins and have never had an issue with Minnetonka Moccasins before . So much so that I threw away all of the packaging and the return receipt right away . That being said - I have some serious issues with these.First of all , as previously noted in other reviews , these things run way big . I mean at least a full size big . This makes no sense to me - you are a show company , how the heck do you screw up sizing ? While this angered me , I could have lived with just the sizing issue . Unfortunately the other , and bigger , issue is the overall comfort level of the shoe . Again I have owned several pairs of Minnetonka Moccasins . They have been the only moccasins I have purchased over the last ten years to the tune of 4-5 different pairs . This variety is BY FAR the least comfortable that I have owned . They are so uncomfortable and seemingly poorly made that I have examined them closely trying to determine if they are knock offs . Still inconclusive . The leather is hard and almost jagged and the padding is completely minimal . The soles seem alright , except for the fact that the stitching is bunched up and coming out of the bottom of the shoe . I 'm really disappointed in these shoes and wish I would have just gone to the store to purchase.For those of you looking at moccasins - pick up a pair of the Minnetonka Moose Skins - those are a ca n't miss .
 As a long time Minnetonka shoe customer , I have noted a degradation in the quality , comfort , and useful life of their shoes . About 8 years ago , I had a pair and it was comfortable , long wearing , and of high quality . When the soles wore out , I had them re-soled . Twice . -LRB- I use them continually . -RRB- With the price of a new pair on Amazon vs. the price of re-soling the old shoes , well , it did n't make any sense not to simply buy a new pair . I did . Once . Quality was lower , only lasted a year . So , I bought another . Lasted less than a year . With my past 2 pairs ' quality issue , I was very suspect of buying another . I did a LOT of due diligence . I contacted Minnetonka direct with my concerns ; no response . A bad sign . I still went further ; locating local stores to try them out first before I bought . None of the stores had the above style ; I actually bought another which was close ; I returned it the next day . Finally , I gave in and ordered a pair from Amazon with widespread differing opinions . The shoes were n't comfortable , actually hurt my feet . Today , I returned them to Amazon . -LRB- What a wonderful return policy they have ; you have to love Amazon . -RRB- I decided to re-sole my old but comfortable shoes . This 3rd time to re-sole them , the shoe repair shop said they were fearful the new sole might not bond well and I might not get my full value -LRB- $ 45 -RRB- out of the shoe . I told them to go ahead and do it.Minnetonka had no bigger of a fan than me . I sold them at a retail store over 40 years ago and have been a satisfied customer ever since . Until now . I expected better . My advice to a prospective customer is to beware . Your experience may be different ; maybe I have weird feet . Just go into your purchase with your eyes wide open .
 I wore them less than a week and the stitching started to come loose . I had to take them to a cobbler -LRB- yes we still have one here in the hinterlands -RRB- to get them fixed.Pass , next time
 -LRB- dskh dsk hd ksd hk sad sdsa sdsd sccsc ssc sad fdgd -RRB- it ripped from the side after one week
 THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT , THE WORSE SHOE EVER !!! I 'm truly one who believes you get what you pay for , so when I paid for something I expected it to work . NOT !! First of this shoe has a battery , yes a battery . It dies really fast and replacements are not cheap . Second , the super smart motor is like having a giant rock stuck to the bottom of your shoe , oh and I forgot the batery cover , under your insole come up , turns on its side and it 's like stepping on a quarter that is on it 's side that has no intention of moving . Finally and by no means the least the sole deterioriates very quickly . Summation , piece of junk . Do n't waste your money . Give it to a homeless child instead if your insistant on wasting the cash .
 these shoes are really cute , but extremely heavy . My daughter had constant problems with them coming off her feet because of the weight .
 The real shoe looks kindda not too classy . Even the sole has this ` fashion ' word imprinted on it . Gave it away .
 Purchased 2 pair of these shoes on 2/05/09 and when I received it and opened the box the shoes smelled like kerosene or gasoline very bad . I figured it would go away after I aired them outside but the smell remained . This was not only noticed by myself as my co workers actually noticed it as well . It actually gave me a headache and burned my eyes while sitting at my desk at work . I would n't suggest buying this shoe unless you can put up with the smell along with your co workers .
 These shoes were ok at first but now the straps around the back of your foot wo n't stay up - no matter how tight you make them . Very disappointing because they are very cute .
 First , let me say that I LOVE Nine West shoes . It 's practically all I own . So when I bought these , I was very excited to wear them out on the town ... unfortunately , I did n't even make it out of the house . Because they are SO adorable , I tried everything to get them to stay on my feet
 Super cute , and they run true to size , but they NEVER stay on my feet !!!! I made the mistake to wear them to a wedding , so I walked around with my shoes `` flip-flopping '' all night . They were a total waste ... I never ever wear them .
 I have these in black . They are one of the sexiest pairs of shoes I own . I truly feel beautiful when wearing them . One problem though , they wo n't stay on the backs of my ankles ! They slip right off with every step . So even though I bought them for a wedding , I could n't actually wear them there or anywhere else either.I was very disappointed because I am a Ninewest fanatic . I have so many pairs and they all fit wonderfully . This has been the only exception .
 First , the strap on the back of the foot slips down constantly . Because of that , I fell down the stairs at work and got hurt . I 'll never wear these again . I love NW shoes , but I 'm super disappointed with these .
 these heels are adorable . i bought them for a wedding and after a while my feet were hurting so bad . would not recommend .
 I wear 8.5 - 9 , usually 8.5 in sandals like these . I have wide feet and if you do as well I would NOT recommend these . I love Nine West but these heels can be worn for about 10 minutes before you 're ready to go bare foot .
 Like so many other reviewers , I 'm disappointed in the way these shoes slip off my feet . Something about them is also really uncomfortable , and I have other high strappy sandals that do n't have this problem . I wear them sometimes because they are cute , then I end up regretting it because my feet hurt and they slip off . My advice - keep looking ...
 I loved the look of the shoes - but the heels are high and the straps hardly keep them on your feet . I am usually good at walking in heels but felt very unsteady in these .
 After a few uses -LRB- 4-5 times -RRB- the `` leather '' started to peel and also one of the straps got apart of the sole.I really hate these shoes and would not recommend them at all . Zolibeth
 I ordered these shoes for a wedding , but I had to return them . I tried them on for about 3 seconds and my feet were hurting . Since the heel is pretty high , you foot slides forward and there is not much shoe to hold your foot in place . This one strap right across my toes was bascially squeezing my foot into the shoe and it hurt !
 I ordered these shoes for my recent trip to Italy . I found them to be very comfortable , but after about 5 days one of the top straps started to frey and come apart . I expected better quality for the price paid .
 I have these shoes in black and purchased them from the Easy Spirit store . The twine in the middle of the shoe that holds the strap together tore on both shoes . The sales lady in the store had the same pair on and I noticed hers had torn as well . I went ahead and bought them anyway thinking this would not happen to mine ... . and of course it did !! Needless to say , I only paid $ 19.95 in the store for them . Do n't waste your time like I did !!!
 This would be my third pair of these shoes but the first I bought on line . Since I 'd had two other pair of the exact shoe I did n't think this was a problem , as I knew the exact size , 11 2E and my feet had n't grown ... Well they are not the correct size ; they are both too short and too narrow . I 'd hoped that with wear I 'd adjust to them but I 'm miserable . I 've noticed they have a design change in the tongue that may be the difference but I ca n't say for sure.I 've learned that there are some things best purchased in person ... shoes are one of them . I did n't save enough money to have to suffer through these shoes !
 These are great for about a month , and then they are useless . I had two pairs for two winters in a row , and neither one made it even half-way through the winter . I only wore them indoors as slippers , and liked the support and comfort . But within a month the insoles wear thin and start coming loose - as your feet sweat they stick to your foot and get wrinkled and messed up in the shoe so that you constantly have to take the shoes off , take out the insoles , and put them back in correctly . It makes them completely useless , and is unforgivable in shoes of this price.I have never had this problem with any of my Uggs , but every Merrell shearling shoe/slipper seems to do this - poor quality and no attention to a fairly important detail is inexcusable for a $ 90 - 100 shoe . As I said , I do like the support and impact protection , but they seriously need to fix this problem that has been around for at least 3 years !
 These pair of shoes caused serious swollen ankles after my daughter 's first day with them . I found out their tongues have stiff edges especially around the labeling area , and the area around the ankle is also too stiff . It is a nightmare experience . When I was trying to put the shoes back on her feet , she just can not walk . It is so painful that she would not let us touch her ankles . It made me want to sue Stride Rite for hurting my daughter .
 I was very disappointed in this product and will not buy it again . I would have returned them but I hate doing returns so I kept them and will use them for teaching purposes only . They are not suede uppers and they do not have leather straps . Most of the sandal is cardboard , stiff and does not work well as a dance shoe . I have discouraged my students from buying this shoe as I beleve the picture shown and description given is not accurate .
 I ordered my normal size and these shoes were huge on me . Immediate return -LRB- otherwise they 're good quality -RRB- . Size down !
 I tried two sizes 8 1/2 and a 7 -LRB- I wear a size 9 in street shoes -RRB- even the 7 was too big .
 I have the exact same slippers in pink and ordered the exact same size , but these are too wide and a little too long . The elastic is further back on the slipper too , making it fit awkwardly . I do n't know why the sizing would differ between colors , but it definitely did .
 Do n't buy shoes from Amazon ! Tried to get proper size for my nine year old and used sizing chart after measuring feet . It indicated that Women 's size 6 would be appropriate , but after they arrived they were too big . Only after checking chart for Kids did I see that a Bloch `` Big Kid '' size would have been the right one , despite the same measurement in inches . Guess what ? Amazon does n't sell `` Big Kid '' slippers , and they took me for return shipping . And this while they rip off states for sales taxes .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 They are so uncomfortable considering these are flats . The heel part of the shoe is so unyielding ; you 'll feel it pinching the instant you start to walk . They look good though , the silver color is nice . I would save my money and move on to another pair of flats because I like to ACTUALLY WALK in my flats .
 I ordered the Unisa Women 's Tyron Two Piece Flat , Black ,9 M. It 's an attractive and elegant shoe , but while most size 9 shoes usually fit quite comfortably , this fit EXACT ... so now I 'm in the process of wearing it for short bits of time to `` break it in '' , b/c I ended up traveling overseas with it , and could not send it back to Amazon.I 've received compliments -LRB- from guys , no less ! -RRB- about it , because although it 's flat , it does look quite chic . I 'd say , if you 're looking for a comfy comfy fit , go a half a size bigger .
 Why has n't this company return policy been addressed . First you do not get a confirmation email that the order has been placed and you do not get a confirmation email of the shipment . You need to make two phone calls to get this information . Then their sizing chart is not accurate . Since I wear a 9 9/12 I ordered a US 9-10 and even thought it might be a little large . When it arrived the tag said 8-9 and the shoe said 7-8 and it was too small . When I called customer service I was told I should have measured my feet before I ordered my size because they come from brazil . I told them there was nothing on their website that said if you wear a US 9-10 you should order an 11-12 . I was told if I wanted the larger size I would need to pay to have them shipped back and then pay to have the new pair shipped back to me . So 3 shipping charges because their sizes are not true to size . This company could care less about the customer . I said well I would like to just return them because you sent me the wrong size , I was told I would have to pay to have them returned because Havianas under no circumstances pays to have returns sent back to them . I can not support a company who treats their potential customers like this .
 These get two stars for comfort , five stars for cuteness . I like the slimmer shape , straps , and adorable designs , but why they ca n't do all that and KEEP THE LEGENDARY SQUISHY COMFORT of the old Tops , I just can not understand.So , back to the plain Tops for me . The Slims are just a bit more comfortable than ordinary thongs but not nearly enough to justify the price and certainly not worthy of the Havaianas name .
 skip the havaianas . i am a flip flop connoisseur . i chose feelgoodz over havaianas . not only are they more comfortable -LRB- you do n't even notice them on your feet -RRB- , but feelgoodz are totally biodegradable and a portion of the profits helps children in thailand . not only will you be happy with the flip flops , but you will get a warm fuzzy feeling about buying them , and you 'll be creating good karma for yourself .
 I purchased the dark brown Havaianas Flip Flops -- dark brown , non-patterned bottom and dark brown Y-shaped strap -LRB- or thong -RRB- . Instead , I received the patterned bottom with light brown Y-strap -LRB- or thong -RRB- model.I 'm very unhappy with this , but ca n't return the product since my other pair of flip flops are broken . The product itself is fine -- not damaged or dysfunctional -- but it 's NOT what I ordered . I think the seller should rectify this in some way .
 Disappointed with these flip flops and order in general . To start , Amazon falsly labeled 37/38 BR as 7/8 M US ... when I received the order , the 37/38 actually said size 6 . I returned those and ordered a 39/40 BR , which Amazon advertises as a 9/10 M US . I received them today and they say size 7/8 . Basically , the sizing is off -LRB- probably due to them being made in Brazil compared to US sizes -RRB- so be careful.When I received the new pair today , the bottom is scuffed and they do not look brand new . Additionally , one of the small round pieces of the strap that goes through to the bottom of the shoe is falling out and does not seem like it will last.Wouldn ' t recommend ordering them on Amazon , better off going to a store that sells them and trying on to find your size and making sure the pair is well assembled .
 I ordered a 35/36 . I own multiple havaianas of that size . Item arrived labeled 35/36 but it was a full size smaller and did not fit . It left me wondering if it was a defective batch or a knock off .
 Just bought the slim pair and was disappointed that the fit is VERY loose ! the straps do not hug the foot at all . My cheap old navy flip flops are a better fit .
 The sizes are just wrong ... wrong , wrong , wrong . I ordered a US 5-6 and the shoe that arrived was marked US 4-5 with some wacky conversions into Brazil/Euro sizes . -LRB- Every shoe conversion chart I 've found renders their information senseless . -RRB- Be prepared to exchange it . Luckily , friendly return policies apply .
 I purchased 3 pairs of Havaianas for myself and kids . All 3 of them fell apart after 1 month of light use . I emailed customer service and they would n't replace them.Good looking sandals but made with horrible material and process in China . Complete garbage !
 i ordered a slim dark brown pair of flip flop havaianas size 8/9 and they sent me a size 7/8 . and the 2 Shoebuy customer representatives that I talked to were not really nice . The first one was really mean .
 I loved these shoes and only wore them 1-2 times per week and after 5 months the strap between the toes broke . They are now held together with a screw and some tape thanks to my handy husband . I was very disappointed that they broke after only 5 months of light wear .
 Ordered 2 pair of size 9 -- one was the right size one size 5 . ??? I live in Canada so returning them is not a viable option . The shoes are great but the people filling the orders need to sharpen up .
 I bought 3 pairs -LRB- black , grey and navy -RRB- . The size was right , having narrow feet ... these fit me like a dream . I wore the grey out for a day and noticed my feet were hurting . I dismissed it , telling myself that they just needed to be broken in . When I finally did sit down to check my feet , I had two bloody slash marks where the plastic/rubber thong part went between my toes . I took the shoe off to take a closer look and the underside of the thong is a non-finished , rough surface . I took a nail buffer and filed them down but honestly , for price of these flip flops , they should need no `` modifications '' just to be wearable . I wo n't be buying more of these .
 These flip flops are not worth the hype of the name!I have purchased $ 5.00 flip flops that were better.There are several problems with these shoes :1 . The `` white '' ones are really pearl or off white2 . They are very narrow and do n't fit the average foot3 . The sizing information is wrong -LRB- I had to order them twice and the wrong size came both times !

 It was delivered at time . And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance ; however , it was n't . When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe , which is the reason why I bought it , the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance . Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons . Any way , the prodoct was n't the same value or quality of pumma 's shoes that I have bought in the past .
 the shoes look great but are not much for comfort . When I bought them I was looking for a comfortable shoe to wear on my vacation there will be alot of walking involved but I guess these are not the shoes . They are my correct size but they hurt my feet if worn for to long .
 I was under the impression that this was a mid level shoe . Higher than a low-cut shoe . The 1st day I used them I rubbed a blister on the back of my foot which I have to avoid doing due to my diabetes . I now can only use these shoes to go out in , not for walking that I was buying them for .
 These shoes matched my dress perfectly - down to the crystal broach . They were a little higher than I like , but they seemed okay at home - I even walked around in them a little a couple of times to wear them in . They are very cute , but ... I took them on a cruise for formal night , and did n't like them at all . The straps kept falling off my heal and they were not comfortable even having not worn them very long that night . I think I ended up leaving them on the ship . No reason to bring them home , I would n't have worn them again anyway .
 I 'm a size 9 , through and through , and I 've never had the problems with other shoes that I had with these . Do n't get me wrong - I 'm a Softspots fan , but these shoes are not well-designed . I tried these on and could n't take more than 2 steps in them , they hurt my feet so badly . When the shoe bends as you 're walking , the strips on top come together to pinch the skin on the top of my foot .
 This was without a doght the worst pair of shoes I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to purchase . First they were ugly , second they were way too tight , and last they would never be something I would buy . It cost $ 10 to return and I could not have worn them if I wanted to . This was false advertising if there ever was one .
 The quality of the shoe was good , but I returned them because the fit in the heel was too wide . Slipped up and down when I tried to walk .
 When I first got these shoes , I loved them . They were cute , comfy and a good fit . Within a few days , I noticed they seemed to be a little large after all . After a week or so , I realized they were stretching and were quite loose . But they stayed on my feet -LRB- kind of -RRB- , so I kept wearing them . After a few weeks , they had stretched so much that I could no longer wear them - and then I noticed that the heels had worn half-way down and there were actual holes developing in the bottoms ! This is after less than a month of wearing -LRB- and I 'm not mountain-climbing in them either -RRB- . I called the seller -LRB- Footsmart -RRB- and they said they would not take the shoes back as defective since they had been worn , but gave me the manufacturer 's number . The manufacturer said they had a warranty , so I reported the problem . When I did n't hear back , I tried again . I was told it would take two weeks to receive a response . I waited two weeks -LRB- I work for a manufacturer - we respond to customer complaints within one business day -RRB- . No response . Several calls and one month later , I am still waiting to receive a mailing label so I can send the shoes to the manufacturer for evaluation . I will update this if I do receive a satisfactory solution at any point , but as of now , I would say to stay away from these shoes !
 Wasted my money on this shoe . The first day my wife wore them they fit perfectly . By the second day , they streched so much she had difficulty keeping them on her feet .
 These shoes look great but stretched out so much after wearing one time , they are unwearable . I contacted the seller who ignored my inquiry . I wasted my money . Not recommended .
 Softspots Women 's Trinidad Slip-OnLast year I ordered a size 9 in this shoe . It was a too big but I used a sole insert and a heel pad which solved the problem . The shoes wear well and are comfortable . This year I ordered the same shoe style in size 8 1/2 thinking it would fit perfectly . It was so tight I could not get it on . I returned the shoes and reordered a size 9 which fit but are very snug . These shoes have a strong chemical odor . I have aired them for a week with no improvement . The entire closet literally fills with this odor and I now air them in the garage . I may have to return these shoes too .
 My son loves the appearance of the shoe , but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description : - leather-Soft , calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper . I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising .
 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .
 These shoes are not durable at all . My son who is 2 only wore these for a few days before the black plastic piece that holds the strap on the back broke off . I could never get it back on right and eventually lost the piece . They are now completely broken and can not be worn at all .
 We order these for my son 's birthday . They arrived on time on his birthday but they were obviously in Used condition . The bottom of the crocs were worn , and the alligator images on the sides were scratched off .
 I 've purchased many pairs of Crocs over the years but the quality has severely diminished over the past few years . I 'm not sure exactly what has changed in the manufacturing but a pair of crocs used to last my daughter a couple of years . At the end of May , the back strap broke on a pair so I bought a new pair through Amazon . She wore them TWICE when one of the straps broke off the back . We decided to do `` surgery '' and took a back strap off an old pair to replace the broken one . I wish we had simply returned them at the time but she liked them so we did n't . Now , the other strap has broken off the back . Please note that the strap off of the older pair is still intact and going strong . You can actually FEEL the difference in thickness between the old and new . It 's really sad because my daughter and most of her friends love them but I will not spend $ 32 on a pair of shoes that breaks immediately . And of course , I ca n't return to Amazon . Hopefully , I 'm not the only one that 's complained -LRB- I also complained directly to Crocs -RRB- and the quality will improve again but for now , we 've purchased our last pair of crocs . And our last pair of shoes from Amazon , PERIOD , due to the return policy .
 Maybe it is me , but I ordered shoes in what I thought were my daughters size and they came in the exact size of my son 's , whose feet are two sizes bigger . I could have misordered but I was pretty careful about it . The sizing chart is confusing.I agree with the woman who says the shoes are too expensive for what they are . That is probably true for kids ' shoes in general , though .
 I always buy my kids crocs before going to Disney every year . I have never had a problem before . They usually walk alot and stay comfy . This year my 8 year old got horrible blisters on the top of his feet where the shoe opening is . Needless to say he wore gym shoes the rest of the trip . Poor kid was very uncomfortable . I think it might be this style . My other two children wore different styles .
 These are cute and look comfy however both my kids complain that the straps have cause blisters . The area where the round crocs logo is , rubs on the insides of their feet . Not a good vacation when the kids are complaining of hurt feet .
 I order two pairs of these for my boys , and within five minutes of my older son putting them on for the first time the plastic `` rivets '' holding the strap to the shoe broke . Shortly after that , a `` rivet '' on my other sons pair broke . Two new pairs of shoes both broken within ten minutes of them being worn tells me that this is more than just a manufacturing `` oops '' . The rivets are a design flaw and whatever cost-savings they are to the company , they just paid for in customer loyalty . I will never buy crocs again!BTW , for those of you who have this problem , there is a fix ... Go to the fabric store and buy some Blue Jeans Buttons to replace the plastic `` rivets '' . They fit the openings pretty well , and they 're metal , so they are n't going to break .
 The sizing does not make sense ... I bought a size 4 for my one year old and it could fit a four month old . Wasted my money .
 My son had a pair of crocs last summer and wore them every day . They held up beautifully . So , I bought him a pair -LRB- same color and style -RRB- for this year and within a month the strap broke off . At $ 20 , these shoes should stand up better than that . I do n't know what happened to their quality , but these were a disappointment .
 If you get the length you need , then they are way too wide - like boats and way too big for children to keep on their feet .
 I ordered blue crocs for my child in a certain size . They sent me bright neon crocs , in a smaller size . Why ? I do n't know . I ask for an exchange or refund , and I have yet to receive any . This has been going on for months and it is yet to be resolved . I finally put a review to see if I can get a different outcome .
 The strap broke within 6 weeks of receiving the item . Our now 19 month old has another pair of Crocs -LRB- lego blocks -RRB- that she has worn more and those are still fine . Her previous pair she was able to wear until she outgrew with no problems.I am very frustrated I can not return/exchange these when it seems I must have received a defective pair .
 I have purchased at least six pairs of Crocs previously and I have always had great luck with them holding up through all kinds of wild little boy behavior . Which is why I am really disappointed that the straps on these Crocs broke after my son wore them 4 or 5 times . Maybe these were seconds of some type ? Fakes ? Not sure , but very unhappy to be purchasing another pair less than two weeks after purchasing these .
 I normally love Crocs and buy a pair each year for my kid , but the one 's I just got broke in two days . I want to return them for a new pair .
 My daughter owns an identical pair of these in light pink in toddler size 8/9 . I purchased a fuscia pair from Amazon in the exact same size , but they are 1/2 '' shorter in length . When my daughter tried them on , her toes were touching the end of the shoes . So I must return them -LRB- and my daughter is extremely disappointed -RRB- . What 's worse , since the return is not the result of Amazon 's error , they can not be exchanged ; I can order a new pair , but would have to incur the shipping charge . I do n't have money to throw away , and with the sizing irregularities , the next size up could still not fit -LRB- it 's anyone 's guess -RRB- . Unless you have time and money to waste on returns and reorders , I would not recommend ordering these online . We will have to find these in a brick-and-mortar store where my daughter can try them on to see if they 're really going to fit .
 Horrible customer service , unresponsive . I ordered purple and I got a Disney Cars model and on a different size . I wrote an e = mail and never received an answer from them . Thank god Crocs is a great company and I was able to exchange them on a Crocs concept store . I dont recommend this vendor
 Hi , I ordered this pair of crocs shoes for my little boy , and I was very dissapointed , because I noticed that the name of Crocs on the bach side of the trap , was inverted in the right foot . I never saw an original crocs shoes with this kind of mistake , so I thought I was frauded .
 I ordered a pair of children 's crocs from this seller a month ago . I got no notice of delay until I wrote to the seller through amazon . They told me only then that there would be a 2 week delay . Finally today , one month after placing the order , I received notice that they would be unable to fulfill my order . Order your crocs from a different seller !
 I bought a pair of these shoes locally about 2 years ago -LRB- size 8-9 for LESS than -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- he was size 8 at the time , they were a little too big on my son I set them aside . It took quite a few months for him to finally be able to use them . Finally he was able to use them , he used them for quite a while . My son is autistic , so once he likes something he wants it ALL the time . Unfortunately he wanted to wear them to bed , since he never went outdoors with them ; I figured that 's not too bad.The only time these would come off was for bath time , eventually they broke -LRB- 3 months later -RRB- . It was a pain to find them locally , they do n't sell them anymore . By the third sleepless night with my son who 'd give a HARD time to be put to bed I came here to Amazon hoping to find help.I ordered the very same shoe same size 8-9 for toddler -LRB- 3 times the price of the originals -RRB- they took 2 weeks to arrive . His size now varies between 9 and 9.5 . They were really tight -LRB- of course -RRB- and he did n't want them ! So I came back and ordered him size 10-11 , surprise ! THEY 'RE HUGE!In my desperation I had to submerge the 8-9 in warm water ... to stretch them , I took newspapers and shoved them inside the shoes and kept changing the warm water . It took 3 days but the shoes FINALLY stretched enough for him to find them comfortable to wear.He 's back wearing them ; meanwhile his foot is growing as I 'm typing here . And yet no shoe sized 9-10 that resembles this shoe at all.Oh but the worst thing is not the size , the worst thing IS THE PRICE ! -LSB- ... -RSB- ??? For rubber shoes ? Are you kidding me ? If I did n't have this emergency I would n't have bought these shoes AT ALL ! These people are deliberately taking advantage of desperate parents!As soon as I find them locally again I 'm ditching these guys , it would n't be so bad if they actually had the size of my son .
 We own several pairs of the old Crocs type slingbacks which had rivets that held the strap in place . These rivets have broken in the past and we had ordered replacements -LRB- not free may I add -RRB- . When I called today I was told that the new style Crocs have machine rivets and therefore the old style is no longer available . I find this to be extremely poor customer service .
 First time buying crocs . Thought they were supposed to be high quality . But after a few weeks of occasional wear by my 5 year old , strap broke off . Hesitant to buy a new pair , but otherwise great for summer b/c they 're close-toed and can get wet . He really liked them ... a few weeks later , we decided to try another pair and this time strap broke on very first day ! What junk . Now he 's wearing one croc from the old pair and one from the new - until those straps break too .
 I bought these crocs for my granddaughter and was very dissapointed that they were too big for her . The sizing is odd so I had to return them
 This is Amazon feedback more than Crocs feedback
 These are made in Mexico , and although it is 100 times better than having them made in China , they are defective . The cuts are not clean . They look like someone sliced them with a knife . I will keep them because it is a hassle to return them but being from CO and buying crocs since they invented them in Boulder ... I am NOT happy with these .
 Not a big fan of these shoes . After my three year old daughter fell numerous times while running in these shoes , we limit her use of them to quick trips to the pool or backyard . She is not allowed to run in them and does n't like to wear them as they make her fall down . She has a narrow foot , and perhaps this attributes to that a bit . These shoes are very wide and loose . Probably more suited to a child with wide feet or a child that does n't run and play -LRB- do they exist -RRB- ? I will not be purchasing these again , as I have found the Keen Newport to be a much better , durable , safer shoe for my child to wear all summer .
 I think I would have loved this shoe for my 3 year old , but the black buckle piece broke within an hour of her wearing it ! She was just around the house and it popped off and the inside was broken . The color was cute though . Wish Amazon had not run out so I could have exchanged them . I had to take a refund instead . Probably why they were only $ -LSB- ... -RSB- when I bought them !
 I love my work crocs so I ordered this for my daily use , and all reviews said order smaller way to big !! So I usually wear a 81/2 to 9 in shoes -LRB- on the smaller side normally -RRB- so I ordered a 8 and wow they were way to small !! And even with my foot in them it felt too unstable . Not a great choice for me : -LRB-
 We purchased these from an outlet store so perhaps they were not made properly . However I was informed that the color combination between the shoe and strap was the only difference so I am posting this review for Moms who have toddlers with wide feet . After one hour of wearing the shoes my son developed blisters on the side of both feet . We threw the shoes away . Will not buy another pair . Too bad since I liked the anti microbial aspect and breathability .
 I really do n't want to sound like a naysayer , but I remember reading somewhere that , due to the soft nature of these shoes , then have gotten stuck in the edge of escalators . My children are older , so I did n't worry , but my family and I saw this happen to a young boy first hand . It was quite frightening , and I hate to think of what could have happened if my husband had n't rushed over and pressed the emergency stop button on the escalator . If your child wears these , please take caution to keep his/her feet away from the sides of escalators .
 I was very disappointed with this crocs . It smelled so bad , it had a very strong smell , I would n't let my baby girl wear it as I 'm sure it 's very toxic . I ordered this crocs in Fuschia color size 6-7 and I was really excited to try it on my daughter , but I guess it 's going directly to the trash . I can not return it , cuz I do n't live in the US , and returning it would cost me as much as it costs . . very very unhappy with this order . .
 I ordered blue croc , but I got chocolate color.My son was upset , since blue is his favorite color.I did n't want to take trouble returning it and exchanging it.But we were not happy about it .
 I ordered these Croc shoes for my daughter in July , and she wore them 3 times and the strap ripped
 The croc buttons were not snapped together tightly . She was heart broken but without the straps she ca n't keep them on her feet . I saved three of the buttons but no such luck on the first one that came off .
 Not sure what happened to the Crocs brand , however , the quality definitely is NOT the same as it has been . My 2 year old son wore this pair only a few times before the back strap broke off and it can not be repaired.Basically it was a waste of money and I will have to look for an alternative brand that has n't allowed their quality of product to drop .
 I BOUGHT THIS CROCS FOR MY 2 1/2 YEARS BOY AND I CHOOSE THE 4-5 M US TODDLER . WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT DID N'T FIT HIM CAUSE IT IS TOO SMALL . THE SIZE CHART IS TOTALLY INCORRECT
 Well they are crocks . and the color is not what I expected . Burst is highlighter yellow ! I was expecting more of a butter color judging by the photo . I read the sizing chart and ordered my toddler a size 8/9 his normal shoe size is a 7 . Well he most likely will not be wearing these at all ! By the time he fits in them it will be winter ! Ugh so frustrating !! But the quality of the product is wonderful . Despite the color mix up i really wish his feet would fit into these !!
 My son has been wearing crocs for years . He has worn the classic style . I thought this would just be the next size up . But the sizing seemed off . We ordered a boys size 2 . The size 2 was about 1/4 inch longer than the size 1 that he had outgrown . But the width was 3/4 of an inch wider in the heel area , at least and equally wide or wider in the toe area . The size was described by Amazon as Medium or M. I looked up the same shoe on the crocs.com website and it was described as their `` roomiest '' or widest fit of the three fit styles they listed . So I think this shoe should be listed as a W or Wide not medium , especially since Crocs run wide anyway . I had my son put one old shoe on and one new shoe on and took a picture . I was hoping to be able to post the picture so that potential buyers could see how wide this shoe is . This shoe would probably fit a kid with short toes and very wide or chubby feet . I am returning them as they do not fit my child 's average size 2 foot .
 While I had high hopes for these shoes , I can not recommend them for little toddlers at least . My daughter , who is 2 1/2 , stopped constantly to get out bits of grass , sand , and rocks that came in the holes around the sides . Not fun ! However , I also bought some crocs with a crocband around this problem area , which are perfect and never do this , so I recommend buying some of those instead !
 Have worn these shoes for year . Am only sorry that they do n't come in wide and are no longer in stores .
 I have two pairs of G Brutinis boots and this is the third one I purchased . I am rather disappointed because the right boot is noticeably smaller than the left one . I decided to keep them and use wearing thin socks only ... . I even wondered if my right foot is larger than the left one but the problem clearly lies with the boots , not my feet ... . Since the boots are made in China , perhaps their population has feet that do not match - ca n't tell as I have never been there ... Will I be willing to purchase another pair ? I rather doubt ...
 First off , the bottom sole is very slippery , MUST BE VERY CAREFUL , otherwise you will slip and fall very easily -LRB- a black rubber sole would be more adequate -RRB- ; secondly , it makes a lot of LOUD noise as you walk , -LRB- did you ever hear and hate those noises from the shoes/boots from those ladies walking somewhere down the hall , you would keep hearing tock , tock , tock , tock ... -RRB- well this boots will certainly give you those noise . Thirdly , it is a little bit loose around the top opening , which does n't give you a tight grip onto your ankle , therefore when you walk , it feel loosen , and thus these boots , in my opinion , are not made for wearing everyday , for walking ... running errands ... etc. . They are only looking good for showing up at a special occasion or wedding party for maybe 1-2 minutes top . If you wear them longer than that , you will suffer the consequences . Got my point . -LRB- they are sitting on my shoe-rack collecting dust already , I only wore them approximately 1-times -RRB- -LRB- now , you may be asking , why would n't I return them ? right ? Good question , the answer is very simple , when you put them on and walk around the house for lets say , 1-minute to try them out , the bottom sole paint chipped ... it shows sign of `` wear and tear '' so that way you just ca n't return them -RRB- . -LRB- I already went to -LSB- ... -RSB- and bought myself another wear-it-everyday pairs of boots , real leather for even cheaper price -RRB- .
 THE BOOTS HAVE PROBLEMS
 The center section of the sole on the boot cracked from left side across to the right side . It cracked and split where the sole bends as you walk . Bad decission on my part to buy these boots . Will not happen again .
 Based on the description ` dress boot ' , I was expecting something I could wear to work here in New York . I 've seen some Amazon customers refer to these as Beatle Boots . That 's an apt and better description . Guys - these boots are great if you want some sort of retro-mod 60 's fashion boot to wear with paisley pants but they are not men 's dress fashion in the 2010 's appropriate for the office . They kind of look like girls ' boots as the toe narrows to a tip and whoa , these babies have heels . Euro-dress boot at best . They should call them something other than Dress Boot for USA . The word `` Dress '' threw me off completely . And , finally , between the tapered toe and the heel , they make your foot look tapered , small and feminine , and I am a 9 1/2 . Need I say more - Return .
 they were in perfect shape it just doesnt seem like they should fit like that -LRB- not the sellers fault -RRB-

 I tried to order these crocs two different times and both times I was sent the wrong thing . I spoke to someone about it and they told me they would get back with me but they never did . I wo n't ever waste my time or tell anyone I know to use this service . I understand mistakes happen but if a company refuses to make good on their promise then I have no use for them .
 I have weak ankles , and decided that I needed to wear high top sneakers to give me some support . Years ago , I wore Reeboks exclusively , in many different styles , and never had any problems with sizing . I had read some of the reviews that noted that the shoes ran narrow , but I figured that I would try them anyhow.The shoes arrived yesterday . I liked the sneaker , and the way that they were made . Problem was , that after just one look , I knew that they were not for me . They were n't a little narrow , but so narrow that it was obvious , to the naked eye , that these sneakers would not fit . I tried one on , and was just about able to squeeze my foot into them . Walk in them , forget it.There way no way that I could wear them . Some people had suggested buying a larger size , but I was afraid that it would not work . They still would be narrow , and too long.I have looked all over the internet , for a basic , white hightop , at a reasonable price . Apparently anything that I have seen are either very expensive , or come in garish colors only . Any suggestions ?
 i had to return these shoes . Reebok quality seems to be slipping . Also , they were narrow instead of medium in width.T . Hancock
 this purchase turned into a disaster because Bealls sent me the shoes with a security device fastened to them necessitating having to immediately send them back to Bealls for removal and increasing the cost of the postage which did not make them a good buy at that point . I returned them and will not order from this company again .
 Esperaba otra calidad , es muy aspero el material y del dise & ntilde ; o. . ni hablar ! Definitivamente , no lo recomiendo .
 The moment I slipped these on , I knew they were going back . The thong upper with all the stone decorations , was stiff and uncomfortable .
 Extremely hard lower boot leather . It caused a bleeding blister in less than 20 min wearing it . The shoe is VERY wide , so if you have a normal size ankle and not obese , you foot will `` swim '' inside of these boots . I 've own at least 10 pairs made by Kenneth Cole and all the Italian shoes were excellent quality and very comfortable . These Romanian made pleather-looking shoes are just not Italian quality .
 These shoes are not made in America , they are made in India . The sizing is off , an 8.5 2E is more like a size 7.5 narrow . And they are NOT made of leather . The printing inside the shoe says that only the `` soles '' are made of leather , the rest are `` man-made materials . '' They are the poorest quality shoe I have ever seen.When I bought these shoes the description said `` Stacy Adams and men who know style have been a perfect fit for over 100 years . Founded in 1875 in Brockton , Massachusetts by William H. Stacy and Henry L. Adams , the Stacy Adams Shoe Company has long been a part of American culture . '' They want you to think that they are made in America by Americans who have a 135 + year history and actually care about the product but that 's a lie ! They are really made in India , and very poorly made of sub-standard materials.And just in case they change the description after my complaint , here 's more of what the original description read when I bought this garbage in January , 2012
 the shoes look great but are not much for comfort . When I bought them I was looking for a comfortable shoe to wear on my vacation there will be alot of walking involved but I guess these are not the shoes . They are my correct size but they hurt my feet if worn for to long .
 I 've sworn by Adidas for years . Tennis shoes , trail runners , and basketball shoes . They always fit perfect and last forever ... until I bought the T7 ATS Trail Shoe . My very first run yielded a small tear in the fragile mesh covering the toes . The very next run resulted in the sole of the shoe beginning to peal off near the ball of the foot . I was shocked . I 've been able to stop the damage , at least temporarily , with shoe goo , but I have a pair of Adidas Estes trail runners almost 10 years old that have needed no mending . I 've put them through the paces in Africa twice and back to Colorado . I may put these new T7 's out to pasture and go back to my old ones . Do n't buy these . They look good but may tear from looking at them too hard .
 This is the worst pair of tennis shoes I ever bought . I dont know why but the box and even the shoes came with a rare and not confortable smell . The materials used in the fabrication of the product are not the best or the appropiate . I think this are not Kenneth Cole Original Shoes . First of all they are made in China and second the quality is really under other kenneth cole shoes . I hope you take in consideration my review . I do n't want to damage anybody , but it ` s just my experience . Hope it ` ll help other costumers . Thank you .
 STILE = GREAT , BRAND = GREAT CONFORTABLE = NO WAY . . SHOES ARE HARD AS A STONE.I 'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THESE SHOES ... MUST OF MY SHOES ARE FROM THIS BRAND MARK ... BUT THIS ONE . . I CANT RATE AS ALWAYS .
 I am usually very satisfied with Timberland products , especially for their durability , but this shoe is a real disappointment . The term `` hiker '' in the name could n't be more wrong . Granted , this is a great product for regular walking , and if you do a lot of city walking , then I would highly recommend this shoe because it 's fast , form fitting , and very comfortable . As an aside , this product is shipped with shoelaces that are way too long , and are made of a heavy and slippery material that causes them to untie very easily . That 's not a true product defect , but prepare to buy new laces if you order these shoes . Otherwise , at first glance this appears to be a quality Timberland product.But that 's for city walking only , or maybe light trails at best . I enjoyed this shoe for regular daily use for a couple of months , but then I went on an actual hike , on a real trail in the woods , and unknowingly inflicted catastrophic damage to this `` hiking '' shoe . At some point I scraped up against something with an edge , a rock or a stick , but this was such a minor occurrence that I did n't even notice when it happened . But later I looked down to find that with every step , large wads of down were squirting out of the side of one of the shoes . I had torn a hole in the fabric portion . Since this happened on a typical hike on a typical forest trail , in a very minor mishap that I did n't even notice , then that tells you that this shoe is way too fragile for the `` hiking '' that is implied in the product name . Meanwhile , the damaged shoe appears to be un-repairable unless I get it done by a professional seamstress , and probably at great cost . No adhesive-based repair that I can think of is working , because the fabric is a non-stick vinyl-like material . So I went on one extremely non-hazardous hike , and probably ruined this `` hiking '' shoe forever . For the folks at Timberland , I recommend that they change the name of this product and advertise how fragile it is . For the consumer , I would recommend this shoe only for pavement in town . -LSB- ~ doomsdayer520 ~ -RSB-
 I did not like the silver color , my son said that it looks like robot shoes . I wish it was white .
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .
 el producto aun no ha llegado al lugar de destino , tiene mas de un mes de retraso y aun no ha sido despachado para recibirlo en mi local ...
 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 After waiting over 2 weeks and shoes did not arrive , I contacted the company to track the package , but I was informed that the package could not be tracked and it must have been lost in shipment . The ahoes are no longer in stock , so now I must wait for money to be credited back to my account which they say may take up to 2 more weeks . This was a very disappointing experience with poor service . I do not plan to order from them in the future .

 Good delivery , easy return , beautiful shoes , but they do n't fit me . Soft , nice leather , very nicely made . Gaped a bit widely at the front , at the ball of my foot , when I took a step . But , I doubt it was the shoe , think it is my feet .
 The size is correct for me but since it is not very comfortable and the scrap is hard so I have to return it .
 This is a very attractive shoe but it lacks any type of support for the arch or ball of the foot . The footbed is very hard . It is an attractive round-toe style which I really liked . Too bad it would be very hard to wear over the long haul .
 I was desperate for a new pair of work shoes ; I have purchased this Mary Jane from Propet before however the sizing on this was so wide it gapped when I put it on with thick socks . Had a hectic schedule at work and missed the short return period which was barely thirty days . Better to go to Zappos .
 I purchased these boots and wore them from october to december . This is not very long and on my right foot I have a huge hole in the sole now I can no longer wear them .
 They look good and qualilty appears decent , BUT they run small ... I wear 8.5 and the 9 is tight . In addition , the top portion , which reaches the calf is too tight and mind you I 'm 5 ' 6 '' about 145 lbs , so I am very average in size . You have to be a stick figure to wear these boots ... very disappointing .
 I typically wear size 6.5 in women 's shoes but at times I 'd order a 7 because my feed are wide . I ordered a 7 in these boots and felt my toes crammed against the tip of the boot . This has never happened to me before . I had to return the boot and end up paying for shipping . I was n't allowed to exchange for a bigger size .
 Was totaly surprized by the quality of these boots !! MAYBE THEY ARE KNOCK-OFFS ! A Bearpaw box I have never seen too ! Flimsy is what they are !! I have alot of Bearpaw Boots - these are crap !
 Well , i returned them , they suppost to run small so I ordered one size bigger , but they were too big for me , in the calve they were too tight and the sole were kind of soft . Did n't like them at all .
 The sizing is off on these boots . I usually wear a size 9 , but these were too small for me in size 9 . They were also too big for my daughter who usually wears a size 8 . I think the size 10 would be too big for me . So , these boots just do n't fit at all .
 my mom wears 6 or 6.5 , I ordered 7 , still tight ... returned it annd I had to pay for the return shipping because Amazon decided it 's my fault that I chosen the wrong size ... . disappointed !
 I love my boots but almost returned them for another pair as the stitching on one side of them is not right there is a coupe inches on the side seam that is white and they should be all black . I had already returned a pair of the taller boot as they were to tight around my calves so got the shorter one which I love . I guess I will just try to color in the stitching as I really do n't want to return them again and wait for another pair ... even tho I still have not worn them . But I do love them ! Thanks
 The boots had a strong chemical scent , my daughter did not like them , so I returned the boots . It cost me $ 18 to ship them back and then the company charges $ 8 to reshelf them ... so I paid $ 26 for an item that was returned . Needless to say , will stay away from this company in the future .
 THESE BOOTS ARE MUCH TOO DIFFICULT TO PUT ON AND TAKE OFF . I HAVE RETURNED THEM FOR A REFUND .
 found it very very hard to reach anyone in customer service to return the item . of course they had all excuses . i wo n't shop again
 Had to return these . I purchased these for my wife in a size 10 , she wears a9 1/2 , and they were so tight she immediately sent them back.Wish we could have something positive to say about them , but ... not possible .
 The boot looks just as it is shown and the fit was true to size . No extra room , so there is no forgiveness . If you really need the next size up , by all means order it . It 's a fairly good imitation of the name brand `` U '' , however , the suede is not as soft as sheepskin and somehow misses the mark as a result . I did like the non-slip soles , but the thickness tends to weigh down the boot . All in all , the boot is OK , but I sent it back . I will probably keep using the boots I have now and look for a less trendy , classier style next season .

 Length :

 Item was advertised as Quarry Beige the seller sent Quarry . Was disappointment that item was not sent as advertised .
 Very uncomfortable . The strap near the toes cuts into the feet , and creates severe blisters . Very disappointing .
 The style is cute but the shoe is not at all comfortable if you need to walk around much during the day . It 's a little narrow and pinches on the front sides . I returned these .
 they were quite stiff and took a while to get used to . not my favorite .
 Birks are the only shoes I can wear due to neuropathy / arthritis . I was so excited when I received these . I rarely wear these because the top straps are floppy and due to no feeling in my feet I ca n't get my toes under them . I have several other pairs of Arizonas & they are quite easy to get on becase these upper straps are stiff & stand up . I am very disappointed with these .
 Thought these were cute , especially when I need a lower heel . Unfortunately , they were very ` hard ' and I returned them .
 I bought this shoe for halloween and did not ware them due to the pain they caused . The front of the shoe was too short and my toes were squashed . Cute shoe
 I had to return this item . The shoes were too narrow and pointy for my wide feet .
 My daughter loves this coat and rainboot combo , but the coat is very cheaply made . It 's so poorly made that in taking it out of the plastic wrap around it , one of the ears pulled right off . My daughter did n't want me to send it back for a new one because she did n't want to wait so we just used black tape to put the ear back on but I have to redo the tape every two or three times she wears it . I would not purchase this brand ever again . I usually buy Kidorable brand rain coats and boots and get a few years out of them . I purchased the WC one because of the pattern and ordered my son a Kidorable one . They both arrived within a few days of each other and this WC dalmation coat is so much flimsier feeling that the Kidorable one . Despite the fact that it is flimsier it was actually more expensive than the other one . No bargain here . The only reason I even give it two stars is becasue the pattern is so cute we are often complimented on it .
 I 'm looking for a new pair of Sperry Docksider tremont kiltie tassel loafers . I own them already and know what they look like This product says Hush Puppies , but the picture is the Sperry product , and the reviews are for the Sperry product . I do n't know if this an Amazon problem or a vendor problem , but I do n't want to take the chance .
 I just got my Hush puppies shoes . Delivery time was ok , packaging it could be better but I do not complain , shoe size correct , nice looking with good leather quality . However I rate it two because I expected a comfortable shoe as well and this is not the one . Your heel hurts after walking for a while . If you are looking for comfort do not try this model .
 this shoes are the only one that in my life are bigger than my feet . they say 14 and the look like 16 . why you make your own tyoe of shoes and not standarize sizes .
 The Sperry topsiders were of far lower quality than the ones they were replacing . They turned my white socks brown . No rain , never got wet . Wore them twice ; never again . They also did not have any eyelets on the holes with the lacing . Really poor overall quality.The seller was great ; sent me a mailing label and a prompt refund .
 These shoes are very cute at first glance but once you put them on , the buckle rubs against your foot and causes really painful blisters . This shoe is poorly designed . I love Sam Edelman shoes but this one is the WORST . You ca n't even walk in them without having extreme pain from the buckle rubbing against your foot and causing severe blisters . I wish I could return them . Not worth the money .
 Ok , I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother . I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color . I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes . Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones , The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2 . WTF ? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time . Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift . The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA .
 A few years back -LRB- though it seems like forever ago -RRB- , I was in graduate school for anthropology . I was the studious type and had gone straight from college to grad school , so I 'd never had time for a girlfriend . Sure , I 'd had my dalliances , but when it came down to it my only sustained love was anthropology . It was Spring Break , and I 'd gotten a grant to travel to the Oaxaca region of Mexico and study the indigenous Zoque tribe . Figuring I 'd need a sturdy pair of sneakers and impressed with the rubber shell toe design , I ordered a pair of Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoes -LRB- White/Black -RRB- on Amazon . They arrived the morning of my flight.That day I flew to Mexico City and then took a bus to the city of Oaxaca , where I transferred to another bus to get to the base of Monte Alban . I then climbed Monte Alban to reach the peak , where I 'd read the Zoque tribe could be found . At this point I 'd been on my feet for nearly 16 hours , but I had nary a blister or even a foot ache to speak of . I was beginning to really like my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . But they were caked in dirt and I was getting tired , so I decided to take a break at the summit . As I was about to wash my sneakers in a puddle of water , I heard a rustling of leaves . I looked up and all of a sudden 10 Zoque warriors were surrounding me , spears drawn . I knew a few Zoque phrases from my studies , so I told them , `` Tuk ` ay Tum , '' -LRB- `` I am your friend '' -RRB- but perhaps my dialect was off because that only enraged the warriors more . Soon , the Zoque Chieftan had his spear within an inch of my throat . At that moment , I was certain I would die right there in my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs.But just then , a female hand grabbed the spear and threw it on the ground . I looked up , and standing in the golden sunlight was the most beautiful girl I 'd ever laid eyes on . Her tawny skin glistened like a lake on a cool summer night , her jet-black hair was so soft it made horses jealous , and her eyes were like two perfect almonds . `` I Almika , '' she said , gesturing toward herelf . `` I Dan , '' I timorously replied , awestruck by her beauty . `` Why joo here ? '' Almika asked innocently . `` Study , '' I answered . `` Joo study Zuque ? '' Almika continued . I nodded in the affirmative . At this , Almika 's eyes beamed with excitement . She said something in Zuque that made the warriors lower their spears.Relieved and relaxed , I strolled with Almika toward the Zuque encampment . Between her limited English , my limited Zuque and some hand gestures , we were able to communicate with one another . I learned that she enjoyed weaving and playing traditional Zuque songs on her ocarina , and more importantly that she was looking for a man but was having trouble finding one in her tribe . It was important to her that a man be brave and strong , as many men in her tribe were , but she also wanted a man who was cultured and could show her the world beyond Monte Alban . It was clear to her that I was worldly , but in order to win her heart I knew I 'd have to prove that I was brave and strong . So that night as I fell asleep on my straw bed in the encampment , my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs still caked in dirt , I resolved to show her that I was tough.I rose early and quickly learned that the Zuque men were setting out to fetch firewood . I waved to Almika and then followed them into the woods . Fortunately , I 'd had some experience gathering wood for the fireplace at my parents ' country house in Massachusetts . So I quickly noticed the dry pieces of wood , which impressed the Zuque men . When we returned to camp at midday , I had a haul of firewood in my hands as I espied Almika roasting a cob of maize over a tiny flame . `` Better fire '' I said , and threw some of my wood onto the fire . The sudden burst of flames frightened Almika and she dropped her maize on the ground . Without flinching , I picked it up and held it near the enlarged fire . When it was perfectly crisped , I proudly handed the cob of maize back to her . Beaming , Almika bit into the maize and exclaimed `` Ees tasty ! `` The rest of the afternoon was spent helping the Zuque men fix up one of the elders ' adobes . My repair skills honed on D-I-Y projects with my Dad at our country house in Massachusetts came in handy here . I impressed the Zuque men by patching up a small hole in the roof using some Trident chewing gum I 'd brought in my backpack . When we returned to camp at dusk , the men relayed tales of my handiwork to Almika , who smiled and locked her piercing brown eyes with mine . She walked toward me and we sat on two boulders around the fire during the communal tribe dinner of rattlesnake stew , flirting and laughing all the while.As dinner was winding down , I had my arm around Almika and was about to suggest we take things to an empty hut on the periphery of the encampment . But just then , we heard the shriek of a Zuque child . I looked over and racing toward us was a gigantic jaguar galloping at full speed . Instinctively , I grabbed a bow that was lying next to me and loaded it with an arrow . I 'd learned archery at day camp near my parents ' house in Massachusetts . My parents did n't want me to go because they thought the camp was run by a bunch of ne'er - do-well Hippies , but fortunately I convinced them to let me go . I pulled the bow string back , and released . It was so dark I could barely see what had happened . But then I heard the noise - first a whisper and then a full-on chant `` Dan ! Dan ! DAN ! DAN ! DAAAAN ! '' and when I looked closely , I saw that I 'd hit the jaguar squarely between the eyes ! Almika ran up to me and gave me a bear hug . I held her and just wanted to be with her , but jaguar blood was everywhere - on my arms , on my legs , and on my already dirt-caked Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .
 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 super cute , but really cheaply made . we bought them for christmas and they are falling apart . not worth the $
 Purchased these for my 6 year old niece who goes to private school , so only wore them infrequently . After only two months , the sole has separated from the boot base ; very disappointing . The boots were worn in Arizona so it 's not like wet or snowy weather impacted the wear . Save your money and just by Uggs , the may be expensive but will last much longer .
 I just got my Hush puppies shoes . Delivery time was ok , packaging it could be better but I do not complain , shoe size correct , nice looking with good leather quality .

I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .
 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 I 'm looking for a new pair of Sperry Docksider tremont kiltie tassel loafers . I own them already and know what they look like This product says Hush Puppies , but the picture is the Sperry product , and the reviews are for the Sperry product . I do n't know if this an Amazon problem or a vendor problem , but I do n't want to take the chance .
 I just got my Hush puppies shoes . Delivery time was ok , packaging it could be better but I do not complain , shoe size correct , nice looking with good leather quality . However I rate it two because I expected a comfortable shoe as well and this is not the one . Your heel hurts after walking for a while . If you are looking for comfort do not try this model .
 this shoes are the only one that in my life are bigger than my feet . they say 14 and the look like 16 . why you make your own tyoe of shoes and not standarize sizes .
 The Sperry topsiders were of far lower quality than the ones they were replacing . They turned my white socks brown . No rain , never got wet . Wore them twice ; never again . They also did not have any eyelets on the holes with the lacing . Really poor overall quality.The seller was great ; sent me a mailing label and a prompt refund .

 This boot looks good and is comfortable to wear ; but after a very short time several months light wear ... the soles began to disintegrate to my surprise ... what third world sweat shop created this mess -- where is quality ? and how could they sell such a shoddy product ? I was appalled . I had to throw it away along with my money !!
 These boots are advertised as leather but the uper patches are man made . Feels like I 'm wearing a pair of rubber boots . On the flip side , the arch and heel are perfect ... Just disappointed that Bandolino would not make a full leather boot and that Amazon has not properly communicate the specs .
 I purchased this with an expectation that Adidas brand stood for quality , but was dissappointed with how unsubstantive the shoe itself was . I believed it was on a sale price due to the color -LRB- a rather obnoxious orangy-red that my wife cringed at -RRB- and I was willing to live with for training in . But it think i would have been as comfortable and supported if I had strapped the shoebox to each foot .
 I returned this shoe after I tried it . quite narrow , and not comfortable .
 I ordered 3 $ 9.99 each on sale by Amazon.com & i returned all three because the quality is terrible and look cheap !!
 the shoes were n't comfortable and they do n't look as good as they did on the computer
 When I ordered these in early Jan/08 , they were for just over $ 50 . I see that they are now at $ 99 !! I was really looking forward to this `` great bargain '' . Just imagine my disappointment when opening the box yielded a plain , poorly made product . There are leather flaws that look like scuff marks over several parts on both shoes . The style is much more pedestrian and old school than the shiny picture suggests . At any price , this was a poor buy . I returned them on the same day without even trying them on .
 I really respect the fact that Donald J Pliner is dedicated to making comfortable shoes . However , if comfortable shoes look like this I 'll just take the sore feet ! Some of the shoes in this brand are cute , fun and sexy as well as comfortable but this is NOT one of those examples ! Reminds me of a witch shoe or something my grandma would wear ! This pointy toe thing just needs to go away ! I do n't understand what is so appealing about having your toes crunched into a cone shape and having your feet look bigger ! These do n't look comfortable , they do n't look feminine or attractive and they cost a lot of money . Oh well , I guess everyone has their own taste ! Thanks again to amazon for posting accurate photos .

 The worst fitting boot I have ever bought . I thought with the North Face name I would n't be disappointed . I usually do not make comments but I do not wish these on anyone !! I even took the sole out and bought a comfy sole , still horrible . I bought these for a trip to Canada and was absolutely miserable . I ended up throwing them away ! BIG WASTE !

 I was really looking forward to these boots ... they 've since gone to charity , after two wearings . They run EXTREMELY small ... I wear a size 7 ... I bought these in a size 7 1/2 to allow room for socks and they did n't fit , even with stockings . They were a great deal and so not worth the shipping to return them . They are as pretty as the picture , but highly disappointing in the fit . They were very narrow and the heel was hard to walk on -LRB- might have been the fit -RRB- . Since I buy everything from Amazon , these seemed like a good bet , however I might not buy shoes by mail anymore based on the disappointing outcome of this purchase .
 this particular boot I wanted a comfortable one but instead is stiff on top and I get too tired when walking . .
 Look great , the foot fits wonderfully , but a bit too snug around the calf . When pulling the shaft to its full height , almost cant zip and I do n't have large legs ! HOwever , I can wear them if I scrunch them down a bit ... would have returned them but didnt want to pay the shipping fee for that .
 I was surprised these were made by Dr. Scholl 's because they were very uncomfortable , as soon as I put them on . I had my daughter try them -LRB- we wear the same shoe size -RRB- and they hurt her feet immediately too . I returned them . The two stars I gave are because they did look nice .
 I bought a pair because of the good reviews . Well , they look good , but they are not very comfortable as others said . It 's very hard to walk in them . If you are not super-high heels lovers , do n't buy them .

 Delivery was perfect , but the boot was too tight for my foot to go into it at all . I thought it had a zipper , did n't look at the photograph closely enough .
 these boots are great but they are heavy and extremely long so if you are short they may be above your knee .

 I bought these for my daughter who developed terrible blisters inside of ONE HOUR wearing them . I put them on myself , and I am surprised she was able to last an hour wearing them . They are horrifically uncomfortable . Hard mesh = not good on your feet .
 Boots look like they 're work boots ! Not leather ... and that fact not mentioned in description of item .
 It 's not too heavy and it 's warm enough for mild winter but if it 's below -10 C , I 'll stick to my Sorel boots.I got medium width and wore these boots with thick wool/acrylic socks . However , even with my thick socks , the boot shafts were too wide . I have to fold my already thick socks to make my calves really thick enough to fill the boots.How do you maintain the suppleness of synthetic boots ? I do n't know if being worn only a few months of the year and being kept in storage the rest of year is detrimental to synthetic shoes . My Snug boots have creases and cracks on the upper right where it bends when I bend my feet . I have a lot of other synthetic material flats and boots but they do n't have cracks.I 've noticed that when I walk on slushy snow -LRB- we have lots and lots of snow here -RRB- , my feet gets wet . I finally poured water into my boots to find out where the water is seeping in . My boots were dripping water like mini waterfalls . There was water beading up from the creases/cracks on the upper and water flowing out of the joints between the upper and the sole.Guess I 'll have to reserve wearing these boots only on DRY winter days .
 I suffer from severe swelling of my legs and feet and ordered these slippers and paid a huge premium to have them delivered on a Sunday . Not only did they not deliver them the next day , they did n't refund any of the shipping costs and waited almost a week to ship them with it taking several more days in transit . The item did n't fit so at great difficulty and pain to get to the post office to return them . Because I used Amazon 's method to return the item I have no record that the item was returned . So I do n't have the mechandise , I 'm out of pockect for the purchase price and the huge fee for sending the item next day.I 'll tell you one thing - if I ever have to return something to Amazon again I am NOT going to use the Amazon Return Authorization paperwork . It 's sad that the only recourse I have is to warn others about this vendor . But I mostly hold Amazon.com responsible for the entire problem.Sure the cost to return the item was free but who cares when I am now $ 56 out of pocket for an item that sells for $ 38.95 . Sad part is that this item was fulfilled by Amazon LLC .
 the quality of these slippers is most disappointing . i do not recommend them.i was very please with amazon 's process and will use again
 I bought these for my elderly aunt and although they were wide width they were much too narrow .
 After wearing them only once or twice , these slippers required repair . The insole came apart from the sole itself and needed gluing . At the price charged for these slippers , and given the company 's reputation , I expected much higher quality and a reasonable period of problem-free wear .
 disappointing product . This is not the Daniel Green slipper I remember from the past . Not soft nor flexible . Very uncomfortable . Had to put foam insoles in to tolerate walking in them .
 Due to a recent injury , and a very swollen foot , I ordered WW width . I was hoping to have something that I could get on my foot , since this will take a long time to heal . The slippers that came are actually more narrow than a regular width ! The box label says WW but they are FAR far from it . I am NOT impressed . BEWARE !
 Size is totally WRONG !!!! Ordered another 8N in a different color and it fits fine . This product is defective and should not be sent to any other customer . .
 Sides of slippers bowed out . They were extremely uncomfortable as there was NO padding at all in the sole . Obviously I returned them .

 The boots look good . The designs might fall off since its glued on the boots . For ppl who have big calves , the width is not big enough even with the adjustment . It wo n't pull up at all .

 I have been wearing these shoes for about 4 months . They are good looking but feel cheaper than the shoes I replaced made by Nike Air -- which also was more expensive than this pair of Adidas . I would probably not buy this shoe again.Nothing compares to a great running shoe with cushion inside to protect your foot as it hits the pavement . I feel like this Adidas has no cushion and that my foot is not protected . Also , the Nike shoes were purchased at a running store which is the really best place to buy them .

 This boot only lasted me 2 months wearing them every other day . The zippers splits apart . It is not water proof and the air pocket on the bottom popped . Do n't waist your time or money .
 Walking around on to 12 hr shifts and the top of the boot kept rubbing near the zippers latch . It 's a shame I used the Under Armor boots -LRB- new on the market -RRB- and they were great right from the start .
 When I first got these shoes , I loved them . They were cute , comfy and a good fit . Within a few days , I noticed they seemed to be a little large after all . After a week or so , I realized they were stretching and were quite loose . But they stayed on my feet -LRB- kind of -RRB- , so I kept wearing them . After a few weeks , they had stretched so much that I could no longer wear them - and then I noticed that the heels had worn half-way down and there were actual holes developing in the bottoms ! This is after less than a month of wearing -LRB- and I 'm not mountain-climbing in them either -RRB- . I called the seller -LRB- Footsmart -RRB- and they said they would not take the shoes back as defective since they had been worn , but gave me the manufacturer 's number . The manufacturer said they had a warranty , so I reported the problem . When I did n't hear back , I tried again . I was told it would take two weeks to receive a response . I waited two weeks -LRB- I work for a manufacturer - we respond to customer complaints within one business day -RRB- . No response . Several calls and one month later , I am still waiting to receive a mailing label so I can send the shoes to the manufacturer for evaluation . I will update this if I do receive a satisfactory solution at any point , but as of now , I would say to stay away from these shoes !
 This was without a doght the worst pair of shoes I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to purchase . First they were ugly , second they were way too tight , and last they would never be something I would buy . It cost $ 10 to return and I could not have worn them if I wanted to . This was false advertising if there ever was one .
 The quality of the shoe was good , but I returned them because the fit in the heel was too wide . Slipped up and down when I tried to walk .
 I 'm a size 9 , through and through , and I 've never had the problems with other shoes that I had with these . Do n't get me wrong - I 'm a Softspots fan , but these shoes are not well-designed . I tried these on and could n't take more than 2 steps in them , they hurt my feet so badly . When the shoe bends as you 're walking , the strips on top come together to pinch the skin on the top of my foot .
 These shoes look great but stretched out so much after wearing one time , they are unwearable . I contacted the seller who ignored my inquiry . I wasted my money . Not recommended .
 Softspots Women 's Trinidad Slip-OnLast year I ordered a size 9 in this shoe . It was a too big but I used a sole insert and a heel pad which solved the problem . The shoes wear well and are comfortable . This year I ordered the same shoe style in size 8 1/2 thinking it would fit perfectly . It was so tight I could not get it on . I returned the shoes and reordered a size 9 which fit but are very snug . These shoes have a strong chemical odor . I have aired them for a week with no improvement . The entire closet literally fills with this odor and I now air them in the garage . I may have to return these shoes too .
 Wasted my money on this shoe . The first day my wife wore them they fit perfectly . By the second day , they streched so much she had difficulty keeping them on her feet .
 Nine West Women 's Deltona Flat , Black ,9.5 MThey look cute and the texture it 's soft , but they are to narrow and these come from a person who does n't have wide feet . Also to big -LRB- long -RRB- ... I had to gave them away
 These shoes look pretty but that 's about all they have going for them . The leather in the heal of the shoe has the worst smell . They arrived and at first I just thought it was because they 'd been in a hot truck since it was 100 degrees outside . But the smell never went away . The shoes are n't comfortable and they slip off my feet . I normally donate my clothes and shoes that I do n't want but I would n't give these to my worst enemy ; they 're going in the garbage .
 I was thrilled to find these shoes online , as I thought they were identical to a pair of D'Orsay pumps by Anne Klein I already own and love , but to my dismay these are a higher heel and extremely uncomfortable .
 Not a lot to say , just do n't like the pointy toe on these pumps . I wear a size 9.5 and with the extra length the pointed toe gives the shoe , I just did n't like the look . Also shoes were n't comfortable .
 I was disappointed in this purchase . There is barely room for a wallet , checkbook , and a phone . For a `` medium '' size -LRB- and for the money -RRB- , I expected to fit the basics easily .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .

The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .

 I need black confortable shoes to work . I am a waitress and I have to walk non-stop , sometimes for 12 hours . I used to wear Reebok Princess Sneakers but with new uniforms , I needed something more dressy , so I bought all the &#34; comfortable shoes &#34; I could find here at Amazon . I was looking for a mary-jane look with a sneaker feel . - Ambulator By Aetrex Women 's B6000 Mary Jane , Black - I could n't even try it because it runs a number and a half small -LRB- at least -RRB- . My size is 9 or 9,1 / 2 . I bought 9M , 9wide and 9 1/2 wide . All too small . Go at least a number up . Another problem is that the insole is too high . My toes and the top of my feet were so &#34; squished &#34; against the top of the shoe that I could n't even give it a quick walk . It looks adorable , - Propet Women 's W3851 Wash & Wear Slip-On - The back is too high so it cuts/rubs on your leg when you walk . Overall uncomfortable . A lot of pressure on your feet overall , sides and top . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 W for me -RRB- - Propet Women 's W0029 Mary Jane Walker - Good support all around , long strap on top , good looking but not enough cushion to walk for 12 hours . fits true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 for me -RRB- . As they did not have it in wide , it makes too much pressure on the front of the foot , just before the toes . - Drew Shoe Women 's Rose Mary Jane , Black Calf/Black Stretch , - Too high where the strap comes out , it hurts as soon as you put it on . It looks so comfortable is the worst offender . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 , 1/2 W -RRB- - Clarks Women 's Wave.Cruise Mary Jane Flat , Black ,9.5 W US - It feels like it is missing half of the sole ! It feels like just the outer part of the sole is on , and the other half is missing , making your foot lean towards the inside . Crazy ! It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .
 i have 5-inch platform high-heel boots that are stable and look great ... and i have THESE things that wobble and look clownish rather than wicked.the point on the toe is too long , looking clownish/awkward rather than wicked . and they are a bit wide . So if you get them , get them a 1/2 size smaller than you 'd usually get.and i danced in them for a single night , and the plastic black thing on the point on the high heel got worn down to an angle such that they do n't stand up streight anymore and i 'm not sure i can wear them again.they are uncomfortable -LRB- compared to other wicked high-heel boots -RRB- , they do n't look good -LRB- they look awkward/clownish -RRB- and they fall apart after a single use.no more ellie shoes for me . i got shoes from spike angel . they cost the same and look much better , and are actually more comfortable than some flats i own .

They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .

 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .
 Ordered 2 for my sister and wife . Sizes are 1 full size smaller than US standard . Has to exchange the item . Be careful ... Thanks / .
 These run really , really small , even compared to other Asics shoes .
 I was really excited to get these boots in . They were ADORABLE ! Then I tried them on ... . not so good . I have muscular calves and I could not zip them all the way up . I 've had this problem before , but after reading about the boots , I thought they would be ok.I was highly impressed on how quickly the boots got to me ... however , I sent them back right before Christmas and I am still waiting for my credit on the return . So that too was disappointing .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!

 I love these shoes ! They are cute , comfortable , and I get compliments every time I wear them . Unfortunately , the quality is terrible . After the second wearing , the `` patent leather '' began flaking off . The trend has continued and a good bit of the `` patent leather '' has flaked off the sides . I am sad , but I still wear them , they 're too cute not to !
 This shoe is pretty disappointing . It is not as cute as it looks in the picture -LRB- the toe of the shoe is much more square -RRB- , and it has absolutely no support and the toe box pinches your toes . I would not recommend this shoe .
 I would not recommend this product . In receiving the shoes the white stripes were a pale yellow making the shoes look cheap and old . I know this is not how the shoes were suppose to look and was very disappointed !
 I 've never bled like I did with these shoes . I commute to work which consists of taking 2 trains to the city everyday . After about 15 minutes of walking I limped into the closest drug store to buy a box of band-aids to cover the cuts on both my feet . Never in my life have I ever experienced pain like that before with FLATS of all shoes . I immediately returned them that evening when I got home . Luckily I had an extra pair of shoes at work but the damage to my feet was done already . NEVER AGAIN will I buy her shoes .
 I ordered them in black , and they came in thus ugly blue and cream color . I have to wear black shoes at work . So of course I tried exchanging them , got told that I have to get a refund and purchase the black ones ... ok.so someone was supposed to come and pick them up and I was supposed to get a refund . No one ever came and got them , do I 'm stuck with some ugly shoes that I will never wear . I 'm NEVER ordering shoes from Amazon again . Also , I prefer to speak to someone on the phone that speaks English , not Indian English . I ca n't understand those people . VERY disappointed in the shoes and even more so in the service I got .
 I had these same shoes a year or two ago , bought as macy 's . Only difference was the first pair had a suede toe . Those were so awesome I wanted a second pair now that I had a baby and my feet grew 1/2 size . I thought it was safe to buy these online and was dissappointed to find that the toes of these were not normal - they edge up towards the sky . I thought maybe it would just take breaking them in , but now months later feel I was sent an off pair . They fit fine , just a bit strange with the elf-toe thing . Would n't recommend buying these online again . And if they changed the manufacturing with the line , I would n't recommend buying them at all .

 I 'll start out with the statement that this is a good shoe . It fits well and the build quality is fine . It 's comfortable and the shape is great.The major problem I have with the shoe is that there is quite a bit of a very , uh , bright bronze on the toe and side `` stripe '' and lace area of the shoe . The pictures at Amazon.com do not come close to representing it correctly . My sister had ballet slippers that looked just like these areas . It 's as bright as a new penny . More copper than bronze . I took a dremel tool with a buffing wheel and got this paint off . I would n't recommend anybody else try it . It took a long time -LRB- I did it while watching a game on TV -RRB- , but it at least makes the shoe wearable.Be very aware that the toe , side stripe , and laces area are all a very bright copper .

 The Sole of the shoe is coming off at the heel . Wrote to Keen and sent pics . And I will update this review depending on their response . I had them for about three months . I was hoping they would last for three years . Keen failed me !!!! I was such a believer . now i 'm crushed .

 My daughter was very happy with the shoes when she first got them . She wore them often but not unusually so . She showed me a couple of weeks ago that the bottom flap of the shoes have worn away and are gapping open . This request for review reminded me that we purchased them in August and it is now early November . I think with normal wear and tear shoes should last a bit longer . I would not purchase these sneakers again .
 i order this shoe june 23 , its july 26 and they havent sent my order because they dont have it , they send me wrong shoes at first to see if i like it but it wasnt even a soccer shoe.after i send it back they told me that they send the right shoes long time ago , after 2 weeks i called them again because they emaild me with the shiping confirmaion but the shoe is now here.now they say they dont have it and they keep my money so i can order another shoes !! then i talk to the manager he told me that they have refunded my money , but they didnt even refund my money . my bank says that they havent recieved any money from eastbay , but eastbay say they refunded my money less shiping and handling ??!! 2 weeks ago !!! now i have to find my money .

 The sunglasses were all bent up and the hooks hurt your ears . It is a great gift for enemies ! word
 I purchased these sunglasses because I wanted a pair of yellow lenses . I was shocked to see the size of these glasses ! These glasses almost cover my entire head . I was hoping they would be smaller . I also do not like the curved ends . The nubs at the ends bother my ears and I constantly have to adjust them to stop the irritation . I still use the sunglasses from time to time , but I am currently trying to find a better pair of yellow lenses .
 The glasses themselves are pretty flat across the front , which is somewhat different than most aviator-style glasses I have owned . It seems like the spring-like metal that goes over the ears was designed for someone who has ears half as large as mine . They dig into the back of my ears and I can not wear them for prolonged periods of time.I originally bought them to take out shooting with , but I will reserve them strictly for my Walter costume now .
 These would be fine yellow tint avaiator glasses if they had n't used vinyl for the lenses . Yes , two reeking vinyl slabs riding on your nose . Washing did n't help . I gave up and threw them away .
 The stems are short . It only fits by looping the ends around and the metal balls poke your ears and are very uncomfortable . And worst of all

 I bought and received beautiful , STINKY shoes ! They smell to the point that the first time I wore them , my date commented that there must be a refinery in the area because of the strong smell . Despite their beautiful looks , they are stinky to the point that they are unwearable . I plan to give them to a charity I do n't normally give to , and hopefully a less fortunate person with no sense of smell will like them . Terrible !
 Good
 I purchased these shoes for a New Years party . When they arrived they seemed fine . They were comfortable and had minimal odor . I only wore them the one evening . Jump ahead 2 and 1/2 months and we notice a foul odor in our house . It turns out to be the shoes , they are giving off an unbelievably strong foul odor . They are now living in the garage awaiting a trip to the dump . I would like to take this time to apologize , ahead of time , to the dump for placing such a foul odor at the dump .
 I got these shoes for my son for a school banquet , they are comfortable stylish and attractive . H was pleased with the price and he is happy with the fit . The shipment arrived in record time , and as an added bonus he placed second in the best dressed competition at the banquet .
 It was totally different from what I saw online . I returned it , because it was too shiny for my comfort .
 I would have been better off buying the $ 15 pair of shoes from Walmart . These are the single worst things I have ever put on my feet , and would not recommend anyone purchase them . Totally horrible . Not recomended .
 I 've bought more than 30 items from Amazon already but this is my first time writing a review , that means I am very disappointed by my purchase.These shoes looks and feel cheap , not stylish at all . The smell was n't much of an issue for me but the shoes are just made with very cheap material which bends and cracks very easilly . And the price is n't that cheap . Please save yourself some money and skip these shoes .

 This shoe is very cute but the fabric is so stiff and rough that it made it impossible for me to wear them for more than 1/2 hour before I took them off . I do not like to have to `` break '' a shoe in . It 's not just uncomfortable in the achilles area but around the front edge of where the fabric rubs on the foot as well . If there was some sort of padding sewn into the area under where you see the ribbon , then it would have made a big difference in the quality of the shoe . Oh well , I guess I got what I paid for .

 These shoes look great but slip on the heel making them very uncomfortable . Perhaps the toe box is too large . I returned my pair before going out of my apartment with them.linda b
 I was recommended to purchase a Ryka water shoe . I chose the slip-on hoping to save myself some money . Unfortunately the shoe was way too tight , so much that my feet cramped almost immediately and I had to finish my water aerobic class barefooted . Now I have shipped them back and will have to spend the extra bucks for the tie type . I will still purchase the Ryka water shoe - it is awesome .
 I bought these when they were $ 12.99 . Upon getting them I was really disappointed in the quality of them and wanted to send them back . Unfortunatly Amazon was going to make me pay for the shipping , so I decided to just spare the trouble and keep them . All and all in the end , I should have just paid the expense ! After wearing them only an hour , the paint on the bottoms starting peeling off and was sticking to the bottoms of my feet . At the end of the day , the sole 's looked awful and made their finnaly walk , straight to the trash ... . Save your trouble buying cheap ones on the web , when the dollar store 's are much better .

 I bought a pair in brown and black thinking that Rockport comfort with a long lasting vibram sole would be great . WRONG . Both pairs developed a loud squeak on any surface with each step . Unless you work in a noisy environment these are not the shoes for you
 The shoe is comfortable as all Rockports are , but it squeaks all the time . Bought at an outlet . Make me wonder if Rockport knew this and got rid of them at the outlet .

 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .

 I am glad that I got the opportunity to rate this product.The sneaker is fabulous and extremely good since I wear othodics . However , both times I ordered M3910 I had the leather pull away from the sole which was very discouraging . I like the sneaker so much and thought perhaps the second pair would be made better . My Podiatrist commented on how well they were made .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I 've got a pair of these shoes and was very excited , when I received them . Unfortunately they had a huge glue stain on them and were made from material imitating suede , but advertised as a suede shoes.Big disappointment for me
 these are not wide , they felt like a b width . Had to return

 I wanted a red patent shoe and I love wedges and Donald Pliner . I must say though , it is the first DP pair of shoes that is completely uncomfortable , and not up to par with the usual quality . Made in Spain , not Italy like most DP shoes . I had a cobbler stretch these and break them in a bit but it did not help much . The ties do not hold your heel in very well and my heel lifts out when I walk .
 I have a couple pair of KC Reaction shoes . They are fine . I wear a 8.5 in those . I ordered an 8.5 in this shoe and it fit me more like a 9.5 . The sizing is horrible , thus that 's why they are probably clearing it out on all online stores.So I sent the shoes back , and got a half size smaller at a local store -LRB- Nordstrom Rack -RRB- . They were STILL too big . Do n't buy this shoe unless you are ok with a sloppy fit shoe .

 I bought these because I was looking for a dress boot in a 13 Wide , and almost noone carries them in my size . The boots look nice , but the soles are very slick and can be somewhat dangerous . Also , the front of the boot fits good , but the heel and ankle are loose and do not fit snug enough for them to be comfortable for a long period of time or for walking any distance .
 I 've had these shoes for only six months and already worn off the cute little nubbins on the soles . I am not usually hard on my shoes , they will last a least a few years , but these ones might not make it to a year.They are comfy to wear , and cute as all get out . But , they just are n't built to last for even moderate wear .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 I ordered these shower shoes because I had recently had surgery and wanted to be sure I did n't slip . These slippers are slicker than the tiles . If that 's why you are buying -- do n't !
 These are comfy - they protect your feet in the shower - and are completely impractical for travel.They never dry out ! When you 're traveling and using these shoes for communal showers - you need material that dries quickly . I even held them under hand driers and blow dryers when available -LRB- often for a long time -RRB- and squeezed them in towels to no avail . They were still soaking wet . Packing a pair of wet shoes that stay wet is just a breeding ground for bacteria and general grossness.Get a cheap $ 2 pair of foam flip flops - they 'll do the job , dry fast enough and are cheap enough to toss when the travels are over .
 Decorative and lightweight . But it 's nothing more than a very large , waterproof gift bag . It 's stiff and crinkly -LRB- and loud -RRB- . For the price , you can find something better as a beach bag .
 This is a huge bag ... but the one they delivered is not the one I ordered . In fact , the pattern I received was not even pictured on the Amazon description . Quality control issues .
 I loved this bag . It was exactly what I wanted ... lightweight , roomy , water resistant . I was so disappointed to realize that after less than a month the material right next to the straps was ripping on three of the four straps ! I was using it as a pool bag so it was packed with several towels , goggles , sunscreen . Nothing heavy that would have stressed the material too much . Returned it for a refund .
 on the size chart size 39.5 corresponds to size 8.5 . On the shoe 39.7 is size 7 so the shoes are too small . They were given as a gift and now they are sitting in the closet
 These shoes were not what I expected . They were not comfortable . They were big and bulky looking , very unattractive shoes . The front of the shoe is what stands out as being too big ... -LRB- like clown shoes from the the front -RRB- . I immediately sent them back .
 The shoe tongue rubs on my ankle - very irritating . I can not wear these . I thought a 12EE would be super wide ... a shoe I could put my custom made orthotics into , but they would not fit inside and the shoe was too tight and uncomfortable . If you have any swelling around the ankle at all , these shoes are not for you.You can see in the picture how close the shoe tongue is to the back of the shoe . Too close quarters for my slightly swollen ankles .
 The shoes were as advertised , however , the toebox is not deep enough for extended walking . The toe is more shallow than in the picture , this puts pressure on the big toe . Otherwise , it is OK . Shoe is true to size .
 Large lump on innersole , would be impossible to wear these shoes for any period of time , very poor quality assurance inspection.Waste of my time to even order such garbage . Amazon shame on you for not checking the quality of the shoes you recommend and sell !
 These are cheap copies of the SAS originals . I purchased and returned a pair of these imitations . The SAS shoes were comfortable from the instant I put my feet into them . Not so the copies .
 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .

I thought a 12EE would be super wide ... a shoe I could put my custom made orthotics into , but they would not fit inside and the shoe was too tight and uncomfortable . If you have any swelling around the ankle at all , these shoes are not for you.You can see in the picture how close the shoe tongue is to the back of the shoe . Too close quarters for my slightly swollen ankles .
 Purchased shoes in late May 2010 . Did not wear them until mid 2011 . Left sole began delaminating from the shoe after 3-4 months of wear . Continued to use them and attempted to glue sole back with Shoe Goop -LRB- tm -RRB- . Did not work . Finally gave up and sent an email asking if poor quality stitching problem had been resolved since I would like to buy another pair . I have owned at least 15 pairs since 1975 and all of them have failed after 3-4 years of extremely hard wear and never once has the sole come apart . The leather usually cracks after repeated wet and dry cycles -LRB- over many years -RRB- . In other words normal wear . The latest pair very prematurely failed . Shipped them back to Sperry -LRB- at my expense -RRB- for evaluation . I do n't expect much .
 These shoes are very uncomfortable . I was extremely disappointed with what I thought would become a favorite shoe of mine . If support is what you need in footwear , search elsewhere .
 Disappointing is the word I 'd use to describe this purchase . I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old . They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft . Also , there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them . I 've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I 'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I 've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem .
 The shoe I received must have been a second or a knockoff . Quality was not that of sperry . Very disappointing . Could not return it as my son left for college the next day and needed them .
 Ordered the Wide width expecting to shoe to be at least a bit wider than an average shoe . In fact , the shoe was so narrow through the ball of the foot , felt like my foot was being squeezed . Returning this shoe immediately . Also , did n't care for the brassy gold color of the shoe lace grommets ! Very disappointed !!
 The wrong size shoes were in the correct box , box said size 11 which is what I ordered but the shoes inside are a size 13 and the seller has not got back in touch with me . Not very happy here and I paid alot of money for them .
 This shoes are not worth the price or the quality.Ive used them probably 5 months now and they seem to be breaking apart ... the shoelaces especially are most likely made out of chalk or something.Ive ordered other boat shoes from amazong without any problems at all and get complimented all the time!This just dont match up , Get another one . .
 The Sperry shoes are fine , but be careful in that what Amazon shows -LRB- a reddish brown leather with white sole -RRB- is not the shoe that is actually sent as that one is a tan shoe with a brown sole . Got these for my son 's birthday and was disappointed that what I thought we ordered was n't what we actually got . Went back and double checked to make sure I did n't just select the wrong pair , and now see that the small thumbnail image does n't match the original product page .
 I have been using Sperry Top-siders for about 40 years , always size 9.5 . These shoes arrived , marking inside said 9.5 , but there was no chance they would fit . Too small ... return . Replaced them with a pair of Timberline shoes from Amazon size 9.5 , they arrived yesterday , them fit fine .
 I 've been wearing Sperry Top-Siders in 12 wide since the early 1980s , and for well over a decade in the color Sahara.Though I specified Sahara , and what arrived was labeled Sahara , these appear to be shipped mislabeled and are actually Oatmeal -LRB- from what I can tell by comparing to online colors -RRB- . They say Sahara on the box but are not.Worse still , though they say 12 wide , my last pair was roomy in width and just right in length . This pair is tight in length and tight in width , but worse still , the left one is MUCH tighter than the right , and though I tried breaking them in for two days to see if they would stretch , this only resulted in pain and my left foot swelling up.Are they making these in China now ? That would explain so much.These are not the Sperry Top-Siders we have all worn for decades . Something is seriously wrong when a company is suddenly shipping out mislabeled products -LRB- the wrong color shoes in a box labeled as being a different color , and that most likely are also mis-labeled in size at the factory before being boxed . That 's two major errors ? I will never buy these shoes online again with these kinds of quality control issues , and will instead give Sebago boat shoes a try , ending a 30 year run with Sperry .
 I was extremely unhappy even at first when I received the shoes and saw that the insole only extended to the mid point of the shoe . It reduced support and made the inside feel rough and not very comfortable . I wore them for a time over the summer and the sole on both has split in the mid point of the front . I had owned Topsiders from Sperry before and they lasted for years , dealing with salt water from my sailing and other activities.It will be a long time before I can be convinced to buy a Sperry product again . They have obviously totally taken quality out of the equation .
 Got shoes within 2 days the whole insole cracked . It 's like there extremely old and dry rotted . Will never buy sperrys through amazon again .
 The Sperry Top-Sider in Amaretto was a far darker color than the photo on Amazon . I did not try them on , and instead , returned it hassle-free and that went well . I chose a brown/brown replacement as it looked like my next best choice , but the size seems to run small . It 's an uncomfortable fit -LRB- I decided to tough it out and not do a second return -RRB- . My feet are not hard to fit as I have bought several pairs of shoes from other manufacturers on Amazon in this same size and they fit perfectly .
 I have owned several pairs of the AO Sahara . This pair is much , much lighter in color than past purchases . I am not sure why it is not even close in color to others I have owned and those seen in stores .
 A pair of shoes arrived that did n't meet my color expectations -LRB- shoes were suede not brown leather -RRB- . I requested a return from the vendor and have been ignored to this point .
 I have worn the Liberty Loafer for many years . These run wider than any others that I have -- in the same size . I will not order these again .
 I have worn the Enzo Liberty loafer as my primary shoe of choice for many years , and have owned at least 15 pair . I always knew I could depend on this shoe to fit my foot as if it were hand-made for me , and to be comfortable from day one . Unfortunately , the quality of this shoe seems to have deteriorated while the cost has steadily gone up . This pair is not the soft buttery leather I have grown accustomed to , but feels extremely stiff , does not conform to my foot , rubs my ankle and cuts into my instep . I will not be ordering these again , and am greatly disappointed .
 Ordered a size 8N in blue , received a 9N in black . What more can I say?The seller has no quality control .
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON -LRB- SHOEFLAKE -RRB- AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE . FORTUNATELY , I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO . HOWEVER , I AM OUT $ 60 + DOLLARS .
 Shoe appeared to be the wrong size.The shoe was a bigger size than what was stated , more like a factory reject .
 These shoes were not what I expected . They were not comfortable . They were big and bulky looking , very unattractive shoes . The front of the shoe is what stands out as being too big ... -LRB- like clown shoes from the the front -RRB- . I immediately sent them back .

If you have any swelling around the ankle at all , these shoes are not for you.You can see in the picture how close the shoe tongue is to the back of the shoe . Too close quarters for my slightly swollen ankles .
 The shoes were as advertised , however , the toebox is not deep enough for extended walking . The toe is more shallow than in the picture , this puts pressure on the big toe . Otherwise , it is OK . Shoe is true to size .
 Large lump on innersole , would be impossible to wear these shoes for any period of time , very poor quality assurance inspection.Waste of my time to even order such garbage . Amazon shame on you for not checking the quality of the shoes you recommend and sell !
 These are cheap copies of the SAS originals . I purchased and returned a pair of these imitations . The SAS shoes were comfortable from the instant I put my feet into them . Not so the copies .
 I am a Banquet Food Server and was looking for a good work shoes ! ... well after purchasing these shoes , I am still looking !!! 1st these are Heavy shoes2nd my feet NEVER hurt so bad after using these shoesI started to break them in doing some none banquet work -LRB- desk job -RRB- , I then had 1 banquet shift and they seemed fine . but the next week I had a week of doubles -LRB- Breakfast & Lunches -RRB- . The 1st day my feet were sore , the 2nd day it was worse , and the 3rd day I could barely walk to the car . The pain in the balls/pads of my feet was unbelievable . I switched back to my 2 year old shoes for the final 2 days of work and my feet were fine . The spring in the balls of your feet must of caused this as the soles are plenty thick -LRB- an inch and a half thick -RRB- . I must note that I had put inserts in these shoes for additional padding when I had this pain , ca n't imagine how bad it would have been if I had no inserts!The only good thing I can say about then is that my arches -LRB- plantar fasciitis -RRB- did not bother me at all .
 I have purchased 5 pairs of spira shoes and will not waste anymore money on them.They have a good idea and work good on cement with comfort for bad knees and back but the quality is junk.Spira measures quality by milage and believe mese willnot make it out of the house , i have to keep glueing the soles back together one place after another maybe i will get them completly re glued and they will work.I HAVE WATCHED THE QUALITY KEEP DECLINEING OVER THE PAST 4YEARS TRYING DIFFERENT STYLES AND THEY KEEP DECLINING DO YOU SELF A FAVOR AND BUY SOME OTHER BRAND .
 In there ad they claim because of the steel springs the sloes do not compress as much as conventional shoes . I supinate with my right foot and she shoes compressed on the outside a lot on my first use . It 's the only time I was able to wear them . They were uncomfortable and gave me ankle pain .
 This shoe is basically a gimmick . Very cheaply made , wears out very fast . For the price I was amazed at how poorly constructed it was . I was not impressed with this product at all . A little over a month the sole was wearing down , the top looked very worn , and I think the spring inside broke because the shoe started to lean to one side . I attempted to contact the manufacturer who only told me to return it to the place of purchase . When I told them that it was past 30 days and I could n't send it back they essentially told me that I was out of luck . I will never buy a shoe made by this company again .
 I recently bought this sneaker , the fit was great right out of the box . I am an RN and have knee issues . When I put the sneakers on they felt comfortable . I walked around for one day with them . That night my knees became swollen and painful . Two weeks have passed and my knees still hurt . I attempted to return the sneakers but they were sent back to me . I am very upset and disappointed with this company and would not recommend this sneaker or this company to anyone . The company also advertised a 100 % satisfaction guarentee . It appears they will not honor this statement .
 I bought these shoes because of all of the hype that they are comfortable . I am on my feet most of the day . I wore them for 2 days and I had to take them off because the shoes only caused pain and agony to my feet . The concept is good about the springs . The reality is that the springs are very hard and have no give . I tried these shoes off and on for a month . I even went to the store and bought padded inserts . The inserts did n't help either . I tried everything I could think of to help make them comfortable . Nothing worked ! I just did n't want to throw away a pair of shoes that I had spent so much money on . The bottom line is that I would never buy another pair of Spira shoes .
 Does n't fit the way I want it to . Since I had to wear them and the return policy said they had to be unopened or unused , I can not return them .
 ITried them on and sent them right back.To tight hurt my foot I need a big EEEE width this felt like a 2E
 usually they are great ... this last order ... shoes were too short and too tight ... same size as previous shoe ... defected ... had too to take to a shoe repair and had them strecth ... still too short and too tight ... this has NEVER happen before ... this is about my husband 10th pair ... what happen ????
 I am on my feet 10-12 hours aday at work . I was looking for a pair of shoes that would be comfortable throughout the day . So I bought a pair of Spira Classic men 's shoes . After wearing them 3-4 hours , I had to switch back to wearing my old ones . The springs in the front of the shoes began to hurt . I thought at first I needed to give it some time and allow the shoes to break in and to allow the my feet to adjust to the shoes . I then was going to give it a month for the break-in period , but after wearing them for 3-4 hours for 2 days my feet were in very painful . I had to stop wearing them . I then tried wearing them once a week for 3-4 hours . Once again my feet became painful and I had to switch back to my old shoes . I believe the problem with the shoes is in the springs . The springs are much to hard to walk on and that there is no give . I would NOT recommend buying a pair of these shoes .
 Nice materials . Not much support in the footbed , sandal runs loose . I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I 've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible .

 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem

 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .
 I purchased these slip ons because I wanted to get my mom a different grasshopper shoe , since she loves them so . Unfortunately , one look at the shoes and they went right back into the box and sent back . My mom has really wide feet , due to a condition that causes her to have high levels of water retention in her legs and feet . If she 's on her feet for too long , her feet further swell . These shoes did n't look capable of holding a regular wide foot let alone an extra , extra wide one . Maybe as a regular shoe they 're awesome , but if you 're looking for a pair to accomodate a wide foot , look elsewhere .
 The shoe looks great , but is one of the most uncomfortable I 've worn.Leather sole is really hard and there is almost no cushioning inside . The heel started wearing out in a few weeks time.These shoes seem to run a 1/2 size larger than marked .
 I was sent the wrong size . I had to return these boots . They did not have my size in stock . Awaiting credit back to my card .
 this item is both cheaply manufactured and poorly designed . It is n't at all helpful to a disabled person . I would exclude this from any consideration for purchase .
 TOTAL , CHEAP PLASTIC JUNK ! IT WORKS , BUT SEEMS WORTH ABOUT $ 1.50 . WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THIS IF HAD SEEN IT &#34; LIVE &#34; DOUBT THAT IT WILL LAST VERY LONG .
 This item was overpriced and not a quality product . I was able to find something much better at a better price .
 The shoe horn arrived in two pieces . The tee handle had broken off the shaft in shipping or handling , revealing the honeycombed interior , an obvious manufacturing defect . The typical Amazon service was good but , in my opinion , even dollar store prices would be too high for this poorly made product .

 I found these to be less than comfortable . The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour .
 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!

 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer

 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .
 this is absolutely the most uncomfortable pair of shoes i have ever tried on . i have not and will not ever wear them - even around the house they hurt my feet because there is no sole . it is just like walking on concrete . additionally , in person they look like slippers .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 The back of the shoe was so pointed that even with a heel insert , the shoe would n't stay on . I tried my shoe size and a half a size down and nothing worked . Very disappointed .
 I am very disappointed ... I love Nine West Shoes and I can usually buy them in my size and they fit perfectly . But these shoes are incredibly uncomfortable . I am returning them today . The height is fine and I love the platform , but the are so tight across the ball of my feet . They actually pinch my feet . I couldnt wear them for more than 10 seconds and I knew they had to go back . I 'm sad .
 the leather looked nice , as did the sole and heel but it was just too narrow in the toes for me , I returned them .
 This is a very nice looking shoe . I ordered a half size down from normal and they still wanted to slip a little on heels . A foot petal in the ball of the foot area would probably take care of this but the toe area on the outsides of foot hurt a little .
 I bought the Rocha after all the positive reviews and ordered 1/2 size smaller than my regular size -LRB- 7 -RRB- but the toe box was super tight and cramped . My feet hurt within a couple minutes of wearing them so back they go ... pity because it is a very attractive sue and the color of the shoe and the stacked heel is really nice . FYI , I ordered another pair in 7 , and they were way too big and fell off as soon as I tried walking . So beware , the sizing is tricky !
 I typically wear anything from a 5 - 5.5 . These shoes were way too big . Very dissappointing since I really liked them and it 's very hard to find a nice pair of plain black heels .
 Greetings , This is my first dissapointing experience with Amazon . The product
 I ordered these in a 9W . The shoes look great in the box but they were way too tight when I put them on . These were not wide width at all . I sent them back the same day I received them .
 They look hot but ... . They were very stiff and the toes were very stubby looking . I believe I ordered a size 9 . They were the correct size but very uncomfortable . I did send them back . I had no trouble retuning them . The size chart did help me to accurately know what size to get .
 I bought these shoes a couple of months ago.I liked the design so much that I recommended some other people to order them and they did so , but unfortunately the quality is really low , the platform split into two parts on both sides after a week and the same happened to the lining and I noticed that the heel was not positioned correctly from the beginning . I was really disappointed because I wore them only a dozen times , and the same thing happened to all the people who oredered the same shoes . I love the design of Nine West very much but the quality is awful the same happedned to the other pair of shoes by Nine West after a week of wearing them , so my advise is do n't buy them if you are not v ery rich .
 I fell in love with these shoes when I first saw them after my first pair I was even more in love and immediately bought several more -LRB- 3 more to be exact -RRB- . A couple months into owning them after a few wears they began to come apart . I was very disappointed as they are leather uppers -LRB- the ones I bought -RRB- I expected more durabilty they were not worn often I would say probable 3 or 4x when I began to see distress in the look of the shoe . The leather black ones have a white trim like lining popping out around the top opening where your feet slide in.The fit and the comfort is a plus . Granted they were not majorly expensive and you get what you pay for but I have had similar product for similar price and much more pleased with the product overall .
 Not sure if it was just the pair I received , but there was a good sized scratch across the top and the shoe just did n't look well made ... lots of glue showing and rippled all along the edges ... not what I am used to from Nine West
 Fabulous looking shoe - terrible quality . Within moments of wearing these , scuffs began to appear on the heal , the sides , the top . The leather marks so easily that they already looked worn out the first day after wearing . To make matters worse , the rubber sole began to unglue at the tip and proceeded to continue pulling back a good 2 '' by the end of the day - dangerous ! I bought them in black and have n't worn them yet but speaking specifically to the taupe leather , do n't waste good money . They are ruined after 1 use no matter how careful you are .
 I am a little bit dissapointed with this shoes , I love the model but the material is synthetic and it peels in the edges and lose the colour .
 I ordered the shoe twice , had to return it both times . . leather was stained and damaged both times . I was very disappointed , the color of the shoe is beautiful .
 When I first saw this shoe , I loved it instantly . It was simple yet stylish and exactly what I was looking for . However after wearing this shoe only TWICE , it completely fell apart . The inner lining just peeled off from the outer material . So now I have a pretty new pair of shoes that I simply can not wear . I probably wo n't be buying anymore shoes from Amazon .
 I bought this pair of shoes as a gift for my wife , she was very happy with color and model but just at the first time she used them , they completely teared apart in the inside , all the seams split ! I wo n't definitely recommend this shoes , one star because I cant give them none .
 I love the color , shine and heel . The toe area was way too snug . Only buy if you have very narrow foot .
 I love the look of these shoes their just not good for walking in . I slipped out of them and was tilted forward awkwardly . I 'm just not good with a 4 inch heel . I will stick with a 3 &#34; heels . If you like 4 &#34; then you will probably love them .
 Very low quality . Seems like those were already used . Have scrashes on the leather . Dont like at all . Sorry . At least my pair were like that .
 every review i read before i bought these was good-the problem with mine was that they looked poorly made - where they were put together there was glue dried all over the shoes -
 I read the reviews but I still purchased these shoes from Comet in Florida . The shoe itself was really good quality , but the size 9 I order was a little too tight and I returned them for a larger size . On yesterday , 10/4/10 I received an email returning my monies for the shoes even though I requested a larger size . There service is very poor . I guess Amazon has spoiled me because when I order from them it seems like I get the product in a one to two day timeframe . I order this shoe on 9/3/10 and received them two weeks later . I would not recommend buying from them especially if you are in a hurry to receive . I even sent them an email with no reply or should I say a standard email reply that they would get back to me in 48 hours , did n't happen .
 I read all the reviews of these shoes about how comfortable they were and was soo looking forward to them . But they were AWFUL . It hurt just to try to slip my foot in for the first time and after 5 minutes of wearing them around the house , I could n't stand it anymore and printed out the return slip . The angle of these heels puts tremendous pressure on the toes , which are jammed into a fairly narrow vee . I ca n't imagine what my feet would have felt like after wearing these for a day . Agony . I 'm very disappointed .
 Way too narrow . Unless you have unusually skinny feet , these shoes are too uncomfortable to wear . No longer willing to suffer to look good ! Too bad , because the shoe is great looking .
 Color is gorgeus , high of heel is good but when I used started my problems
 I was disappointed in the pair that I received . They looked worn except for the bottom of the heels . A bit discolored , creases and a slight spot that appeared like it was exposed to heat . However the return was simple enough and I received another pair the following week . But unfortunately slight creases or wrinkles were noticeable and scratches or scuffs . I wiped them down with leather cleaner / conditioner which hep restore them a bit . Another issue is they scuff very easily . I kept them anyway .
 item came with a defect with the platform was little detached , besides in some parts of the shoe the synthetic was detached .
 The shoe is cute but the sizing is WAY off . I ordered at 7.5 -LRB- way too big -RRB- so I ordered -LRB- from elsewhere -RRB- a 7 -LRB- STILL way too big -RRB- ... I 've worn a 7.5 for years ... did n't even try the 6.5 ... I gave up !
 looks great but does not run true to size . also heard rumors about its quality - that it starts ripping apart in a noticeable way
 Shoe appeared to be the wrong size.The shoe was a bigger size than what was stated , more like a factory reject .
 Ordered a size 8N in blue , received a 9N in black . What more can I say?The seller has no quality control .
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON -LRB- SHOEFLAKE -RRB- AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE . FORTUNATELY , I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO . HOWEVER , I AM OUT $ 60 + DOLLARS .
 I have worn the Liberty Loafer for many years . These run wider than any others that I have -- in the same size . I will not order these again .
 I have worn the Enzo Liberty loafer as my primary shoe of choice for many years , and have owned at least 15 pair . I always knew I could depend on this shoe to fit my foot as if it were hand-made for me , and to be comfortable from day one . Unfortunately , the quality of this shoe seems to have deteriorated while the cost has steadily gone up . This pair is not the soft buttery leather I have grown accustomed to , but feels extremely stiff , does not conform to my foot , rubs my ankle and cuts into my instep . I will not be ordering these again , and am greatly disappointed .

 I ordered these boots in Wide since my husband wears wide boots in Caterpillar brand . But , these boots did n't fit as they were n't any wider than a standard boot . So , steer clear of the `` E '' width if you actually wear an `` E '' .

 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .

 These boots are n't very comfortable . I chose to bear with the pain for a while . I bought these shoes because I thought they would be more durable than the junk shoes I 'd been buying that wear out in 4 months . I do alot of walking , and it 's pretty hard on shoes.But the soles are already starting to wear out at the back , and it 's only been a month and a half . This just makes it hurt more . Now I have to buy some new shoes and throw these ones out . I do n't have much choice .

 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 I purchased this with an expectation that Adidas brand stood for quality , but was dissappointed with how unsubstantive the shoe itself was . I believed it was on a sale price due to the color -LRB- a rather obnoxious orangy-red that my wife cringed at -RRB- and I was willing to live with for training in . But it think i would have been as comfortable and supported if I had strapped the shoebox to each foot .
 I returned this shoe after I tried it . quite narrow , and not comfortable .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .

 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 these shoes are so uncomfortable , i am so sorry that i bought them . They really look nice but i tell u they are uncomfortable and they will rub ur foot .
 These shoes look great online and I was really excited to try them on . When I did , they were definitely comfortable and they fit very well , but unfortunately the toe was way too pointy for my taste . It made my foot appear an inch or two longer than it actually is and it just looked silly sticking out from my pant leg . As much as I wanted to love these , I had to return them .

 I bought these pumps in November for wear with pantsuits , slacks , and dresses . I do n't like extremely high heels because I am tall and also because I like to walk quickly -LRB- I find very high heels to be a hinderance -RRB- . I got them in black . They were n't too exciting but functional . Or so I thought ... I did n't wear them THAT many times - maybe twice a month maximum . I have 5 pairs of black heels counting this pair . Notwithstanding this relatively infrequent wear , the plastic cap on the heel wore completely through to the metal by June -LRB- yes - within 7 months of relatively infrequent wear -RRB- . I was n't pleased . Normally I have a good experience with Nine West shoes , so I was surprised . I wonder if one of my shoes was defective .
 The silver Nuncio pump appears poorly constructed . The heel looks poorly made and appears like it was glued on and the silver coloring -LRB- which is almost a glittery/snake skin look -RRB- appears cheap looking . I believe the other pumps -LRB- i.e. the leather finishes -RRB- are probably constructed better
 First of all the shoe is tight fitting . I usually wear a 9.5 or 10 and I ordered the 10 and they still felt tight in the toe area . Also , when I ordered this shoe , they did not have a picture of the fabric for this color so I was taking a gamble by ordering them on color name only . Needless to say , I did n't really like the fabric either . I returned them .

 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...

 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .

 I love heels , the higher the better . I also adore shoes by Steven . This shoe however did nothing for me . I tried to wear it several times and always took it off to change into another pair . I do n't know if it was the gold color , and I really prefer bronze . Whatever it was , I gave the shoe to charity . It would have set new in the box forever . This way , hopefully someone will get to wear them , and maybe like them !
 The ladies 9.5-11 size was way too big . It would fit was a man 's size 11 shoe . The Tingley rubbers was correctly sized .
 My son loves K Swiss , it 's what I have always known him to wear , so when he sent me a gift card I thought I would try a pair . The shoes looked great when they arrived but the first time I wore them which was to a meeting , I notice they hurt my heels . I was shocked to also find that my heals were bleeding . I did get to return them which I am grateful .

 This is n't a review of the shoes but Amazon 's business practices . I 've been waiting for these shoes for 3 months . They keep pushing my delivery estimate back . They said the shoes are back ordered . I 'm sorry , but it should n't take 3 months to get ahold of shoes that I could simply buy down the street from me . The only reason why I do n't do that is because I bought these shoes here when they were on sale and I had a gift certificate.I 'm very disappointed in Amazon . This is the worst service I have ever had

 I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11 . They run large , which is strange for being from the same company . They are super thin , light , and only stay comfortable for about a half hour . Afterwards your feet WILL hurt . I do n't recommend them , even though they look cool . Comfort is a must , so I will be going back to my beloved 574 's .

 I have to say I was very disappointed - I would not buy another pair of Earth shoes again as these are not comfortable at all .

 These sandals are extremly uncomfortable . I wear a size 10.5 , but I ordered a size 11 , they were still very narrow and pinched my feet . Also they felt like I was walking on concrete . They are not ajustable and look and feel poorly made . For the same price go with Adidas sandals
 My son loves K Swiss , it 's what I have always known him to wear , so when he sent me a gift card I thought I would try a pair .

 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .

 I have to say I was very disappointed - I would not buy another pair of Earth shoes again as these are not comfortable at all .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 The product description misled me to buy this thing . I have a very high regard to the Florsheim brand , but I am very disappointed with this one . A typical made in China quality without passing through Florsheim 's quality control . The leather is hard . Comfortable as describe in the product description ? How could it be comfortable when the leather and the inner soles are so hard ? I really want my money back or maybe some discounted refund on this order since it would be so bothersome and expensive already to ship back the items . I ca n't wear them . I just have to give them away .
 This is the worst pair of shoes I ever bought . They are too stiff at the upper portion of toes . Even after a month of wearing they still hurt me . I have no option but throw them out . An international return is quite expensive .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .

 The shoe looks great , but is one of the most uncomfortable I 've worn.Leather sole is really hard and there is almost no cushioning inside . The heel started wearing out in a few weeks time.These shoes seem to run a 1/2 size larger than marked .
 I bought this product few weeks ago , the style is okie but It 's hurt my end toes ... I 'm thinking to return it ... but I do n't know they 're going to accept or not b/c I 'm already wear it . If you 's looking for this shoe ... the style it look okie but not really comfortable to wear .
 I bought these shoes for my son . He wore them 4 times and then they ripped . Very poor quality especially for the expense .
 This shoe is a very narrow shoe . My foot has fit in all other types of shoes from different manufacturers . My foot would n't fit in this shoe because the shoe is too narrow and the shoe opening is not high enough . I suggest you skip this shoe and buy from another brand.P.S . I currently own an Unlisted Shoe bought from a department store that fits and is comfortable but the leather wore off the top of the shoe within a couple of weeks .
 The concept for the product is good , but I think the sizing is off kilter . I wear Saucony Pro Grid Ride 2 , size 7.5 . According to the size chart , I need a size XS . When I got these , there was no way the STABILicers were going to fit over the shoe . Plus , it felt a little heavy . I decided to return them .
 These did not really work for me as my kiking boots seemed too wide to accomodate the cleats , and then they kept popping off while trekking .
 I ordered a small of these . Supposedly they would fit size 7.5-9 .5 womens shoe . Tried them on my size 8.5 women 's running shoes . I ca n't get them on , they seem way too narrow and definitely too short . I tried them on some narrower sketcher shoes , still ca n't get them on . I tried to put them on my son 's size 4 youth shoes . Still ca n't get them on , and they are still too short . Tried them on my son 's size 12 toddler shoes . I still ca n't get the toes to even to all the way in . The rubber is too tight , and the sizing of the toes too small.I 'm not going to bother with trying the next size up .

 The Boots look great , but when I first put them on , the steel toe rubbed my large toe slightly . After four hours of wearing them , both sides of my foot were too sore to continue wearing them . One person suggested that they needed to be `` broken in '' , but I am not tough enough to break in the steel toe on the boot . The steel toe looks like it belongs on a regular or even narrow boot . I am now the owner of $ 186 boots that were worn only 4 hours .
 Dear friends of Amazon , I am reviewing the Danner Instigator GTX Gore-Tex -LRB- uninsulated/no thinsulate etc. . . -RRB- , boots . I am military , law enforcement , and an avid hiker ... so I was expecting a boot which fit the description which Danner labeled to the letter . My Danner military boots have lasted through many battles -LRB- on and off the field -RRB- . However , BEWARE !!!! These boots , while decent quality compared to similarly priced boots on the market , are not what I 'd expected . For one thing ... Unlike the photographs ... they are by NO STRETCH of the imagination BROWN with TAN highlights !!!!! These boots are as orange as a pumpkin ! As both military -LRB- uniform -RRB- and law enforcement -LRB- uniform -RRB- requirements are very specific , I discovered that these boots ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE under any conditions to wear for duty . And then I figured , `` Well ... I 'll just keep them for hiking then ! '' But , as soon as I undid the laces , and prepared to try them on for the first time , I quickly discovered that they have a LEATHER collar around the ankle section ... . another misstatement , as DANNER claimed they had a cloth/gore-tex like material which comfortably surrounds the ankle ! Yeah right ! That 's on the outside !? It 's cloth on the outside , and leather on the inside ? HUH ? Anyone who does ANY hiking will tell you that that is a friction problem waiting to happen ! Remember those rub marks when you wore crappy boots as a kid ? So I called them to get my money back . They supposedly have a `` no questions asked '' FREE returns policy right , which was one of the reasons I 'd picked them too ! But -LRB- again -RRB- , since I 'd ordered them through the MILITARY website , they would not take them back -LRB- nor would they take them back if you got them on AMAZON either she explained -RRB- ! So , now I am stuck with a pair of boots which CAN NOT be worn with ANY clothing imaginable -LRB- unless your going as a pumpkin to the next Halloween party of course -RRB- ! Signed , Really pissed off at Danner!PS . Also bought an extra pair of the `` supposedly '' impact dampening inserts too . They were $ 16 , and no better than the cheap gel Doctor Shoel 's -LRB- however you spell it -RRB- inserts one can obtain at any drug store for $ 6 . But do n't believe me ... come on and waist your money too ! My advice is to look at customer photo 's on each site , as when one tries to take a picture of them THEY DO look brown and tan ! But when you take them out of the box in the regular light they are not ! First pair of shoes I 'd describe as functionally and visually HIDEOUS !
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe .

What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...
 This shoe is a very narrow shoe . My foot has fit in all other types of shoes from different manufacturers . My foot would n't fit in this shoe because the shoe is too narrow and the shoe opening is not high enough . I suggest you skip this shoe and buy from another brand.P.S . I currently own an Unlisted Shoe bought from a department store that fits and is comfortable but the leather wore off the top of the shoe within a couple of weeks .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer

 Feels good , and the sandals look good . The strap is poorly designed . The velcro and leather strap has to go through a ring . The close fit of the ring and strap soon caused the velcro to start peeling off the leather strap . At their price , they should have a thicker leather strap and a true buckle system .

 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 These look cute in the picture , but think twice before you buy . I bought these in the brown leather in a size 10 . The shoes felt more like a 9 1/2 & very tight in the toes . The metallic accent on the bottom looked like tarnished copper and the protectant was peeling off .
 Returned them due to being narrow and tight ! And there was slight toe cleavage issues . Purchased a half size larger , but returned those too because it was too loose but not as narrow , toe cleavage still exist .

 I tried to order these crocs two different times and both times I was sent the wrong thing . I spoke to someone about it and they told me they would get back with me but they never did . I wo n't ever waste my time or tell anyone I know to use this service . I understand mistakes happen but if a company refuses to make good on their promise then I have no use for them .

 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .

 Nice materials . Not much support in the footbed , sandal runs loose . I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I 've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible .

 These shoes are JUST pretty . Not only did the buckle break the first day I wore them , they rubbed me raw on the heel .
 Feels good , and the sandals look good . The strap is poorly designed . The velcro and leather strap has to go through a ring . The close fit of the ring and strap soon caused the velcro to start peeling off the leather strap . At their price , they should have a thicker leather strap and a true buckle system .
 They do not start off telling you that these shoes run smaller sizes . You get the item and what would normally fit , does n't . Then there is the idiotic restocking fee . How hard is it for an idiot to put it back on the shelf ? I was very angry to have to deal with this problem . I sent them an e-mail to tell my feelings , but still had to pay the restocking fee to return the stupid shoes . I was very unsatisfied with Florida Footwear . People , buy these rainbow sandals locally !
 I bought these as a gift for my sisters birthday . They started coming apart a little after a month of her wearing them . She has not abused them at all . I tried to contact the seller but never heard anything back . I have a pair of Rainbows as do most of my friends and my partner . I have no problem with mine and neither does my partner or friends . matter of fact , my partner has been wearing the same pair since 2002 and they still are not torn in any way . I do n't know what to do to resolve the issue I have with this seller . All I want is a replacement pair for my sister . How embarrassing it is for a pair of Rainbows given as a birthday gift to come apart in a month and the seller avoid you ! I do NOT have a problem with Rainbow , I will never wear any other kind of flip flops . I have a problem with the seller and the lack of their customer service/customer satisfaction .
 I used one click ordering and the shipping address was taken from two different past shipping orders therefore the item was not deliverable and was returned to the vendor . I did not reorder . The vendor notified me that I would be billed for the return shipping , tho the error was not mine . I sent an email to the vendor to bill me and I have not heard from them .
 I 've been wearing and loving Rainbow sandals for well over 15 years ... I can walk miles in them comfortably . These that I ordered surprised me as one sole was longer than the other ! I had to return them , needless to say .
 These are so incredibly narrow . I waited too long to return them so I ended up giving them away . I 've heard now from another friend to buy mens Rainbows if your feet are n't narrow .
 I 've enjoyed wearing Rainbows for years , and was happy to find a great price on Amazon . However , the inside of the strap was sewn incorrectly and caused blisters , to the point I had to remove them and walk barefoot . Amazon 's return policy was easy , but these were inferior quality and should never have been sold as new . Could be a quality control problem , or this vendor is selling seconds as the real thing .
 They shipped the wrong size . The 30 day return policy expired . I did not know about the return policy . It was suggested I resell the item myself to get as much of my money back as possible.WOW .
 I owned a pair of the smooth leather Rainbows and loved them for two years , until the leather began to rub away to the spongy center layer . I tried the premier leather version , but they felt like wearing cardboard . The straps are n't soft enough to stretch and mold to your feet . Stick with the smooth leather version , or buy Reefs . They tend to be cushier and easier to break in .
 The shoes arrived quickly . Unfortunately the shoes must have been seconds . Not only are they not narrow on the right shoe the one strap was sewn on incorrectly .
 I had ordered this pair of shoes twice because I did n't get the correct size the first time . I thought people can make mistake . However , the second order was a deja-vu of the first order ... same wrong size and beat up box .
 These shoes are cute to look at but an effort to wear . They are fine when you are standing still but the moment you start to walk , the heel strap slips off . Quite a bummer !
 These shoes looked so pretty.I was happy to wear them to a wedding.Standing on them was so hard.They are nice looking but my feet hurt so bad.Ieven soaked my blisters in foot bath but it did n't help quick enough.I ca n't recomend them because of the comfort thing .
 These shoes Do Nothing to flatter a woman 's legs.Sometimes a man 's opinion is good to have.Men like delicate or dainty shoes on a lady . In these shoes you might as well wear a big robe and house slippers.I do not recommend these sloppy , chunky wedges .
 I bought these shoes for my son . He wore them 4 times and then they ripped . Very poor quality especially for the expense .
 Good sturdy bag , However not worth the price once shipping is included - it is smaller than it looks in the photos .
 Shoe is not up to Clarks High Standard.No Bargain At the sale priceIf you are inclined to purchase they run sliughtly larger than Clasks usual sizingLong Time Purchaser Of Clark Brand
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .
 I bought two pairs of these super comfortable flats a few years ago when they were made of soft genuine leather and absolutely loved them . I still have a pair that I wear sometimes even though it looks really old and beat up now.I thought the satin version would fit similarly . I bought it in black and was very disappointed . The leather felt so much better on your foot and was soft right away with no breaking in necessary . The satin version looks cheap and the top part just is n't as comfortable.BC Footwear , if you 're reading this , please bring back the leather model ! I would buy several pairs !
 They are soo cute but they squeeze my toes so much I ca n't wear them . Also , I am normally a 7.5 - purached an 8 and they still were ill-fitting .
 I bought these shoes for my son . He wore them 4 times and then they ripped . Very poor quality especially for the expense .

 I bought this for my husband , should have known you get what you pay for.Very disapointed . The shoe looked out of proportion.I 'll try again sometime though

 The top was too hard and kept rubbing against my feet . Soaking in hot water did not help much . The sandal was too narrow and bigger than the size it claimed . I bought three pairs but fortunately at discount prices -LRB- that explains why . -RRB- I did n't like them and gave them ALL away . Stick with Adidas or Rider .
 I expected more from both New Balance and Footlocker . This is very poorly made and the sizing is off - way too small . Also , I attempted to exchange these for a different brand , but instead got a portion of my money back , no exchange . Very , very disappointing . I will not shop Footlocker online again .
 They are very hard and hurt my feet they say they are a size 8 but they are at least a size 9.5 not happy
 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 They are beautiful shoes , but not true to size . I am a ten and I could n't get them on ... they fit my mother , who 's an 8 1/2 Very dissappointing .
 I bought these shoes to wear for my nursing job , I thought they were very cute but no what I had thought . When I put them on they did n't fit , the sides of the shoe hits my lateral ankle bone and is uncomforable . So far I havent worn them due to that fact . I dont recommend them .
 I got these wonderful , warm and cozy boots , so i would not have to worry about the cold of Cleveland . The first month I had them they were fantastic , I told everyone about them . Then the soles began to crack , so now I can not wear them or my socks get wet . I have owned these boots for a month , I did n't think that was long enough to break them . I am hoping it is a fluke that this happened , since I have friends who have bought themselves and their daughters a pair .
 Cute boots ... unfortunately the sizing is way off . I normally take a size 6 . Got these today and they are too tight . My toes are cramped in these boots . If you are ordering these I would highly recommend ordering one size larger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed .
 These boots feel great on your feet , but I had the same problem as other where the buttons just fall off . . Seems like a consistent quality issue . If you do n't mind the defect they do feel warm and cozy .
 After 3 days of my daughter wearing these boots the buttons fell off . Cheap , cheap , cheap!Would not recommend these boots .
 I bought the boots for my daughter and after a few hours of wearing them , the button strap broke . Very disappointed .
 I simply feel these boots run narrow.dissappointed . I had a pair of the victorian style of bear paws and I found them quitecomfy . This abigail style is just too narrow.bad investment
 These boots looked cute in the picture in the product description -LRB- dark brown boots with dark brown buttons -RRB- , but when they came they actually had cream colored buttons that stood out more than I liked . They also do not fit well if you have thinner legs , they did not fit snugly around my calves and looked big and bulky . I sent them back for a refund .
 The product arrived on time and it looked good quality at first but the side buttons fell off after just two days of use . My daughter is known to be careful with her shoes and clothing , so the boots were not abused or anything similar that would justify what happened . We looked at the way the thread holding the buttons was done and it was very poor quality . I hope the boots do n't fall apart too .
 Button fell off 2nd wear now I have to pay to have them fixed . Bear paws were recommended too . Sad .
 This pair shoe is looks very nice , but when you get it , just check the shoes carefully.I got the pair shoe , one shoe is missing button , -LRB- should have two buttons , but only one on the left side shoe -RRB- And the under sole is thinner than the UGG.the size is fit and it is comfortable too , but I wont recommend to buy this shoe on the amazon.because there are many troubles for return process for this item , taking long time to connect the seller , but still do not solve the issue .
 Like the boot ... hate the fit . Too bad ... it seemed like a winner.I could not get my foot in it .
 We had to request a replacement pair due to damage to our original order . The replacements they sent were clearly not up to the quality of the original boots ordered . Colors off , fur lining different , soles different , even logos very simplistic compared to the originals . Very unsatisfied . We opted to keep our original damaged pair and have them repaired at our expense . Buyers Beware ...
 Just received these boots yesterday . They 're very cute but run very small . I wear a size 7 in all shoes but in this boot my toes were cramped . I can not wear them for more than 2 minutes without pain . Sending them back today .
 I bought a pair of Bearpaw women 's Abigail boots last winter from a local store . Both sides of the boot has toggles and elastic loops which was great because I have large calves and a lot of boots do n't fit me . I really liked them , however they wore out much quicker than I wanted or expected . I wanted to buy another pair for this winter , but I could n't find the same ones that I bought last year in the any store . All of the boots were similar to mine , except they only have one side with toggles and elastic loops and I need the double sided toggles/loops . So I went on Amazon to find what I needed . And I seemed to find exactly what I wanted ! The pictures of the Abigail boots showed that both sides of the boots had the toggles/loops . They were a good price and I already knew what size I wore in the boot . I ordered them right away and they arrived quickly.I opened them right away , and what did I find ? ... The same boots I found in every store this year -- the boots only had toggles/elastic loops on one side . I tried with no success to get them on.I will be sending them back and I am very disappointed . I 'm not sure if it was Amazon or Bearpaw that is responsible for having a misleading picture of the product , but I am not pleased at all . I will be even more disappointed if I have to pay for the shipping to return these boots . I know these are nice boots , but I am very disappointed with this pair and this whole experience.I just want the boots I had last year . I guess if they lasted longer I would n't be searching for a new pair already ...
 got them this am , shipping them back this pm.Chinese cr * p.Ordered two sizes larger than I wear , shaft/instep area too narrow , can ; t get dumb foot into shoe area.Of course this was the problem with LL BEAN and Uuggs , expense and junk from china , they made their money , forget they are JUNK , and do n't fit.Got artic packs , old but in good shape and MADE IN USA , guess I 'll forget about boots this winter.BY the way those little side buttons are totally worthless decorations of no value.Beware and good luck .
 I wanted these to fit so badly ! Unfortunately , I could n't get my foot all the way into the boot . I was hoping I would be able to easily slide in and out of them . I did n't even have socks on . Now I 'll have to return them for a different style .
 I got a great deal on these when they were a lightning deal . They are soft and pretty ... from a distance . The stitching is uneven and cheap looking . And , they are n't the most comfortable thing to walk in , they rub against your ankles . Definitely an impulsive purchase I regret .
 I loved these shoes for the first 2 weeks until i was walking to the store and two of the buttons fell off . Im so pissed that i spent so much money on these shoes and they are falling apart . I keep trying to return them and amazon wont let me . NEVER ORDER BEARPAW FROM AMAZON !
 I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend ... needless to say a man should not have to go out and buy a make up gift because the boots were not up to par . Exchanged 4 times , all four times there were issues . I do not blame Amazon on this one , they have worked very hard at making this right . Buttons falling off , seams not matched up , fur missing in sections , as well as one that already had the sole coming apart in two areas . I could not recommend these to anyone . Pay the extra and get Uggs .
 The boots are n't a bad fit but all of the lining on the outside -LRB- the front seam that shows on top of the foot -RRB- . It is n't black but shows up white so it makes it look cheap . I 'm trying to figure out a way to maybe dye it black or something . Also the lining inside is n't soft but feels rough and cheap . Looks okay but I 'm not very satisfied with the product .
 I bought these for me daughter and the first time she went to wear them the lower button on one boot came off because it was just held on by a simple knot of nylon rope . After wearing them on a car ride the lower button of the other boot fell off when she went into the house for the same reason . The boot material seems good but the method used to secure the buttons is horrible . I will try and repair them and if that does n't work I 'll be sending them back .
 so i bought these shoes in november and i am just now writing a review because i just thought everyone should know the quality of these boots . i wore them mayb 3-4 times before i felt a tear in the inside of the shoe . i looked and the fur inside tore right off where by the upper part of my ankle . disappoining but im happy i only paid 20 for them and they look nice on the outside still . so it has some life in them but this would happen to be my second bad experience with bearpaws . who said they were beginning to become competition for UGGs ? i think NOT . what happened to the bear paws that didnt cost more that 40 for any style ? now they were good quality . it seems the more a shoe price goes up , the suckier the quality .
 I was very disappointed ordering these boots from Amazon . I ordered them for my daughter 's birthday . They arrived in poor condition . The left toebox had a large mark on the top of the boot . I returned them for an exchange and the second pair I ordered had an even bigger blemish on the toebox . I returned the second pair for a refund . Not only did my daughter not receive the boots she had asked for , but I am now a very discouraged and disappointed customer . Quality control , anyone ??
 I wore these boots just over a month before I realized that they were cracked right through to the sole of my foot and water and snow was leaking through to my foot . I just missed the 30 day return policy so now I have leaky boots . I am very bummed because I thought they looked like good quality boots . We tried to fix them with glue but it 's not working . I do not recommend Bear Paw boots .
 ORDERED SIZE 5 , RECEIVED SIZE 6 . HAD BOOTS FOR 1 WEEK WHEN THE FIRST BUTTON FELL OFF . OTHERS FOLLOWED WITHIN DAYS . VERY UNHAPPY WITH SERVICE AND PRODUCT
 I have worn these boots twice and the entire bottom of one shoe has come off ! They are very comfortable and if they did not fall apart they would be great ... too bad they were a huge waste of money . VERY DISAPPOINTED !
 These shoes have already started falling apart . My daughter wore them for two weeks and the bottom tore away from the boot . I need to request a refund . This is the second pair I have purchased at amazon that were n't satisfactory . I wonder if they are factory seconds ??
 I spent $ 100 on these and in two months the sole seperated from the boot ... dont waste your money . I am so disapointed in these boots
 I am a huge Bear paw fan . . 1 bc they are cheaper than uggs and 2 bc they are just as comfortable and durable . I thought this item was ok . . didnt care for how the lining looked felt it was a little cheap compared to my other bearpaws . . Also , the stupid buttons were missing or about to fall off . So that was a big let down . But still a fan of bearpaw . . just felt this shoe was to cheaply made
 these boots are horrible . i got one pair and a week later 2 buttons popped off . then they sent me another pair and one the strings that holds the buttons was half off . i wore them once . never again will i order boots from amazon
 Those are like pre-owned ! The buttons were missing , and those were very dirty . Could anybody tell me why ? I do not like a pre-owned pair !
 size and color were exactly as expected . The smell , however , is nasty ! I returned them after trying to let them air out for 1 week , but the smell was so strong and nasty , everybody could still smell them . If you enjoy the smell of cat crap , these are the boots for you .
 My 9 year old daughter got these boots for Christmas and was very happy with them when they arrived . They were very cute and she liked the plush feel of them . However , after less than three weeks of very light wear , the fabric of the boot pulled away from the rubber sole . We are very disappointed in the quality of this product and will not buy a Bearpaw product again .
 the color of the boots did not match each other , the fur was also inconsistent between the two boots and the size was off a lot , size 5 should normally be too big for my granddaughter , but they were too small .
 These boots did not go on as easy as I thought they would . My daughter has a pair and she did not have to struggle to get them on like I did . I wanted a pair that would go on very easily but these did not .
 Even the stores like TJ Maxx check to make sure the boot inside the box matches the label on the outside of the box ! Size 8 boots inside a size 6 marked box . Really disappointed child for Xmas .
 Thought I 'd save a few bucks and try these after enjoying my Emma boots . These have a markedly different lining - not curly , classic sheepskin like Emmas , rather they have short , straight , furry lining that does not have the plush , luxurious feel of curly sheepskin.Disappointing ...
 Pretty cute boot but It was a whole shpe size smaller than mineorder a size up if you get these
 Definitely too small . Follow the other reviewers and order a size up . They did seem warm and comfy but not sure if I 'll order again .
 I got a defective product.Boots battered and worn , as if it was preowned.Buttons wrong color , wrinkles and abrasions on suede and fur glued crookedly - I pulled a piece and it was dropped .
 Boots are warm ! But only have warn these boots for a shot tome and there shot already both the soles are craked where my feet bend not happy wish I could have my money back !!!!!
 Elastic loop that goes around side toggle broke the FIRST time my daughter wore these boots . I expected a lot more wear and tear than this , even if these boots are less expensive than Uggs .
 I brought 2 pair of bearpaw from the owner but they are of different quality . This one is with hard fur and the size is right . Another pair of boot is the same size of the Camel color . However the Camel one is with soft fur but the size is a little small . And the first time I try the Camel one on , one of it 's button fall off . Now I have sewn the button on by myself .
 The toggle buttons broke off on each of the boots within a week of wearing them . I contacted the company and have yet to hear back on whether they will fix or replace them . Very disappointed ! Because they are not unopened , I can not work with Amazon to return the damaged boots .
 The quality of the boots were n't the same as in the store . I do n't like knock of brands . The glue on the bottom is sticking out . I bought them for my mom for a Christmas present and I 'm emberesed give them to her .
 There is a reason why Bearpaw boots are less than half the cost of Ugg and Emu -LRB- the stinger line -RRB- of similar style . It 's because they are inferior products . I checked them out at Macy 's because I wanted to get a pair of `` knock around '' sheepskin boots . Bearpaw 's price fits the bill and I do like their version of the bailey button . I was horrified by the quality of the boots . They are hard as a rock and the fur does n't look plush at all . I did n't even bother trying them all .
 whenI bought the boots I had a sinus infectiom but was still functional . Little did I know about the stench that was coming from them . Every now and then I would get a whoof of smell but didnt realize it was coming from me , i thought it was environment . within three hours of putting the boots on and shopping , I noticed everyone kinda stairing at me in the mall when I walked by . Finaly one lady at old navy encouraged me to check the bottom of my boot for dog pooh and I asked why . She explained to me that the smell was very very toxic smelling and she was surprised I couldnt smell it . Well my nose was packed with packing as I had sinus issues and just couldnt smell . And hour later , my whole body was burning and itching and i was watching red bumps crawl up my legs and consume my whole body.Twice a day I have to rub cream on my body and this is a month later . I dont k now what toxic whatever , or what smell , or what happened on the insude of these boots but its bad . they were supposed to be new , I dont know if they were at this point because they are bad . i have had and still have other BearPaw shoes and love them but this seller has damaged me and I have no end in site . I have been to specialist after specialist . I took the boots to a dry cleaner and we had a long conversation about the boots , he encouraged me to just throw them away . They are currently outside of my home and I am trying to figure out what to do at this point .
 This is not a review of Birkenstock socks . I have been buying those socks for years and they are great . But Amazon uses Shoe Mall as the provider . That has been an unpleasant experience . Shoe Mall gave no size information on the product , so I was flying blind . I ordered twice and both times the socks were too small . My dissatisfaction with Shoe Mall is complete . I wo n't be buying from them again . Amazon should look for a different partner .
 Such a beautiful shoe . Very classy but I could hardly walk in them . The lining was so slippery that even barefoot my foot was sliding and they pinched my toes so bad I could n't walk in them 5 minutes .
 I did n't like the look of the shoe - it was more appealing in the website than seeing it live - guess , that what 's you get if you are web buyer .
 Advertised as a wide width but is too narrow around the toes , not comfortable for all day wear .
 These boots fit like I expected , but the quality is poor ... what can you expect for $ 40.00 ? The zipper is n't properly covered and so it snags socks and hosiery just horribly ! The material is vinyl I think and looks rather cheap . But for the few times I use them each winter , they 'll get me by for a couple years .
 They are nice to look at but the tough leather is awful . I 've had these for over a year and I 've worn them no less than 20 times . They still have n't stretched to my feet . Not good for a 9 hour work day .
 Really like the look of these sandals , but they 're kinda heavy , and run wide , hence I feel like they 're gon na fall off my feet.I think I 'll buy my shoes in a `` real '' store where I can try them on inthe future . I think the internet 's great for certain things , but not shoes or bras !
 They do not feel soft on your feet . It feels like you are walking on solid wood , no cushin . The strap does not give when you walk , it constricts the foot . They are very cute , but uncomfortable .
 I ended up returning these shoes . they are too wide and I felt like you could see more the sole than my foot .
 This is the first pair of Skechers sandals I 've owned that will probably sit in the closet awhile before being donated to the Goodwill . They look nice , but are n't easy on the feet . It 's not the fit , either . It 's just how they `` slop '' on the foot . Probably the reason for the deep discount .
 This boots arrived quickly but , unfortunately , I returned them . I was so excited to finally own a pair of Frye boots but was disappointed with the quality of them . I purchased the boots in the `` saddle '' color and the stain was uneven causing the different pieces of leather to look patchy . The front piece of one of my boots looked like it came from a completely different color of leather . I also was n't impressed with the stitching and ultimately decided that alas , the price was just too high for the poor quality . I did some research at it looks like many consumers are finding that the quality of Frye boots has plummeted since the fairly recent sale of the company . I envy the lucky people who were alive in the 60s/70s and were/are able to enjoy REAL , quality , Frye boots .
 Though these boots had the logo - the workmanship was very poor . The fit was worse . I even asked friends what they thought but everyone kept saying something does n't look right.I was very disappointed as i have wanted a pair for ages . Sadly had to return these .
 There is n't a bit of leather in these shoes . THESE ARE COMPLETELY PLASTIC SHOES ! I would n't have bought them if I 'd known they were plastic .
 The slipper is warm , but the bottom is hard and when you walk with them they do n't `` stay in place '' , my heel comes off . Not worth it .
 They did n't have a size chart to let you know what sm , med , lg , ex-lg , meant , so I ordered the medium and they were too small . I ordered a different color in the same size -LRB- med , which was an 8 -RRB- and they were bigger for some reason , so I had to switch with my daughter.They were sooo soft and felt like walking on air at first , but about a week later the cushion is gone and it 's like wearing covered flip flops now.I would not recommend .
 Very uncomfortable and cheap looking shoes . The promotional pictures looked very stylish and I made a complete fool of myself by getting coaxed into buying these shoes . Personally I expected better quality from Adidas .
 I absolutely loved these shoes , but the slingback frayed just like the other reviewer said after only a few times wearing the shoes . I never buy leather but I caved for this because it was the only flat pointed toe shoe that I could find for work . I 'm going to see if I can get the company to repair or replace them though because it seems a little ridiculous .
 The sling back cut into my heel and the strap frayed and snapped within 5 times of wearing them . Not recommended !
 I bought these shoes for my trip out to Vail , CO. . I normally wear a size 8 1/2 but this shoe does n't come in 1/2 sizes . After reading several reviews , I decided to get the 8 and it fit perfectly ... even room for thick socks if needed . You really do n't need thick socks with this shoe b/c the insulation is incredible . No way your feet will get cold . My problem is , after wearing the boots one day , I was limping . By the evening , I was limping so bad that I could no longer walk . Inside the boot , there is a crease where the rubber lower half meets the fabric upper half ... that crease was level with my ankle . It 's not subtle either , it stick out a good 1/4 inch . I tried everything , I took the boot to the ski rental place and asked them to sand it down ... did n't work . I tried wrapping my ankle ... did n't work b/c my ankle was already bruised and swollen . I tried multiple socks and still it did n't work . By the second day , I had to suck it up and go try and find another pair of boots . I literally could not walk in my Sorels anymore . This is a very good looking boot and very good for extreme cold , but beware if you have skinny , boney feet . I loved these shoes , but could n't even wear them . Very disappointing .
 I have wanted a pair of Sorel boots for as long as I can remember , and was delighted when I received them for x-mas . After wearing them today , they are being returned . Going from the wet and snowy outdoors and into various businesses , I slipped and nearly fell every time . I think these boots just like to have snow under them.Oh , and they are very heavy . After just a short walk my legs felt like they do after running 5-miles .
 Liners nearly impossible to get foot into . Boots arch is at wrong spot . Overall they are poorly designed . Not up to standard of years past when made in Canada .
 After much searching for a basic snowboot that wasnt incredibly ugly , I finally settled on the Sorel Caribou in Elderberry , size 5 . I have a very small foot and these boots looked hideously large on . Also you can not move your ankles at all and they feel like you have foot casts on both feet . The upper was so stiff I could barely get my foot into the boot . They are very warm however and I can see why they are popular in very cold and snowy areas . But for folks who just deal with a few minor snowstorms a season , they are really not necessary . Sadly , I returned them to Amazon the very next day .
 I never actually got to test them out in the snow because it did n't really snow here in PA this winter , but I do n't think they worked very well . I did wear them on some 30 degree days , and my toes were cold , which really disappointed me because I am a Southerner who just moved up North and I was expecting for the snow boots to keep my feet warm ! They were also really uncomfortable . They kept rubbing and hitting against my shins . I think you also have to go up at least half a size because they run small . In short , I would not recommend these .
 Bought these boots in what I thought was my size and they ended up being a lot bigger than I expected - both in size and weight - this is one heavy boot ! Kind of hoped for the girly version of this style but it felt like a man 's boot . The hazzards of mail order I guess , shipped to a US address so was not practical to exchange . On the plus side , feet are toasty and dry .
 These boots were enormous . I thought perhaps they were a men 's size and were mislabled . The vendor was wonderful about the return
 I 've heard great things about Sorel snow boots , and living in Minnesota , snow boots are essential . Since my old boots gave up the ghost after a few years of faithful service , I decided to spend a little extra money to see if Sorels would hold up longer . Given how much snow we 've accumulated up here , in addition to the sub-zero wind-chills , I was very much looking forward to having warm , dry feet , courtesy of my new Sorel boots . Unfortunately , I received MEN 'S boots in the size I ordered , rather than in the women 's size . Accordingly , the boots were HUGE . Due to this error on amazon.com 's part , and the fact that what I 'd ordered was now out-of-stock :-LRB- , they paid for return shipping and refunded my money . -LRB- The first customer-service rep failed to provide the return label and refund info within the promised time frame , so I had to contact amazon.com again . -RRB- Last I checked , the Sorel women 's Caribou snow boot was still up on the website , despite being out-of-stock . While I appreciate amazon.com taking care of the error , I wish they would update their product pages to correctly display only in-stock items , thereby avoiding unwitting customers ' waste of money , time , and effort .
 Do n't be fooled !! I live in Alaska where everything 's more expensive and I got the same exact boot for $ 65 REGULAR PRICE !!! what a joke!@!
 I have Reynaud 's syndrome - a condition where my hands and feet freeze when exposed to the slightest cold , and then take a long time to ` defrost ' once they 're frozen . It 's very painful and gross , plus I live in New Hampshire , so warm boots are a must !! I bought the Sorel caribou boots two winters ago , because everyone said that these are the warmest boots available . I did n't want to spend $ 300 + on electric boots because I kept hearing that the battery would die and the boots were useless . The Sorel boots have a very thick sole and nice felt lining , but if the boots are even kind of cold when I put them on , they do not keep my warm feet warm . I have to warm them up with the hairdryer before going outside , so I end up spending 5 + minutes just trying to get out the door with these boots.They are also TOO FREAKING HEAVY !! I feel like I am wearing ankle weights at the gym . I 'm 5 ' 7 '' and weigh 135 , and consider myself in fairly good shape . However these boots are too heavy to walk around in , the footbed is very wide and it 's awkward to try and walk normally , I find myself `` clomping around '' whenever I go out.I will say that they are very sturdy boots - I have worn them for two winters now and they still look almost brand new . Maybe this is because I try not to wear them very often because they are so heavy and uncomfortable to walk in.If you enjoy an additional workout , by all means these boots are for you . If you are like me and do n't want to spend any extra energy on a frigid winter day by wearing an extra 5 lbs of shoes , then you should not get these boots .
 I know these are supposed to be a utility boot , but the rubber part is enormous and the liner was too small for my feet . If the fit had been better , I am sure that they would be a great work boot.I sent them back . Had to call the company for a return label because they they were purchased through Amazon . The seller -LRB- Moose Jaw -RRB- was wonderful !
 Have had these Sorel Caribou boots for years . I 've often heard people swear by them . However , as one who works out of doors through winter and frequently stands for long periods on a cold barn floor , they are completely inadequate for keeping my feet warm . I 'm not referring merely to temps below zero , or even in the single digits ; my feet remain cold even at 34 degrees . I need to use those chemical handwarmers tucked into my socks to keep my toes from going numb.Despite new liners each year and enough room to wear a silk liner and 2 pairs of Smartwool winter socks , my feet freeze . I do admit that my extremities are often cold from November until April . Ergo , I 'm not condemning these boots all around ; I 'm merely saying that they do n't keep * my * feet warm enough , even if I 'm moving.The difficulty seems to be that the sole allows the cold to seep through . With only a felt liner as protection , the insulation just is n't enough.For temperatures of around 40 degrees , they 're fine for me . Heavy and rather cumbersome , but , hey , it 's good exercise and I feel light on my feet as soon as I take them off at the end of the day . This year , however , I already bought out all of the handwarmers in the two local stores . So , I 'm biting the bullet and looking for new boots !
 My wifes Sorel boots literally fell apart the first time she wore them.The soles fell off ! I wrote and called Sorel but they refused to reapair or replace the boots due to some aqusition that has nothing to do with me ! Amazingly poor customer service and product .
 This is my second season with the Caribous.I purchased them in the beginning of December last year . I wore them in the snow of Philadelphia to and from work for January and February . I pulled them out again in December of this year and gave them moderate use . They were warm , however , my feet felt damn most of the time in them.They would , in theory , be the best winter boots except the rubber is perishing after one season of wear . The bottom of the boot is fine and is not at all worn out . The lining in the boot is in good condition , however , because the quality of the rubber used on the boot is so poor , it 's cracking off and perishing around the toe box . It allows for moisture to enter the shoe and my feet feel humid . I did n't think Sorel boots would last such as short time given their reputation . Considering that these boots are now made in China and not Canada as they were previously , it does n't surprise me one bit.They also tend to run large and are quite heavy . This is understandable for a solid pair of winter boots - however , I would say these are just not solid .
 There is n't a bit of leather in these shoes . THESE ARE COMPLETELY PLASTIC SHOES ! I would n't have bought them if I 'd known they were plastic .
 These are really cute , but the straps are so long , they fly off when you walk in them ! Also , there is a label pasted on the sole , that is jagged and was painful to walk on , so I removed them . Additionally , they are very slippery and difficult to walk in ! I would not buy these again .
 These shoes were adorable ! The perfect summer sandal to wear casual or dress up a bit . Unfortunately , the straps were very uncomfortable on my feet and they did n't have a lot of support . The shoes were quite stiff and probably would n't have softened over time so I had to return them . Wish I found a pair exactly like them that were more comfortable .
 i have had three pair of these thongs , my pit bull chewed one up , -LRB- not merrell 's fault -RRB- and the other two pair broke at the thong . maybe they are fine for around the house but dont go far from home .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 I thought these shoes would afford more comfort . The sole is so thin that I can only wear them inside the house . If I step on a pebble , I feel it . I find myself tying the laces all the time , even when double knotted . I will keep wearing them around the house but certainly not for running errands around town . I wear a size 8.5 M and had to go a whole size larger in order to get a comfortable fit .
 the seller original claimed that it is gore-tex , I bought it , it is not gtx , and more , there is no evidence to show it is waterproof.I contact the seller , but no response at all.won ' t buy from it again.now they revise the description , but be noted , it could still be a lie to say it is waterproof .
 I bought these on clearance for about 25 dollars . I bought them half a size bigger , and I 've had them for almost two years and they 're still uncomfortable . They pinched my toes and the inner sole started to scrunch up and move within 6 wears.I keep them at work and try not to walk in them . They feel a little better with hose on . I 've bought and returned two other pairs of Kenneth Cole shoes as I felt the leather was supremely hard . I do n't buy expensive shoes normally , and Nine West is usually fine for me , these are supposed to be a step-up , but too painful . They are cute though .
 The shoes are made from very good leather material wich is pretty light in weight considering the style . However , they are not the most comfortable shoes . They pinch the toes and I spent a lot of time with them unbuckled so that I could ease my foot out of them . I wear a nine and these were a nine medium . At one point during the day I wondered if I had on a six and took them off to check . I wondered if I had bought a nine & a half if I would have gotten a better fit . What I found odd is that when I fitted them on their arrival they were fine it is the continuous wearing that revealed the discomfiture .
 The shoe looks beautiful , but when you receive it , the part of the shoe that fits around your heel , or the very back of your foot does not provide any suppport . It is soft like fabric where it should be stiff . It almost feels as if it is going to fold or fall down .
 I ordered these shoes for work in a size 11 and they do not fit .
 The black + white combination is fabulous but the pointed toe is way too pointy -LRB- did n't look that way on the site -RRB- . My solution wear them with pants which is a shame because it hides the shoes .
 I recieved the shoes and only wore them twice and the 3rd time the shoes strap broke . I really wanted another pair of these shoes and now on my birthday they break , VERY DISAPPOINTED !!! WILL NOT BUY FROM HERE AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!
 I used to buy these shoes at some dollar store across the street from my house and reading these reviews , it is obvious that the quality on these ones are no better than the ones that I used to see . I would never pay more than $ 10 for these things unless there is a better quality version out there .
 I got these shoes a week ago and now I 'm sending them back . they were adorable , but they smelled funny , were too stiff , and the little buckle was really chinzy . I let them sit out on my floor for a couple of days thinking that maybe my opinion would change , but nope ; off they go again tomorrow !
 I ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and I had the same problem with the turpentine smell . I was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price . I wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem . I washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink . I 'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they do n't make my other clothes smell , and I 'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them .
 Even for only $ 12 , these were n't worth the money . They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine , or some other noxious chemical and now , at least 2 months since I have received them , the smell has not dissipated . They are extremely stiff , so even if they did n't reek , I still would n't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day . I guess that 's what I get for buying cheap shoes .
 Only buy these shoes if you do . They have a terrible odor to them , arrived with bent in and beat up toes , and the piece of metal the strap is fed through to fasten is comparable to the pop top of a soda can . All around , these are the worst shoes I have ever purchased . I will never wear them . I wouldnt even give them away to a thrift store . Ca n't complain enough about these and I have never before complained about an item from amazon . Save your money and find something else .
 I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor . All 's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place . The straps slip off occassionally , causing the shoes to come loose .
 These shoes appear to be thin fabric glued over cardboard . They smell bad , have no pin in the buckle to keep the strap from slipping , have permanant wrinkles in the toe area from poor construction , and the sole is made of a light , slick material that I do n't care for . I would return these shoes if not for the money lost on shipping both ways . Save your money !
 I bought these shoes about a year ago , and ended up not keeping them because of the stench . I could n't get it out , and was too self-conscious about it when wearing them because other people commented on the smell ! Eww ! They were comfortable , true , but made of rather cheap materials . Because of the smell and the rather cheap , crinkly material on the body of the shoe , I would n't recommend it .
 these shoes have a terrible chemical smell , very unpleasant , ca n't wear them . Even if I wanted to their not comfortable very stiff and cut wrong -LRB- material comes up too high on the back of the ankle -RRB-
 there was no smell at all like the other reviews mentioned ... they are a little stiff -LRB- the bottom and the material , but comfortable ; just not as thin and flexible as better quality chinese shoes ... cute and trendy though ... i tried them on right when i got them and the side buckle for the shoe strap broke right away when i was putting the strap thrpough it ; wtf ??? the buckle -LRB- which has no pin by the way -RRB- is very thin and bends when you put the strap in , so it makes perfect sense that it would break very easily sooner or later ; with me it broke of in half right away though ; i probably got the `` lemon '' pair lol so i do n't know ; i will try to take it to a shoe repair place and see if they can fix it for me , which will be more money ; but i would n't by these again ; very poorly made : -LRB-
 I used to buy this type of shoe from Pier 1 . They were light and comfortable . These have a harder sole that does not bend , and are poorly made . A waste of money .
 These shoes appear to be yellowing - literally yellowing - on the shelves in stores all over New York City . I do n't know what they made the white part of the soles from , but they should consider changing it because it actually turns yellow with age like the plastic on an old computer , except apparently much much faster.I ca n't speak to their comfort , however , because Amazon/FootLocker sent the wrong size , so I had to return them to a FootLocker that had stopped carrying them .

 Nice materials . Not much support in the footbed , sandal runs loose . I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I 've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible .
 These shoes look and feel very nice , but there is a MAJOR problem with them.The cleat mount is drilled for the wrong size screws . You ca n't use standard SPD screws -LRB- or cleats for that matter -RRB- with these mounts ! ARGH ! I had to drill and re-thread the mounting plate to work with standard mounting screws .
 This shoe is cute , but the leather is very hard . I had to place insoles in the shoes for them to be comfortable . Even still , I can only wear them for two hours at a time . I would not recommend the purchase of this shoe .
 these shoes were okay on size , but they are pretty stiff therefore not comfortable ; not recommended . oh , and the silver part is slightly sparkly which is not what I wanted . : -LRB-
 These boots are extremely uncomfortable . I am tall and wear a size 11 , so I ordered an 11.5 . While I expect to have to break in new shoes , especially boots , the awkward height dug into my shin with every step.Perhaps they would 've been more comfortable over time , but I expected more of $ 70 boots .
 This boot is impossible for my daughter to slip on her foot even with a zipper . It has zero flexability . It is also very clunky and heavy .
 These boots do indeed serve their purpose in all winter weather , but I was also relying on comfort and they hurt the arch of my foot ... I had to buy insoles . The photo does not show the black zipper which I found cheesy , I was suspecting no zipper -LRB- maybe I didnt read the details enough -RRB- or at least one that was hidden . I do not like shoes where you ca n't feel a grip on the ground and with these you do n't . And last but not least , the upper front part of the boot where the wooley lining is sticks out at a point and looks too damn ridiculous . The lining also , I thought filled the boot a bit like an ugg would , but I was wrong there too . Oh well , I liked the picture and the price , but I made a bad decision .
 I placed my order on October n the description said i will receive on Dec 12 , now it 's Dec 20 . still do n't see the shoes . it took 2 months for it to be shipped ? Disappointed n the seller has to fix this ASAP
 I really like Sorel boots but these pinched at the front of my ankle where the zipper bends and I could n't wear them for more than a few minutes even with heavy socks . Totally disappointing .
 I bought these on the recommendations from this site for my winter boots . The boots seemed warm - but they look kind of frumpy and are very stiff when walking . They do n't look good with pants tucked into them - or even with pants over the top . I know that you ca n't expect too much style from winter boots - but the suede looks cheap and I imagine will stain easily with salt/slush . I 'm returning them .
 In the past 2 weeks I invested in 10 different pairs of winter boots from Amazon and Sierra Trading Post.These boots are so uncomfortable to wear that my legs started to ache right through.The stiffness was overwhelming as there is no give in the lifting of the foot motion to simply walk.They are also rather heavy as well so the weight and stiffness makes you aware of every step you take.As soon as I took them off the aching subsided and was gone in 5 minutes.Because I finally have winter boots for the first time in my life the novelty will take years to wear off.But these boots will be used only in the worst conditions as to not ruin any of my other boots.Because I live in Australia , postage to return them would cost me more than I paid for the boots and it 's not Amazon 's fault so I shall keep them .
 Nice looking and I 'm sure they 're warm and dry , but when zipped open you only get about two inches added opening . Makes it tight to squeeze into the boot and a real chore to stuff pants into there -LRB- if you have straight cut jeans they wo n't fit over the boot -RRB- . I 'm sending 'em back .
 These boots are warm but not very comfortable . The sole and ankle portion of the shoe are stiff and hard to walk in for any long distance . I was not happy with the way these boots fit or the lack of flexibility when walking . I had bought them for a trip to Russia in March and did not even take them : -LRB-
 Other reviewers have said these do not have much flexibility and are quite rigid . I would agree . They are so stiff that it is hard to move your foot or walk . The side zipper is very uncomfortable as well . I returned them .

 I thought these shoes would afford more comfort . The sole is so thin that I can only wear them inside the house . If I step on a pebble , I feel it . I find myself tying the laces all the time , even when double knotted . I will keep wearing them around the house but certainly not for running errands around town . I wear a size 8.5 M and had to go a whole size larger in order to get a comfortable fit .
 I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style . The other color fits wonderfully but this pair , due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching . If your feet are medium , these may not be the shoe for you . It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched .
 Just after two uses , the shoe showed white patches here and there andlooks ugly now after just two uses - not used in rain yet .
 Thankfully SHOEBUY has free returns , or I 'd be really unhappy . The shoes were not as shown , and did n't fit well , either . Not wide enough , yet a bit long ... almost like they were seconds ? I am happy with the customer service I received from both SHOEBUY and Amazon . My accounts were quickly credited .
 I am extremely disappointed both in these shoes and , for the first time , with Amazon Prime . I bought these pumps for a wedding , only to have them arrive covered in defects and flaws
 these shoes are very comfortable . The leather is very soft . But it 's out of shape after wearing once for a wedding .
 The shoe is cute and very inexpensive , but I ca n't wear it because it is so big . I wear a size 9 shoe and every other shoe I 've ever bought online has fit , but not this one . It is 1-1/2 inches longer than my other shoes . It would have been ridiculous to return a shoe that cost so little so I am giving them away . If you wear an 8 , order a 7 .

 The first time my six year old granddaughter put them on the heel of one shoe cut her toe . A fairly deep slice . I am retuning them . I hope they are never sold to anyone else .
 I Have Twins they just love shoes they had to sleep with the NEW Cind-R-Essa Sandal . Thanks

 These slippers seemed comfortable at first but after two steps my feet shifted and I found myself walking on the sides of the shoes . The closing flaps are not big enough to accommodate wide feet even though the soles are . Worst of all the company has a TERRIBLE return policy . They are in Canada and shipping costs are expensive and cost of shippig return or exchanges is prohibitive . Their customer service is uneven ; one employee was helpful while everyone else I spoke with was at best unfriendly and at worst cold and unhelpful . I do NOT reccommend either the shoe or the company.Extra Wide Mens SlippersI would never buy anything at all from Silvert 's again .
 I have bought these for my grandfather who had itchy and swollen feet . I was looking for light shoes with smooth fabric that would help him walk easily and not make his skin more irritated . what I liked about these shoes was the fact that they were easy to slip on.unfortunately , when these shoes arrived , they were heavy in weight and the fabric was some sort of wool which would not help at all in reducing the irritation he had.If you are planning to buy it for an elderly to walk with it , I would recommend that you find a lighter shoe and let me know where you bought it from : -RRB-
 This has been a very unpleasant e-commerce buying experience . It has changed my mind about purchasing some items on line . I ordered some Roper boots from Bargain Outfitters . They came in a timely manner , when I tried them on they did not fit me . I decided to send them back immediately and because there was no address other than the one on the box and it was the same on the paper insert that was given to me , that is where I sent it back . I sent it UPS ground and it was delivered the next day . That was 3 weeks ago . I am still waiting for my refund because they are busy and ca n't get around to finding this box and refunding my money . I am wondering if I will ever receive a refund and what my recourse is going to be .
 These shoes are just adorable -- they look great on ! But , even the first step was horribly uncomfortable . The straps rubbed my feet raw and caused them to bleed . I have worn many strappy sandals and the like and have never had this happen . These are the most uncomfortable pair of sandals I have ever had ... what a shame .
 I just got my shoes now . I have n't worn them yet so ca n't talk about that but these shoes came with visible dark orange or yellow glue on them holding the strap design on the side in place . I bought them for work with possibility of wearing them at other times but the way they look I 'm not ever gon na be able to wear them anywhere else . I do n't even want to wear them to work . I still do n't know if I 'll send them back .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 did n't love this shoe . didnt wear it . ended up giving it away . too narrow in the front for me and just was not comfy . the front part of the design is too wide and did n't compliment my feet well either .

 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 This can in no way be considered a hiking boot lace . I have owned many a pair of hiking boots and this is unlike any lace ever provided on a pair of name brand boots . Based on the quality of the product , I cant see it lasting very long on a pair of heavy hiking boots with hooks . This is nothing more than a 60 inch long dress shoe lace . Quite disappointing .
 The Boots look great , but when I first put them on , the steel toe rubbed my large toe slightly . After four hours of wearing them , both sides of my foot were too sore to continue wearing them . One person suggested that they needed to be `` broken in '' , but I am not tough enough to break in the steel toe on the boot . The steel toe looks like it belongs on a regular or even narrow boot . I am now the owner of $ 186 boots that were worn only 4 hours .
 Dear friends of Amazon , I am reviewing the Danner Instigator GTX Gore-Tex -LRB- uninsulated/no thinsulate etc. . . -RRB- , boots . I am military , law enforcement , and an avid hiker ... so I was expecting a boot which fit the description which Danner labeled to the letter . My Danner military boots have lasted through many battles -LRB- on and off the field -RRB- . However , BEWARE !!!! These boots , while decent quality compared to similarly priced boots on the market , are not what I 'd expected . For one thing ... Unlike the photographs ... they are by NO STRETCH of the imagination BROWN with TAN highlights !!!!! These boots are as orange as a pumpkin ! As both military -LRB- uniform -RRB- and law enforcement -LRB- uniform -RRB- requirements are very specific , I discovered that these boots ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE under any conditions to wear for duty . And then I figured , `` Well ... I 'll just keep them for hiking then ! '' But , as soon as I undid the laces , and prepared to try them on for the first time , I quickly discovered that they have a LEATHER collar around the ankle section ... . another misstatement , as DANNER claimed they had a cloth/gore-tex like material which comfortably surrounds the ankle ! Yeah right ! That 's on the outside !? It 's cloth on the outside , and leather on the inside ? HUH ? Anyone who does ANY hiking will tell you that that is a friction problem waiting to happen ! Remember those rub marks when you wore crappy boots as a kid ? So I called them to get my money back . They supposedly have a `` no questions asked '' FREE returns policy right , which was one of the reasons I 'd picked them too ! But -LRB- again -RRB- , since I 'd ordered them through the MILITARY website , they would not take them back -LRB- nor would they take them back if you got them on AMAZON either she explained -RRB- ! So , now I am stuck with a pair of boots which CAN NOT be worn with ANY clothing imaginable -LRB- unless your going as a pumpkin to the next Halloween party of course -RRB- ! Signed , Really pissed off at Danner!PS . Also bought an extra pair of the `` supposedly '' impact dampening inserts too . They were $ 16 , and no better than the cheap gel Doctor Shoel 's -LRB- however you spell it -RRB- inserts one can obtain at any drug store for $ 6 . But do n't believe me ... come on and waist your money too ! My advice is to look at customer photo 's on each site , as when one tries to take a picture of them THEY DO look brown and tan ! But when you take them out of the box in the regular light they are not ! First pair of shoes I 'd describe as functionally and visually HIDEOUS !
 I will never buy anything from this company again . I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law 's wedding , they were not what she wanted , we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge . Boy they are reaaly making money off customers .
 There very very very painful and uncomfortable ! A solider could n't wear these in combat ... and I 've been told that I 'm a solider ... I beg to differ after wearing these shoes !!!
 With a name like `` butter '' I expected soft , broken in and comfortable from these flip flops . Instead they were tight feeling , had a taller sole than originally thought and have yet to be comfortable enough for everyday wear .
 From the description , I figured they 'd be totally comfortable . Wrong . I ca n't wear them because the `` strap '' part of the uppers cut my feet -- literally . Felt soft enough to the hand , but the tops of my feet screamed for release after just 1/2 hour . The bottoms seemed great , but later the balls of my feet hurt , too . Also , the soles were much thicker than I 'd anticipated . But the real issue is the lack of `` butter softness ''
 The straps on this thong cut into my feet every time I wear it . It 's heavy and hard at the bottom . Maybe that 's why the straps are cutting my feet since it has to hold all the weight . This is the worst pair of thong I 've ever owned .
 The thong that goes between the toes was way too long so the sandal did not fit snugly enough . I know they are flip-flops , but they should stay on at the toe . Amazon did refund my money , but they charged me a re-stocking fee because the reason for the return was `` no fault of Amazon 's . '' I do n't agree - I think there is a design flaw or this was a defective pair .
 I 'm usually a big fan of Reef flip-flops , but these were very uncomfortable . The straps cut into my feet in several places . Within an hour or so of wearing them , I had blisters and some areas on the tops of my feet that were actually bleeding . Ouch ! It 's really a shame , because they 're very cute sandals ! -LRB- I have them in saddle/gold . -RRB- Maybe I should 've broken them in better before I wore them outside ... ?
 I will never buy anything from this company again . I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law 's wedding , they were not what she wanted , we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge . Boy they are reaaly making money off customers .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I was looking for a nice pair of shoes that would also be comfortable to walk around in . During my second time wearing them the sole of one of the shoes came completely off while I was in the mall . The other sole was coming loose as well . I was disappointed in the quality , especially for the price .
 Very well made , cute , but not much room in toe area . Toes felt almost crushed and ended up returning the shoes .
 The product description is not true , `` quality leather upper '' ? NO!All man-made materials so they can not breathe . Also , following the previous views , I ordered 1/2 size lager than my normal size and it still did not fit well . They are going to back to the warehouse.This is another pair of Kenneth Cole REACTION which let me down .
 The shoes look so great but I got a half size larger and the toe room was still cramped . I had to send them back . It is a very good looking shoe and the heel is perfect in height . I hope it works for you !
 I 've bought other bacco bucci shoes from Amazon before but this pair is too narrow that I have a very tough time to squeeze my feet in . Then they are too tight that I can not walk . I 've returned to amazon and they penalized me for both shipping & handling when I 've bought them -LRB- $ 5.97 -RRB- and return shipping & handling -LRB- $ 3.99 -RRB- . Do n't every buy these pair .
 I will never buy anything from this company again . I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law 's wedding , they were not what she wanted , we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge . Boy they are reaaly making money off customers .
 They squeak when you walk . If you want to sound like Squidward when you walk , then buy these shoes . Otherwise , stay away .

 When I first slipped these shoes on my feet they were so comfortable . Four wearings laters , the heel tip on the left shoe was gone and the entire top edge of the toe bed was scuffed on both shoes . The day I came home walking on the metal peg in the heel , those shoes went right in the trash . Should have sent them back .
 This is a nice shoe , but it is loose-fitting in the standard size I wear . A slip-on needs a firmer fit in order not to slip on the feet .
 These shoes were almost completely cushion free on the soles.I thought they would be something like their walking shoes as I have a bad back , and bad feet.Unfortunately , these slip on tennis shoes were the first real disappointment I 'd had from Propet .
 I 've tried different insoles in them to make more comfortable and not much luck . Have n't tried cleaning them yet so do n't know how easy that will be
 Absurdly , comically overlarge . My SECOND attempt to buy this shoe , I ordered a full size below my normal one this time as the last try was way too big . It is still nearly an inch too long and yet with a tiny opening for the foot . Unless you have feet like a sparrow and are willing to order 2-3 sizes too small and return a few to guess at what may fit , do n't waste your time . I thought the first time I got a misidentified clown shoe . Now I realize Propet just does n't know how sizes work .
 I ordered these shoes for work beauce of a number of positive reviews I 'd read about them , however , these are not walking shoes ! They make my feet ache just walking to and from the bus stop which is right down the street . They have n't much cushioning , had to buy inserts but in doing so make them extremely tight . The only feature I do like is the easy slide on/off . Do NOT buy these if you do a lot of walking.Still searching for the right shoe . So far , Nike Air Max has provded the best results -LRB- for me -RRB- . Hope this review helps .
 My husband only wears Propets and he has a 15 3E . Normally the Propets are perfect and very comfortable so I decided to buy this pair for him because it looked a little dressier in all black . He got them in and I am not sure if it was a defect on the ones we bought or what but they were super skinny . You could tell just by looking at them that they were way too long and tight . He could hardly fit ! Unfortunately they had to go back , but we bought the Propet Men 's Travel Walker M Casual instead which fit perfect just like the other Propets !
 Los zapatos a pesar de ser converse no salieron tan buenos , alpoco tiempo se despegaron .
 esto es un enga & ntilde ; o , yo hab&iacute;a comprado un par de color blanco y otro par de color azul pero el vendedor envi&oacute; los dos pares de zapatos de color blanco ! ademas dudo que sean originales puesto que el material se ve de baja calidad .

 These were a bit of a disappointment in that I remember wearing these as a teenager and LOVING them . . I liked the idea of wearing wood , plus I used the muscles in my legs so it kept them in shape , but they seemed -LRB- after 30 some odd years -RRB- heavier and if you do n't get the leather , they look a bit cheap . Plus , my foot kept sliding off of them so , the rubber worked better for me .
 Like Denise above , my foot slides forward too and I can not adjust the strap either . I tried everything , even prying open the thing that looks like it would release the buckle , to no avail . All I ended up doing was making a mark on the metal ! I have n't worn them outside , so will probably take them back , which is a shame because they are absolutely darling ... I got the pink plaid ones .
 The right shoe does not wear well at all , I feel there might be a problem with the strap , I developed a blister on my toe which started within thirty minutes of wearing -LRB- I had to purchase a pair of flip flops to change because of the horrible pain -RRB- the left shoe is fine but because of the problem with the right I am unable to wear them . I am updating this review I bought this product last year and received horrible blisters , I tried again this year and the same thing . As of this writing the seller has not made ANY attempt to contact me .
 I recently ordered the `` Original Dr. Scholl 's Exercise Sandals . '' They came today , and I plan to return them for a very important reason
 I also purchased a pair thinking they were the original sandals that I had worn and loved for so many years . Not only is the wood not well shaped anymore but the leather upper on any of the design sandals is thin fabric and thus flimsy . The best part of the original sandals was the great toe grip . That is what made this sandal famous and gave us all such wonderful calves ! The new ones are almost flat . I also sent mine back but beware ... check this before you buy . I had to pay a restocking fee to send them back ! So you pay shipping , then hate them and send them back paying more shipping AND a restocking fee . Might as well have kept them . I am very disappointed and wrote to Dr Scholls to let them know .
 The name of these is very misleading ; these are not at all the * Original * exercise sandals . I 've worn Dr , Scholl 's sandals for 35 years and far as I can tell , the only `` original '' element in these is materials -- wood and leather .1 . As many others have noted , the toe ridge has almost disappeared so you do n't have anything to grip . As someone with ankle stability issues , I ca n't wear shoes that slip around when I walk . That was never a problem in the past but this `` updated '' -LRB- aka cheaper to make -RRB- design does n't provide the support I need . I found that I was scuffling more and sure enough , the front of the shoes showed wear where I had previously never had a problem .2 . Something is really wrong with the buckle design . It 's not only hard to adjust , but I think there is one less hole so I was n't able to get as snug a fit as I used to have -LRB- I wear a B width so it is n't as though I have narrow feet -RRB- .3 . The leather is not as good quality as my old ones . It 's stiffer and when combined with the looser fit -LRB- 1 & 2 -RRB- , I ended up with marks on my feet just below the big toe.Looking at the reviews here and elsewhere , I see that repeat customers have been complaining about the redesign for quite some time now . I guess the company figures it 's more profitable to churn through new buyers rather than keep a loyal following . They are trading on the reputation of the actual original to lure unsuspecting buyers . It 's another case of a reliable old standard abandoned .
 It 's just like some of the reviewers were saying
 I originally wore this shoe in my early teens and it was fantstic . . However , these are definatley not made the same way and they rub blisters on the feet . .
 I wore Dr. Scholls Exercise Sandals for about 10 years and loved them . I was hoping for the same sandal when I ordered these . My foot size has not changed over the years , but these sandals do n't fit correctly . The `` ball '' does n't hit at the right place and the leather rubs my foot . Also , I ca n't adjust the strap . I 've read and re-read the instructions , but nothing I do will release the buckle so that I can tighten the shoe . The leather is stiff and uncomfortable .
 I read the instrutions here on how to adjust the buckle but they do not work for me . I 'm about to send these sandles back . Can anyone explain , very simply , how to move the buckle so I can make these shoes fit tighter ??
 I bought the shoes 10/10 . Looked good , felt good but the buckle was different from the originals . 4/11 the buckle stud broke off , rendering the entire pair useless , as the strap can not stay closed now . A complete waste of money and , of course I do n't have the original shipping box . Who actually saves garbage ?
 I have no issue with the buckle -- it is easy to adjust -- just search on the reviews , here . But , after a screw fell out , I tightened all of the remaining screws only to discover that three of the screws on the opposite shoe simply turn without tightening . I 'm sorry to say this because I really loved these shoes in the past , but this newer version is junk .
 I truly never understood what was so great about these shoes . Before I got them and wore them , I liked them better . . After wearing them , I realized they were just plain . . clunky . I clunk around in them all day . I have n't worn them in a while , needless to say . They ok in the comfort department , but not great . And , as some other reviewers mentioned , I was never able to get the hang of easily adjusting the strap . I only tried a few times , because , again , I did n't wear them all that much , but still . There are cuter shoes in the world that do n't make you feel so dumpy and frustrated .
 Sandal did not hold up . Had the sandals for 1 week . I caught my foot in the door and one sandal ripped . Who do you send them back to ? The sandals are very comfortable but are not made to last .
 The quality of the boots were horrible ! The straps were stitched with orange threads . The shafts that were put on the soles were of two different sizes and werent for that size sole . The heels on the insides were just thrown together . Bunched up and folded leather that hurt the heel . I was not impressed with this product . I would n't give it one star .
 Awful shoes . They seem like they would be cute in theory but not only are they completely uncomfortable , but they make legs look like tree stumps . -LRB- And I have really skinny legs ! -RRB- they need more shape at the ankle .
 This shoe gives a fit that is a bit too wide and even though i ordered my size it didnt fit quite right , also it pinches at the toes .
 I was unhappy to find out AFTER I paid over $ 7 for this product and shipping , that it was nothing more than a tiny bottle of plain old rubbing alcohol ! Save yourself time and money and just use the rubbing alcohol that you buy at the drug store for $ 1 .
 shoemakers use 50 % isopropyl alcohol/water mix to soften leather for stretching - you can do the math on what that costs
 Seriously . Here is a much better solution . Just use what people in the shoe repair biz have always used ... regular , cheap , alcohol!For very stiff leather shoes and even sneakers ... try a 50/50 mixture of good old tap water or distilled water -LRB- if your tap water is too hard or discolored , etc. -RRB- and alcohol.Seriously ! It works well . Just use your imagination . You can pour it into the shoe , put on a sock and wear until dry then rinse and repeat until you get the results you want.Some shoes might only need 1 part alcohol 3 parts water . You can pour it in , spray it on ... whatever.Have a new pair of boat shoes with an abrasive heels that rub you raw?Take some alcohol/water mix -LRB- or just pure alcohol -RRB- , soak a cotton ball with it , then rub the heel inside area . Rinse and repeat as needed until it stretches or softens to your liking .
 Did I really just pay around $ 12 for a small bottle of isopropyl alcohol ? This product works somewhat , but I ca n't help but wonder if it works any better than water and/or alcohol . I have used a product in the past that worked amazingly well , but I ca n't seem to find it now . This was not it .
 I ca n't tell if this product works any better than water . The `` stretch '' seems to revert back to original shape after stretchers are removed . No instructions were included other than `` works fast as lightning '' -- and lightning moves at 186,000 miles per second -- so what fraction of a second is required for this product to work ? The company failed to respond to my request for how to use this product .
 I think it 's just isopropyl alcohol -LRB- or rubbing alcohol -RRB- which costs $ 1 in drug stores . The spray has the same smell . That 's why you can spray and wear wet shoes immediately after spraying . There is no harm for you but at the same time there is no result . Manufacturer does n't say a word about ingredients . Use wooden shoe stretcher to stretch your shoes .
 save your money , all this 5 stars reviews got to be either the business ' owner 's family or customers that got another free bottle -LRB- yeah of soap and water !! -RRB-
 I 've been buying and wearing Rainbows since the early 80s -- when Rainbows used to sell at the O.C. Swapmeet , that 's how far back I go . I live in these things . However , the new ones I mail ordered are really not like the originals . First they do n't have the arch support the old ones had and the three different pairs I ordered from Island , though marked Ladies 11 , were more like a men 's size 11 and not as stylish as the old ones . I 'm going to have to go to Rainbows ' outlet in San Clemente to see whether the old style are still available . Very disappointed .
 I was shopping around for a nice shoe for a little while , and I found this one at a great store called Soccer Plus in Palatine , IL . I bought the shoe and used it to kick a ball around with some friends . By the end , the back of my ankle had a mark from the friction . Next time I used it , I ran on a treadmill . When I finished and looked at my sock , it was covered in blood from that same area . I 'm not sure what the problem was , but I think it was the artificial material and the lack of padding . I would n't really recommend this shoe . Find one with better padding inside .
 These lace up boots have caused severe blisters and bruises . i am trying to return them after having worn them for one day . They 're worthless , make my feet sweat -LRB- faux-leather upper -RRB- , and are absolutely the worst pair of shoes i have ever purchased . Please , if value your feet , do not buy shoes online and do not buy kenneth cole reaction .
 I was not pleased , there were glue stains and rhinestones missing , but because I was pressed for time I had no choice but to keep them -LRB- they were to wear at my daughter 's wedding .
 These sandals looked great in the box , but as soon as I put them on I could tell they were too pointy , looking like they were big on me . As to comfort , forget it !! These sandals actually CUT my feet , the pretty stones are great in theory , but the manufacturer did n't execute the idea well . I wore these once and gave them away .
 I was looking for to this sandal to go with my outfit that also a zebra print . But these sandals run very narrow , so if you have a wider foot they may not work for you.I had to send mine back .
 I was so excited when I purchased these & got them in the mail . I 'd hear such good things about ` Reef ' flips flops ... but when I put them on , my heart sank . These flip flops are so narrow & the soles are so thin that the sides of my feet literally touched the ground . -LRB- Notably , I do n't wear wide shoes . -RRB- Ugh ! I had to send them back . I 'm not ordering anymore ` Reefs . ' I much prefer Sanuk or Yellow Box flip flops over these by far . Do n't waste your money people .
 THESE ARE WORSE FLIP FLOPS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED ! Something is weird about the piece that fits between the toes ; it gives my foot a sharp pain every time I walk . The bottoms are so flimsy I 'm afraid to wear them anywhere except inside my house , I fear I would get glass or something in my foot . Even inside the bottoms are so sticky they make me trip , on the carpet and my wood floors . I tried wearing them in the garage and it felt like I was barefoot ! I would have return them , but the return shipping would cost as much as these cheap flip-flops !
 Upon receiving these shoes , I found out a little more about the shoes . My major problem with these shoes is the bottoms of the shoes have lots of dull little rubber spikes on them , so they pick up dirt , mud , and just about anything that you step in so that you have to pry it out with a stick in order to remove it . If you only use them on concrete , they would be a good shoe , i suppose , but for anything else , it 's to much of a hassle unless you dont mind mud all over the floor . On the plus side they are comforable and very easy to take on and off . My advise is to spend an extra ten or twenty bucks to get a different brand .
 I bought these by mistake for my son.The shoes look good but do not last on concrete . The little rubber spikes wear out way too fast . Use them for what they are intended for ... Turf .

 These shoes are so comfortable that I had great hopes for their future . However , they started falling apart from day one of general wear . Literally . The heel support cracked on one , and chips would fall out every day . Holes appeared on the top surface -LRB- leatherette -RRB- and grew into larger holes and cracks . I could not walk anywhere there was wet ground , as the soles leaked . Finally , after two months , I gave up . Two months , Grasshopper ~ you owe your customers better than that .
 I have been looking for just yhe right color of sneakers for months . The denim color is rich & they are so comfortable.Great since I am on my feet all day at work .
 Well , I did like these shoes , they were very comfortable , and cool , however after just a couple months they fell apart , and the whole back on both of them ripped from the bottom of the shoe , in the denim ones anyway . So , as I said before they WERE nice for a little while , but I would n't want to buy them again .
 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .

 Good posterior & medial ankle support but the back of the ankle is too high & is not flexible enough . This is the area that rubs every time I wear them . The synthetic material just does not conform or break in very easily . Another player I know had same shoes with the white stripes & c/o getting blisters in the same area at the achilles .

 I purchased these Shoe Covers as a gift but for some reason the Qty kept defaulting to 2 although I only needed 1 . I 've changed the Qty back to 1 two different times but after adding another item to my order and back paging to re check something I did n't notice AGAIN that it defaulted to Qty

 I 'm usually ok with most of the pain that comes with heels . This bends the foot to an awkward form . The hole in the middle just cuts into my foot . It 's pretty though ... !!!
 After a couple of times waering the shoes the sole and leather separated in the arch -LRB- inside part of the foot -RRB- . No wonder these were on sale when I got them ...

 I purchased the women 's large , which should work b/c I am an exact women 's 9 . The shoe stretcher was way too large in length , width , height . Sure , it could stretch a sneaker , but why would I want to do that ? It is completely unsuitable for a women 's shoe , even if I did buy a smaller size -LRB- which is currently not available -RRB- . To return it , you have to pay nearly half it 's cost b/c of the item 's weight .
 i have a pair of 9.5 shoes , medium in width from Nine West . they are a little tight , so I bought this to stretch them out . It wont even fit into my shoe to stretch it out . This product is a waste of time . I will return it if I get a chance .
 the stretcher that was delivered was very off center in how it was made and the holes for the attachments were drilled crooked so that the metal pieces did not sit flush with the wood.I have another stretcher that appears to be a similar model that is excellent . I am looking for a better made product after returning this one
 Size 0 is indicated for a size 9 but 00 is better for me . The first one I ordered worked well . The second one , a few years later , has cheaper hardware that does not work as well when stretching the shoe . Am returning my `` 0 '' for a `` 00 '' and hope I get one of the better ones . This is made overseas with apparently poor quality control .
 These shoes ripped where the tongue meets the side wall after normal wear of half an hour . Returned to Eastbay . Still working on refund . My son has a similar pair of globe shoes that ripped in the same spot after several months .
 These are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever had . I missed the return window . Now I am stuck with this junk . 1 -RRB- when you walk they sound like your wearing cowboy boots -LRB- loud -RRB- . 2 -RRB- the inside is NOT comfortable . It feels like wearing plastic shoes . 3 -RRB- the foot opening is way to large , your feet slip out and they look like women 's slippers . -LRB- i checked and they said `` men 's '' -RRB- . Get some DC 's . They are much better . -LRB- P.S. . Who cares that they come in a cigar box ? I would 've preferred good shoes in a paper bag -RRB-
 Globe shoes wear out too fast , both pairs wore out with the lightest casual use . Please make your shoes better quality !
 They 're nice looking shoes but the seam around top of the toes ripped alot . I like how they look but they 've ripped a lot idk if i 'd buy them again .
 I ordered these shoes because I simply liked the way they look . However there are no half sizes ... I wear 11 1/2 and I got a 12 , they are too big , and I figured the 11 would be too small , so now I wear them with thick socks and its not that bad but if you wera a half size I dont really recomend these make of shoes
 My son is eight and has been wearing Sperry shoes for years . This shoe looks very nice however it runs small and narrow . The first pair I bought was a 1 1/2 M and was so narrow my son could not get his foot in the shoe ; the second pair I ordered in wide and they are still too small . He has a new pair of topsiders in the same size and they fit great . After sending back two pair I am not sure if I will order again , especially since I have to pay to return them and it is not possible to make an exchange .
 I guess I 'm just used to buying Pedipeds and Umi shoes , but I was really surprised at how extremely stiff the soles of these shoes are . It sounds from the reviews like they might break in okay , but for a little more , I can get shoes that do n't require breaking in . I 'm returning .
 Cute shoe unfortunately it runs small and narrow . I had to return it . I can not recommend this shoe . Amazon also charges an additional $ 5.00 for return .

 Very cute and colorful shoe . Made to look at and not walk in ! Very hard and uncomfortable . Could barely walk across my carpet in them .
 The other person who reviewed these shoes was completely right . They are so cute , though , I bought them despite her warnings . I should have heeded them . They are really painful shoes . Darn it , Naughty Monkey , why ca n't you make shoes that are cute AND comfortable -LRB- or at least wearable -RRB- ?
 These are really cute shoes . They are also really uncomfortable . I wear between an 8 and 8-1/2 . I purchased the 8 -1 / 2 but should have gotten the 9 . I am slowly breaking them in , but they would have been more comfortable in a size larger . The elastic cuts into my foot .
 These sandals are extremly uncomfortable . I wear a size 10.5 , but I ordered a size 11 , they were still very narrow and pinched my feet . Also they felt like I was walking on concrete . They are not ajustable and look and feel poorly made . For the same price go with Adidas sandals

Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .
 I purchased these Shoe Covers as a gift but for some reason the Qty kept defaulting to 2 although I only needed 1 . I 've changed the Qty back to 1 two different times but after adding another item to my order and back paging to re check something I did n't notice AGAIN that it defaulted to Qty

 I am very unhappy with this purchase . First let me say that I own 5 other pairs of this exact same shoe , they are my favorite style . When I received this pair I tried them on , and as with new shoes they seemed a bit stiff and snug , but I thought nothing of it since I own several other pair , all in the same size . So off I went to work wearing my new shoes - and by lunchtime it was clear that the right shoe is narrower than the left one , it was very uncomfortable . But I thought , well , I 've worn them so according to Amazon 's guidelines , they can not be returned , so I have tried to wear them again , hoping they 'd `` stretch '' or something , but to no avail . At this point they are sitting in my closet . I do n't know why one is narrower than the other , but it makes me wonder if the shoes that Amazon is selling are `` odd lots '' or seconds ... unfortunately , I have searched to find a way to talk to a live person at Amazon , but can not find a telephone number anywhere on the website . So I am out $ 75 , and I have decided not to order shoes from here again .
 These shoes did not fit . Were wider in the heel and gapped along the sides . I am going to have to try another brand .
 I Love the look of these shoes , however they heel is extremely hard and the left shoe of my black pair has an annoying squeak in it .
 The shoes were not as shown / They appeared to be bulkier and sturdier but instead were a very minimal shoe ... not one for a day of shopping when your feet need a lot of support . They were narrow meaning not much shoe sole on the ground . In summary , I was disapointed .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .

 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation

 These shoes come with their own storage pouch , they have leather soles with rubber no-skid island in the middle , they look pretty sitting in the box ... In short , before trying them on , they are the perfect pair for the price.But , they are just a tad shorter for the listed size -LRB- the heels hang out from the back just a few centimeters -RRB- and the band is a little too loose both for comfort and the look -LRB- the toe goes a little too far forward -RRB- . But the length of the shoe is short even with toe going all the way forward . For most other shoes , my feet are very true to the regular size I wear.No matter how good the shoe looks off the feet , it is not worth anything if the fit is not right . Very disappointed .
 I am very unhappy with this product ... These boots cost to much ... I have been wearing them on the job for three weeks and they 're still not broke in ... My apprentice at work bought a set and took them back after a week ... I want to return them but I bought mine on Amazon and do n't know how to send them back ... I may look in to Thorogood ...
 WATCH OUT FOR AETREX . So a while ago I stumbled upon a good deal on 3 pair of aetrex shoes . One was the listing here , and I also got two pain of yellow athletic trainers by aetrex . These shoes are comphy , but their design is HORRIBLE . the first time i wore these they tore along the dottet lines along the outide of the toe area , and two of the grip pads on the bottom fell off . I thought it was bad luck , got them sewn up and glued at a repair shop . Little did i realize that I was in for a repair of some kind every few wears with these shoes . They tore along the vent holes on both sides of the toes on R and L shoe over time . One of the grip pads on the bottom would fall off about every five wears , as well as small tears in other areas . I was dumbfounded , though maybe just a lemon pair . Then the other two pair of athletic shoes I got proceeded to fall apart w/in a week of my first wear . The part where the grip on the bottom wraps up the toe fell off on all of them , pads kept falling off the bottom , and other equally ridiculous things would tear , break almost every time i wore them . I called the company and they offered no help at all , even after arguing . they said i must have stored them in heat or something ? ridiculous . all three pairs fell apart faster than i 've ever seen a shoe do so . I have about five places where they are stiched , and half of the pads i glued on myself because they fell off , thank god for gorilla glue , among other repairs . I am never going to buy a pair of aetrex again , an i 'm so mad because they were over 70.00 dollars a pair or more and i got about a month or two of wear only out of each pair . I 'm not making this up , THREE PAIRS is too much to be coincidence . You do n't have to believe me but it 's the truth , BUYER BE WARNED .
 I purchased these shoes for my son based on the commercials and features of the shoes . I was very disappointed in the quality of them . The insole seemed like a piece of wood -LRB- very hard with no cushioning -RRB- . After walking for a while , my son would complain that the bottoms of his feet hurt . To top that off , the shoes only lasted 5 months . They started falling apart , and he only wore them to school . Should have been made better for the price .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 This shoe would have been ideal except for the fit . It was too short and the toe area too flat . I have worn VanEli 8N for years , but this was not comfortable .
 Not a very comfortable shoe . I dont know if it 's me or the shoe . My toes feel pinched and hurt after a while of wearing . Have not had this problem with other shoes I own . Even pointy toed ones . Problem may be with the shoe design .

 I searched and searched for a great pair of shoes for my husband . He has always worn Johnston & Murphy and everyone said these were better . He is on his feet constantly and needs something durable and comfortable . He wore holes in the bottoms of these shoes in two months . We did n't even bother sending them in to get fixed , they were always stiff , they scratched really easily and just were n't great . He went back to a cheaper pair of Johnston & Murphy shoes and they have held up really well and are a lot more comfortable for him . He has a narrow foot and he finds them a lot more comfortable for him than the Allen Edmond 's shoes .
 I bought a pair online from Nordstrom . The shoes fit perfectly and were very handsome . However , the leather quality was not so good and I felt like I was holding a $ 300 hunk of cardboard . The upper started crinkling up badly when I bent it slightly to insert the shoe lace . I was afraid of what they would look like after a couple wearings . I wanted to have a pair of dress shoes but did not feel these would still look good past a couple wearings . The sides of the soles were sloppy and reminded me of the Bass Weejun pennyloafers I wore when I was in my 20 's . When I took them back to my local Nordstrom store , the sales associate likened them to Birkenstocks . I think these shoes are better as office workhorses than dress shoes . If you are willing to spend 300 bucks for workhorses , these are just the thing for you.imo , for the texture and feel , definitely not worth 300 bucks . I do n't think I 'd pay $ 100 for them either. : -LRB-
 We returned the item because there was hard dryed glue that oozed up in the toe area of the insole and made them uncomfortable to wear . It gives the impression they could be seconds and the price was the same as if we bought them in the store .
 Many many many problems and issues with these shoes . This is why they do n't make shoes in America anymore . There seems to be no standard in any Allen Edmonds shoes . None seemed to fit right , they were all different . The quality and workmanship are very poor . There are many small defects . Very uncomfortable and stiff shoes . Shoe run very narrow . NOT WORTH THE MONEY !!!
 Firstly , the shoe looks great . Found the right size for the AE # 5 last
 The heel fell apart after only about 3 months - not what I had expected from a $ 300 + pair of shoes . Poor quality - definitely not worth the money .

 Received these shoes for Christmas and like other reviewers , was more than a little surprised at the extent of the `` distressing '' that Sketchers has applied to the shoe . These shoes literally look as thought the UPS truck that delilvered them actually ran them over a few times . There are strange and rather non-stylish black smudges all over the shoe . People have commented that the shoes look like those of someone that has been changing oil and rotating tires all day . The pictures do not show this . Indeed , I think online is the only mechanism that these shoes will be sold ... if you saw them in the store you would probably throw up !
 I ordered these shoes based on the picture provided , when they arrived i was dissappointed the color was much darker than it looks and it looked much different .
 SHOES WAS NOT EXCALTY THE SAME AS PIC SHOWN ON WEB SITE IT WAS KIND OF USED ...
 I have to say that the distressed look is fairly ugly . These do NOT look like the pictures on amazon.com . Also , these shoes are so wide on my feet . This is ridiculous honestly . I wish I could return them for a full refund including them paying for my shipping , because if I could , then I would . There is absolutely not support in these shoes . I ca n't even still my own orthotics in these shoes to fix it because they are so wide . I normally buy wider shoes like new balances because my feet are wider than normal and my feet fall right out of these . There is no way that I could wear these for more than fifteen minutes without them hurting my feet or just pissing me off since my feet keep popping out . Unless you are into what looks like worn shoes that are extra wide , then do not buy these .
 Hey , if these shoes are supposed to have the ` distressed ' look , then it needs to be displayed on the picture and told in the description ! Like the other two kind ladies who gave their review , I too , received the pair with black streaks and they looked filthy . I did n't expect that so I returned them and although I want to get another replacement , I see that the other woman ordered a pair and got the same streaks again on her second reordered pair so I 'm hesitant to proceed with another order . I too will be pursuing a full refund for these shoes .
 I experienced the exact same problem with my order as the lady who posted ahead of me . The shoes arrived extremely dirty and distressed , like they had been left out in the rain . I contacted Amazon 's customer service , told them about the problem , and they immediately agreed to ship another pair free of charge . The new pair arrived looking exactly the same as the first pair and I am livid . I will be returning both pairs of shoes and insisting on a refund .
 I bought this sneakers because I considered Skechers a big reliable brand . I was so mistaken ... I have owned them for 2 and a half months and the sole is already worn out and one of them has even a small hole in it . I am not much of a sportsman y I use them only for work -LRB- at the office -RRB- . I have had similar sneakers from another leading brand for more than five years now . You see , I am not like a `` shoe-destroyer '' or something.Conclusion

I wanted to have a pair of dress shoes but did not feel these would still look good past a couple wearings . The sides of the soles were sloppy and reminded me of the Bass Weejun pennyloafers I wore when I was in my 20 's . When I took them back to my local Nordstrom store , the sales associate likened them to Birkenstocks . I think these shoes are better as office workhorses than dress shoes . If you are willing to spend 300 bucks for workhorses , these are just the thing for you.imo , for the texture and feel , definitely not worth 300 bucks . I do n't think I 'd pay $ 100 for them either. : -LRB-
 We returned the item because there was hard dryed glue that oozed up in the toe area of the insole and made them uncomfortable to wear . It gives the impression they could be seconds and the price was the same as if we bought them in the store .
 Many many many problems and issues with these shoes . This is why they do n't make shoes in America anymore . There seems to be no standard in any Allen Edmonds shoes . None seemed to fit right , they were all different . The quality and workmanship are very poor . There are many small defects . Very uncomfortable and stiff shoes . Shoe run very narrow . NOT WORTH THE MONEY !!!
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .

 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .
 This bag is huge . I should have checked the measurements rather than relying on the picture . The bag is much longer than it is tall , not at all like the picture . Only buy this if you need a huge , wide bag .

I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 I purchased the black pair thinking it had gray lining like in the pictures , when I received them it turned out they were an army green color . Plus one shoe fit differently than the other . These are definitely going back .
 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .
 I ordered this in a size 5 big kids and received a size 5 infant .

 these shoes are super cute , I 've seen them in the store and my size wasn ; t available , so I bought them on Amazon . I bought the green . They came and they are indeed a lovely fun shade of bright green but the texture is matte and unfinished . I put them on and they definitely run a half size small . I wore them all morning around the house with socks to stretch them a bit . The cut of the shoes is such that it is cut just a bit low , and right on the bunion joint . I don ; t have bunions or wide feet but this is a bit of painful squeeze . It did ease up with the socks stretching them , though . There is NO support in these whatsoever , I wouldn ; t walk around town in them , maybe just at work or somewhere I don ; t have to walk alot -LRB- and I live in Brooklyn and walk EVERYWHERE . -RRB- The WORST thing is - I did wear them out yesterday and it rained a bit and they got wet . THE GREEN RAN ALL OVER EVERYTHING , my feet are GREEN and sheer pink polish on my toes is GREEN , and I can ; t wash it off . I put the socks back on with them and now the socks are GREEN too . The only thing I can think to do is to rub them with an oil-based leather protectant , it 's going to turn the leather darker but so what , because now they are all water-spot-stained anyway.If I ca n't make them better , they 're going back to Amazon , because shoes that ca n't withstand one day of actual wearing should not exist , not at a price of $ 90 !!! Who knew I 'd have to treat them like glass slippers . Save your money . Pretty but TOTALLY non-functional .
 So I bought these right after x-mas waiting for spring to come . I finally wore them out today and they are made very poorly . Living in Seattle ... it rains and once these got wet they turned a funny color and started tearing tiny lines into whatever kind of material these are made out of . They are cute ... they run really small . If you live in a place where they wont get wet go for it , but I would n't buy these again . They get two stars just for looking nice on .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 Pros : InexpensiveCons : Uncomfortable - narrow , top of heel back cuts into back of ankle , itchy zipper seam , does n't stay ` up and smooth ' on calf , looks a bit too ` club ' to wear anywhere other than a Saturday night
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I really wanted to like these...looks-wise , they are very pretty shoes ... but they just do not feel `` stable '' when you walk . They do not hold your feet in , and the ankle strap does n't help much in that department either . So while they look great -LRB- I bought the ones with the green straps -RRB- they do not feel sturdy enough for me . I feel myself walking a little slower and more carefully , because I feel like I 'm going to slip or turn my ankle . It would be a great sandal for just going out to dinner or to someone 's house , but I would n't recommend wearing them to any function that involves more than just walking to and from your car ! Also , I wish I had bought the darker ones because after wearing my lighter-colored soles a few times , they look dirty/stained ... I 've learned to always buy shoes with the darker fabric or leather footbed ... !
 These shoes are cute and comfortable but they are so poorly made that the ribbon strap snapped the second time I wore them and that was it - the shoes are unfixable . Trash .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style . The other color fits wonderfully but this pair , due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching . If your feet are medium , these may not be the shoe for you . It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched .

 These shoes looked great online but once I got them they lacked any support what so ever . Unfortunately , I had to return them .

 Now I used to buy Ugg boots ... that was when they were made in Australia and New Zealand ... but I really ca n't understand all you folks with your Chinese made UGGs ... whats with that ??? you might as well buy Bearpaw or Emu for all thats worth . Personally I will not buy a pair of UGG Australia boots for $ 125 upwards that are made in China ... because I do n't like the concept of being ripped off ... and for all you folks with your plush UGGs made in China ... whatever ... you are wearing expensive Chinese copies as far as I am concerned . Amazing what some people will buy just because of a name .
 I bought these to replace another pair which finally wore out after 13 years of use . The rear seam of one of these new boots split wide open while i was trying them on . The sole is n't what it used to be and the boots weigh half as much . I sent them back and got emu boots which i like much better for less money
 This review is for the customer service of the seller , I can not review the specific item becauseI did not end up getting the item from here . I was charged my credit card on one day and then refunded the next day . The item was a Christmas present and here I was waiting for the item and the seller did not even have the decency to send an email informing me that they were out of the item . I had to send emails to track down the item . Will be highly skeptical before buying anything on-line .
 I am convinced that men are not supposed to wear any kind of Ugg based shoe products . Much like sandals , Uggs convey a message that 90 % of men just can not convey . Perhaps European guys who weigh 90 pounds and drink tea while eating a crumpet , but not American men . We have Neanderthal feet , which should not be prettified in any way - it 's just like putting lipstick on a pig . It 's the reason you rarely see men chatting about their shoes - real men only care about two things with regard to their feet
 I am unable to fathom the success of these hideous boots . If I wore these I would have to kick my own a $ $ .

 Found these shoes very comfortable right out of the box , and they do n't look like those ugly golf shoes you often see . Look and feel like tennis shoes . Good price . However , at the end of the first summer two of the spikes fell out , and not just the spikes but the part of the shoe that holds the spike in place . Did n't notice it until the next summer so too late to do anything about it .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 These are the only running shoes that have continuously given me blisters . Even with good running socks after a couple 10K runs these shoes gave me a blister on my heel . I tried different lacing but it did n't matter . Threw them away . I thought I would buy some cheaper trainers for when I have to run inside on a treadmill . It can get down to around -40 for weeks here and I usually run outside . If you run less than 10K or just walk/slow jog it might not matter .
 So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks ... what a dissapointment . I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect . The inside of the shoe -LRB- like on your right foot , the left side , not the right -RRB- was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area , including smudging on the asics logo . This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged . Also , the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe . Poorly done , last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .

 These beautiful boots arrived today -- and I tried ... and tried ... and tried ... to get my foot into it . The ankle area is VERY narrow , and the angle at which one would have to try to get past that narrow area into the actual `` foot '' of the boot is impossible . -LRB- Hey , I 've had ballet and can point my toes pretty darned well ! -RRB- It is a gorgeous boot - but it seems to me to be designed to be impossible to get into . Sadly , these boots are being returned .

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .
 I am very unhappy with this product ... These boots cost to much ... I have been wearing them on the job for three weeks and they 're still not broke in ... My apprentice at work bought a set and took them back after a week ... I want to return them but I bought mine on Amazon and do n't know how to send them back ... I may look in to Thorogood ...
 I have purchased a new pair of mens reebok classic tennis shoes for over ten years now and always have enjoyed the quality of the tennis shoe . This is the first year I have purchased a new pair of mens reebok classic tennis shoes and been disappointed . The upper are no longer 100 % leather although they are listed on Amazons description as all leather . The uppers are now a balance of leather and man made materials . This is not the same as 100 % leather . The new leather/man made uppers feel cheaper and less flexible - I bought Reeboks before for their 100 % leather uppers . May seem a minor point but the quality of the shoe laces is not as good as past Reebok shoes either . They feel cheaper and lighter in weight and seem to come untied very quickly . I assure you that I do know how to tie a shoe after many years . Just a little disapointed they have changed somethings on the shoe - Will look for another brand or type of Reebok that has 100 % leather uppers from now on . Amazons need to change their description to reflect this change.Thank you .

 First off these shoes look great . They have that simple classic look that will forever look good , so if you 're looking to pick up a pair to wear around with jeans you 'll be more than happy . But , if you 're like me and looking for an inexpensive pair of shoes to actually play the game of tennis in these are not worth your time . The material is light and cheap and the rubber they use on the sole/toes does not hold up at all . After about two months of playing I had worn a hole all the way through the toe area on each shoe . So , 10/10 for style , 2/10 for durability on the court .
 Did a search for wide men 's tennis shoe and this came up . I did not realized that M was not the same as wide -LRB- since that is what I had searched for . -RRB- The shoe did not fit . Do not know about the quality or anything else . My son could not get it over the ball of his foot .
 I ORDERED SIZE 7 1/2 , BEEN WEARING THIS SIZE FOR 40 YEARS , TOO LITTLE , ORDERED SIZE 8 , TOO BIG , WHAT 'S THE DEAL ??????????
 I am sorry to say that these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned . I purchased two pair and ca n't wear either of them . They are extremely cute , but do n't let that fool you . Please understand that I am no stranger to wearing heels or trendy shoes . I rarely ever wear anything but heels and spend hours and hours on my feet . These hurt so bad that I actually had to go barefoot in public!Take my advice and stick to Enzo 's , they have never let me down ! Sadly enough , Steve Madden has lost the business of the biggest shoe addict on the planet . I will never buy another pair of Madden shoes .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 The shoehorn bent after the first use with new chukka boots . For shoes , it may be OK if the shoes are loose fitting and the shoe horn is just to save bending the back .

 As far as the price of the shoe goes it does not fit the poor quality of it 's build . I was looking forward to receiving this pair of shoes in the mail believing for the price I paid they would be top quality and ended up disappointed before I even tried them on . The velcro on the side of the shoes is not fully sown on which will cause them to fall apart much sooner than they ever should . I also received the order with no return label or order slip . Nothing was sent to me to indicate that I would be allowed to send them back and get a refund.It 's pretty difficult to disappoint me and this order all around had nothing about it that was positive except the timely fashion I received it in .
 I did n't like the quality of these boots at all they were not made out of leather but what almost appears to be plastic or something of that nature . I expected allot better quality boots for what they claimed to have been worth.I saw boots for 15.00 at walmart as good as these .
 They shipped the wrong size and wrong color . I sent both boots back and never got a refund . They owe me $ 120 . Amazon said I did n't resolve it according to their policy so they are absolved . I am upset - got no help from anyone . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SHOE MANUFACTURER AND KNOW YOUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS WITH AMAZON .

 The quality is great but I gave them a low rating because of the deceiving fit.I 've purchased Mootsie Tootsie shoes many times and have worn a size 8-1/2 for 35 years . I ordered these online out of convenience since it 's hard to find a place closeby that sells them.When I tried them on they feel more like a 7-1/2 . They 're not just the type of fit you know will stretch out in just a few wears - I ca n't even wear them they 're so snug!Now to play the game of returning them to the nearest store as recommended by the seller .

 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem
 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .
 I have not yet received this product , the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month . And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .

 These are pretty little shoes but not very comfy and it just did n't fit right for my small foot . I gave them away .
 Although attractive , these shoes were too stif and uncomfortable for my wide foot . Had to return them .
 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .
 This company sells shoes made from the hides of animals ; in fact , the majority of shoes they offer for sale through amazon are dead animal skins . If it looks and smells like an animals ' hide , and , it comes from a company who sells shoes made from the skins of once living animals - I 'm not buying it . A shoe marketed as `` vegan '' wo n't cause us to overlook the fact they sell products made from slaughtered animals .
 I have worn Earth sandals and loved them , but the new line of dress shoes do not lend themselves to the same comfort level as the sandals . These shoes caused blister at the heal .
 I purchased these for my daughter to wear in a beach wedding . She wears a size 8t which is the size I ordered . They were so small her foot didnt even slide all the way on ! They run incredibly small ... wish I would have known that !
 I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon , and was very disappointed and returned them . I normally wear size 10M from Adidas , as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs . Yet with these shoes , size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL , and quite painful . They were returned ... If you order them , make sure you get a larger/wider size !
 I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment ! The look and heel were ok , so does the GTX XCR . However , there is a major problem
 Do n't get me wrong these are nice high end shoes , however , I was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site . Nowhere on the products site was the -LRB- red -RRB- `` Outdoor Plein Air '' color shown as a choice .
 incorrect color was shown on the website . it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase .
 hi i ordered 3 pairs of flip flop from you 's and the slim aqua color and the red ones are really nice . i love them but the metallic ones fit but they are like irregular products , one look nice the other does n't . how can i send these back to you 's . i like the color alot but the flip flops dont look the same . please contact me . thank you for the other 2
 I have so many friends who LOVE their Havaianas ! I could n't wait to get them especially at that great price ! My experience was not the same though . I found them uncomfortable to walk in . The part at the side of the foot hit me in the wrong spot and was painful . I do n't think it is because I bought a pair that was a size too big either as I tried them on in the correct size in a shop and had the same problem . I love the color as it goes with everything and the bottom cushioning was great too , it 's just too bad I could n't walk in them . My experience with Amazon returns was once again a pleasure and hassle free which is why I keep coming back again and again , they make it very easy to shop !
 These flip flops are okay , but they do n't seem to be any different than a cheap pair from Old Navy or Target . I had a pair of Havaianas that were suuuuper comfortable and soft , but they met their unfortunate end at the teeth of a dog . I bought these to replace them , but they 're definitely not the same shoes . I 'm not sure if there are different types of Havaianas and I ordered the wrong ones or if these are just cheaply made , but they 're not nearly as comfortable . The price is right though if you are looking for a standard pair of flip flops and the gold color is great .
 I bought a silver pair last year size 7-8 -LRB- 37-38 -RRB- and I love them ! So much so that I just purchased the gold pair . . same size ... supposedly . The stamp shows 36-38 but they are clearly larger both in width and length . Like another reviewer stated . . a good half inch past my heel kinda looks dumb . Not sure what I am gon na do .
 I had a pair of havianas that broke last summer . . I loved that pair ... I ordered a gold size 37/38 , same as my previous pair ... Color is great . . But the fit is real wide , unlike my other havianas
 I ordered two different pair from Amazon LLC and both pair were shipped a size smaller than I selected . If they did not have them they need to remove their availability from the drop menu .
 The only good thing about these is the color . Hard and not comfortable at all , I just do n't get all the positive reviews .
 I place an order for a women 's size 5-6 and was sent a different style shoe in a children 's size 13 . I have been ordering from amazon for a long time and this is the first time this has happened to me . It make me not want to order from amazon anymore .
 Nice warm boot . But the leather that holds the rings for the shoe laces broke on both feet within one week of purchase .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India . The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be . I have worn this same style of Bostonian -LRB- Marco -RRB- for several years , and was completely satisfied . This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great , comfortable , well-constructed shoe . Return to having them made in Italy !
 If you see the description
 I bought the shoes because photography was written made &#8203; &#8203; in Italy.I received the shoes made &#8203; &#8203; in India ????? There 's a kind of fraud
 This is a very stiff shoe . I ordered the size to match a size 7 US . It was cut very small .
 The Fly Flot sandal is very narrow and is more like a size 6 than a size 6.5 - 7 . High arches ... forget it !
 These are nice shoes , however the sizing is way small ! I would recommend ordering at least a size or two larger than what you normally wear .

 Bought this in June 2008 for junior player . Good fit and comfortable , but the uppers were chaffed and ragged from 3rd wear.Used only oncourt but the soles are completely worn smooth by mid November 2008 , causing many falls on court.Not recommended for regular play .
 Tommy , what were you thinking ? Although they are lovely to look at , they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe , bar none . The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk , I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem , I was wrong . Take this design back to the drawing board and start again .
 I have some foot problems . I live in the city and walk long distances in my commute and usually love Clarks boots for their style and comfort . But this pair was n't for me . The leather is stiffer and less giving -LRB- and not just because they 're new -- other Clarks boots I have were n't like this -RRB- . The toes of these boots curve up and off the ground and after about a mile of walking in these , my feet were in a lot of pain . They are very stylish-looking boots , but they definitely are not the most comfortable .

 I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style . The other color fits wonderfully but this pair , due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching . If your feet are medium , these may not be the shoe for you . It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched .
 Although the description of these booties says they run true to size , they do not ! I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter 's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet . Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange . Not a great transaction experience .

 I used to love Rockports , but this pair has turned me sour . The line across the rear of the toes box is so uncomfortable I may throw away the shoes -LRB- I 've worn them for two long days at work to break them in hoping against hope . Not sure I can take the pain to try again .
 for the first I wear this shoes , after walking no more than 1000m , the heel port srubbed my heel , and get my heel peeling .
 This replaced an older Rockport shoe that was much better made . This has to be broken in . Have to find a replacement for this brand that I have used for years .
 I had to return these shoes . I ordered the Oxblood shoes but they were so dark they were practically black . Much , much darker than what was pictured or what they look like in stores .
 I wore these twice , both times on sunny days . I had applied high quality polish prior to wearing them . After the second time that I wore them , the top of the right shoe cracked in two different places.By purchasing these &#34; shoes , &#34; I fell into the reduced price trap . Either all Rockport shoes are now garbage or the shoes sold through Amazon are garbage , but I have been burned twice . Because the shoes did not crack until after 30 days , I can not get a refund ; -LRB- it 's like having your car break down the day after the warranty expires -RRB- . I suggest that you buy shoes elsewhere .
 This is the third pair of these shoes that I have owned . The previous two pair were comfortable and nice looking but this new pair has the look of pleather . Adding to the shoody appearance -LRB- which I thought I could improve with polish -- with no success -RRB- is the annoying squeek that these shoes make when walking in them . I would not recommend purchasing them .
 I purchased these under the impression that they might either have the sheen as shown in the product picture , or could at least shine up to that level - they do not and can not . As a casual shoe , it 's on the ever so slightly dressy side , but they do not really fit into a conservative work environment . The toe is a bit too thick to be dressy , and the thick rubber `` border '' that the sole creates around the toe simply is not all that classy . The product images shown simplyThe soles are squeaky on polished marble or tile floors , even though there is no obvious unusual wear - I suspect it is simply the material used . I find myself occasionally walking on the ball of my toe to avoid the embarrassing squeak . I did not discover this problem until they were well worn , broken in , and entirely unreturnable . The heel may wear quite quickly because the rubber is so soft , so taps may be requisite IF these fit you well - see below.The leather is not quite leather . I have older Rockports that have been made of far more pliable and comfortable , higher quality leather that broke in quite nicely . These are somewhat harsh pleather with the soft but overly thick lining that provides cushioning but no real comfort . They will crease to no end -LRB- and by no means gracefully -RRB- and can be stiff and painful to break in . My toes were blistered and calloused after one extended walking period
 I should have investigated this more . the shoe is fine for rainy days but its a pleather type material so not a daily wear dress shoe . I like Rockport so assumed this was real leather -LRB- I 've had several pairs and have always been happy -RRB- .
 I bought a pair in oxblood several years ago and found them to be very comfortable . When I needed a new pair of black shoes I felt safe in ordering the Ellingwood model online because I already knew they fit well . What I did n't anticipate was while the shoe upper is still made of leather , the tongue -LRB- which is not considered part of the upper -RRB- is now `` man-made '' . The stiff plastic-like material is not pliable and the edge digs into my ankle as I stride , making the shoe unwearable .
 I have always liked rockports but these shoes just do n't look like leather shoes . I also need shoes without metal shanks and it appears all rockports have them now . I sent them back .
 Out of the box , you 'd think these shoes are pretty comfortable - in fact , considering that they stole an important aspect of Mephisto 's shoes design , the Soft-Air mechanism -LRB- which Rockport calls the Kinetic Air Circulator -RRB- , they SHOULD be comfortable . But after a few weeks , they most certainly are n't . The quality simply is n't there compared to Mephisto shoes . The leather is thin , stiff and plasticky , the insole is cheap foam that quickly flattens out , and the rest of the shoe just is n't up to par with genuinely comfortable shoes . Once the insole wears out in a month -LRB- if you do much of any walking -RRB- , the shoes go from sort-of comfortable to painful . The hard leather does not conform to your foot , but rather squeezes it when you take a step and the toe cap digs into the top of your foot if the shoe bends too far . I do n't recommend buying these shoes unless your foot happens to be exactly the same as the shape of these shoes , because they 're completely unyielding and become painful even to sit around in after a few weeks .
 too narrow for my feet but if it were to fit , has nice appearance for a waterproof shoetry it for size
 They look nice . However , they did n't fit me well . I have wide feet and that 's why I bought the XW -LRB- Extra Wide -RRB- size , but it still did n't work and was n't comfy at all . I returned it .
 Perhaps it 's a mishap at the factory but the `` 8.5 '' that I ordered was easily an inch too large . This is strange considering the only reviews I could find about size were positive . All the same I 'll have to return them . I have size 8.5 or 9 shoes from many brands -LRB- penguin , timberland , puma , sketchers , etc. -RRB- so I thought I 'd be safe ordering this shoe through Amazon . Oh well , guess who 's paying the return fee .
 I have been a Rockport fan for many years , and ordered these along with a pair of Allander Plain Toe Oxfords . I returned both pairs immediately . The quality was awful . I have no idea what kind of material these shoes were made of , but it certainly did NOT seem like leather . I was disappointed because I have finally worn out a pair of Rockport oxfords that I bought a few years ago and was hoping to find a replacement . They do NOT make them like they used to ... not even close . Save yur time and your money and buy something else ...
 It makes weird noise when walking on the hard surface . It is uncomfortable for long walk .
 My last shoe was a rockport and was very comfortable from day one . But this shoe has been causeing me foot pains I never had before , like `` sesamoiditis '' . Even afte I take the shoes off , my feet continue to hurt all weekend and the worst part is that the shoe still hurts even after `` breaking it in '' fom two weeks of daily wear . I plan on getting rid of them .
 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .
 This company sells shoes made from the hides of animals ; in fact , the majority of shoes they offer for sale through amazon are dead animal skins . If it looks and smells like an animals ' hide , and , it comes from a company who sells shoes made from the skins of once living animals - I 'm not buying it . A shoe marketed as `` vegan '' wo n't cause us to overlook the fact they sell products made from slaughtered animals .
 I have worn Earth sandals and loved them , but the new line of dress shoes do not lend themselves to the same comfort level as the sandals . These shoes caused blister at the heal .
 The soles are so very , very thick and ridgid Walking was uncomfortable as the shoe did not flex with my foot . The size was fine but on every step my heel almost came out of the shoe . Looked nice but !!!
 I realize it 's UGG and so what you 're paying for is the name but the company could make an effort to try to make them worth at least 80 % of the price , but no , the soles are so stiff and un-giving that when you walk your heel rides up and down out of the clog . Also would it hurt or cost them so much to add some arch supports ? There is absolutely none so unless you 're one of the lucky few who have strong arches , you may limit the time you have these on , or do as I did and purchase supports .

 I bought the shoes because photography was written made &#8203; &#8203; in Italy.I received the shoes made &#8203; &#8203; in India ????? There 's a kind of fraud
 These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India . The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be . I have worn this same style of Bostonian -LRB- Marco -RRB- for several years , and was completely satisfied . This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great , comfortable , well-constructed shoe . Return to having them made in Italy !

 I bought these and they are so warm and comfy . If you are a half size , go down .

 These shoes are far heavier than other steel toed shoes I have worn . If you are not on your feet all day , and want something that looks a bit more business-like , then they may be a good choice . But otherwise , I would suggest something lighter .
 A cheesy product . This was not the quality I expected . I was hoping for something a bit nicer . Yes it wasinexpensive .
 I loved this bag for the few weeks it lasted . The shoulder strap is attached to the bag really flimsily , though , so it did n't take long for it to break . Now it sits in my closet . I wish it had been more durable .
 Bag is ok , nice leather but super small . Do n't expect to carry a Ipad in it as I had wished when I bought it . Key , Phone , change ... . that 's about it . Little expensive for a bag this size .
 The bag is the perfect size , lightweight and in general looks nice . However , the bag I received had some shiny glue-like stuff on it especially around the metal parts . I got a little of it off , but in one place it turned green when I tried to wipe it off , in another place the leather crumbled . It was all a little too much to pass off as ` weathering ' . I emailed the seller and did not get a response so I decided to return it and not order another . The refund was processed without question .

 I have bigger legs and I was hoping that they would stretch out . I was able to get my leg in but it just did n't look right and had to go back : -LRB-
 Although this boot appeared to be well made and I loved the look , it was difficult to put on . Once it was on , the boot fit very tight around the ankle which is unusual for me . The foot section fit fine , therefore a bigger size would not have been a good fit . I was disappointed but it was necessary to send this boot back .
 For all of you thinking about buying these boots ; do your feet a favor and skip it . Looks really pretty and it 's made out of really good quality materials . But has a major flaw ; the sole is terrible . You can feel the sole because the wool bed covering it is very thin and feels like you 're walking on little rubber pads . Very uncomforable . But worst of all , the heel does not have any support at all . You 're heels will be screaming in pain after a few hours of using it . I bought pads , lots of pads but it did n't make a difference . Now they are just stuck on the very back of my shoe closet .
 I bought these boots in North Dakota . At first they were great but 6 weeks later after being outside for 5 min my feet are freezing and wet . Horrible winter boots for places that actually experience winter . I expected them to last longer than 6 weeks . Of course Bearpaw wo n't do anything about it because they are n't in new condition . Do n't waste your money .
 These boots are sized wrong . My size 10 foot -- sometimes a 9 1/2 -- could n't make the turn into the foot of the boot . Since this was considered a buyer 's error , I would have been charged a fee to return them . I gave them to a size 8 wearing pal .
 This boot is a great alternative look to the `` UGG looking '' boots . I bought it because the front of the boot does n't look round down the same way like how UGGs do ... something I really do not like . The boot is very comfortable when you slip it on . The sheepskin inside is super soft and it feels like you are walking on a cloud . However , if you sit the boot down , you will notice that the boot leans to the front -LRB- you will also see this in many pictures of it -RRB- . This is because the ankle part pushes the boot forward ... and the stitching sorta cuts into the backside of the boot where your ankle goes . This would n't have been a big deal ... if it did n't make it super uncomfortable to walk in . The first 15 mins of walking in these boots seemed fine ... but after that , I started to notice how the ankle area kept rubbing against my skin . By the end of the day , the thin layer of skin on both of my ankles were bright red and was burning in pain . This is REALLY a shame because aside from that , I love the rest of the boot . I wanted to wear them everyday ! I 'm going to need to find a solution to remedy this problem before I wear them again . Would n't recommend a friend on getting it , however I wonder if UGGs have this problem ...
 BTW - could n't submit without picking a `` star '' rating - zero stars was n't an option!I was so excited to get my new boots until I tried them on!They felt cheap and fit weird - hurt my feet instantly - definitely not what I expected for almost $ 50-The worst part is it cost me over $ 10 in shipping fees to return these crappy boots - lesson learned - do n't buy shoes online !
 I ordered twice , and both times received the wrong size . I was credited for the returns quickly , however . Would not deal with this company again.Bearpaw Women 's Suede & Shearling 10 '' Boot - Style 410 EvaThe only reason I gave one star was that I had to to be able to post this review , or it would not be able to be seen .
 one of the boots was defective.the structure of this boot is not good.it folds near the ankle area
 As of November 16 , 2010 , I ordered 1 of Bearpaw Women 's M405-W Dream 10 '' Boot , Nutmeg ,8 M US . Though contained in the original packaging , the content was a completely different size.So I 'd like to return this one since it is not the one that I wanted . I want 8 size . Why packaging is 7 size !! Delivery from Korea . And A delivery cost are your charged please .
 This product was great for the few two weeks -LRB- comfortable , warm , and fairly light weight -RRB- . Unfortunately , the inside liner quickly began to wear down , as did the arch support in the boot making them pretty uncomfortable to wear . I did n't want to buy a new pair of boots so I inserted a new insole . I continued wearing them for another month , in which time the sole of the shoe began to crack and pull away from the fabric of the boot . I waterproofed the boot when I first got them since I live in a snow belt , but that does no good if water can get into the boot through the sole . Ultimately , these boots left my feet cold , wet , and aching . If you are looking for a good winter boot for everyday walking in the snow , do NOT buy these boots !!! They seem to be made more for fashion than function .
 I do n't agree with a restocking fee - I already have to pay to return the product !
 BEARPAW , from what I 've heard , is an excellent brand . They actually use real sheepskin , and real sheepskin wool on the inside of their boot . If you are into this style and not into brands , this boot is a good go . They 're sturdier than they look actually - I might buy a pair for cheap to wear to Tahoe over the winter but only because I would n't mind ruining them . They 're uncomfortable . They 're not UGG equivalent , but are a higher grade boot than EMU 's -LRB- and cost less . -RRB- Emu 's use threaded cotton instead of real wool like BEARPAW . If you are looking to buy something INSTEAD of UGGS - do n't waste your time . These are not the high quality of UGG and do not have the softness of UGG brand boots , which I had assumed with the same fiber content it would have the same quality however it does not . The boots are also a very tight fit . I usually wear 7 or 7 1/2 -LRB- depending on the shoe -RRB- and ordered a size 8 , and it was far too small . Also , something I found odd was that one of the boots was actually a little different in specs than the other -LRB- size , shape , etc -RRB- the two boots were NOT uniform at all , which is something you can expect of low quality shoes . You deserve a better boot than Bearpaw . Do n't buy these .
 I ordered these boots in September & did n't wear them until it got cold out in November . The right boot rubbed a blister on my heel & Im unable to wear these boots . Since it was past the 30 day return policy they wo n't take them back . I just do n't see how this will make or break the company !!! You would think that you would want a satisfied customer but I guess not !! My advice is do n't buy this product because the seller does not want to stand behind it !! I will contact Bearpaw and see if that gets me anywhere . Stay tuned !
 I ordered a dark brown 12 in boot and they sent me an ankle length sand colored boot . This is ridiculous , do not order from them .
 These are cute shoes but very uncomfortable . I have normal width feet but the front strapes and ring detail dig into your skin .
 I have been out state and just returned home and was happy my order was here . -LRB- that is untill I opened the box -RRB- The white hush puppies that I ordered are a sick grey but labeled as white.When you order a product you expect to receive what is shown , not some off colored product which was sent.Also the return policy is bad.I will not purchase from the co. that sent my shoes .
 Liked the shoe style , but the shoes were uncomfortable . Felt like they were off-center , causing me to walk on the arch more , which was very uncomfortable . I returned the shoes and Amazon did a fantastic job in acknowledging the return and very quickly processing the refund . I will shop with Amazon again !
 I bought these as uniform school shoes for my son . He found them light , however , they fit more like loafers and are very loose and sometimes feel like they will fall off his feet . They have no to little support for the arches and ankles . His foot slips in and out of them . They are his right size , however , they simply do n't fit very well as a daily secure school shoe . We also bought the New Balance Men 's Walking Shoe in black and he loves those and they fit more securely and snugly and comfortably .
 The shoes where very comfortable but the Shoes fit a half sizeto big and where very loose and sloppy .
 OK the title says it all , the boots are a monstrosity , they are horrifically ugly and if you want to be a savage caveman with no fashion flare , then these are your best bet ! I actually bought these as a gift for my sister and she puked when they were opened , these are awful , stay far away . Sorry for the graphic details , but these boots are unnecessary cruelty to the human eyes .
 Wore these three times for some recreational ball . They appeared to be well made and were very cofortable . On the fourth time out , the bottom of the shoe separated . Had to grab a roll of duct tape for an emergency short term solution to prevent injury .

 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I have worn Earth sandals and loved them , but the new line of dress shoes do not lend themselves to the same comfort level as the sandals . These shoes caused blister at the heal .

 These would be great boots if they were waterproof but they are not . Unfortunately , I did n't find that out until I went to Iceland which is a very wet country . My feet were soggy for two weeks straight . At the time , the boots were still pretty new with only about 100 easy miles on them.When I got home , I tested them very carefully in my sink . When I submerged the left boot in a few inches of water , it got wet in the footbed area after only 20 seconds . The right boot , about 30-40 seconds . Water did not enter through the upper areas , only around the soles.Goretex boots should not leak , period . Goretex boots of this price and supposed quality , even more so . I tried the same water test with 2 other pairs of old Goretex boots -LRB- with 500 + miles -RRB- and neither leaked even 1 drop of water after submerging for 90 seconds . I do n't get it because you could buy a $ 70 pair of goretex boots that does n't leak - these cost $ 200 !!! Worse yet , when I contacted Asolo and they were of absolutely no help in fixing the situation , or even looking at my boots . I talked to Lisa Erling and asked her if they wanted me to include anything in my reviews online . She said this
 Awesome bootsI ordered these boots for a week 50km hike thru the mountains , I took them out of the box and did a 20km a week before my trip , they are awesome , feel great , I could barely notice I was wearing boots , they are very light weight and your feet are always dry , no matter what ! I put them into the mud , walked thru streams and my feet were always dry.I mixed them with ankle gaiters and the job was done perfectly.Must buy!UPDATE ! 2 years after2 years after I started using the boots and on the top of a mountain both of the soles started to separate from the boots . I have no idea what happened . Is it normal for it to last just 2 years and about 14-15 weekend hikes?I had to cut the soles off and risk my life desending the mountain without traction.I dont know if I should trust this brand again and Im very disappointed or is it normal for a 200 + dollar boots to last this long?Pros : Very comfortableSuper good tractionFeet were always dryCons : Poor durability , boot lasted 2 years then sole came offLaces broke first year -LRB- wrote Asolo they shipped a new pair really fast -RRB-
 Tread separated off shoe after less than 50 miles . This company does n't do returns and stand behind their products . They all talk about great customer service and then leave you holding the -LRB- garbage -RRB- bag . One star because shoe was comfortable .
 Have these boots , not specifically this model , but a similar Asolo boot , and the soles are disintegrating ! Large chunks are falling off as I walk and soon all the rubber on the bottom will have fallen off ! There is hardly any wear on the boot itself , it looks new , but the soles are gone ! This should n't happen to a boot that costs this much ! I would never buy Asolo again , there are better boots out there .
 I have purchased these shoes before and never had a problem . I have small wide feet and ordered these in EW . Easy Spirit must have changed their sizing these were way too narrow and I had to return the shoes .
 I do n't know if it is the shoe or my foot , but I am finding them too large at the heels so they slip there causing irritation when I am walking/jogging on the treadmill . I would not buy this style again .
 I used to be a big Easy Spirit fan , until I bought Easy Spirit 's Jumper and Punter recently.First , the good
 These shoes are terrible and i totally hate them . I had originally ordered a pair of Easy Spirit Gofast which i loved but had to return because of sizing . As the Jumper was the only shoe available in a half size at the time i went with them even though i was n't thrilled with the style.The style though bad , is not why i dislike these so much . These are marketed as a walking shoe . I tested the walkability at the flower show and halfway through the show my feet were hurting . I do n't know why they call these walking shoes . I felt like Frankenstein 's monster in these shoes.They are so big and clunky and heavy and stiff . No ventilation , no flexibility they are n't good for walking let alone working out . And your feet will be so hot.I 've had these for a while a now but shortly into wearing them the man made material started peeling off . I feel like an old woman in these shoes !
 In person the boots looked like the picture , but the leather seemed low quality considering the price . It was like stiff cowhide , and when I tried on were n't comfy at all . Not enough padding in the boot I think .
 Though they are advertised as imported suede boots , these boots are made of some sort of plastic ! ALL MAN MADE MATERIALS is printed plainly on the bottom of the shoe.BEWARE - FALSE ADVERTISING !! NEWPORT NEWS has been alerted and they are `` very sorry . ''
 I 've been wearing a size 12 for almost 30 years , so I ordered a size 12 , but could n't begin to get my toes in it . I have normal feet -LRB- no wide width shoes in my closet -RRB- . This shoe was incredibly cramped at the toes and loose at the heel . I boxed them back up and sent them back to Eastbay within an hour . I 'm now out $ 26.90 for shipping -LRB- to and fro -RRB- , and do n't even own a pair of shoes yet .

 I should n = know by now not to purchase shoes or clothing online ... I sent the first pair bad because they were too tight and this pair is too big ... I 'm just going to give them away ... It 's too big of a hassle sending things back .
 I really liked these slippers when I first got them because they seemed sturdier than the ones from the Main store catalog . But I just noticed the sole is detaching from the upper after about 8 months .
 Purchased these for my husband , who loved them initially , but less than a week after he began to wear them , the stitching around the perimeter of the sole began to unravel on both slippers . The elastic side gussets also took on a scalloped look . Sent them back and was told that the same problem would occur again with a replacement pair , so I am now looking for a new brand to replace them with .
 I bought these slippers in Nov 08 , the insole wore thru at the ball of my foot by March 09 . They were worm and cozy at first . It was a lot of money for a short life !
 I 've had a pair of Old Friend Men 's slippers as well as another pair of Tamaracs . Both lasted 1.5-2yrs . Figured another pair of Tamarac slippers was in order after my original pair was losing its shape -LRB- the inside still held up though ! -RRB- . Everyone rates these so highly , and in-fact my original pair follows the trend ! However , the pair I just bought for over $ 50 + looks awful and worn after just over a month or so . I 'm really bummed and disappointed at the same time . They either are cheapening their materials , or I got a pair in a absolutely awful batch . Sheet happens . Old Friend Men 's here I come !
 I bought these for my husband based on the good reviews here . He has a little bit of a wide foot , so I ordered a 10 wide , thinking he 'd be able to wear them with or without socks . Well , when they arrived , my husband could barely get his foot into it . Once he did -LRB- without socks -RRB- his foot looked like a sausage in a casing inside the slipper ! He said the bottoms were n't very well cushioned either , and the soles are not very flexible at all . We had to return them . I paid a bit more and ordered him some Uggs instead . Hopefully they 'll be a better fit and quality ...
 These Tamaracs seem well-made and comfortable -- except that they are pointy-toed , so that there is no wiggle room , and toes are crammed together . I wear 13m shoes , and I ordered 14m . My old EMU slides were much more comfortable , but -- according to several reviews -- have deteriorated in quality . Hard to find a shearling slipper that has deep toe , and wide wiggle room . Why ? Perhaps they can cut more shoes out of the material if they do n't follow the natural contours of most feet ?
 Previous reviewers were absolutely right . They run very small . I take a 8.5 W shoe size , and a 10 M -LRB- inexplicably , no 10 EE available -RRB- was TOO SMALL . The design also is tight over the top of the foot , making them a bad choice for anyone with a high instep . Otherwise , they look handsome and well-constructed . A word of warning
 I am a size 10.5 or 11 and i ordered size 11 on these slippers and they are too tight ! At least a 11.5 or 12 if you are a size 11 is my recommendations . Ended up giving them to my cousin who is a size 10 . Remember these run small so get .5 or a full size bigger .
 My wife got these for me for christmas , and at first I thought they were great , but the sole fell off of the right slipper after about 4 months . Quite disappointed that they did n't last at all . And it 's not like I ran marathons in them or anything . My last pair -LRB- Acorn -RRB- lasted many years .
 The description on Amazon item page
 These slippers run small . I ordered the size my husband would normally wear and we had to return them . They would not let us exchange them so we ended up paying shipping 2 ways and never got anything for our money . We basically threw our money away .
 I was looking forward to warm , fuzzy slippers . I usually wear a size 8 Wide , and that 's what I ordered . I tried them on , but they were too tight in the width . The length was barely adequate . Got return authorization right away .
 Nothing to write home about , the fit is poor and irregular size . Originaly ordered a pair and stitches were missing , but the fit was okay . Ordered a second replacement pair and they look okay , but the fit is sloppy . I have now spent a little over a month ordering , returning and so on , to buy one pair of slippers . I simply accept and will make do what they have sent me , and consider any further action with regard to these slippers as being just , &#34; more wasted time &#34; . You can do better . shop arround .
 I bought these slippers for my husband the end of October 2012 and in 2 1/2 months they are totally worn out . The sole on the right foot cracked and split and the seams along the top part of the foot on both both feet have broken away from the sole ! I am very disappointed as I thought these sheepskin slippers would be durable . I would never recommend this brand again !
 I love Keens and own two other pairs . These were just too bulky , and I had to send them back .
 I used to be a big Easy Spirit fan , until I bought Easy Spirit 's Jumper and Punter recently.First , the good
 These shoes are terrible and i totally hate them . I had originally ordered a pair of Easy Spirit Gofast which i loved but had to return because of sizing . As the Jumper was the only shoe available in a half size at the time i went with them even though i was n't thrilled with the style.The style though bad , is not why i dislike these so much . These are marketed as a walking shoe . I tested the walkability at the flower show and halfway through the show my feet were hurting . I do n't know why they call these walking shoes . I felt like Frankenstein 's monster in these shoes.They are so big and clunky and heavy and stiff . No ventilation , no flexibility they are n't good for walking let alone working out . And your feet will be so hot.I 've had these for a while a now but shortly into wearing them the man made material started peeling off . I feel like an old woman in these shoes !
 I do n't know if it is the shoe or my foot , but I am finding them too large at the heels so they slip there causing irritation when I am walking/jogging on the treadmill . I would not buy this style again .
 I have purchased these shoes before and never had a problem . I have small wide feet and ordered these in EW . Easy Spirit must have changed their sizing these were way too narrow and I had to return the shoes .
 My review is strictly regarding the product information on amazon.com and the sender 's mistake on the color.When I saw this bag I was very happy to find something I could use for international travels since the product dimension provided on this website said `` 21x5x14 '' . I thought that 's perfect size to fit all my travel stuff on top of my carry-on bag . However , when I opened the box , I was surprised to see this little hand bag . . I thought it was folded somehow . . but NO . . that 's all ! In fact , on the tag , the product dimension is `` 8.75 x4 .75 x7 .75 '' . So be ware . . future customers . The information on the website is incorrect.Another problem was the color . I ordered `` true blue '' but the only thing that was `` true blue '' was the gorilla attached to the bag . The actual bag is BLACK . I 'm quite disappointed and I 'm returning it tomorrow . : -LRB-
 These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India . The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be . I have worn this same style of Bostonian -LRB- Marco -RRB- for several years , and was completely satisfied . This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great , comfortable , well-constructed shoe . Return to having them made in Italy !
 If you see the description
 I bought the shoes because photography was written made &#8203; &#8203; in Italy.I received the shoes made &#8203; &#8203; in India ????? There 's a kind of fraud
 I love my last pair of Eastland loafers . These however are not the same quality . They only have half of an insole . The ball of the foot and toes are directly on the course leather . I had to buy insoles after spending almost sixty dollars . Very disappointing . We 'll see how they hold up .
 I ordered these expecting a lovely shoe , sadly disappointed.The inside and the leather were inferior and looked cheap , there was no support at all inside unlike most loafers.The length was true but they turned out not to be very narrow -LRB- I have narrow feet -RRB- I live in the UK and buy all my shoes from the US on line so not worth sending them back , just wo n't buy this make again .
 I purchased these in a 10 and they were way too short but width was fine . They stop making half-sizes after 10 so my only option was to go up a complete size to 11 - they were like boats on me . I 'm now stuck with them ... Also the quality is just NOT there ... Never again !!
 I purchased this shoe in July , 2012 and we are in December , 2012 . I wore the shoe twice and it burst at the top seam . I took it to the cobblers to have the tear sewn and I was advised that nothing could be done as the shoe has dry rotted . I am extremely disappointed with this purchase and would certainly not buy this brand ever again .
 THE SHOE WAS A GOOD LEATHER GREAT FIT BUT THE COLOR WAS NOT NAVY IT LOOKED MOREBLACK THAN ANYTHING ELSE
 I sent them back they did not run true to size . I wish I could find a pair some place that I could try on before I buy them . Bass Shoes in Phoenix Oregon went out of business.You would think J.C. Penneys would carry Penny Loafers ! Anyone out there that knows where I can try them on and then buy them please let me know . tracybet@charter.net
 I found these sandels very hard to keep on my feet . I would walk right out of them . Perhaps it was the width .
 I LOVE Steve Madden shoes -LRB- and own so many ! -RRB- and have never had a problem with them for sizing . I generally wear a 6.5 or 7 , but almost exclusively wear a 6.5 in Steve Maddens -LRB- their shoes tend to run big I think -RRB- . These shoes do not fit true to width or size . I tried on both a 6.5 and 7 in these but could not comfortably get my foot to fit into either one . They do n't look that narrow ! The heel comes up really high and I tried all sorts of weird angles to get my foot in without the leather folding over to no avail . Maybe this is one of those out sourced `` supposedly '' name brand shoes . Who knows . I do not recommend .
 These shoes are far heavier than other steel toed shoes I have worn . If you are not on your feet all day , and want something that looks a bit more business-like , then they may be a good choice . But otherwise , I would suggest something lighter .
 The slippers looked and felt great . I gave them to my 15yr old son as a gift . However , within 1 week , the stitching came loose from one of the slippers around the sole . I had to take them to a shoe repair shop and have them stitched again -LRB- both of them -RRB- for an additional $ 8.00 .
 MADE IN CHINA ... that should tell you something about the product . Only the upper flap showing in the picture is 100 % sheepskin ... the inside where it touches your feet is actually polyfibers . Very nice spice color and good sole but very disappointed that the inside is NOT sheepskin . Why not make the inside with sheepskin and the outside part with the fake stuff ?? ... just shows how backward our society really has become .
 The only part of these slippers that contains sheepskin is the exterior cuff . The upper interior is made from wool -LRB- not nearly as soft -RRB- and the interior footbed is made from cheap synthetic acrylic . Sent these back for a refund.You can find much higher quality 100 % real sheepskin slipper , almost identical in design to these for only $ 10 more at a store that rhymes with Kabelas . -LRB- Amazon automatically deletes my reviews when I spell the name of the store with a `` C '' -RRB-
 These are very nice slippers , but much too narrow ! My husband always wears a 10 medium and these were too narrow for him . They ca n't stretch out as you wear them , because the very firm soul is simply made too small . And they are n't offered in a wide . Be very cautious with these .
 I was disappointed . I did n't like the way they looked , and they were lumpy underfoot . I have flat feet and need a lot of support . I did n't like the color of the folded-over sheepskin . So I sent them back .
 Poor construction , uncomfortable andnot worth the money . The materials advertised stirred the mind with hopes of warmth andpractical leisure . The price was presented as something special . At $ 20 less it would still be overpriced . These types of products make online shopping a crap shoot and will eventually destroy the trust that it needs to be sustained .
 These slippers are definitely not worth the price . My husband has had a pair for only two months and they are falling apart . He barely wears them so I do not understand how they could possibly be falling apart already but they are . PLus he sayus there is a seam right down the middle of teh sole that makes them really uncomfortable .
 My order took 10 days to arrive . After all the glowing reviews on this pair of slippers I thought I would be very satisfied with my purchase but I was wrong . I tried putting on the slippers which I ordered in my usual shoe size but I was unable to fit my foot into the opening of the slipper comfortably . There seems to be a reinforcement over the top of the slippers that caused this . After I finally got my feet into the slippers they seemed to fit fine so I know they are the correct size . I 'm disappointed that at this price they were not better quality . I 'm surprised that so many people reviewed this product with high ratings and it makes me wonder if they are legitimate reviews .
 Ewww . Bought these during the Gold Box deal in men 's size 12 for friend 's birthday . Box said size 12 which is what I ordered , but the slippers inside were marked size 11 . Even worse , they were USED . They did not have the original bags inside the box , the slipper soles had wear and some dirt , and the inside had toe and foot imprints on the footbed . Yuk . Luckily I was able to return them for a refund , but disappointed not to have the gift I planned and that Amazon would ship out a used item .
 Most of the fur has pulled away and has fallen off on the base of these slippers after only 3 weeks . What is left is a `` rubber '' type of material where the fur has pulled away . I am now forced to wear socks while wearing the slippers . If I do n't the inside base of the slippers become ... . Well , slippery . Not what I expected from a $ 60 pair of slippers .

 these slippers look so warm & cozy , but my husband 's feet are still chilled when wearing them . they were n't cheap , so I am disappointed . also , i would suggest anyone purchasing these order at least a 1/2 size up . unfortunately , there was no mention of this in the product description , so not only are my husband 's feet still cold , but now they are a bit cramped , too !
 It is a fine looking picture . Unfortunately this is not what I received in the mail . My order was messed up totally and I ended up sending the product back for a full refund . Had I actually gotten the product I ordered I imagine I would have been much happier.As it is I have placed a similar order from a company I have used before and I do not anticipate any problems .
 I got these for Christmas but the toe box is very narrow in these slippers . I sadly enough had to return .
 As another reviewer noted , these Tamarac by Slippers International `` shearling '' slippers are not 100 % sheepskin-lined . Only when the slippers arrive do you see on a sticker on the soles that the lining is 50 % acrylic . This should be clearly stated in the product description on Amazon .
 I read tons of slipper reviews before purchasing these . A lot of the reviews for other slippers said that the slippers were n't true to size , but these slippers had much better ratings especially about being true to size . My husband has a size 7 foot so I ordered a size 7 and he could n't get them on because of his high arch . They may have fit length wise , but that does n't matter if he ca n't get them on . Also , the shearling cuff on one side of each slipper was glued in place without enough shearling to cover the glue . It looked very cheap . I sent them back immediately and received a full refund -LRB- thanks Amazon ! -RRB- .
 I bought these for my father for Christmas in his normal size , but they were too small . If you purchase these , make sure you order a size larger .
 I received these slippers last year , and did love them when I first started wearing them.A year later today and there are quite a few problems.While the outside of the slipper has held up , even with occasionally walking outside with them . The inside bottom of them has pretty much worn out to the stitching . All the nice comfy warm padding it pretty much gone and these are only worn for a few hours each day around the house.The biggest complaint however is these things flat out stink . My feet do not sweat that much but it did n't matter.I 've tried washing them with no success , using powder , etc. . They just smell and will be going in the garbage.Rather disappointing for a $ 60 slipper .
 I recieved the black shoes with a brown zipper , my first compliant . Them my second wearing the brown zipper broke . I noticed they are not American made any more . Dont take a chanceand buy these shoes the workmanship is terrible . msskttty@aol.com
 I liked the color and the way the moccasins were made , but they are just way too narrow . Please make them in a wide width . Could n't even get my foot in them and I ordered a half a size larger than what I wear .
 really to narrow couldnt get my foot in i am sending back for a refund sorry make them in wide !!!!
 These ARE NOT official Minnetonka mocs . I had a pair of a really nice blue shade back in the day and wantd to &#34; get them back &#34; again . These were a letdown . I would have given it no stars if I could have but it does n't allow for such on here . They were tight and my feet could n't even tolerate the try-on ! The color blue was also more of a cloudy blue and not the nice sky blue I had before -LRB- I had the blue ones probably about late 90s -RRB- I returned them asap ! : o -LRB-
 I returned these for credit because the very small lace eyelets were not right for the very wide laces . I have already rated these before .
 I purchased these in a 10 and they were way too short but width was fine . They stop making half-sizes after 10 so my only option was to go up a complete size to 11 - they were like boats on me . I 'm now stuck with them ... Also the quality is just NOT there ... Never again !!

 I sent them back they did not run true to size . I wish I could find a pair some place that I could try on before I buy them . Bass Shoes in Phoenix Oregon went out of business.You would think J.C. Penneys would carry Penny Loafers ! Anyone out there that knows where I can try them on and then buy them please let me know . tracybet@charter.net
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .
 They look nice . However , they did n't fit me well . I have wide feet and that 's why I bought the XW -LRB- Extra Wide -RRB- size , but it still did n't work and was n't comfy at all . I returned it .
 I used to love Rockports , but this pair has turned me sour . The line across the rear of the toes box is so uncomfortable I may throw away the shoes -LRB- I 've worn them for two long days at work to break them in hoping against hope . Not sure I can take the pain to try again .
 I have always liked rockports but these shoes just do n't look like leather shoes . I also need shoes without metal shanks and it appears all rockports have them now . I sent them back .
 Out of the box , you 'd think these shoes are pretty comfortable - in fact , considering that they stole an important aspect of Mephisto 's shoes design , the Soft-Air mechanism -LRB- which Rockport calls the Kinetic Air Circulator -RRB- , they SHOULD be comfortable . But after a few weeks , they most certainly are n't . The quality simply is n't there compared to Mephisto shoes . The leather is thin , stiff and plasticky , the insole is cheap foam that quickly flattens out , and the rest of the shoe just is n't up to par with genuinely comfortable shoes . Once the insole wears out in a month -LRB- if you do much of any walking -RRB- , the shoes go from sort-of comfortable to painful . The hard leather does not conform to your foot , but rather squeezes it when you take a step and the toe cap digs into the top of your foot if the shoe bends too far . I do n't recommend buying these shoes unless your foot happens to be exactly the same as the shape of these shoes , because they 're completely unyielding and become painful even to sit around in after a few weeks .
 I have been a Rockport fan for many years , and ordered these along with a pair of Allander Plain Toe Oxfords . I returned both pairs immediately . The quality was awful . I have no idea what kind of material these shoes were made of , but it certainly did NOT seem like leather . I was disappointed because I have finally worn out a pair of Rockport oxfords that I bought a few years ago and was hoping to find a replacement . They do NOT make them like they used to ... not even close . Save yur time and your money and buy something else ...
 It makes weird noise when walking on the hard surface . It is uncomfortable for long walk .
 My last shoe was a rockport and was very comfortable from day one . But this shoe has been causeing me foot pains I never had before , like `` sesamoiditis '' . Even afte I take the shoes off , my feet continue to hurt all weekend and the worst part is that the shoe still hurts even after `` breaking it in '' fom two weeks of daily wear . I plan on getting rid of them .
 too narrow for my feet but if it were to fit , has nice appearance for a waterproof shoetry it for size
 for the first I wear this shoes , after walking no more than 1000m , the heel port srubbed my heel , and get my heel peeling .
 This replaced an older Rockport shoe that was much better made . This has to be broken in . Have to find a replacement for this brand that I have used for years .
 I had to return these shoes . I ordered the Oxblood shoes but they were so dark they were practically black . Much , much darker than what was pictured or what they look like in stores .
 I wore these twice , both times on sunny days . I had applied high quality polish prior to wearing them . After the second time that I wore them , the top of the right shoe cracked in two different places.By purchasing these &#34; shoes , &#34; I fell into the reduced price trap . Either all Rockport shoes are now garbage or the shoes sold through Amazon are garbage , but I have been burned twice . Because the shoes did not crack until after 30 days , I can not get a refund ; -LRB- it 's like having your car break down the day after the warranty expires -RRB- . I suggest that you buy shoes elsewhere .
 This is the third pair of these shoes that I have owned . The previous two pair were comfortable and nice looking but this new pair has the look of pleather . Adding to the shoody appearance -LRB- which I thought I could improve with polish -- with no success -RRB- is the annoying squeek that these shoes make when walking in them . I would not recommend purchasing them .
 I purchased these under the impression that they might either have the sheen as shown in the product picture , or could at least shine up to that level - they do not and can not . As a casual shoe , it 's on the ever so slightly dressy side , but they do not really fit into a conservative work environment . The toe is a bit too thick to be dressy , and the thick rubber `` border '' that the sole creates around the toe simply is not all that classy . The product images shown simplyThe soles are squeaky on polished marble or tile floors , even though there is no obvious unusual wear - I suspect it is simply the material used . I find myself occasionally walking on the ball of my toe to avoid the embarrassing squeak . I did not discover this problem until they were well worn , broken in , and entirely unreturnable . The heel may wear quite quickly because the rubber is so soft , so taps may be requisite IF these fit you well - see below.The leather is not quite leather . I have older Rockports that have been made of far more pliable and comfortable , higher quality leather that broke in quite nicely . These are somewhat harsh pleather with the soft but overly thick lining that provides cushioning but no real comfort . They will crease to no end -LRB- and by no means gracefully -RRB- and can be stiff and painful to break in . My toes were blistered and calloused after one extended walking period
 I should have investigated this more . the shoe is fine for rainy days but its a pleather type material so not a daily wear dress shoe . I like Rockport so assumed this was real leather -LRB- I 've had several pairs and have always been happy -RRB- .
 I bought a pair in oxblood several years ago and found them to be very comfortable . When I needed a new pair of black shoes I felt safe in ordering the Ellingwood model online because I already knew they fit well . What I did n't anticipate was while the shoe upper is still made of leather , the tongue -LRB- which is not considered part of the upper -RRB- is now `` man-made '' . The stiff plastic-like material is not pliable and the edge digs into my ankle as I stride , making the shoe unwearable .
 Perhaps it 's a mishap at the factory but the `` 8.5 '' that I ordered was easily an inch too large . This is strange considering the only reviews I could find about size were positive . All the same I 'll have to return them . I have size 8.5 or 9 shoes from many brands -LRB- penguin , timberland , puma , sketchers , etc. -RRB- so I thought I 'd be safe ordering this shoe through Amazon . Oh well , guess who 's paying the return fee .
 These slippers were not worth the price . I 've Been wearing them now for 2 months and they are already starting to fall apart . I 'll never buy anything like this online again . Much better to go to a shoe store so you can see the quality before purchasing .
 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .
 For what these cost I would expect them to be great but the fabric that goes between your toes causes pain and they are also a bit too tight a fit for my regular size that I wear . So , I will be returning these and getting sandals that cause no discomfort between my toes .
 I have a different model of Reef sandals that are very good and extremely comfortable , but these are not . I do n't know if the strap is different material , or if it has been sewn differently , but wearing these gave me blisters and rubbed holes in the tops of my feet around the toes . I am not able to put my finger on exactly why , maybe because they were new , but in five days of wearing these on vacation , I never felt comfortable , and was often conscious of the discomfort . I try to be optimistic , maybe I got lemons , or maybe Reef missed on this particular design .
 The sandal looks fantastic , but my foot did not even come close to fitting in these . It was like stuffing a sausage through a pinhole . I gave it two stars for the cool bottle opener feature .
 I have been wearing these for 4 months now doing all the things you hope to do in a sandal . The comfort is amazing , A + . Their demise is that they stink , literally and it is becoming unbearable . It maybe the leather strap after so many wet/dry cycles that is causing it or the rubber sole soaking in all the foot juice but I have never had a sandal stink like these do . After a lot of reading about how to remove it everyone has their own suggestion with no real cure out there . Some seem like a lot of maintenance for a sandal that is IMO supposed to be pretty much maintenance free.They look cool , they feel cool but unless you work on a farm you wo n't smell cool in these shoes .
 I bought these because they were the highest rated and the best selling at the time . As cool as these are , the little flap that goes between your big toe and your middle toe on the size 10 pair I received hurt . I 've worn them around on the beach and around several city blocks thinking the flap would loosen up ... alas , the flap is n't any softer and they still hurt . My wife tried them on as well and agreed .
 Far too wide to be called medium . Basically just two strips of leather stitched together . So , if one just likes some kind of sloppy slide to wander around the house , guess they 're OK . I have narrow feet anyway , purchased these a size down to compensate , and they 're still like boats , which normally is not the case with other shoes .
 I was hesitant about buying running shoes w/o trying them on first or getting fitted , but these were true to size and oh so comfortable . You really can feel the difference . Their return policy -LRB- 60 days , used -RRB- also reassured me that if they did not work out , I was n't stuck with them . * UPDATE * I 've had the shoes for a few months now -LRB- well passed the 60 day return period -RRB- and the rubber at the bottom is starting to become unglued -LRB- towards the sides of the shoes -RRB- . I most definitely do n't run everyday so this is quite disappointing to see happen already . Substracting some stars ...
 Construction of the shoes was great but it was one size too big and the calf size was more like a size 17 '' . Very comfy too bad they made me look like I was wearing goulashes .
 Good product but there but no 1/2 sizes on Amozon for men slippers - I had to send 2 pairs back 9 's we 're too small and 10 's too big - that was a disappointment I really liked them and tried twice for the correct size .
 Bought these slippers as a present and they did n't fit the person I bought them for.They were advertised as wide and were not anywhere near wide enough . They did look like nice slippers though too bad they did n't fit .
 Someone in this company should review American foot sizes . When a customer requests size 12 wide he should not get size 11D .
 Out of the box , these slippers are pretty much among the worst things I 've ever put my feet into . And I once stepped barefoot into dog poop.First of all , they reek . It smells like play-dough , not like new shoe . I like new shoe smell . It 's a good smell , it 's a nostalgic smell . Play-dough ? On my feet ? Not so much . They 're moderately soft , which I can live with . But really , slippers should be like putting your feet into clouds . They 're for relaxing , taking a load off . If I wanted support I 'd wear my shoes . I want something I can wear around the house , indoors and out , and imagine I 'm on sunshine . These are more like I 'm on the moon . Do n't get me wrong , I like the moon , it rules , but definitely not what I was expecting . They just do n't feel like a slipper . They feel more like a furry shoe . Could be a positive if you 're into that sorta thing.But really , those are the least of my qualms . The reason these slippers are so horrible is that the stitching on the inside is sub par . Strike that , it 's sub sub par . It 's so sub par it 's almost circled around and become above par . The elastic binding the top to the sides just sticks out there , scratching the tops of your feet . It 's really quite uncomfortable , and a little disconcerting . Here 's an idea for the manufacturer
 Bought these because they did n't use any animal products in their manufacture . Should have known better , but never had any experience with this manufacturer . Will not be purchasing any other products from this company as the soles completely deteriorated -LRB- dry rotted -RRB- after only 1 year . I had a pair of lambskin booties for ten years before the soles wore out -LRB- when i was a kid/early teen and used them outside probably a little too much -RRB- . One year of use is clearly insufficient . I hope this review saves people some time and money with this type of sole/manufacturer .
 this is not what it appears the shape and qc is missing and its not a cheap product shame someone doesnt look into thisthedistshould have thatresponsibility
 This Christmas present for my boyfriend was a bust!The weight of the slippers was very heavy . They were poorly made inside , the stitching was unfinished and was very sharp . Whew , they also had a strong odor .
 Ordered Size 14 EEE ; they sent Size 14W . Too narrow and hurt my feet . Will be returning them . I 'll order a different style or different brand .
 I 've had this brand before and linked them but as I grow older I need a wider shoe so this time I ordered a 10w -LRB- wide -RRB- to replace my prior 10 slipper . The new ones are NOT any wider . I can place the old and new sole-to-sole and clearly the sole is n't any wider . I 've very disappointed and will have to return them , which is a big hassle for me .
 The slippers are unable to be used in bare feet . The insides are strengthened with very hard stiff canvas with very sharp edges and corners . After using twice only I had three scrapes on the arch of each foot . I now use heavy athletic socks before using ... completely defeating the object of carpet slippers . The slippers have a very pungent chemical odor which persists to this date . Not a good buy .
 The slipper is very scratchy against the top of my foot even with socks , it 's just on the sides of the ridge over the foot . Not alot of floor grip but fine on carpets.With any item you purchase to wear , my best suggestion is to try it on at the store , find the items that fit and look good and are comfortable then buy them online and you should be 90 % -100 % satisfied ... plus you wo n't be paying the stores `` overhead '' mark-up ! This small problem -LRB- was the first one with this company -RRB- wo n't stop me from buying more items from this company , I 'll just try them on in a store before I do .
 I bought a pair of `` Tamarac '' slippers with real leather and sheepskin for my husband about 2 years ago . He loved them . These are not the original Tamaracs . They are now made in China out of synthetic materials and have a funny smell . I never would have bought these if I would have known that . We ended up sending them back for a refund . Save your money .
 Very comfy , size runs a little large , and the liner started coming apart after the first few weeks ... maybe because I got them too large ? I 'd give them another shot , but in the meantime I replaced them with floor dusting slippers that I totally love ...
 I purchased these slippers as a Christmas present for our son , but ended up returning them . They seemed comfy enough but after trying them on there was a stitch of material with a rough edge on the top of the foot which basically rendered them uncomfortable unless wearing socks , which defeats the whole purpose of slippers . The sole is nice & sturdy , but the slipper material itself was too firm .
 After having worn these slippers for about 3 months , I 'm less than satisfied . When I first put them on , I was amazed by how soft they felt on my feet . It was like stepping onto a cloud . However , now the inner layer of cotton is completely smashed down and flat . I might as well be wearing thick socks . The threads are also fraying . They are also bigger in size than they should be . I normally wear a size 12 shoe , but I decided to get a size 11 slipper just so that it would fit snugly . But even that is too big on me ! I guess I should 've gone all the way down to a 10 . Bottom line , these slippers should be priced no higher than $ 10 based on their quality .
 I purchased these as a Christmas present for my husband . He does not like them and I 'm sending them back . He says they have a funny chemical smell and that they make his feet `` burn '' . The elastic was poorly sewn on the inside and left a rough surface that scratched his feet . He DID like the sole and the good traction that it provided .
 I got these flip-flops less than a month ago and they 're already coming apart ! I know , they were on the cheap side , but still ...
 These shoes are adorable ! ... but I had the worse blisters I have ever had after wearing them . I have tried wearing them a few times but they are so uncomfortable that I ca n't even break them in .
 This product looks much better on the website than in person . The gold trim looks cheap and the suede -LRB- if it really is suede -RRB- looks very inexpensive .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 The buckle broke the day after i got them . I didnt know how to fix it so i just bought new shoes . So be very careful when putting them on because yes they break very easy .
 The shoes are very beautiful , inthe moment you put them on your feet the start to hurt . The material is chap and stiff . I usually like CL choes , but these are not in my `` I like '' shoes
 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...

 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 These shoes are adorable ! ... but I had the worse blisters I have ever had after wearing them . I have tried wearing them a few times but they are so uncomfortable that I ca n't even break them in .
 Even though these shoes have an elegantly simplistic , yet contemporary style , the loud sound that the fairly hard plastic heel makes as you walk is an annoying feature . The padding of the sole could also be a little more ample , so if you decide these shoes will suit your needs , you might consider additional orthotics to increase your comfort .
 Material is low quality so I dont expect it to last that long . I have only worn it once and it has that shiny coating which is not the greatest according to me . I like the styling and it is comfortable to wear . Overall it is just another shoe . . not a winner .
 Did not fit well AT ALL . WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took , the boot would start to fall off . They were the right size , length wise and all , just way too wide above my ankle . They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo , which was very disappointing . I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day . I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first , then ordering it off of here for cheaper .
 The boots were not what I expected . The pictures made the books look different then they actually were . They were exremely wide and the sizing was off .
 Nice boot but is not even close to size . I ordered a size larger than I wear and still too small . I had to return them .
 I bought these boots a size larger than my normal size and they still did n't fit . It does n't warn about this so I will !
 I also bought a pair of boots for my daughter . They run very small - at least 1 to 1 1/2 sizes too small . I had to return at my expense .
 I just received these boots yesterday and wore them all day.I have some pros but the most important is the con . They are huge & I feel like I am walking in moon boots . I am not referring to shoe size but overall appearance and feel . I own 3 other similiar boots and these are the worst by far.Pros - the color . I wanted a chestnut color boot and this color is perfect . The quality is 100 % . The suede and shearling inside is great and they are very soft and comfortable -LRB- when not walking -RRB- . the price was great too ! especially b/c the quality is great.I ordered the size 9 based on previous customers . I am normally an 8 or 81/2 . if they made these in an 8 1/2 that probably would have fit me but i am happy i ordered up.I am only keeping these boots b/c I do not want the hassle of a return . If I had seen this in a store i would have tried it on but not purchased it b/c of the huge look to them!I was going to order another pair in black but am happy I did not !
 I have several pairs of KC shoes , two from this same line . But this one is huge !!! I think it must be a mistake . I was very dissapointed in the sizing discrepancy . I do like this line though , I love the scalloping around the edges and they are comfy . Too bad these ones have to go back .
 Ibought this for my 3 year old and was very disappointed . First of all , you ca n't tap on carpet so if you do n't have a tv by hard floors you ca n't tap and watch the dvd at the same time . Not only are the shoes pretty silly looking , they are a real pain to put on . I returned it and went to payless and bought her a real pair to play with for less money !!!
 MY BABY LOVES THIS TOY - SHE WILL TAP FOR HOURS AND SHE IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD ! I THINK IT IS VERY CUTE
 I ca n't purchase this item if you ca n't provice me with the sizing information . S , M , L , XL means NOTHING . You lost the sale
 I have had numerous surgeries on my feet and carefully read the reviews on many slippers before buying these . So I was very surprised to find that they have no flexibility or give in them at all . It is like walking on two pieces of wood . I bought them last year for my mother to give me for Christmas and have tried a few times to wear them . Unfortunately , I waited too long to try to return them and now it is too late . The price here was great , but I would definitely suggest that you find a store that sells them and try them on first so you can feel the comfort/discomfort level for yourself before purchasing . These are definitely not comfortable slippers that you want to sink your feet into at the end of a long day !
 As other reviewers noted , the `` adjustable tap shoes '' are NOT adjustable , and they are so loose that they pose a hazard to little tap pupils . The elastic which is meant to hold the tap shoe onto a child 's regular shoe is ` sewn in such a way that makes it impossible to shorten the shoe for the snug fit necessary for safe tapping . The shoes made it hard for my 5-year-old to follow along because they kept flopping off , and after we nearly had a disastrous spill I tossed the shoes.As for the video , it seems the camera person kept forgetting that kids would need to see the dancers ' feet rather than their smiling faces in order to follow along . And though Bella is cheerful and a great tap dancer , she only VERY briefly demonstrates the basic steps and provides almost no commentary . Most of the video is filled with corny segments with the rest of the cast -LRB- including an odd animated pair of tap shoes who block the video profiling famous dancers -RRB- and a couple of dances which moved too quickly for my daughter to really figure out what she was supposed to be doing . Perhaps if she watches the video a number of times she will get it - the problem is she does n't seem that interested in watching it again.I really wanted to like this video , but there just is n't enough content that explains or shows exactly how to tap along with Bella . No wonder it was so cheap !
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .
 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 Received `` traditional '' pump - no sling back , no peep toe , no bow . So disappointed .
 Length :
 my left shoe is not same as right shoe , the right shoe wide than left , and the left shoe tongue is not level
 I hated to walk anymore even inside the house while wearing those NOISY shoes . Everybody will know when you 're coming or going . I swear , these shoes are first , in my count , to make so much noise . I will not dare to wear those shoes in public place , or private for that matter . They really make too much noise , I had to return them . They look great , but I ca n't get the noise out of my head !
 Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit . Very unhappy with return policy . Wondering if I 'll ever get my credit .
 These shoes do not last very long and they tend to size differently between the left and right shoe . In other words , the size tolerances for the shoes are unusually large which tends to indicate a below average quality shoe .

 The leather and warmth on these boots are awesome comfortable nice boots but the sole wore out and fell off in one month . I called the company . They told me nothing they could do about it and to return them to the place I bought them . I thought I would have these boots for years !! Not just one monthThanks for nothing I will never buy a product from this company again.Look around for a better Boot
 All of the other reviews must have been after they recently bought these boots . They are comfortable . The outsoles and leather are durable , but the insole has completely deteriorated in 6 months . I wear these boots on a regular basis for work , so they get good wear . I had a pair of red wings that I had for 10 years . These did not make the cut . Also the stiching is starting to come apart on the boot straps and upper trim .
 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .
 I have not yet received this product , the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month . And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem
 I really liked the look of the shoe ... but it kept rubbing on the heel when I walked around . Do n't know if it is a size issue ... but unfortunately headed back for a refund .
 Both shoes are marked 9.5 however the left shoe is 1 1/4 inch smaller in length . Both shoes show poor stitching quality and one shoe string eyelet is missing on the right shoe . Though not marketed as second quality , I consider them to be . Be warned !
 these sneakers are definitely NOT what is pictured . My husband and his best friend thought they found the perfect sneaker when I showed them this picture and I wish I had read all the posts . This is definitely a bait & switch tactic . We ordered 2 pairs thinking we got THE sneakers they wanted but what we received is a substitution . This is the 2nd time I have been let down by -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 the mid stinks compared too the old high-top iseemed to me it was sized abit smaller . if you liked the 4600 high top you 'll be disappointed in its &#34; replacement &#34; 2 thumbs down
 I bought the exact same shoe that the picture is showing on eBay , known as the Reebok BB 4600 . When I found this on Amazon , I was hoping to get myself a re-issue of what I bought on eBay . However , I just recieved the package , opened it and found myself a pair of Reebok BB 4600 ULTRA , which is a completely different shoe than the picture is showing . This is NOT the BB 4600 the picture discribes . Does n't even look alike except for the colorway , which is white . . Do n't waste your money on this .
 My husband has been wearing this style of Reebok for years and years . We have ordered them from Amazon before and got the correct shoes . However , the two pair I ordered this time were fakes . Instead of the stitched logo on the back there is a decal , also , instead of the sewn label on the tongue , there is a decal . The fit is not the same . We will not order these from Amazon again unless there is some reassurance they are the real thing . The picture is correct , the shoes , sadly , were not .
 We have ordered this same shoe before and have been very pleased . These however , were very substandard for a Reebok shoe . The tongue on one shoe was even with the top of the shoe and the other was at least 1/2 &#34; above . The flat part on top of the toes where they sew it together , one was much wider than the other . Do n't know what happened here , but let me say this , they were no match !! Sent them back
 I bought this product assuming that it is real . . But unfortunately it is made in China and fake . . I would never believe if someone says amazon sells fake product . . = -LRB-
 The boots arrived and were lovely . However , they were too big for my husband , so I returned them approximately three weeks ago . I have sent the company several messages through Amazon inquiring about when my credit card will be refunded . However , I have yet to receive a response even though the company boasts a 48-hour policy of getting back to customers . Lucky for me I have the receipt and can place a dispute on this charge . Order from this company at your own peril and make sure you keep all copies of receipts .
 very cheaply made feels like a 20 dollar boot , ive brought timberland boots for the last 20 yr , this will be my last pair .
 Did not like the fit of this boot . Color was not what i had expected . Boot was so heavy and clunky .
 Buying shoes online is always chancy . You ca n't tell if they fit or not until you try them on . For that reason , Amazon and many other merchants allow free returns . As it turned out the boots were too large for me . I was surprised since I have two other new pairs of Timberland shoes that fit perfectly.So , I requested a return . The vendor , Frankels of Brooklyn NY sent me an email with return instructions . I was very surprised to find that they charge $ 10 for a return . Add the $ 20 UPS charge to ship it back to them and you are looking at a big penalty for online shopping.But that 's not all . Frankels notified Amazon that they shipped my boots -LRB- which triggers my credit card being charged -RRB- but failed to ship for nearly a week after that . Pretty dishonest.If you want these boots , check to see if the vendor is Frankels . If it is , go elsewhere .
 On the fourth time I wore these boots the sole of one separated from the heel , to the extent you can put your finger from inside the boot to outside it . The seller refused to replace them and directed me to Timberland , as they say the boots are `` guaranteed waterproof '' . The local distributor here refused to replace the boots and claimed I had damaged the boots myself . Timberland HQ in the USA sent me the following email `` Thank you for your recent inquiry . As a global company we rely on our international distributors to provide service to our consumers outside of the United States in accordance with all regional policies and regulations . Because of this , the distributor in your area is solely responsible for the final resolution of this issue . Unfortunately we are unable to offer additional assistance with this matter . '' Looks like they want to pay my legal fees when I take them to court .
 I previously tried on these boots in a Timberland retail store and loved them . They were very comfortable , but expensive . When I saw the same boots on Amazon for considerable savings , I ordered them . They are the same boots , I checked the item number . The boots I received looked identical , but the leather was as stiff as the plastic boots sold at low end department stores for around $ 20 . I tried to break them in but could only wear them for 30 minutes at a time . I called Timberland customer service and they told me to buy a bottle of leather conditioner ??!! . They finally became comfortable after about a month . They are n't marked `` seconds '' , but they are definitely not the same quality . I would not recommend buying these boots online .
 According to the description the boots should have leather lining , but it is partially true . The toe part is not leather lined and has some sort of synthetic lining that I hate .
 The product that I thought I was buying was a certain color and double soled like the picture shows . Unfortunately that is n't what they sent , as I received a single soled boot that was n't even the same style as the one I ordered . Make sure you check what you are buying as I thought I was getting a deal and then realized I could have gotten them cheaper somewhere else .
 I opened this package and these boots were damaged , the toes of both boots had black scuff marks & one had a deep cut in it , boots looked like were used and returned . Was n't enough time to reorder , ship & receive a new one b4 Christmas . Had to search several stores within 65 miles to find another size 11 boot . Then , all sales had ended and had to pay full price for it . This was a horrible experience . I do not recommend this company to anyone and I will not be buying from this site again .
 I ordered this boots because they where the new version of timberland with waterprooof leather and a better confort insole , and they started to lose color !!! from the wheat color to a light brown . the outsole it appears to be incorrectly finish .
 I ordered these and when I received them they were defected . One of the tree stomp stamps was darker than the other and it was also crooked . One of the insoles was also too small for the shoe , maybe it was just the pair I recived , I dont know . Its a reason why they sell boots that cost 180.00 for 120.00 , you get what you pay for . I returned these and ordered from timberland.com for 180.00 and boots were perfect . Oh well .
 Used these boots for 30 days and found that the seam below the lower lace eyelet was ripping apart . I returned the boots for a refund ASAP .
 once these boots are on , they are awesome ; but the difficulty of getting your foot into and out of this boot makes it undesirable . I even ordered a 1/2 size larger , but it did n't help .
 I bought this pair of timberland boots , fully expecting to receive the one shown on the picture -LRB- with black padding at the top and the brownish color bottom -RRB- , but somehow , this seller sent me a different pair of boots . After I have emailed the seller about this issue , the seller did n't reply and instead , added the picture of the boots -LRB- no black padding -RRB- . Maybe they were going to change the picture , and I ordered it right before they changed it , but , I am rather dissatisfied about this purchase .
 I have worn Timberlands myy whole life I love em . The ad shows a different pair of timberlands with the leather insulator that is what I ordered however now what I received will be calling to complain .
 The style I selected was a charcoal colored nubuck shoe with white soles and white stitching , however , what I received was an all black smooth leather shoe . I specifically ordered these shoes for a trip and I have no way to even be available for a return pickup ... I do n't drive ... I do n't even have a doorbell for UPS to ring when they come to pick up the return . Amazon completely failed me on this order.BUYER BEWARE , AMAZON will bait and switch and you ca n't call anyone to fix it.Last time I order ANYTHING from amazon.com
 I really liked the look of the shoe ... but it kept rubbing on the heel when I walked around . Do n't know if it is a size issue ... but unfortunately headed back for a refund .

 Poor craftsmanship , Reminds me of &#34; 99 cent store &#34; merchandise . A couple of years ago , this was a good product , when purchased through a department store . And it does not even come in &#34; Hi &#34; anymore .
 Against my better judgement , I did not take the advice of other reviewers for this product , and took a chance . What a mistake ! First off , these sneakers do not have any official Reebok logos . No tag on the tongue , no insignia on the side . There are phony imprinted stickers that say Reebok . The size was not even close . This must be the smallest 11.5 in the world . Never had a problem with any 11.5 from any manufacturer . The material is cheap and the product is not worth anything at all . STAY AWAY !

The tongue on one shoe was even with the top of the shoe and the other was at least 1/2 &#34; above . The flat part on top of the toes where they sew it together , one was much wider than the other . Do n't know what happened here , but let me say this , they were no match !! Sent them back
 I bought the exact same shoe that the picture is showing on eBay , known as the Reebok BB 4600 . When I found this on Amazon , I was hoping to get myself a re-issue of what I bought on eBay . However , I just recieved the package , opened it and found myself a pair of Reebok BB 4600 ULTRA , which is a completely different shoe than the picture is showing . This is NOT the BB 4600 the picture discribes . Does n't even look alike except for the colorway , which is white . . Do n't waste your money on this .
 the mid stinks compared too the old high-top iseemed to me it was sized abit smaller . if you liked the 4600 high top you 'll be disappointed in its &#34; replacement &#34; 2 thumbs down
 I really liked the look of the shoe ... but it kept rubbing on the heel when I walked around . Do n't know if it is a size issue ... but unfortunately headed back for a refund .
 Both shoes are marked 9.5 however the left shoe is 1 1/4 inch smaller in length . Both shoes show poor stitching quality and one shoe string eyelet is missing on the right shoe . Though not marketed as second quality , I consider them to be . Be warned !
 these sneakers are definitely NOT what is pictured . My husband and his best friend thought they found the perfect sneaker when I showed them this picture and I wish I had read all the posts . This is definitely a bait & switch tactic . We ordered 2 pairs thinking we got THE sneakers they wanted but what we received is a substitution . This is the 2nd time I have been let down by -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .

 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .

 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 Los zapatos a pesar de ser converse no salieron tan buenos , alpoco tiempo se despegaron .
 esto es un enga & ntilde ; o , yo hab&iacute;a comprado un par de color blanco y otro par de color azul pero el vendedor envi&oacute; los dos pares de zapatos de color blanco ! ademas dudo que sean originales puesto que el material se ve de baja calidad .

 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .

But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .

 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .

 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!

 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .

If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 the shoes look great but are not much for comfort . When I bought them I was looking for a comfortable shoe to wear on my vacation there will be alot of walking involved but I guess these are not the shoes . They are my correct size but they hurt my feet if worn for to long .
 I hate the boots ! I purchased a pair for $ 110 in October of 2012 . After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder . Regardless of the floor surface ; carpet , concrete , or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder . It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem . I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $ 15 . Thanksgiving goes by , then Christmas , then New Years with no word about my shoes . Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes . A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland . I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again . I am out $ 125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise .
 I contacted the seller after the item 's metal parts -LRB- brittle wire -RRB- broke when I first took it out of the box and tried to adjust the folded up strap . They never responded . This deserves the lowest of low ratings . It 's leather looked OK , but the parts that make it work were , as I said brittle wire .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 I bought these shoes for my son . He wore them 4 times and then they ripped . Very poor quality especially for the expense .

 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .

 I hate the boots ! I purchased a pair for $ 110 in October of 2012 . After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder . Regardless of the floor surface ; carpet , concrete , or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder . It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem . I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $ 15 . Thanksgiving goes by , then Christmas , then New Years with no word about my shoes . Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes . A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland . I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again . I am out $ 125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise .

 The shoes were ugly and the on line pictures were not a good reflection of the shoe
 I do n't know if I just got a bad pair but within 4 months of purchase , these shoes got a huge hole in the inside upper heal portion . And the shoe also completely lost its shape . I 've had these shoes before for four years and they were very durable . Perhaps a different vendor ?
 I am not a soccer player , but I liked the style of this shoe . When I recieved them I thought the tongue was ridiculously too big and just looked silly . The arch support in my pair was like having large ant mounds in the soles of my shoes . After wearing them for work for 8 weeks , the ant mounds finally broke in a little bit , but now the heal feels wore out . I would not recommend these except for maybe wearing them for short stints with a pair of jeans to cover the silly looking tongues .
 really pretty bad . hurt my feet . get terrible grip on anything but concrete . held up for a long time on the outside , but not on the onside . only other good thing to say os that they look kinda cool .
 These shoes look great and have amazing style . Unfortunately , they are cheaply made and have zero comfort/support . I remember having an old pair of these that were amazing ... something is n't quite right about these new ones . Its really too bad , they look cool but are torture to wear . Returned .
 I have experienced both these pairs . Breakdown : CLASSIC : adidas Men 's Samba Classic Soccer Shoe - Larger tongue - easier to slip on/off - medium/enhanced arch support . If you wear air-soled running shoes , you probably wo n't even notice . Personally , I 'm NOT A FAN . - The arch support has changed in the last 3 years -LRB- the last time I bought this pair -RRB- . Be warned!ORIGINALS : adidas Originals Men 's Samba Reflective Sneaker - Smaller tongue - Old-school arch support -LRB- meaning flatter/next to none -RRB- . I have worn nothing but Chucks and older Sambas happily for many years , and identify with the barefoot-running crowd , so for me , flatter is better . - Harder to slip on/off , but once it 's on , it fits like a glove ! - Yes , they squeak like everyone says . Does n't bother me , but then again I 'm not a movie usher , burglar or otherwise occupied in the skulking arts.Some people will prefer one over the other . For me , the clear winner is ORIGINALS .
 I have owned two pairs of these shoes and lost both of them after the glue connecting the rubber and cloth parts came undone , and I lost the heels . Otherwise they are comfortable , although the arch is somewhat lacking !
 I purchased two pairs . One pair was fine , on the other pair the left insole was n't fitted corrected so my foot felt twisted when I had the sneaker on . That pair got returned and on the replacement pair the right insole does n't feel like it is fitted correctly . I can feel the arch part of the insole against my foot whereas I do not have this feeling with the first good pair or even on the other shoe of the replacement pair . Very disappointed .
 I found these shoes by searching the women 's option for running shoes . The name may say Unisex , but there is no indication that the sizing is 100 % male . Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.When the shoes arrived here , they were huge . I tried to return them , but Amazon considers this to be MY fault , and planned to charge back any shipping , promotions and coupons against a possible refund . I had done very well using a coupon , a sale , a `` buy $ 80 worth of shoes and get $ 20 off instantly '' promotion and Amazon prime , so my `` refund '' would be less than nothing.That 's right -- if I return the shoes , I owe money . Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women 's section of the site might be men 's shoes instead . Yeah , that seems fair .
 Amazon represented these as women 's shoes but when I received them they were men 's . It turns out that the company no longer makes these shoes for women but that is how they are clearly listed on Amazon.Even though this was Amazon 's fault , and I sent plenty of support documention , I had to pay $ 9 to return these shoes and was not reimbursed or even acknowledged.I will not order through Amazon again !
 The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product , but rather the company that I purchased them from . I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift . Unfortunately , they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place , so he was unable to wear them , and since they were an online order item , it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return . The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label , so my son could return the original pair . When I spoke to my son last week , he had not yet received the return label . I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item . I am very unhappy with this purchase .
 These are true classics . I remember not liking them when they first came out decades ago , but I ca n't remember why . Anyway , the shoes are really comfortable and fit true to size . This is a VERY subjective thing to comment about - fit . If the proverbial shoe fits , wear it . And for me these fit . Cheers .
 I usually like Adidas shoes and I have a good collection . this one is an extreme opposite of what an Adidas should be like.First thing
 This shoe are supposed to be made out of leather -LRB- it is what I had before for similar prduct -RRB- , this is a man made materials , and are not what I expected . I am disappointed with this product , it seems to be an immitation of real staff .
