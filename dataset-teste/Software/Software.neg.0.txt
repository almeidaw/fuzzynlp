 I bought this software for my 5 year old . He has a couple of the other RH software games and he likes them a lot . This game , however , was too challenging for him . The biggest problem I see is that the game requires the child to be able to maneuver the vehicle using all 4 scroll keys on the keyboard . During one exercise , which by the way you ca n't get to the next level until you complete this exercise , the game requires that you use the keys to move while watching out for falling lava rocks and clouds , monitor a fuel gauge , watch arrow indicators that help you determine where objects are in the arena below , and watch a scope that shows animals when you 're hovering over the top of them.I tried to perform this exercise myself and got frustrated . It 's just too hard to expect even a 7 year old to complete this exercise let alone a 5 year old.There are some exercises he can complete himself but they mostly require using the left , right keys.I do n't know who this game would be good for . Parts of it would be too easy for someone 7 or older . Yet some parts are too difficult for those younger than that .
 I got this for my 4 year old son because he really likes Rescue Heroes and it sounded like it would have some adventures for him.What the description does n't tell you is that you ca n't pick which activities you want to play . You have to complete one part before you can go to the next which just does n't make sense for this age group . There are certain parts he has no interest in or are too challenging so he gets frustrated and ca n't get to play the parts he does enjoy . The graphics for the different rescues are very basic and each time you go through the sequence it 's exactly the same stuff , so even if he could do it I think it would get boring fast . The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that my son has enjoyed watching it -LRB- while I play it -RRB- . If you 're looking for something your child can do easily by themselves without getting frustated - do n't get it . Almost all of the play involves using the arrow keys instead of the mouse . If your child has no problem with the arrow keys , he might not have trouble .
 It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system . The disk comes and it does not , only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac !!!!!!!
 My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it has n't been touched since . You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the `` power-up segments '' instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun . Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it .
 This game makes you do the same things over and over , it never holds my son 's attention long enough to get to the next level . There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order . We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it , but this one is a dog !
 This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work ... if you have a better version of quicktime -LRB- I have 7.5 -RRB- , it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD ... if you click no , it will not let you play . So , I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try , and it installed quicktime 5 , THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc . It KEPT telling me that , even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5 , and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5 . Very frustrating , and the game absolutely will not work for me . It keeps telling me over and over , to install quicktime 5 , tho I 've been through the installation process repeatedly . It is NOT my `` operating system limitations '' . This is a brand new computer ... merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions .
 ... My daughter and I loved the movie . She is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game . Absolutely no challenge , and very little interaction . It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed . There are no games to play , nothing to figure out , nothing to do . Save your money .
 My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers . But halfway through the game , the program hung , and would n't let us leave the room or click anywhere else . Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up , we are frozen in one spot while Barbie 's disembodied voice urges us to `` explore somewhere else in the castle . `` Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting did n't help . Vivendi Games ' support site is `` currently disabled . '' And now I 'm left with a weeping , frustrating child who does n't understand that it is not her fault that her game wo n't work . I 'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that could n't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around . Or maybe they just do n't care about the problems , so long as you get our 20 bucks . If you do n't want a crying little girl , avoid this game !
 DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM IF YOU HAVE A MACINTOSH !!! It ONLY runs on `` Classic OS 9 '' , which is an operating system over 8 years old . It does NOT run on OS X at all . A HUGE disappointment and clearly false advertising ! Also , the company , BSL Mart , is very difficult to contact . There is no phone number , you can only send them e-mails . Also , the return slip was already peeled off on the packaging slip , so it is obvious that someone else already returned it and BSL Mart just slapped it right back in the package and shipped it off again anyway without even looking at it . My 5-year old daughter was so upset -- we had ordered this as a reward for her good behavior as well as doing her chores and the game is so out-dated it wo n't even work on a Mac OS 10.3.9 - the Panther version , which was the lowest operating system we could find . PATHETIC . I also placed this in dispute with my Visa card company , and they did put it in dispute but also informed me that in order for it to stick I have to get a `` second opinion letter '' from a `` qualified merchant '' who knows about video games ! So I HAVE TO DO THE LEGWORK TO GET THIS $ -LSB- ... -RSB- removed from my bill - not BSL Mart ! You talk about furious . I will never do business with them again . I also will never purchase a game from Amazon unless the ad SPECIFICALLY states hat it will run on a CURRENT operating system . -LRB- DUH ?! -RRB- If there had been a phone number to call before I purchased it I would have but there is none . SAD .
 This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind . The only bad thing is that there is only one `` castle '' for the kids to `` decorate '' and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it . You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did . My sister finished the `` castle '' in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore . It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money .
 NEGATIVE
 fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing . I 've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue . It 's a shame my 4yr old really likes it .
 My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her . She was so excited . We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen . The game was so so boring . You get to choose music , outfits , and which of the three skaters to skate . That is IT . Everything else is controlled automatically by the game . Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not . My daughter has n't played it since and is so disapointed in it . The store I bought it from wo n't let me return it because it has been opened . They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem . This game was a waste of time and money .
 My daughter -LRB- almost four -RRB- begged for this game all holiday season . It was the sweetest thing , because she shyly told Santa this is what she wanted , and told people all December that Santa would bring it for her . Well , he did , and his reputation is tarnished in our house now!She was bored with it the first time she played with it . Your child 's interaction consists of choosing which girl of three to skate -LRB- fun -RRB- , choosing which outfit of five to wear -LRB- fun -RRB- and pressing the up or down arrow to make Barbie skate faster or slower to do the jumps -LRB- zzzz -RRB- . Not by your own choice , you move the arrow to match the color of the line on the ice.Freestyle mode was n't much better -- go ` round and ` round in circles . There may be more to it but who cares at this point?My own personal mommy beef
 I did n't buy this game , becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique -LRB- see below -RRB- . This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1 -RRB- Box picture -- I ca n't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral ? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking , or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral .2 -RRB- Layback -- Although it 's hard to see , it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick .3 -RRB- Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump . She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames -LRB- makers of the game -RRB- 1 -RRB- Stroking -- Barbie 's body is crooked . She does n't have her weight over her stroking leg , and her body is leaning to the side . I 've never seen anyone stroke like this .
 My daughter received this cd for Christmas . It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen . When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate -LRB- only one choice worked -RRB- , my daughter kept asking what she could do now . Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully . Not very interactive . I consider this a waste of space on my computer , a waste of time for us to use . I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile .
 In the words of my 6 year old niece
 Like many of the Barbie CD Roms , the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters -LRB- ages 5 & 7 -RRB- . Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done .
 I bought this for my 4 year old 's birthday . While I think the graphics are really great , the concept stinks . My daughter told me she thinks it is boring -LRB- and she LOVES Barbie -RRB- and last night she even said she hates it ! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it .
 I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done , so I thought that this would be too . It was an absolute waste of money . The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic . There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level . I ca n't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game .
 This is the WORST CD-ROM game I have ever seen ! My 7-year-old daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour . It is slow , skippy , etc. running on a new computer ! Do n't waste your money like we did , skip right over this dud .
 I bought the disk . I did n't trust the download wersion . I went to install it , and at the end of the installation , you click on `` finish '' and it is supposed to activate something that emails to you an `` activation '' key . That did n't happen . I tried to contact the company tech support . I get form replies , no activation key . This is aggrivating , and makes me want to PUKE . I could have bought a different morphing software , one where you do n't HAVE to get their so called activation key , and I 'd have had an enjoyable day . But , No . I bought this one , and am wishing I had NOT !!! They need to fix this system , so that it is easy to get this so called activation key , if they insist on using it . I spent houras just trying to get in touch with the company . Very poor documentation . And after I sent in 4 to 5 emails asking for the stupid key , I still have no key.My advice
 This software is not user friendly . The samples do n't help . I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go . The whole interface just does n't make any sense . It 's very time consuming . Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store .
 I bought this software one month ago . I was required to immediately update it to fix problems that existed with the version I bought . I was able to navigate the program with ease and build a slide show with-in minutes . Now , for the bad news . It would not burn onto a cd-r as described . I contacted v-coms tech support and received a response within a day or two . The patch did not fix the problem and now after several attempts to reach them again , it seems I am stuck with another neat idea that does n't work . Still waiting for help .
 I tried this software as an alternative to ULead 's DVD PictureShow . The good news
 It was n't long before I realized I just wasted -LRB- my money -RRB- on this near worthless software . No transitions effects/No ability to burn multiple albums to a VCD/Horrible music timimng ! / No SVCD support/Music drop outs during slideshow . Sorry but I ca n't recomend thissoftware to anyone !!!
 I received this software as `` bonus '' with Photo Explosion Delux . It 's terrible . Was easy to create the slideshow and it looked great on my computer . Tried it on 2 DVDs and it did n't play . Tried to re-record it on a CD-RW and it still did n't work ! It did run on my husband 's laptop , but out of 6 computers I tried it on at work it only was recognized on 1 ! Very frustrating software . SAVE YOU MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER .
 I just recently purchased this near worthless software and found out very quickly that I just wasted -LSB- my money -RSB- ! The music timing is all up to you ! -LRB- so why did I buy this program ? -RRB- They give you a chart and you must arrange the number of pictures to fit the music or else your slides end in an awkward manner without music or overrun . Yes you can adjust the time for all the slides but it 's in 1 second intervals and in a 50 picture show that 's 50 secondsa show you can be off by because you ca n't adjust each frame it 's all or nothing . ...
 This product is anything but fast , complete , and easy as it claims to be . Unless , you already own Powerpoint it is also useless . You can not add text or graphics to your photos unless it is done in powerpoint and imported into DVD photoplay . As far as adding background music good luck . The instructions tell you to compress the files and then combine into one large file then once you go to burn the cd it wo n't recognize the audio size you were told to convert to.I would not recommend this product to anyone . The concept is great one but failed miserably in it is claim to be fast , complete , easy , and flexible .
 I got the 1.04 version with Photo Explosion . The CD slide show feature was the main reason I bought PE . I did n't realize at the time it was Bonus Software , and not PE that did this.I 've had mixed success . I have created a VCD using my Win ME system -LRB- 128 MB RAM -RRB- with about 30 or so photos and music . OK there 's not much you can do with the music , but I do n't care , I just want to send photos around on CD , not do fancy , timed , multi-media presentations.When I tried to make a CD with 130 photos -LRB- about 100 MB total project size -RRB- , PhotoPlay wrote the slide show , then caused the OS to thrash about for memory for about 15 minutes , and aborted without writing the PC player software to the CD . -LRB- I could head the disk seeking , so I assume ME was doing a virtual memory dance -RRB- I tried to write the same project using Win 2K Pro , SP 3 , 256 MB RAM . It did even worse . It tried for 20 + minutes to format the show before giving up . Not a byte was written to the CD.Keep in mind the FAQs on their web site indicate 500 photos and 700 MB CDs can be made.I tried the same project , again , on a Win XP Pro system -LRB- do n't know the RAM size -RRB- and it worked as expected.Results
 I got this as bonus software on a Photo Explosion Deluxe package . I installed it , I made sure my photos were . jpgs , etc. . I mean , I 'm not stupid and I can read the simple instructions . It previewed on my computer just fine . I 'm running XP-Home . Anyway , I ca n't burn the CD ... it goes through the motions then it gives me one of 4 different reasons it wo n't burn . I called Tech Support . One guy was really rude , the next guy was good and said he 'd send a new installation disk that day . Two weeks later , I got it . Uninstalled the program , reinstalled from the new disk , and OH BOY ! A FIFTH ERROR MESSAGE . My computer is new , fast , and has an extra graphics card . 10GB hard drive , 512 , the works . I am so sorry I got so excited about this worthless piece of software . BUY SOMETHING ELSE !
 Effects is n't the only Adobe product in the CS3 family that crashes . We are having issues with all of them . Photoshop which does n't normally import huge files is now crashing our Mac G4 . I 'm running Sony 's Vegas Video at home which has quite a few `` effects '' add-ons available from other vendors . If Adobe does n't straighten this out maybe Sony will take up the slack .
 The software is nice to work with , not very simple to use but usable none the less . The only problem I 've encountered with this software is the notoriously bad encoder with memory leaks up to wazoo . If you try to encode a large movie file into mpeg2 premiere will more than likely crash on you due to bad memory management . The only solution so far is to simply restart the system and pray it would n't happen again . Although from my experience it seems to work the 3rd time you try . I have tried this on two brand new machines one with a new XP 32bit install and both expereienced the same issue .
 I purchased Adobe Premiere CS3 , Soundbooth and AfterEffects hoping the massive package would let me do most anything with video , DVD 's , and so on . You ca n't even take video off a DVD onto your computer , crop it and resave it ... it leaves out the audio . I found numerous forums discussing this . I tried renaming from VOB to MPG . Premiere wo n't import the audio . You have to download and install several separate programs to modify/convert VOB , and spend hours of reading and research , and download special plug-ins for Adobe Premiere , just to get the video and audio into Premiere . Then ... it still did n't work . The funny thing about it , I can copy the DVD video -LRB- . vob file -RRB- to my hard drive , and play both the audio and video from the hard drive simply using the free Windows Media Player . I can capture stills from it using PowerDVD that came with my Dell PC . Yet , this expensive program -- made for video ! -- ca n't simply crop out sequences of audio/video from the . vob and resave it and burn it back to DVD with both audio and video . Wow . Sad . Dreamweaver is great . Some versions of Photoshop are pretty good -LRB- but require a class just to learn the basics -RRB- . But Premiere -- terrible in my opinion . FOLLOW-UP
 I purchased CA 's antivirus software because I had read some good reviews . After purchasing I downloaded the most current version . I installed it on one of three PCs in the house . All reasonably new and powerful Dells
 My ISP offered Computer Associates/e-Trust EZ Antivirus for free , so I tried it out instead of upgrading my Norton Antivirus . Installation was easy , full system scan was fast , and the user interface was simple ... maybe a little too simple . EZ Antivirus lacked the sophisticated scanning ability that Norton had , the only setting options in EZ AV were ` on ' or ` off ' settings for Email , auto update , and Real time scanning.EZ AV claimed to have Email protection , but I never saw it scan any of my emails , neither incoming nor outgoing.While scanning , EZ Antivirus showed no errors or incomplete scans , but in exploring the activity log I found several failed scans for certain files . I ran the update utility and scanned the system again , but still had failed scans showing in the activity log eventhough the status window claimed the scan was complete . ... Was the Antivirus working or not?I desided to uninstall EZ Antivirus and upgrade to Norton Antivirus 2005 . So far , so good ... I 'm able to see everything Norton AV does in my system , and have more control over the antivirus settings .
 at first this seems like the perfect antirvirus program ... cheap , uses up very minimal resources , simple to use . . lifetime subscription for free . . what could be wrong?EVERYTHING . see , the problem is n't that this program ca n't find viruses . . the problem is IT FINDS THEM AND DOES N'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM . that 's right , it leaves the viruses right there !! how is that useful in any way ? i looked in options to make sure it cleaned or deleted viruses , but still the log report would announce to me '' -LRB- this many -RRB- viruses could not be deleted or cleaned . '' well , thanks for nothing . i 'm going to return this and get a real antivirus program .
 Bought the 2005 program in the spring . I 've been using this program for about 4 months , now the program prompts me to renew my subcription . I ca n't manually run a virus scan because the program requests that I renew my subcription . Other programs give you one year of use before renewing . I 'm not certain if this product is working correctly . I 'm going to use a different product instead .
 I downloaded EZ Antivirus trial version from CA and Installed it on my laptop -LRB- XP Professional SP1 -RRB- . After installation the software started scanning automatically , which I allowed it to do and left my laptop alone . The laptop caught my attention when it started rebooting again and again . I realized my hard disk was also making a lot of noise.I went to CA 's website and could n't find any number to call . So I started web chat with their support . The support said that I might have installed the software with another anti-virus already working on my laptop . As per him , now only Microsoft can fix my problem . He said he would escalate the issue and copy me the email , which I 'm still awaiting.To fix my hard disk I tried XP setup , Restore disks , and even reformatting the hard disk . Nothing works . I had to throw the hard disk.So just a friendly warning ... stay away !!!
 If you are security minded and choose to use an e-mail client like Thunderbird or the bundled Opera e-mail client this program will NOT protect you ! Not only that , but the fact that CA Anti-virus will ONLY work with MS Outlook or Outlook Express is not revealed in any documentation . I found this out the hard way when a manual scan found a virus in my Opera mail folder and could n't clean or quarantine it ! The CA tech confirmed that the AV program only works with MS e-mail clients . To me this is false advertising !!!
 It does n't scan incoming or outgoing e-mail and has no firewall protection , but then it 's only about $ 20 so as long as it stopped viruses from coming in or , at the very least , innoculated any that managed to sneak by , I 'd be okay with that.I checked a review at another site -LRB- by a company , not an individual -RRB- and it said this was the fastest program they tested . Well , I 've got a pretty decent computer and yet the program took over 10 hours , yes HOURS , to complete . The program started running at 5am but did n't finish until 3:30 pm ... 10 1/2 hours later . Perhaps it pauses whenever the screen saver goes on ? But if that 's why it took so long , that 's bad programming because most people do n't sit there and babysit their PCs when they run antivirus programs AND if they did have that problem , it should tell you to shut your screen saver off . -LRB- The program does not include a booklet , only 1 sheet with nothing but installation instructions . -RRB- When it did finish , it just closed down , it did n't give me any result information . Were there any viruses on my PC ? Did it repair infected files?I reopened the program and clicked on the log icon -LRB- one of the few features available -RRB- , scrolled down and saw `` Unable to open file - file not scanned '' and `` scan incomplete '' on EVERY file listed . It said it did not find any viruses but , then again , it did n't open over 400 possibly infected files . I downloaded a free antivirus program by AVG and scanned my PC with that . It took about an hour and found several viruses AND removed them -LRB- most free scanners just find them then you have to buy the full version to have the viruses removed -RRB- . The only icons and pull down menu items available include several on how to view your Windows Explorer directories within the file -LRB- full tree , large icons , small icons , multi-column , etc. -RRB- but that comprises most of your program options . There is a `` Go '' -LRB- start -RRB- button , a `` Stop '' button and a `` Log '' button to view the log file . There are a few more items but it 's pretty limited.When a free limited antivirus program has more features and can find AND clean more than a program you pay for , then no matter what the price , you paid too much .
 I switched to CA Antivirus from Norton which was slowing down my 3.2 gig XP system . I had no problems with it and was content until it was time to renew my license . One month before renewal time the program 's renewal module kicked in . after EVERY boot up the module would sit in memory until I connected to the internet . at which time it would automatically ask me to renew and opened up my default web browser to the renewal site . After 4 days of this I felt my back was against the wall and renewed my license , -LRB- I did like the program -RRB- . Unfortunately that was not the end of it . I received no confirmation of purchase from the company until 15 DAYS AFTER RENEWAL PURCHASE . Yes my order was listed in the website , and yes the automatic reminder continued every single boot up and connection . after a week of calling Customer service -LRB- 4x -RRB- and getting the runaround I found turning on my computer so unpleasant that I searched around and found another program which was less intrusive and Just as effective if not more so . I managed to still maintain an acceptable level of computer footprint so that my resorces are not taxed as with Norton or Mcafee as well . It was a shame because I liked the product but the Greed Module kicked in and ruined the program for me . - Switched to Kaspersky . There are many other very good antivirus programs out there , you just have to do a little digging .
 DONT BUY OR EVEN INSTALL A TRIAL OF THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU READ THIS !!! I tried this program on a recommendation from the Microsoft web site , that should have been a warning right there . On install the etrust antivirus software -LRB- nothing else just antivirus -RRB- broke my Zone Alarm firewall , interrupted internet browsing and caused the system to hang up . I uninstalled it and have tried installing other antivirus programs since then but none of them will install ; they keep popping up with guess what error message ? That 's right , please uninstall Etrust antivirus software , it is incompatible with our software . I 've emailed Etrust and tried thier ` live ' online chat and get no response . The software is evil , it looks like I will have to format my hard drive to get rid of it . I can find no related keys in the registry to clean by hand . Do n't repeat my mistake !!!
 I got this product in April and exactly two months later it said my subscription had expired and I needed to renew in order to keep receiving updates for antivirus protection.I wrote to the company and a week later they sent me a reply . The reply was to go to their update center and to renew . I sure was n't going to pay again for something I only had for two months and its suppose to last for a year.I 'll be going back to my trusted Norton Antivirus , it may be slow but at least I only have to buy it once a year .
 Once my year-long subscription expired , I have been unable to uninstall CA ETrust . It now pops up a nag window about every 20 minutes , and when you click exit , it pops up a browser window and takes you to CA 's web page . I have tried uninstalling many different ways to no avail . This has been going on for months and makes my computer painful to use.My attempts to reach support are futile . Their support page does n't work in my browser -LRB- IE 6.0 -RRB- and the phone line is pay -LRB- which I will probably end up paying -RRB- . This is much worse than a virus . At least with a virus I can go buy Norton and clean things up .
 Yes , it 's easy to install , configure and use . The footprint is small and it does n't hog resources . That 's the good news . The bad news is that this software 's virus detection rate is abysmal and the company 's tech support is worse . So , in short , do n't * trust * it.Two examples , starting with tech support . After building a new computer , I had several blue screens -LRB- stop errors , BSODs -RRB- and my analysis seemed to indicate that EZ Antivirus was at least partially responsible . I emailed support with all the relevant info . Their -LRB- paraphrased -RRB- reply
 Beware . This game does not work with Windows XP . The vendor said that it would work on any XP Version except Media-Center , but I have XP Pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution . I suspect that it 's like another game we purchased that worked fine when XP first came out , but Windows Auto Update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old Win 98 games like this.We have it up and running on an 11 year old laptop with Win 98 , but it 's too CPU intensive to run properly on that old thing.The game seems OK for the right PC and operating system though ...
 I kept getting the following error on Windows 2000 `` monsters1.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close '' when launching Disney/Pixar 's Mike 's Monstrous Adventure -LRB- Windows 2000 -RRB- All my drivers are the latest . Do see what the problem was and the Disney website is of no help . I may have to return the product if I dont get this working
 I kept getting an error message when trying to install it . I ended up having to return it unfortunately . sorry
 this game is just like all the other nickelodeon games ; bad graphics , too many codes and pointless goalsi was stupid enough to buy it without renting it from a video store first . just as i did with 5 nickelodeon game boy games that were way overpriced . please dont be as stupid as i was ... i suggest you DO NOT buy it .
 If you want a game for the whole family to enjoy , get Shrek.Just because the cartoons may be good , does n't mean the game is.My 6 year-old does n't like it .
 This game is a piece of ... . The system requirements on the box are misleading . It is tough to explain to a six year old that his brand new game ca n't be played until you upgrade your video card , even though no reference was made to it on the box.And when the game finally works it looks like a hybrid of 2000 technology meets 1977 graphics .
 This game is ridiculously hard for a game with `` Nickelodeon '' on it . I was expecting something easy that my 5 yr old would like to play . Spongebob and Tommy let us down . Hard . Very little point to the game on multiplayer , some of the levels I -LRB- a gamer of many years -RRB- can not figure out the moves to and in the end the case makes a great coaster . My daughter is a much bigger fan of Cel Damage and Rayman Arena . XBox needs more kids games , but this one was a waste of money . I wo n't be taken in by the `` Nickelodeon '' name again .
 This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under . The game is cute . I 'm not looking for cute games . I mean shooting water , getting slimed , and doing a food fight is for kids . When you buy it , you will only like the games for probably like the game for 3 days unless you are a big Nickelodeon freak .
 I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible . Do n't waste your time . Save your money and wait for a better , or get a different game . IGN.com gave this game a 1.1 out of 10 also . Which I read after playing it . Sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun . Save your MONEY !
 I was excited when I first saw this game . We are always looking for a game for our young children to play . There it just not enough games for young children on x-box . This game was a big disappointment ! There did not seem to be much of a goal to shoot for while playing . There are so many players on the screen at once that it is difficult to fine your player . It just was NOT FUN !
 This game is the worst Nickelodeon game I have ever played . It has horrible graphics and I do n't think it portrays any Nickelodeon character at all .
 We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games . This is the worst game we have ever purchased . It is hard to figure out ... hard to play ... and hard to see what you are doing . It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also ... many levels that my daughter would want to play are ` locked ' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it .
 I can not rate this item since I can not load it , it will NOT run on Windows XP , you must have Windows 95 which makes it pretty much obsolete . It does not say this clearly in the product description
 This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all . The maps are the worst part of it , you can either look at a small general state map or zoom to a trail map NOTHING in-between . If you want to find trails -LRB- and do n't know the trail name -RRB- you have to guess on the state which only lists major cities . All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for . If you know the trail name then it is OK . My advice is save your money and use the internet because there are many hiking web sites that have the same or more trail information and are a lot easier to use .
 Like someone else said , I 'd give it zero stars if I could . I took four years of high school French and I bought this program with the misplaced hope of being able to brush up on my pronunciation , conversation and vocab.However , the second I popped the CD in , I knew I 'd made a mistake . The whole thing is set up in a really useless way with ambitious expectations.Throughout , you are only taught limited vocabulary , then , in the dictation section , are asked to understand a horrible computer simulated voice speaking French to you.The `` interactive games '' are something a five year old would be bored with and , honestly , I got so irritated at the lack of advancement that I threw the whole thing away.Even as someone with a relatively extensive background in the language , I found this to be a difficult program to use because of it 's confusing set-up . Plus , you do n't really have the chance to advance your skills since everytime you use the program , it 's the same material ... just in a different order.Avoid this program if you really want to learn the language and spend an extra $ 20 - $ 30 on something that works .
 Instant Immersion French is poor when it comes to teaching you French . I was just unable to learn from this program unlike some other programs which have helped me . Beware this product , I would consider a different company 's product over this one . I have also tried French Now by Transparent Language and found that it taught me French quite well .
 This product is really a disappointment . There are no menus and no lessons one , two , etc. . On CD 1 you learn some basic words and then on CD 2 there is nothing but French . The other CDs are not much more help . I bought this program to learn French and now I 'm considering not wasting my time , trashing it and starting again .
 It should have got 0 rating . You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this . This does not ` teach ' you anything . Do not spend your heard earned money on this
 It 's a waste of money , do n't buy it . The phonetics tools are good , but there is no chance anyone would learn English with this 5-CDs version , and also is too basic for people who want to improve their English command . I 've found better stuff for free in Internet .
 5 disks that are related in title only . Very difficult for non-english speaker to set up . Poor graphics . This is not for someone trying to learn English as a foriegn language . I 'm here on Amazon to buy something different .
 I am a college student who was looking for software to help me learn german . I bought this because it was the first thing i came across . I can already speak french in addition to my native language english . The first cd will introduce you to a series of basic nouns , food , body parts , time , useful inanimate objects and colors . The second cd throws you into a sort of game , however even the instructions for the game are in solid german . The questions are not only german but very hard to understand , even after mastering the first cd . The speaker is too fast on the third cd -LRB- talk to me 3.0 -RRB- , and the interactive picture dictionary fails to have a decent selection of anything but nouns . I never played the last cd `` who is oscar lake '' . All in all its an ok set of cds to help one memorize nouns . There are lots of games to play and fun ways to help one memorize . However there is absolutely no aid in german grammar . I actually had to look up , on my own , the very basics in sentence structure , such as object pronouns , definite and indefinite articles , verb conjugations and even simple prepositions necessary to give even the most banal of sentences cohesion . This software may be satisfactory as a supplement to help with nouns , but that is all , i would look to other companies for a self education .
 For starters , all the content offered would have easily fit on a single CD-ROM , so their offering so many disks reminds of bogus language courses from the past which had 30 or so cassettes or videocassetes , each with about 10 minutes or so of playback . Each area of the course is essentially worthless . To just describe one disk , the vocabulary disk has about 2,000 or so words almost randomly chosen . Very few of the essential words of the language appear , and instead hundreds of terms deal with country names and things you do n't need to know your first days , such as cufflinks and redcurrant.It is true that pictures and videos help remember words , but the images are thoroughly depressing and -LSB- sad -RSB- on many ocassions . For example , the woman in the `` kiss '' term looks like she is doing so forcibly , and in general any picture or video -LRB- one in about 30 definitions has a 2 or 3 second video -RRB- in which people of any age appear seem to either have a great dislike for the photographer , or for life in general . It is rather disturbing to see such suffering when one is trying to learn a new language.The other disks are even more worthless , and everything has a depressing quality to it . Needless to say , I sent it back , and will instead try another product . I recommend staying far away from this one !
 This is a budget title , I realize , but there are still some serious deficiencies in this game . I bought the game before reading any reviews on it , so I just took a chance.From looking at the box , you would think this was some kind of `` sports management '' take on gladiatorial combat , or a fighting game , perhaps , but when you go to play the game , it 's just a squad-based RTS game . The combat is like Freedom Force , only much less refined and the end effect is a slow-paced affair to what should be quick and flashy . I really think they could have done better with a `` train gladiator , pick fights for him , watch fights '' sports management approach than the micromanagement RTS style they chose here . So the actual gameplay is n't very original or fresh , something that I think can be redeeming for a budget game with otherwise low production values . To top it off , the interface is a bit clunky - forget repeat attacks or chaining together commands using the shift key or anything like that.Only buy this game if the subject interests you and you like real-time squad-based strategy games , and are willing to put up with alot of nits . Personally , I think there are better games out there , though . Even better budget games . Try `` Shark
 Like others I took a chance on this hoping for a different angle on a first person sim , or management fight game , and should really not have bothered . The gameplay is pretty straightforward , but even with a 256MB video card , the graphics are pretty bland , and the gameplay slow . It 's also another game where there are too few levels of play to actually be able to achieve all the game has to offer . For example , there is a good interactive section of equipment , fighting slaves , upgrades and impressive array of weapons , but financial constraints and sheer playing time invloved make them almost inaccessible . Another main complaint would be -LRB- for me at least -RRB- an easy boredom threshold - this game could have , and should have been much better , despite the price .
 I received this item as a gift to prepare for my vacation in Italy . This CD is good for a young child who just wants to learn very , very basic words and phrases . You learn a handful of phrases you might need but that is about it . And the other customer was correct , the 2nd CD in Talk Now is completely italian and contains words and complete sentences that were never even introduced in the first CD . If you want to have your 7 yr old child impress his/her grandparents by knowing how to count in Italian or know how to say colors in Italian , this is great . However if you want to learn to actually somewhat converse in Italian , skip this CD .
 Bought version 2.0 of this at a local bricks & mortar retailer . I could n't get the software on disc 1 to work . Exchanged the disc - tried it on a few different computers but no luck , so I 'm shopping for something else now .
 I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons . First off this product did not teach me much of the Italian language , which is its whole purpose . Secondly , I felt very lost from one part to another it just seemed very unclear as to what I was always supposed to be doing . My advice is to consider a competitor 's product before this one . A good alternative product to look at would be Italian Now by Transparent Language , which is very well done .
 This set is fine if you only want to learn Spanish in the Castillian accent . Castillian is a rare accent that you will encounter in certain areas of Spain . No Latin American countries use Castillian ! You 'd be better off with a different set of software if you truly want to learn the Spanish that most native speakers use .
 Lousy , could n't be worse . Is n't worth the small amount of money.Wasn ' t worth the wait for delivery.Makes me more careful in the future about cheap products .
 This is BAD ! It was so bad , I returned it . The virtual people look cheap , like cardboard , and they keep repeating the same word until you just want to scream ! Trust me , I 'm not just saying this to be mean , it 's the truth . If you do n't believe me , just buy it , and then you 'll see .
 NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL ! there are four discs , the only useful one is the first disc . it starts out by teaching you basic vocab ... how to say bathroom , silverware , fruits , food items , how to tell time , colors , numbers and stuff like that . but then u put in the second disc and its speaking ENTIRELY in Japanese and it 's impossible to understand whats going on or what youre supposed to do by just what you learned on the first disc . also there are interactive games to help u learn and remember , but the games are easy and repetitive and get boring fast ! Not a good tool for learning Japanese ... disappointing = -LRB-
 Your money would be better spent on a book that teaches you grammar AND vocabulary . This set comes with no directions , just a bunch of CDs in a box . Using the software isnt explained , the games are useless as you can win just by clicking all over , you dont have to learn anything.Learning phrases isnt helpful for any language if you dont know how to take vocabulary and form your own phrases.Honestly this is a waste of cash . Get a book . If you need pronunciation help buy a book with an audio disc included .
 Disk # 1 - too few wordsDisk # 2 - starts with based on reading ; but there are no lessons on how to readetc
 I 'm not sure if this is the exaxt same product , because the one I have has 6 cd 's in it , but it 's Instant Immersion Japanese , so I 'm going with it.This was given to me by a friend who 's trying to learn Japanese because he found it worthless , as in way too difficult for a beginner . I also found it too difficult . I gave it to a japanese friend of mine and he said it 's correct but there 's no way a westerner is going to learn Japanese from it.I found the whole approach ineffective . They did n't lie when they said it 's instant immersion , they just immediately start speaking Japanese at a normal rate and do n't let up , rarely if ever pausing to let you know what they said . I can learn more Japanese by watching imported DVD 's than I can with this , at least there you get some some context clues and some gesticulation if you 're observant.I know it 's cheap , but you generally get what you pay for . Pimsleur is expensive but worth every penny . It 's only weakness is that you have to get your expanded vocabulary elsewhere , but the grammar and pronunciation are outstanding . Rosetta stone is great for vocabulary , but weak in grammar ... the two work fantastic together if you do n't mind the cost - but education is expensive . You 're better off spending the money for one or two good programs than you are dropping 40 or 50 dollars a pop on cheap programs over and over until you find one you can actually learn something from.This may be a very good addition to an ongoing study , but do n't get your hopes up if you 're a complete beginner and this is the only program you 're planning to buy . You 'll be lucky if you learn how to hail a taxi .
 Sorry it 's so looong = DThis is the worst teaching product I have EVER seen ! It is simply an illogical way to teach a language . They really do mean `` Instant Immersion '' . The first disk is okay.They really start you off on a beginners ' level -LRB- basic words , phrases , numbers , foods , and all that other good stuff ... -RRB- . The second disk is completely in Japanese , and sure they give you a clue or a hint here and there , but there is no way for a beginner to understand what is trying to be said . The Third disk is a pretty good book , but it does n't cover everything , and the fourth disk is a translator that is hard to figure out unless you read the guide for it.I have read a couple of the previous reviews that people have written , and I am shocked that some of them think that it is the BEST possible program you could buy!For an example of what some people said :1 -RRB- It 's an inexpensive program - sure it 's cheaper than others but it will also give you a cheap -LRB- poor -RRB- education in the language!You get what you pay for and the cheapest programs may not be the best . I 'm NOT saying that all of the expensive ones ARE the best , but I 'm saying that you should do more reasearch into something before you buy it . You know , find out all of the pros AND cons.If a LOT of people say it is n't good , then I would n't buy it .2 -RRB- It 's fast - I hate when companies promise something that works fast . I can understand being a busy person , but if you think you can learn something without having to do a little work!Just because something is fast does n't mean it 's the best quality ... and half of the companies that promise fast results are usually the ones that do n't come through.Besides half of the programs that you learn faster with are the ones that no one is willing to use -LRB- example
 From the descriptions of the programmes on the box , I thought that this could be helpful -- at least , that `` Human Japanese '' would . This is NOT the `` quickest way to learn a language '' ; if it 's quick , it 's only because it teaches you very little . `` Talk Now '' is VERY basic . It teaches greetings , colours , numbers , food , etc. words by saying each word/expression for you -LRB- and showing it on the screen -- though it tends to use kanji , which I do n't find too suitable , especially if you keep in mind that the people using this CD are complete beginners , many of whom are n't even completely familiar with romanisation -RRB- with a rather scratchy recording . Then you can record yourself and then listen to see how you match with the example speaker -LRB- s -RRB- -- but this is not like the more expensive software in which the programme itself actually compares the two . Then there 's some practice , and you go on to the next category . Again , you only learn REALLY basic words -- `` hai , '' `` iie , '' `` konnichi wa , '' `` konban wa , '' `` takushii , '' `` koohii , '' `` sakana , '' `` Nihon , '' `` Amerika , '' `` aka , '' etc. . And in the end , most people probably wo n't be able to remember too much of what they `` learned '' -- so much for `` instant immersion , '' especially when there is n't any context for the words . Seriously , it does n't seem too practical to teach people the names of random countries without even giving them a sentence -LRB- pattern -RRB- . What are you going to have people do -- walk up to maps and point as they name the countries they know from the CD?World Talk may utilise `` immersion '' -LRB- finally -- something as advertised -RRB- , but unless you have at least some background in the language , you 'll be quite confused -- and this `` background '' CAN NOT be attained in what is basically a basic word list which is the `` programme '' `` Talk Now . '' Even right at the beginning , when they ask you to type your name
 BEWARE of Immersion 's ` Help ' site - I clicked on Help for their ` dictionary ' which made no sense and had stopped working - and it send me to their site ; while I read trying to figure out how it even worked - it was ADDING things to my computer as I was reading without letting me know it was doing so . What it added was jibberish.Haven ' t been able to remove all of the files it added . Not even sure how many got added before started having problems with my computer.AVOID there ` HELP ' in the ` dictionary ' - which does n't make sense -LRB- maybe to those who are advanced it might make some sense but did certain is of NO help to a beginner.Also it says that the dictionary part can work without the CD but have n't found that to be the case - it comes up but wo n't do anything AT ALL - except take you to that BAD ` help ' site.The dictionary itself makes no sense , at least certainly not to a beginner.However , if you leave the CD for the dictionary in the drive - and go to File and Open Study list - there is a list for Hiragana and one for Katakana - click on the one you want to practice using Flashcards with - then go to Options and Study List and then to Flashcards.This will open up another window and you can practice using the flashcard.The only odd thing is that sometimes it puts an X in front of the letter - like XEIf you get it right it turns GREENIf you get it right but it has an X in front of it for some reason - have n't seen this anywhere except here - then it turns YELLOW , I just ignore the x and hit enter and it goes to the next cardif it is wrong it Stays RED - can click on the button below it labeled ` READING ' and it will show what it is - can then just hit enter to go to next or enter it.Still would NOT recommend Immersion software.Nor Berlitz -LRB- Japanese did n't even work on XP -RRB- but their Spanish has flashcards which work.Have not found anything I would strongly recommend in the inexpensive versions - have n't tried the pricey ones and after these I will just stick to books and audios instead . There are plenty of flashcards available without having to get software for just that.When I would read others recommendation to stick to books instead of these software products I would get frustrated because I wanted recommendation for some software that would be helpful , after all we are in the age of computers - but now I understand why after using these software products the only thing that can be recommended is a book/audio products.So far for TEXTBOOK I have liked Human Japanese . But it is a TEXTBOOK on Computer not really software program since there is no real interaction to help with learning or to check for retaining - just mainly reading - has STROKE order that you can Click on and See being Written out . Can hear most , but not all , of what is written in Japanese - and it does go through the Hiragana and Katakana - including the g , etc - but mainly about how to write , not really to help remember/learn . No tests , just hearing .
 I just receive the product and installed the Spanish language program . Basically you are given a menu of sorts which allows you to select a subject area such as `` food '' , `` parts of the body '' , `` common phrases '' etc. . For each area you can browse pictures dealing with the subject area and hear people pronounce each word as you click on it . You can then take quizzes to test how well you recall the words.While I do n't necessarily believe that you need to be able to do 47 conjugations of every verb , -LRB- I ca n't even tell you what a subjunctive imperfect is in English and I can still speak it ! -RRB- I had hoped for a little more comprehensive treatment of the language . The products from Transparent software although they do n't go about teaching in a structured way either at least have the advantage of giving thousands of examples in the context of sentences and paragraphs for those who can learn inductively . This product will teach a bunch of words -LRB- mostly nouns -RRB- and a few common phrases but not a lot else.I expect to make use of this product from time to time as a picture dictionary so it was probably worth the $ 9 I paid for it , but it would not have been worth much more .
 BioTutor is the worst educational software I have ever purchased . I trusted the reviews that were posted and was a total fool for doing so . It is simply pretest questions with written explanations if you need them . I ca n't believe they consider this interactive . I could get this from doing the pretests in the back of my book . I will be sending this software back !
 I was convinced that after the great reviews of this product this had to be the best on the market . Unfortunately , it was not . Frankly it 's the worse I have ever tried . There really is no tutoring at all , it 's all questions and if you want the answer you would have to click `` answers '' and it gives you a useless explanation . Not to mention the mistakes in some of the answers.I 'm almost certain that 95 % of the 5 star posts are bogus . It 's impossible for an actual user to be impressed with this product . I returned mine two days after using it . This product is the WORSE in the market , I 'm almost sure .
 Biotutor is a rip off . I can tell you that Amazon.com keeps removing my post because the company that produces this piece of junk asks them to remove it . The truth is that the people who rate these product 5 stars are not actual users . I PROMISE YOU , when you use this product you would never rate this product 5 stars and you would be so disappointed with this software . It 's a very cheap looking software , the pictures and labels in the software are horrible almost like they came of a test book from the early 20 's . They should be selling this at a bargain store for $ 1.00 , even charging that amount I 'm not sure it 's worth it.I 'm not going to spend a lot of time typing something that might be deleted . But just to tell you plain and simple , this program is pure junk . A rip off .
 I also bought this software after all the good reviews and thought that for $ 30 it must be really great and interactive . I was sorely dissapointed when I installed it and all it is is pretty much a test . There is no interactive learning at all , only an `` explanation '' of the answer to the question . This is something that I would hesitate to pay $ 5 for . I do not see where all these great reviews came from .
 The product once installed looks like its from 1990 , and all it does is quiz you . It does n't really explain anything and it 's not very interactive . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 Just ask questions and give answers . If you do n't already know the subject matter asking questions does not tutor you .
 I purchased this product after all the wonderful reviews . This product is not a tutor . It ask questions and gives a short explanation of the answer , if you click on ` Explanation ' . This product offers no tutoring at all .
 OK , I know the specs say it 's for XP . I installed this and used it slightly when I had XP , but I soon upgraded to Win7 . This is the ONLY product -LRB- out of several dozen -RRB- that would not upgrade with me.I suspect it wo n't install on Vista either -LRB- Win7 is more like Vista than Vista is like XP -RRB- . This is a seriously outdated product .
 I am not satisfied with this product . When i loaded it on my cpu I loaded the label part first . When I attempted to load the print shop portion the program stopped working and locked my computer up . I finally had to unplug the cpu and re-power it up to get it running again . I removed the Printshop version and tried to remove the Label portion but could not . When I tried to do some labels on the program I found it to be more complicated that it should have been . I spoke to a friend and she said she had the same problem with Printshop and it took her son-in-law five days to fix the problem .
 Does not work ! Missing a file , so after you create your address book , it will not print . UMM file is missing . This product is no longer supported , so you are left on your own . Do n't bother ! Since you must open the package to try it , it can no longer be sent back . I am stuck .
 I purchased this to create labels for gifts . I found it easier to create the labels with the templates that come with the labels -LRB- Avery -RRB- . So I 'm not using this product at all.It might be ok for DVD labels . I did n't try that .
 I brought this program to help me learn figure drawing . Theoretically , it would have been helpful to study the light as well as pose the figures as desired . To see the body in motion , the effects of movement , and the play of shadows -- this is how to bring life and vibrancy to a drawing.This program does n't help with any of that . The figures are stiff and do n't react either to movement or to objects in the environment . For example , someone sitting on a chair does n't look like someone doing knee bends , except in this program . Furthermore , posing a figure is a very involved process , and an entirely unnatural result is very common . I tried to pose a figure on tiptoe , to see how the body mass moved , and I could n't do it . It is possible to possible to rotate a shoulder completely out of plane with the chest and the arm , and the program will not murmur one complaint . Facial expressions are all ghastly and there is n't a simple smile in the bunch.The program runs slowly , and the opening help screens crash the program . The help manual is a PDF file and there is no written documentation besides the usual legal threats . The tutorials can get you to a basic pose , but its more effort than its worth.This program might work for someone wanting to put alien-like figures into designs on the computer page . Maybe it works great with other programs or plug-ins that I do n't have , but it is n't useful as a drawing tool .
 A good introduction to ASL , but a pain to get the CDs to work together . This should be on DVD -- or allow you to put all the content on your hard drive . Several times when I had CD3 in the drive , the software told me that I had to insert CD3 . I could not find any tech support.On the positive side , the presentation of signs at optional speeds is great . Adding grammar is a real plus !
 I bought this program to load onto my laptap for school and work . You can only download the installation cd . You can not load the other 7 cd 's onto your hard drive . For anyone who does not want to have to tote around a bunch of cd 's this is not the program for you . I have emailed the company to see if an upgrade will be released but I have not received a reply yet . I am now looking for a program that can be completely loaded onto my hard drive . This was a waste of money .
 ok so i ordered this product because im trying to learn sign language and well it messed with my mac and it did n't work . so yeah . if you own a mac do n't buy it because if the seal on the package is broken they wo n't take it back and you 're out $ 30 .
 The product did not operate as stated on the box . The supplier CDROMUSA was n't at all helpful and left me with a product I 'm unable to use ; so they got FREE money and refused to send a replacement.They do n't deserve a star at all , but the one star represents the nice , deceptive packaging .
 this product looked great but 8 CD ... please !!! not easy to drag around 8 Cds . have to switch cd everytime ... beware that th MAC version is cheaper than the windows version .
 I was hoping it would of been one CD instead of eight . I was hoping to obtain a CD dealing with whole words as well .
 I have n't spent much time with this product . It 's very boring . The fingerspelling quiz is EXCELLENT !
 Instant Immersion American Sign Language DeluxeTried using this DVD . Came without instructions . Never use it.Not recommended .
 The video portion frequently skips . The signers have different hand motions , so it can be hard to tell the same sign . Would be interested to see a rating system of beginner , intermediate , advanced from Instant Immersion on their product -LRB- s -RRB- .
 I 'm a big user of Adobe Audition . I used the old Cakewalk for midi and was always very fond of the program . So , I thought I 'd try the new Cakewalk -LRB- Sonar -RRB- . I really dislike this program . It 's hard to use , hard to configure and is limits what hardware you can use . I 'd sell this one and go back to my old cakewalk , however , i 've already registered it . Oh well .
 McAfee has been trying for over three months to resolve various problems with the product disabling itself on users ' computers.With an anti-virus product , of course , that 's about as bad a bug as you can get.In my case , the product disables itself every time I use Roxio 's Drag-to-Disc . The forums at McAfee are full of different instances of this same problem .
 After purchasing the product , I am now trying to get it off of my computer . Guess what , they say I have to pay for a telephone support service $ 9.95 in order to get any help in getting it off . Great system pay to put it on pay to get it off !!
 Nothing but troubles with McAfee ... do n't do it ! Came `` free '' with new computer . Screwed up my whole system . Went back to Norton Anti-virus and am 100 % satisfied . All my problems went away when uninstalling McAfee .
 I have recently bought this item and i have been very disspointed because it works only with Windows 95/98 . I have window Xp . How does people sell a program like that . Nobody use window 95/98 . I have lost my money . I am very sad .
 This course while extensive in activities , was not what I had expected . The course did not start out basic such as learning basic communication between two people . I think this course is better for someone who is some-what fluent in French already . In addition , this course is however good for refreshment or learning more where it comes to things such as ordering dinner or renting an apartment .
 I was disappointed in this package . There was no rhyme or reason , no direction , no coaching on where to begin . I was hoping to use it for my teenager and she was completely lost . If you want to learn the mechanics of the language , do n't buy this package . If you simply want to memorize a bunch of phrases and words in French , I guess its ok . Definitely not what I expected for software in todays interactive environment
 The graphics are nice and clear , and it does teach minimum skills for communicating as a tourist ; if you want practice with very simple conversations , try it . You 'll learn to say and understand things like '' I would like to rent an apartment '' . But if you can conjugate verbs , write , read or speak a little in French , do n't bother . I ca n't understand French movies or conversations at regular speeds , so I thought this might help . It did ` nt .
 OUT DATED !!!!!!!!! BLAH BLAH BLA BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAN . 10 words to go fooled again read before buying or ask .
 I bought this product and it could not play on my computer , I had to dig up my ole laptop that has windows 98 and that was the only way to get some parts of the game to work , so this was a waste of money for me and i never got the chance to return it so , I lost . Other than that , I got the product within good time , that 's the only good thing .
 why must almost every game be for pc not everybody owns a computer for me i had to beg my sister to use her labtop ! i wish you would make the sim games for ps2 is really that hard to make more sims games for ps2 !! -LRB- ... -RRB- thats why i give it one star -LRB- you have to be a rocket scientis to figure out how to get to work !!!!!!!!!!! -RRB- sincerly , im not a rocket scientis
 it does not even load on my 64 bit windows seven computer I am going to try to load a second xp program but i do not have much hope for this program it is and excellent program i have used on other computer in the past and I love when it works but not if i can not get it downloaded .
 Warning ! Warning ! Will Robinson . This software is defective . Unless you are planning to spend a lot of time uninstalling , reinstalling and searching the Internet for free help -LRB- Sage provides virtually no technical support for this or any Act ! products -RRB- , you a recommended to stay far , far away from any version of Act ! for Palm -LRB- 1,2 , or 3 -RRB- .
 The software on this link is actually the old version of ACT for Palm . The new version is Act for Palm 2.0 . When I got a Treo 700 about a year ago , I wanted to very simply put my contacts and schedule on the Palm . Not rocket science . I had to upgrade my ACT 6.0 to 9.0 and purchase the Act for Palm program . Now , I 'm not Bill Gates , but I 'm not stupid about the computer.It took about 20 hours of tech support to get my data converted . I opted to buy the extra tech support for about $ 250 , which is the only wise decision that I had . It has NEVER worked right ! It works ok for a few days , and then it crashes my phone . I can not reliably use it as a scheduler or even a list of phone numbers . It has cost me business rather than being a tool.The capper ... the Treo 700 broke , and I got a Treo 755 . I can not load my contacts into the new Treo , because tech support says that the hot sync for the new Treo only works with the latest version of ACT . I do not want to go through the nightmare of reconverting my database again ... so I am switching to Outlook . Act sucks ... big time !
 This has got to be the absolute worst software ever.There is nothing about this software that is acceptable . The quality of the graphics is suspect at best . If you wanted to get clip art of a tree for example , you have the choice of two trees -- both appear to be banzai trees.Installing the software is quick since but since it does n't install correctly -- according to the scant directions that are provided only in the CD cover -- it does n't matter.It says that you can pull clip art off the net in the form of web images . You can not . The option under the heading in your Accessories file -LRB- by the way , it is not the same heading that the manual says will be there -RRB- does n't exist.And if that was not all , the company that makes the software `` global star '' refered me to their sister company when I complained . Their sister company did n't have any answers either . When I asked for a refund or a replacement , I was referred back to global star which is now ignoring my pleas.To summarize , this is the absolute worst software I have ever purchased . Do yourself a favor and pass it up .
 I bought this used and was extremely disappointed in the product . While I paid a whole $ $ for it , that 's about all it is worth , if even . There is no search for the clipart and no book to look up the images . Yeah they are categorized nicely on 2 cd 's but what if you do n't know what category a certain item would be listed under ? Then you have to keep switching disks . Luckily I have a thumbnail program that will allow me to print out a catalogue on my own.The only search engine I found was on the photo objects disk . And I just found out it 's part of their 50,000 collection , which I already have . So that 's worthless to me also.The web images disks actually let you choose the item , color and shape but the catologue runs really slow -LRB- and I have a fast computer -RRB- . As for the photos . I 'm sorry but images at 200 dpi and only 10k -LRB- 2x3 inches ... ouch -RRB- are NOT high quality photos as stated on the packaging . This can not be used for any type of print work AT ALL . I have not yet found a Clipart package that had high resolution images . So beware if this is what you are looking for.Overall , rating it 1 star was generous but I will be able to use the clipart images at least . It will just be a hassle trying to find the right one .
 Purchasers of Word X for Mac should be aware that Micrososft does not warranty their product . I purchased Word X software from Amazon about a month ago and had problems with printing out a document . On seeking help from Microsoft I was told that Microsoft does not warranty Word for Mac and that a minimum thirty-five dollar fee would be required for their help .
 I 'm a Graphic Designer so I rarely use Word or Excel except for very , very basic tasks , such as copying and pasting text into desktop publishing programs . So I ca n't comment too much about those programs . The one application I use day in and day out all day long is Entourage .1 . Ca n't be programmed to accept my company 's address book automatically . I have to enter the person 's address in order for it to be saved .2 . If you accidentally have the wrong address typed in , well , it saves it anyway and eventually you have a list of wrong addresses to choose from your list of correct addresses . I have n't had the time to figure out how to delete addresses .3 . Tasks ? Projects ? Clutter tools . I never use them . Do n't have the time to figure them out . Do n't want to . I actually tried to utilize the Projects wizard and after spending xx minutes setting it up , I had this `` That 's it ?!? '' feeling ; I did n't find it helpful or useful or intuitive at all . I 'll do better to jot project notes on a piece of paper.By far my biggest gripe is that Entourage makes EVERYTHING an ordeal to set up . I 'm NOT a programmer , I do n't think like a programmer . I do n't have time to spend PROGRAMMING functions that should be built in.For instance , Entourage does NOT have a basic out of office reply function ! To use OoF you have to go to Tools , then Rules , then figure out which specific set of actions go together and in what order and even then it does n't work . I had to GOOGLE for help because there is nothing about Out of Office reply in the Entourage Help section and the steps I followed based on the directions here
 It only takes a mere seconds . And suddenly you 're experiencing high blood pressure that registers in the danger zone . But you wo n't mind . It 's part of living on the edge in Word OSX . Want to play ? Follow these directions . Simply install Microsoft Word 's OS X in two of your networked Macs . Almost instantaneously you 'll feel a little flush come to your face when the screen reads
 I have office 4.2.1 will this count as an upgrade ???? I do n't want to buy this and find out that it wo n't ! I hate office , but love entourage and if I qualify for the upgrade , it 's actually cheaper than buying entourage on its own !
 You would expect Office v. X by Microsoft to be compatible with Office XP and 2000 ... but not . Although some simple Word , powerpoint files will cross platforms from MAC to PC , the translation is far from perfect.In addition , on the Mac you can drop all kinds of multimedia video clips into powerpoint and they work great , but when you take your file to Office XP/2000 it will display a defying message stating there is no way it is going to display Quicktime content . So ... I installed Quicktime on the PC . But guesswhat ?! Powerpoint still does n't display the video . Maybe the video clip is in the wrong format . So I purchased QuickTime PRO for Mac and converted the video clip to a million different formats and they still do n't work.There are problems with Office V. X by itself on the Mac -LRB- not the Macs fault -RRB- . You can change fonts in PowerPoint and save your file , close , and reopen your file and all your fonts will revert back to Times Roman !!! So forget using lots of different fonts.Word seems to work as expected , however it has some quirks with bullets used in word documents on the PC . All these bugs EVEN AFTER THE Service Pack 1 UPDATE ! This software just -LSB- stinks -RSB- . Too bad alternatives are slow in coming . In the rumor mill some say Apple is redoing Apple works to integrate KeyNote -LRB- really nice ... does n't import Power Point very well though -RRB- and add Office file open/save compatibility .
 I use Word and Entourage , every single day . I use PowerPoint at least once a week . I use Excel about once every month . I must use this suite for the interaction I need with PC users , but I am not a happy camper . This program is pretty , and it has some nice features , but , overall , it 's mediocre . At times , it 's downright bad.Entourage is the worst of the programs in this suite . The freebie Mac Mail program has the most incredible junk mail filter I 've yet used . It does nearly everything that Entourage does as far as making it easy to drop pictures or attachments into email . No , it does n't have its own Calendar , but I do n't use one of those things anyway . The Entourage calendar is a pain to deal with , anyway . It does n't lay out well , and it does n't account for schedules like mine . I have no use for it . Entourage also does n't have a feature to just receive mail . No , one must send AND receive , at the same time , or just Send . Maybe I do n't want to send mail just yet . Sheesh . Even MacMail lets you just Get Mail , without sending.In Newsgroups , Entourage does n't offer a preference to view only subscribed newsgroups for a particular server . No , I must go to the server , then go to View -- Subscribed only . What a pain.Where Entourage really messes up is its junk mail filter . It consistently lists valid mail as Junk Mail . Much of the time , anything from Apple comes in as Junk Mail . If Mac Mail mistakenly attributes an email after its `` learning '' phase , correcting it is a breeze
 Microsoft has run every other major player out of the Mac Office market , and so why should they sweat it ? Most Mac users need Office because they 're outnumbered by Windoze machines at work and have to be able to read files generated by these apps ... do n't get me started . If we ever needed an example of why open , non-proprietary standards are important , you need look no further than office.Excel is actually a pretty decent spreadsheet , but it has some deficiencies . For example , the default templates do n't work with imported files , like HTML or Filemaker tables . People overuse Excel , and spreadsheets in general.Word is an aggressively mediocre word processor , and is n't really suited for serious technical publication - use Adobe Framemaker for that . It 's Ok for little memos , letters and suchlike . It would be better if people used it right - for example , using styles to designate space before a paragraph instead of hiting retrun to insert a blank line ... Powerpoint is an inhuman curse . Years ago , Symantec had an app called `` More '' that far superior , but the usual herd mentality favored Powerpoint . Get rid of Powerpoint and productivity would go up across the board . In fact , get rid of 90 % of viewgraphs and the associated chartsmanship that clouds our communications so badly.Entourage is a good idea in broad concept , but is very poorly executed , wo n't synch with PDAs properly , and does n't really interoperate with Exchange and Outlook as promised . It 's very buggy and its junk mail filter is n't adaptable and does n't really work at all -LRB- uss SpamSieve if you 're stuck with Entourage , or switch to the OS 10.2 Apple mail app , which has a kickin ' spam filter -RRB- . Its support of Applescript is poor , and it fails to empty its trash when asked to do so . For some reason , you ca n't schedule the application of rules . Many other deficiencies.Unfortunately , there are n't many alternatives to Office on the Mac . OpenOffice is still pretty primitive , but if it fulfills its promise , it could rock . Appleworks is nicely done but underpowered , and only comes bundled with the iMac and iBook . We 're stuck with monopoly and mediocrity for now .
 I still use Office 98 for the Mac . Why ? Because the newer versions of Excel are retrograde . Valuable keystrokes -LRB- eg Apple-D to fill down -RRB- are gone . Yes , I agree that versions 9 and 10 of all Office applications have an improved `` appearance '' , but WHY do they take OUT useful features for USERS ???? Newer versions are supposed to advance the effectiveness of the users . Did M$ T forget this principle ?
 Who I am ? A professional writer that bought and Imac , 17 ` screen , 1 GZH , with all the ORIGINAL software.The computer is WONDERFUL . Then , I decided to buy the Office Package . That was the GREATEST MISTAKE!I wanted word processor for my writings . Then , I would explain what happens . I charged the program in the Apple . Then , the word processor starts to fail . how ? Simple at random , when you are working in a window , or open a word document , the message appears : WORD QUITS UNEXPECTLY , THE SYSTEM HAS NOT BEEN DAMAGEDI contacted Microsoft for help . They told me that it was a kind of crashing because of fonts interfering ? What fonts ? That of the Macintosh ? It is supossed that the Office is suited for the Mac , is n't ? They offered me upgrades , None of them work.I have to write a novel this summer . How can I be sure that , when I get the chapter 25 , then , the message WORD QUITS UNEXPECLTY . THE SYSTEM HAS NOT BEEN DAMAGED , appears?All what I did was : First , buy the ImacSecond , buy The office.Third , Install the OfficeFour . garbage as a Result!Do not believe any of the other reviews , or otherwise , loose your money . This program is pure garbage . I put one star because it has no option to put ZERO stars .
 I bought this software for my son , who is a Lego fanatic . His favorite is the Legoland software , where you build your own amusement park . This seems great until you try to play it for awhile and it keeps telling you that you are low on items . Even after you add everything it still dumps you out so you have to start again . Very frustrating for a kid or adult ! We have n't played the chess game yet , but the others are far from being the best games on the market .
 DVD Picture Show has to be the simplest slide shows shoftware out on the market . You may be thinking to yourselves , oh rapture this is for me ! But you are sadly mistaken . The program is so simple that you can not create a splendid slide show . Here are the problems you will face .1 -RRB- There are no transistional effects between slides . This is terrible concidering you want to add effects , variation and emotional emphasis to your presentations .2 -RRB- The duration of the pictuers on each slide is uniformed to the whole side show project . That means you are not free to add legneth to certain pictuers that you may have some deep emotional attachment to . This fallibility creates another and much more intense problem . You will not be able to adjust your pictuers to fit the rythym , duration , pictoral style accorrding to the music and most importantly you can not create a strong theme to your piece . Now you are saying to yourself , I do n't care about that . But once you start working with this program you will have a strong desier to do way more with it .3 -RRB- The box says you get to add music . Do n't let that decieve you . True you get to add music to your slide show , but you only get to use one song per slide show and it has to be an MP3 file . Luckily , I know how to convert CD music to MP3 music , but probably you do n't , and if you do I know for a fact you will loathe this program . When you have your song , you are not even allowed to adjust the duration of the song as a separate entity from the pictuers . This means the number and length of the pictuers are the only factors that chooses the length of the music . You have to plan your slideshow so perciously and meticulously so that your music does n't stop at a very unusal part of the song . The music stops when your pictures stop showing.True this is a simplistic program , and I can see how people can love this . But those who long to add some creativity in their slideshows will find themselves void of any creative opportunities . I am sure all of those whom have given great reviews soon found out that this program could offer way more .
 Everthing sounded great on the package but ... Timing the background music was ridiculous . I used the built in timing mechanism for the program -LRB- based on the length of the music and the duration of the slides -RRB- then previewed my work ... it was all off . So I manually timed the music to the slides . That took forever because you ca n't jump ahead to different parts of the slide show , you have to go through the whole show each time . Plus , it was rarely the same twice . Sometimes the music ended on one picture , the next time it ended one or two pictures earlier or later , etc. etc. . When I FINALLY got it worked out and just the way I wanted it -LRB- after hours and hours of trying -RRB- , I triumphantly burned my show to a DVD . Guess what ? When I played back the DVD , the music was completely off and I had to go back again two or three times to try and fix it and burn the DVD again . I went through several DVDs before it was finally right.I looked online and through all the documentation . Nowhere was this problem addressed . I 've got another slideshow to do , but I 'm buying another program . My Ulead Picture show is going in the virtual trash .
 Do n't be fooled by the online description of this product . The description is for Version 2.0 . Amazon sent me Version 1.0 a VASTLY inferior product . Just check out the limited free ware version on Uleads web site . I 'm heading to the post office tomorrow to return my copy .
 I had a ton of problems getting all the programs loaded with XP . I e-mailed and called Roxio 13 times . Their service and support ranks dead last .
 The add said it works with mac No it did n't and the case the cd came in was all broken in pieces Just got ripped-off on that deal
 Yes , it has a great set of features , but they 're meaningless if you ca n't keep the program from crashing ! Inadequate documentation , poor support by Pinnacle -LRB- it 's an obsolete product for them , so do n't count on them for help -RRB- , undocumented error codes , and more crashes than any program I 've used before . The most frustrating is getting an error after waiting six hours for the video to be processed -LRB- which happens nearly every time -RRB- . Not worth the price . ...
 I received the Rosetta Stone Latina America almost two weeks from the day of purchase . However I did not receive the coupon for the free Rosetta Stone language of my choice as promised . I have sent the seller note about the status of coupon but I have n't heard anything yet . * Here is a copy of the seller advertisement note on Amazon :1 of
 I did not recieve the box with checks as stated in the ad . Only receiced the program disc .
 I purchased this product and found after opening the box that it does not work with DVD drives . There is nothing on the box about this . IMSI has promised a patch since June 1999 , but as of May 2000 there is no patch and they are now saying `` THERE WILL BE NO PATCHES OR UPGRADES '' . If you doubt , check their site and join the support forums . An e-mail during the `` free 90 days '' of initial support was auto-responded to with a message saying that there is no free support no matter what the problem is . Stay away !
 I began to be suspicious that I did n't get what was promised in the advertising hype and what I thought I was ordering when I took the CD out , which was titled
 This program would not work with my high-speed computer . It needs a serious updating . I am disappointed .
 I was looking for a viable alternative to MS products and , in the last month , I have installed 5 different xxxBSD and Linux OS 's . This version failed to recognize my hardware . As well , the istallation was D&O -LRB- dense and opaque -RRB- . For people want to investigate other OS 's , IMHO , the BSD 's are not ready for you . In contrast , some of the Linux OS 's have worked hard and do provide a usable path to these new OS 's .
 I purchased the Fodor 's review for my statewide travel around Oregon . I 'd hoped to find recommendations for the major cities , including the state capital . However , only Portland is mentioned and the reviews failed to capture the essence of this city.Installation was easy and use was as one would expect of the NUVI .
 This travel guide is disappointing in that it focuses only on major cities -LRB- and not a lot of them -RRB- with limited information
 I was very disappointed in this product . Unless you live in a large City this is not going to do you any good at all . Overpriced and limited information . Save your Money .
 ... but not this time . This is a very expensive and embarrassingly deficient collection of out of date information , and very extensive areas of the United States are simply unmentioned .
 This guide has a lot of useful information but only if you are going to one of the large cities listed in the guide . However it is very confusing and un-intuitive to access . There is a `` Travel Guide '' icon on the touch screen which Garmin tech support tells me that it is nonfunctional because the Garmin Travel Guide is not completely compatible with my Garmin Nuvi even though it is listed as an accessory for my particular Nuvi . No matter which city I enter in the search bar in the `` Travel Guide '' it takes me to someplace in Maine . Yes , I called Garmin Tech Support on two seperate occassions because I was certain the card was corrupted and not working correctly . Their only response was to walk me through a number of confusing steps to access the information that I want . Of course these steps are forgotten by the next time I want to use it and it takes me 10 or 15 minutes to figure out again which is very frustrating . My recommendation is to save your hard earned $ 50 bucks , go to AAA and get a free -LRB- if you are members -RRB- tour book . It will have a lot more information for a lot more destinations , even smaller towns .
 The Garmin travel guide is very limited for the money . Do n't waste your money .
 I would not buy another travel data card . It is not very useful and not well integrated into the regular GPS function . It was a waste of money .
 Garmin needs to have a chip to up-grade changes in the NUVI 660 in the restaurant section each year.This week I went to three places coded in for Italain , two had changed and one was out of business .
 I installed this in my new Garmin Nuvi GPS prior to making a trip to Iowa City , Iowa . Thought that it would provide some information useful about the City and the surrounding area . Found that there is not a single location in the memory that covers anywhere in Iowa . This is advertised as a North American travel guide . Did they move Iowa ?
 Product has little information about even major metro areas , let alone less populated ones . Totally useless .
 I agree with the other comments about the coverage only being for large metro areas or POI such as Grand Canyon or Wine Country . For intermittent information between large cities it nothing.Really not worth $ 50 . get an AAA book
 maybe useful for big cities or fancy hotels , resturants ; no good for trip planning ; better to get the Gamin CD map updae or update online
 Garmin and Fodors should be ashamed of this product . The coverage is absurd . In Washington D.C. I looked for a restaurant near my current location . Nada , but I was surrounded by a wide variety of places to eat , some of them very highly rated by local media . This guide wanted me to go most of the way across town , an expensive cab ride , to a neighborhood that I was advised was n't very safe . You 're better off to Google the city before you visit and take along a few pages of printouts . Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage .
 I live near San Francisco and wanted to use my Garmin when I entertained visitors . It does not have the comprehensive guide you would expect for the price . It lists some museums left off the DeYoung . One of the best museums in the city . Lists some attractions leaves out many others . it seems like only those items of interest that fodors got paid to advertise made the list . There are too many major points of interest for SanFrancisco left off . I ca n't imagine how bad it is for other areas . I am very disappointed . I wish there was a way to program my own points of interest in to my GPS . I would also like Garmin to add a narrated guide for the 49 mile scenic drive in San Francisco .
 I purchased the Final Cut Studio upgrade for the sole purpose of edit high-definition video from an HDR-HC1 Sony camcorder . For editing standard definition , I was quite content to stick with version 4.0 indefinitely.Once installed , it became apparent that 5.0.4 was bearly ready for high-definition primetime . Inexplicable bugs remained with the all important `` Print to Video '' command . Apple 's free -- but unwilling and useless -- `` Installation Support '' team would not/could not answer my questions . Most of these support representatives could n't answer even the most basic questions , and were in some instance flat out insulting . A bit odd for Apple.Buyer beware
 The software is not compatible with 10.6 , DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOUR ARE RUNNING 10.6 !
 This is a product that Nuance has abandoned for many years . It is not fully Mac designed or friendly . They had to improve installing recently just so it work for being bundled with scanners as a SE . It is not feature parity with its Windows version . After talking with sales/support , I have gotten the impression from them they do n't like or understand the Mac market . Do n't buy it unless you 're willing to fight for a refund . I had to some years ago . I do wish they would improve it so we Mac folks can do some serious OCR work . If you really want a Mac OCR , pound on them to make Omnipage X better , or go with ReadIris , which is OK but not as well done as Windows Omnipage 16 . Oh if you are thinking of using a VM tool with Omni16 , they wont let you due to how product activation is done . A shame , they could be making money instead of making buyers go elsewhere . But they own the OCR market and can afford to ignore the Mac world . Be warned .
 A cautionary tale . Nuance offers no free phone support for this , and apparently all , their products . Nowhere on their web page or in the Amazon description do they indicate Omnipage Pro X Mac will NOT install on Macs using Snow Leopard ! SL has been out since Aug. 2009 ! If you call their technical support number , gleaned from their documents and web page , a phone message points you right back to the web page ! I had to call customer services to get the non-free technical support phone number . It took 5 minutes for the `` technical '' , I use the word loosely , person to determine what their Web Page or Amazon information should have told buyers . To add insult to injury , they refuse to pay return shipping ! Nuance used to be a fairly good company . Omnipage was a great product while it lasted . I would beware purchasing any of their products .
 I 've used Omnipage for years , going through almost all the versions since the first . When an upgrade appeared it consistently offered incremental improvements and I rarely had to even glance at the user 's manual.Not so with this version . In some key respects it is not apparent how it works even after consulting the manual . There are many more errors in text and formatting . Saves do n't even go smoothly . I would guess that something that formerly took me 45 minutes now takes me several hours , including corrections . And I still do n't know why the text selection does n't flow from one page to the next in a multi-page document , as it used to . This product should have been put in the `` leave well enough along category . ''
 What to say ... 1 . It simply would not install -LRB- OS X Tiger , Leopard , and Snow Leopard -RRB- . It has very clearly not been updated in a long time , and appear to be an abandoned product . They should not be selling this until they update it to the point that it can at least be installed successfully .2 . Calls to customer support were incredibly painful .3 . Eventually they sent me another installation CD , which supposedly had a different version4 . It also would not installI can not say this strongly enough
 Nuance has NOT upgraded this product to be compatible with MAC OS 10.6.6 . It would have been nice for them to mention this in their product info , but they hide this fact both on AMAZON and on their website . I did n't discover the incompatibility till I tried to install it , and it would NOT work . After investing the FAQ 's on the Nuance website ... there is an admission -LRB- small print so to speak -RRB- revealing that their product is incompatible with MAC OS X. 6 Nice ! Now I need to jump through all their hoops in order to get a refund . Hopefully this negative review helps save someone else from making the same mistake I did .
 Does n't seem to work under 10.3 . No patches from omnipage either .
 This looks like a great product , but unfortunately it 's not quite there . On the input and display side , it 's quick and not too quirky . I was able to input my yuppy home in a couple of hours . The 3D effects are amazing , including Aerial and walk thru modes . Unfortunately , it crashes frequently . I have several different floor plans saved , and they all crash the program -LRB- on 2 different PCs -RRB- in a matter of seconds , when changing modes . I 'm hoping tech support can bail me out - if not I just wasted my weekend . Not recommended - yet ...
 This program is so full of bugs I could n't complete any design I tried . I spent hours trying to make it work . I finally called Individual Software and was told that they are on Version 8 now and are liquidating Ver . 4 for 99 cents . Yes , 99 cents !! -LRB- as of Jan. 2005 -RRB- They assured me that they had fixed all the bugs in Ver . 8 and would I like to try it for a discounted price . Unfortunatly , I said yes . Beware of Ver . 8 as well !! These programs might be useful for a design dreamer , but they are useless for actually trying to build something from the plans you make . This program does not print in 1/4inch scale and is therefore very difficult to use as a working building plan . The Broderbund program I bought for a buck at a garage sale years ago works better than this program . Luckily , I bought Ver . 4 from a local computer store that gave me a full refund when they heard that Individual was liquidating the program for 99cents . By the way , Individual was not about to refund me the total price I paid for the program . BEWARE and RUN !!
 I thoroughly enjoyed modeling my home with this program . I did a really cool rendition of a cabin from Disney 's Fort Wilderness , and the photo renditions were very close to actual photos my family took . Like stated in the title , this program had GREAT potential , and now the `` but `` but-The downside is that it was incredibly buggy . I had several instances where the program would crash , and the file I was working from simply would not reload . Also , being able to type in dimensions instead of dragging them would have been nice . I believe it was 3.0 that allowed you to easily import textures of your actual wallpaper , etc. . Also , placing items inside the programs made no sense . I 'd spend half an hour placing a computer on top of a desk , only to have it magically hover a few feet off the floor next to the desk when I reloaded the file.I used to think , if the company would only start over , and debug this , it would be absolutely fantastic . Now I see that from version 3.0 to 8.0 , the reviews have only gone downhill , I have to write it off as a lost cause . Too bad . Maybe the open source Linux types may take something like this under their collective wing , assuming whichever corporation owns the rights to this will let go . Reminds me of David Letterman 's advice to Judge Bork - `` Never start a beard you ca n't finish '' .
 This product does n't have the tools needed to design much more than a flat , square flower bed . The wizards and tools are not user friendly or complete.I have used Sierra LandDesigner for years and was looking for something with a larger plant base and better terrain handeling.I had seen a good review in a gardening magazine on this software , so I purchased it.I have just spent several frustrating hours trying to get the house and garage to remotely resemble my home.I am a computer programmer and have used PCs for landscape design for years.When is someone going to make a decent landscape design product ?
 I have n't found anything about this product that works like it 's supposed to . On top of that I have a fairly new computer with a very fast processor , a huge hard drive and loads of memory that keeps freezing up after I run this thing for awhile . Tech support has n't even bothered to reply to my queries for help .
 This software is extremely furstrating . It very often wo n't let you place items like lawn , driveways , fences next to each other or even in wide-open spaces.As an experience software developer , I really doubt this software was tested much at all .
 For the first 30 minutes with the software I was impressed . But then reality set in . There are three problems : First and foremost , the software is so buggy as to be unusable . While it did not crash , it would randomly move and change the walls placed in the floorplan . This was not snapping to grid - it would arbitrarily extend walls beyond the structure , or combining sections of walls located in different parts of the structure . Once this occurred , there was no way to edit the wall . When the defective wall was deleted by deleting the room -LRB- s -RRB- , other walls at unrelated locations in the space plan would be corrupted.Placing furniture revealed more bugs . Two identical chairs placed side by side , and one chair levitated about 2 feet off the floor . Entertaining , but not useful . Similarly , an area rug placed under a sofa preferred to relocate itself such that it neatly bisected the sofa on a horizontal plane.At about the same point it started corrupting the floorplan , it began to slow down excessively . Changing tabs , instead of taking the second or so it originally did , began taking 10-20 seconds . Lest you think my PC might be a bit underpowered , it is n't
 did the geeks that programmed this -LSB- software -RSB- ever do any landscaping ?? i bought this to plan the landscaping for my new home and after several hours of wrestling with this have decided i would be better off with graph paper and a pencil . rubbish ...
 This program is an absolute waste of money . It is impossible to achieve anything close to what you want . You can not design squat with this software . Buy modeling clay or graph paper instead . I rated it one star because I was n't given the option of zero .
 I have been struggling with this for 3 days . it is very difficult . Instead of being able to enter measurements , for lot , lawn , etc , it is all done w/pointer & is very imprecise , I am ready to toss this one & get a different one !
 Initially I thought the software was difficult to use . Then I realized that it was just unuseable .
 PLEASE ... save yourself the headache ! Read version7 reviews and decide for yourself if you really have the time to deal with such a program or company.I 've sent Individual all the links about their customers ' experience . I do n't think it will do any good but I think they should know the percentage of people writing negative reviews on their products.My next site to `` update '' will be Cnet and Consumer Reports -LRB- if they have a section for something like this -RRB- . Avoid this program at all costs . I will update you all if they EVER reply to my e-mail . However , I will not hold my breath .
 When you buy this software , you expect professional layouts , and a professional feel . Well when you first open the software , you feel like you just opened a cheap website . Once you enter the index , which is clunky in itself , you will have to choose which math topic you wish to study . Once you enter your section , you have to scroll through tons of info just to find what you are looking for , although you can use edit and find to find some text that you are looking for . This information that this software offers is not complete . For example , in the Algebra section , it does not give you all of the instructions on factoring quadratic equations , even though it gives you huge complicated questions that it expects you to know the answer to . I am studying to major in Mathematical Science , and I would not recommend this software if you are trying to learn new topics or get ahead in your classes . This software is basic review , and you had better remember things from your classes in order to understand what they are talking about . Also , if you do n't have high computer skills , this software will get very confusing .
 may have been a good program but it wo n't run for me . I 'm guessing it is n't compatable with win7-64 . My fault for not checking closer , but at this point in time anything that wo n't run on the current platform should specify that
 I received FINAL CUT STUDIO seven weeks ago , but there were only the handbooks in the box . Since then I 'm waiting and mailing and phoning , and they always say , it 's coming . I think I will never receive the software . Apple refuses to pay back the money . I do n't know what to do ?! TWO MONTHS later after several inquiries they offered a new shipment.But still -LRB- March 21 , 2006 -RRB- no 720/25p , so no JVC HD101 in the PAL region on a mac .
 At around five dollars it was OK . There are a few pictures that can be edited in a photo editing software to make usable . Nothing dynamic or interesting about most of the photos . No where near 10K photos on this disc .
 I agree with the other two reviews . This is very misleading . Sure it sells for $ 4.99 , but quite honestly what you get out if it is kind of a joke , and then , if you want an update , it is now up to $ 29.95 for the update . Any online seller including Amazon should at least quantify the description by saying that it only covers comparisons through 2003 , and that updates are $ 29.95 . Other products are available online .
 It is kind of neat software . You enter the persons birthdate or Anniversary date , do a few other entries and you get out a nice sheet with all the data on the date your were born . The only problem is that this version only goes to 2003 and it is now 2006 so the prices for food , gas , bread , housing , stock market are not up-to-date . If you could get a free download for an update than it would be a great product and I would then rate it a 5 .
 Nice textured case but it dident fit for my girl friends phone :-LRB- so with that being said I CAN NOT RECOMMEND this case
 I realize that this is n't an expensive item by any means , but I guess I expected something more . It did n't give me what I was looking for , which was close-ups of countries , with cities listed . The closer I went in , the fewer pixels there were , making everthing blurry . Maybe I was expecting too much ...
 This is the most worthless piece of fecal matter I have ever bought . Nothing functions well . It 's like reading a bad book . No interactive elements . Totally Sucks .
 I purchased Copy Commander to make duplicates of Linux drives for installation in identical systems . You 'd think this would be a no-brainer based on the claims on the packaging . But even if you are a Windows user BEWARE!I tried to run Copy Commander on no less than three different systems from a Pentium-4 down to an old Pentium II . COPY COMMANDER WOULD N'T EVEN START ON ANY OF THEM . On one , it did nothing ... just hung at the intro screen . On the other two it continuously rebooted after it 's `` welcome '' screen . I never even got a chance to try a copy.And lest you think this is a Linux problem , be aware that Copy Commander -LRB- like any disk copy utility -RRB- boots its own OS from the CDROM , so this had absolutely nothing to do with Linux.It 's shocking to me that a piece of software could get in the field if it fails so miserably on 3 completely different systems . Do yourself a favor ... save your money and look elsewhere . -LRB- I ended up doing a low-level ` dd ' copy in Linuxwhich worked fine and was free ... -RRB-
 Followed the instructions and lost EVERYTHING!Please do not buy this product!If someone gives it to you , do n't take it !
 I purchased this backpack so that I could easily bring my 17.3 '' laptop and all of my tools and utilities with me as I went from customer site to customer site . It worked quite well at first , but after a couple of months I noticed some of the seams coming undone . Several times I had to have the pack repaired and completely gave up on it after about a year . The fabric is very strong and has no problems with the elements , but the seams are poorly designed thus causing the entire product to fail .
 I bought this product a couple months ago . Initially I was very pleased
 You really need to own the latest version for it to work . I bought version 7 , and it does n't work for anything I 've tried so far . When I checked the website I realized that the current version is 12 . Oops . Now I 'll have to pay more money to upgrade .
 This book was written in 1993 . There was suppose to be a coupon for these 3.5 '' disks in the box , but I ca n't find it . There is an order form in the back of the book for supplemental disks at an additional cost of $ 5.00 -LRB- Kit No. 147-095-135 -RRB- plus $ 5 shipping -LRB- 1993 dollars -RRB- , but they appear to be for Microsoft MS-DOS 6 Resource Kit . I bought the Microsoft MS-DOS 6 UPGRADE . Are they one in the same ? Kinda confusing , if they are.I 'm keeping the purchase because I went and opened the package containing the large 5 '' disks thinking the smaller floppies were enclosed or at least the coupon . Neither were . Maybe there is someplace on the Internet where I can download the MS-DOS 6.22 upgrade system for free . Feel like I 've spent enough money and time on this order screw up already . The book is handy with how-to 's on using MS-DOS 6.22 , so I 'm keeping the order . Next time there wo n't be a next time . No coupon . No disks . I feel burned by this order , so no future orders from this customer concerning MS-DOS . Ca n't blame Amazon or the order shipment source . The mixed signals on the box -LRB- does contain 3.5 '' floppies , might contain 3.5 '' floppies , if it contains the 3.5 '' floppies , ... -RRB- and in the package got me . Ack ! IT got me .
 I have the Greeting Card Factory Version 3 and love it but wanted more religious cards so ordered the Art Explosion Christian Greeting Card Factory thinking I would have good results . I was very disappointed that the selections for each category were so limited and verses seemed to be repeated more often than in my other software . I paid just as much for it as I had the other program but received only 25 % as many options . I would n't recommend it for that price . CC
 Over and over again I tried to slice the file size of finished animation - to no avail.Yes - if you only used a postage stamp size image you might get by with being able to use it on your website with a halfway decent loading time.We tried to use the gif animator in our gallery on several occasions - guranted , with high quality images of max filesize 12kb each -LRB- ca n't go any lower if anyone is to see any quality at all -RRB- and the finished , so called improved file size still was larger than any website page can carry - unless you want to wait for the 30-45 seconds for that single instance to load - no one does , not even at the best websites . So , we have another ` wonderful ' program dusting away on our shelves .
 I saw this up for sale at $ 140.00 and had to write a review . GIF Animator is good - but Adobe 's ImageReady is better . It accepts all of the Photoshop plugins for version 6.0 , it does everything that GIF Animator does , and it comes with Photoshop v6 .0 . Now ! If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7 you have to run it in compatibility mode -LRB- Vista -RRB- and you have to install the Virtual Windows XP program and run it in that manner -LRB- Windows 7 -RRB- but it WILL do everything GIF Animator does and a thousand other things that GIF Animator will not do . There are people out there selling the 10,000 brushes & plugins CDs for around $ 20.00 that will give you everything under the sun for ImageReady -LRB- and Photoshop v6 .0 -RRB- . Photoshop v6 .0 can be had for as little as $ 10.00 on eBay sometimes . You install it and then update it so it will properly handle PNG files . YES ! Photoshop v6 .0 will handle PNG file creation as well as about 15 other file formats . True - it does n't do red eye removal -LRB- unless you get the plugins -RRB- and its biggest feature is the batch capabilities -LRB- which I really like -RRB- and it is older software , looks like it was made for XP , does n't have the Aero look and all that stuff like that there ! But I do n't care . $ 10.00 versus $ 140.00 for both Photoshop AND ImageReady ? Thousands of plugins instead of twenty or so ? And an interface that you probably already know from using Photoshop ? If you are going to buy older software anyway - why not get the best you can ? Check it out . I only remembered about ImageReady myself tonight around 8:00 pm . I had looked across the internet for something to make animated GIFs with . The best I had found was FlexGIF which was really nice but at $ 80.00 a whack - I was n't all that happy with it . Finally I remembered that I had looked at and then never looked at again this program -LRB- ImageReady -RRB- and I went - `` I need to go back and look at that '' . It took me about an hour to read through the documentation and play around with the software . After that - I created my first animation . Wish I had of remembered it earlier . Could have saved myself a lot of frustration . A week 's worth of trying out software and being frustrated by it to be exact . Now I 've got ImageReady and will zoom ahead in what I am working on . Check eBay -LRB- or Amazon -RRB- for Photoshop v6 .0 and/or ImageReady . You wo n't be disappointed .
 I 've been a happy user of Ulead GIF Animator 3.0 for a very long time , but I was intrigued by the claims of `` tweening '' made for 5.0 . So I downloaded a trial version from CNET , and I was immediately put off by a new but very confusing , unintuitive interface - totally unlike the clear , straightforward interface of 3.0 . Once I had become familiar with the new design -LRB- which I still do not like -RRB- , I found the tweening function to be a joke - at least on my machine . Yes , it did quickly produce a specified number of new frames between the two frames I wanted tweened , but they were all exact replicas of my first frame ! There was no tweening whatsoever , just a number of duplicates ! I uninstalled and re-installed the program , thinking that it might be a defective installation or that I was missing something , but after re-reading the instructions carefully , the second time was as total a loss as the first.Furthermore , the transparency function in 5.0 was baffling and buggy , whereas I was able to produce perfectly consistent transparent areas in 3.0 without even reading any directions .
 This software is too expensive for what they provide . All of the really great features about this software are OPTIONS that cost half again the price of the software . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 This software is as difficult to use as Finale , yet with fewer features than any other composing software I 've ever used . I 've transitioned composing software before -LRB- Encore to Finale -RRB- so I knew it would take some time to get adjusted . But eventually I gave up -- it just was n't worth it.In addition to the clumsy , non-intuitive controls , the `` Songwriter '' version of the software has crippled features
 This software has so many fixed default auto settings -LRB- many musically incorrect -RRB- that it is essentially unusable . It interferes with entering basic notation
 I bought this program , and I stopped using it within 2 months ... why?This program , at least for me , tends to bug a lot , and it does a lot of screwy things that you never intended . For example , notes that I never entered in appeared towards the end of my pieces , and there was no way that I could delete them.Also , it would randomly bug at some times , and I would have to quit the program , losing everything that I worked hard on -LRB- would n't you all be frusterated if that happened ? -RRB- . Also , and it may be because I did n't figure it out entirely , I could n't have two different note heads on the same beat -LRB- example , half note and quarter note on beat one -RRB- on the same staff . It just would n't work.I would strongly consider buying another notation program . I use Cakewalk Scorewriter , which is about as cheap as this , and I hope someday to get Sibelius ... when I have the money to do so -LRB- ... -RRB-
 This is impossibly difficult to navigate , and many instructions in the help file , even when followed meticulously , do n't work . There is no paper guide to the program ; I found it totally useless and a waste of time ... and money . Into the round file with it .
 The concept of FlipAlbum is great and when it works it 's great . Which is n't often . I found it to be full of bugs - lots of things not working as they are supposed to and I had to do things over and over and over because the program reverted back to an earlier state . It was extremely frustrating . Tech support ? - just terrible . If you actually get a response after a week or so it 's something to the effect `` did you follow directions ? '' and when you answer `` yes '' you never hear from them again . If they ever get it to work properly I might take another look at it , but I 've found simpler programs that are n't quite as fancy but they work .
 This company has a set of business ethics which are questionable . The owner of Flip Books -LRB- EBooksystems -RRB- plasters their name and links to their website all over your finished work .
 In every way , Painter IX is geared towards the professional user -LRB- even by the admission of a Corel marketing manager I spoke with -RRB- . Most of what has been `` improved '' in this version simply will not make an investment of $ 200 worth it for the non professional . With the upgrade or full boxed version , you receive only a handbook -LRB- not to be confused with a manual -RRB- that tells the history of Fractal Designs , MetalTools , Metacreations and now Corel with regard to Painter and gives a few artsy fartsy tutorials that the average user could care less about . And I must add that to get a true manual such as what was supplied as part of the Painter 8 package -LRB- which has highly technical information , help and that you can actually learn the ins and outs of the program from -RRB- you have to hand over an additional $ 50 . So the true upgrade price , at least on Amazon , begins at around $ 250 when you consider the cost of the manual . Granted , the manual is in pdf format on the Painter IX CD disk , but in that format it is virtually useless . Each new term or example leads to a hyperlink and before you know it every page of the pdf `` manual '' has fifty hyperlinks on it and you begin to feel you 're going mad trying to navigate around this behemoth of a pdf file . Try going from hyperlink to hyperlink for 400 pages , not to mention while sitting in front of a montior rather than in a nice comfortable chair . I guess Corel feels the manual is n't very important in this version as their users are seasoned professionals with regard to Painter and the truth is that the `` upgrades '' to this version really are n't that substantial . Getting back to the high costs of this ugpgrade , According to the high level marketing manager at Corel I spoke with , the overall costs of this version is not a concern to Corel or their user base because they believe it is overwhelmingly professional -LRB- people who make their living with Painter -RRB- . So for us hobbysits and weekend professionals , take a pass on this version and on any subsequent versions until Corel begins considering non professionals as a valuable part of it 's user and consumer base and gets back to basics rather than wasting time and resources on artsy , useless handbooks instead of a physical manual and other down to earth resources . By the way , I did buy Painter IX , not realizing what the handbook was and that I wasnt ' getting a manual . At this time , I am strongly considering returning the software as I am not part of Corel 's professional base .
 No amount of wiz-bang makes up for the instability that Corel `` engineered '' into Painter when it tried to make it more Photoshop like . IMHO , Painter was best when it still beloned to its creators , Fractal Design . It was revolutionary , it was inexpensive , it was rock-solid , and it was for Mac only . Corel has definitely given Painter a Windows feeling
 Reading the great -LRB- as it turned out , unrealistic , since she is employed by Punch Software -RRB- review placed by `` Donna '' I bought Punch Pro and have not been able to do even a simple floor plan on it without multiple problems . Furniture and fixture icons snap to invisible points not in any relation to walls or bearings , the measuring tool is huge and ungainly , sort of like driving a tractor trailer through a garden gate , Furniture icons are a joke I ca n't even tell a refrigerator from a chest of drawers , furniture building workshop directions are hopelessly convoluted , users manual is absurdly simply minded , altogether a tremendous loss of time and energy for me . If you need to design a home , go buy a tablet of graph paper and one of the home design model kits they sell at book stores , you will be much more pleased with the outcome .
 I am a professional interior designer , ASID member.I upgraded to Punch Professional thinking it had to be better than the other Punch software I had . WRONG . It is impossible to draw interiors walls with exact measures as it always deducts the wall thickness . The '' Ruler '' in useless as it is huge and cumbersome and hard to keep in a straight line . The furniture templates are a joke.You have no idea what they look like -LRB- and they certainly are n't pretty -RRB- or their size until you drag them into place.Stick to a pencil & graph paper.Can ' t anyone create a software program for the Design Professional that is not cartoonish.Something quicker & easier than AutoCad . I know people would spend the money for it.Any ideas ???
 As a mechanical engineer , I 've used all kinds of CAD programs as well as other types of software . This has to be one of the worst software packages I 've ever used . The interface is maddeningly archaic . It makes one wonder about the caliber of programmer that Broderbund is hiring . It also makes one wonder who 's writing these reviews , some hardly seems believable after actually experiencing the software.PLEASE , do yourself a favor , do n't believe the positive reviews , and save your money . Given a technical background , I lulled myself into believing I should be able to handle it in spite of the negative reviews , and came away severely disappointed.Stick to a general 2D drawing program such as AutoCad , Vellum , or Visio , it 'll be much less headache and still fulfill 99 % of what most users are looking for .
 There are many whiz-bang features that sound impressive but are of limited use in my experience.The basic functionality of this program is impaired . The user interface in not that intuitive , the graphic response is extremely slow , the lack of a functioning `` undo '' is maddening -LRB- in the Edit menu there is a `` undo '' button , but it is never available -RRB- . I found working with this program to be very slow going , frustrating and tedious , and I found the payoff -LRB- seeing a new home in 3D -RRB- to be unrewarding . The 3D view is not that helpful ; it is so difficult to control the movement within the 3D view that it is hard to concentrate on what you 've just created . Also , you ca n't walk up or down stairs.I spend a lot of time working with complex audio/video programs and this is , by far , the most frustrating program I 've ever used .
 I liked the idea of being able to design a house from scratch , rather than just move walls around . I started with Punch 's 5 in 1 , but it locked up my system . Their technical support people told me that it was because I was running ME and I should get their professional suite . The professional version locked up my system just like 5 in 1 had . After another hour on the TOLL FREE line , no luck and the product will be returned .
 I am very unhappy with the product . The word `` professional '' means something different to me that to Punch ! . This is nothing but a Barbie house design tool ; something to play a game called `` design a house '' . The fixtures are trivial ; there is no item for an electrical circuit breaker box , although I would bet all houses have one . `` Flying around in 3D is horribly too fast unless you have an ancient and slow computer . None of the controls act like a normal Windows program ; delete key does not delete an object . Buy this for playing house electronically . Do not buy for any serious use .
 This is inferior to Broderbund 's 3D Home Architect -- by far ! I thought I was upgrading and adding functionality -- instead I was dissapointed with cumbersome programming and limits . Amen to some of the previous comments . Also -- you can not print the 3-D screens as you can with the other software . Do n't waste your money . I am sending mine back .
 I was using Broderbund 's Total 3D Home to design a new home and wanted to try something more powerful . I purchased the Punch ! product and am very disappointed . This product may be okay for drawing an existing home or for finalizing a plan you 've already developed . But it is very difficult to use if you are in the early stages and want to move rooms around , re-size rooms , change exterior wall shapes etc.Now that I 've tried Punch , I 'm going back to Broderbund . It is a far easier package to use .
 As a hobby , I design a lot of houses . I have been using 3D Home Architect 3.0 and wanted to try Professional Home design to step up . I 'm not impressed.What the program offers
 I realized that this was not the best tool for designing a house after 5 minutes of use . I originally hoped that once the general design -LRB- using Visio -RRB- was done I could use this software 's advanced features -LRB- framing , 3D walkthroughs , modeling , etc. -RRB- to check it out . No luck . I guess it would work for simple plans but I found it very difficult -LRB- if not impossible -RRB- to use for complex multi-level plans . The 3D walkthrough is jerky and hard to use -LRB- even on a 500 Mhz P III -RRB- . While the software shows some promise , it is not there yet . Last but not least , it GPFed -LRB- Windows 98 -RRB- during a 3D walkthrough causing me to lose an hour 's work -LRB- I know , I should save my work more often -RRB- .
 I had been using Broderbund Home Architect 2.0 and finally decided to upgrade . The promises of the Punch home design were totally empty . Many , many features I did not like ! Drawing walls was not intuitive ... I could n't figure out how to stop drawing ! If my plan went off the screen , I could n't stop the wall to move the screen and then start back up without walls goings off to never-never-land . I started with an old design of known size and found the `` area '' -LRB- i.e. square footage -RRB- to be 30 % off/under . A major flaw ! Then there is the moving walls . I 'd try to move an entire wall up or down , but just one corner would move ... pulling the adjacent wall corner in at a strange angle . It was impossible to get the corners back to 90 degrees . I found the 3D furniture design tediously impossible to work with . And I did not like the measuring setup . The tape was far too big and once I had measured the room dimensions , the measurements did n't stay ... so I had to move the wall a few inches and measure ... and move a few inches and measure ... I returned it for a full refund and bought the Broderbund 4.0 . It has a few flaws too , but at least its workable .
 As someone in the professional contractor 's field , I thought that this piece of software might be useful , to create all the various layouts of a house , landscape it , furnish it , and see it all in glorious color 3D . The Punch Home Design Professional was supposed to let the lay customer -LRB- i.e. non-architects who have no time to learn expensive CAD programs -RRB- to do all this and more . Unfortunately , because the program is designed to be `` simple , '' it is very limited . If you try to do something remotely different -LRB- such as changing the height of power outlets , or adding home theater wiring -RRB- , then you 're completely out of luck . And if it 's something a little more complex , do n't even think about it.Furthermore , the program is not as simple as it wants to be either . It tries to offer lots of options . Unfortunately , the options are not very useful . Then , there are other quibbles , such as the 3D view controls being completely out of whack . Running on a relatively powerful computer , the scroll is so fast that there is virtually no way to control anything.All in all , this is a great concept , and maybe in a few revisions , they 'll get it right . But for now , do n't waste your time or money .
 This dude is selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge . All of the same info is on the net for free.This product exists for one purpose ... to steal from you.This pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission . He could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product ... but scams seem to be his thing . AVOID !! This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.This John guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed . He is an embarrasement to his company and his family . At least a mugger steals from me face to face ... this snake is sneaky about it .
 Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you would n't even be here reading this review.These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded , dial , yellow wall phone.If you are a recent -LRB- one hour ago -RRB- immigrant from a sixth world country , and you need to forward the `` Burger King Christmas Song '' , well , then you 're already ahead of these `` learning '' CDs . -LRB- My apologies to grandmothers with corded , dial , yellow wall phones -RRB- . -LRB- Actually , I kinda wish I had one ! -RRB- Regards , Older But No Smarter
 Beware of this guy ... he will send you unwanted videos and keep charging your credit card $ 70/month month after month ... no customer service to respond to complaints ... will report this scumbag to better business bureau
 I do n't know how these people got a hold of my credit card number , they probed it 3 times for 1 dollar each , and then they sent me some of his videos , I returned inmediately but they sent me a bill for 75 dollars , I had to close my bank account , I called the video P office , they claimed that they did not know how what happened .
 This is the second title from Punch ! that I have purchased and I have finally learned my lesson . The graphics on the box are great , but they mislead you into thinking that this is easy to use and has a lot of functionality . I found that I could not do very precise measurements ; on the plus side , it does a fair job for landscape layout and you can get a general idea of what your deck might look like pretty quickly . I know this is not much of a review and it probably lacks information , but that 's the same feeling I get from Punch ! Home Design and Deck and Landscape Design .
 I bought this product with the expectations of being able to design & build my deck . The package certainly leads you to believe you can do this . The manual and tutorial are also weak . After spending about 6 hours trying to design my deck using the 2D plan format , I found the software does n't even give you an estimate of materials or building details . It does open up to a spreadsheet telling you how many posts you 'll need , but that 's it . This product was a waste of money.I sure miss the `` Books that Work '' series on `` How to Design & Build Your Deck . '' It was limited in designs you could build , but it was focused on deck building and included how-to pictures and would provide a detailed plan with a complete bill of materials .
 i purchaed this program to design my deck.All it does is create a picture.I used to have a program that designed a deck and also gave me a break down of materials to build it and accurate dimensions in which to cut my lumber and also a walk through the construction.This program -LSB- punch -RSB- does nothing like that at all.If anyone wants to build a deck using this program they are wating there money .
 Home design software should have both flash and substance . Unfortunately , Punch ! is only flash . You can put together a nice cartoon of your vision but you can forget about getting any useful blueprints or material lists or even getting the precise design you want . I was looking for a product that could produce the drawings I need to get the go-ahead for my deck from the building commission . Instead I was able only to get a rough layout of my deck . I say rough because Punch restricts you to a handful of basic designs and shapes . The most unfortunate fact is that all of PUNCH 's competitors seem to have fallen away so it 's either PUNCH or a pencil . I recommend the pencil .
 I just bought Punch deck design . You would expect that it would be taylored to designing decks . Guess again . It is nothing more than a simple cad program with a few deck related overlays . You must build multiple decks to create a single mult-tiered deck . It does nothing with deck supports or even patterns of wook on the deck . Stairs beyond a simple straight stair case forget it . DO NOT BUY this product . Get a piece of paper and ruler and you will be better off .
 I was very disappointed with the product and am going to send it back for refund . The first project I tried to do involved a shed with flat roof , and a large garden with 2 foot concrete wall around it . I was not allowed the option of flat roof or short concrete walls . So I tried fencing around it and only had 4 choices , none of which was concrete . This is no way to visualize your project . I am searching for a better landscaper .
 The only thing that I can say good about this product is that it has a nice live view . Other than that , I think the product is a waste of time buying . Now that I purchased this product from `` PUNCH '' . I do n't think I 'll be puchasing anything else from them .
 I had low expectations to begin with but they were still too high . This program is just not up to the task - plain and simple . I spent several nights trying to get a two-tierred deck designed and have wasted my time struggling with this terrible product . If I had n't borrowed this CD from a friend who also could n't do any constructive work with it , I 'd have demanded my money back . I beg someone to write a review who 's HAS designed and built a deck with this toy ; add a link so we can see what you actually accomplished . Its time to use something useful like AutoCad ...
 Deck design allows design of will/might look good , not what it takes to construct . No place to select joist size/spacing ; type of footing ; size and placement of cross beam -LRB- s -RRB- , cross blocking or size of decking boards . I 'll find a WIN98 machine and use 3D-Deck instead .
 I ordered the Ebay course direct from the Video Professor . It was supposed to be free . In the fine print somewhere it apparently says you are signing up for a program a month . I had a terrible time getting my money back and the shipments stopped . It would not have happened without the help of the credit card company .
 When is Free not Free ? Avoid this product , it 's not free and your credit card will be charged once or multiple times for something advertised as free without further obligations .
 I decided to try Video Professor and see if it was any good - after all , it was a free trial right ? Not quite - I was chrged 189.95 before they even shipped it to me and am now in the third week of waiting for a refund .
 My husband and I received some discs for computer classes in the mail and thought it was a promotion until we received our credit card bill . It was charged for over $ 300 . I called our credit card company to cancel the order and found out another charge had been added that day for over $ 160 . We never ordered anything from Video Professor and did even know anything about the company . We do n't know how they acquired our credit card info . We had to cancel our credit card.Peggy
 I purchased a video professor program and was charged for a subscription service . I sincerely regret buying this software . I gave my copy away for its true value , free ! Check the BBB for more information on Video Professor .
 I ordered a program from Video Professor . At the time that I ordered , I told the order taker that I only wanted that particular program . I did not want to receive future programs unless I specifically ordered them . I received the program I ordered . However , some time later I received another program that I did not order and did not want . I called customer service . They said to send it back . I said I had no intention of spending my own money and time standing in line at the Post Office . Then they offered to send a self-addressed , pre-paid mailing label . I agreed and waited for them to send it . Apparently , more than one month went by and I still had not received the label . But , they deducted $ 69.95 from my checking account anyway . I called them about this . They said they would make sure the label got to me . A month later , it still had not arrived . I called again . They promised another label . To date , I have n't received the return label ; but , they still have $ 69.95 of my money taken at the end of April and now it is July .
 I have say that I was shocked to find my account was debted -LRB- ... -RRB- 5 . I thought I was a very good shopper but Video Professor showed me different . I am now fighting a nightmare to stop payments . This company has found a way to scam the public . What will it take to stop this ? My fear of shopping on line has just become real .
 This is all a scam for the maker to get your credit card info and steal from you !! It happened to me and it took SEVERAL months to get them to stop charging my credit card 80 bucks a month ! SCAM !! This guy is a pathetic old dirtbag that is out to screw people out of their money . AVOID !!
 The MS Word product was n't bad.Here is what was bad .1 . They say they will send you a product for free . What they do n't say is that they also include two other DVDs in the package , and that if you do n't read the fine print you will be billed directly for these unless you return the product immediately .2 . There are NO return instructions . You have to search the website and actually call a representative to get an address and a RETURN CODE so that you can actually return the product , i.e. they try to make it impossible to return product .3 . They start sending you additional products immediately and charging your credit card for these . You have to -LRB- a -RRB- get a return code to send these back , and -LRB- b -RRB- fight the telephone sales rep to stop them sending you more product.This is one of the worst SCAM business models I have seen and I would advise everyone NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY `` The way the CEO talks about `` Giving product free ! '' is surely misleading advertising . I am going to pursue this with my State AG .
 I was one of the many who fell for the commercials on television promoting the free lessons . I went online and ordered the eBay lesson . I was shocked to find my card charged for the full amount , $ -LSB- ... -RSB- just a few days after I received the product . I called the Video Professor immediately and asked them why they charged me . They said that the lesson is only free for a 10 day evaluation . I either had to call them before the 10 days was over and return the product or they would bill me for the full amount -LRB- which is what happened -RRB- . I spent over a month trying to get my month back unsuccessfully . I have since researched the Video Professor online and am shocked to see that this same issue is happening many many people . PLEASE ... before you purchase any product from the Video Professor , do your homework . Read the fine print on the Video Professor website . Do a google search on `` Video Professor '' and read what others have experiences . Then , make your decision . I paid dearly for my mistake . I hope you will research this carefully before making your decision .
 Do n't EVER buy anything from VIDEO PROFESSOR ... I did it as a pass thru sale -LRB- $ 6 sale -RRB- to accomplish something else and SURPRISE SURPRISE they charged me $ 189 10 days later because I did n't return a ` Free ' CD to them . It 's all in the fine print ... Refund my money in 21-30 days when I return a ` free ' CD that admittedly they DO NOT re-send out to any future ` customers ' . This company is working the loops on customer trust . They should be ashamed .
 Beware of this guy ... he will send you unwanted videos and keep charging your credit card $ 70/month month after month ... no customer service to respond to complaints ... will report this scumbag to better business bureau
 I knew about the 10 day deadline to stop the extra charges and actually made it in time . I also called the customer service line to inform them that I had sent in the refusal notice . But they charged me anyway . So I called them to ask what was up and they said it was a mistake and would be taken care of in five days . So in seven days I called them again to ask where was my refund . Once again , they said it was a mix up or a clerical error and it would be taken care of in five days . This process repeated over and over . Each time they apologized and said it was a clerical error and would be taken care of within five days . But of course it never was . It was just one lie after another . It went on for months before I finally wrote to the Denver Better Business Bureau . Only then did they actually refund the money that they had no right to take from me in the first place . John Scherer -LRB- the video professor -RRB- is as dishonest as they come . They might not be breaking the law but if you have an ounce of sense in your head , you will never do business with this crook . -LRB- I called him much worse when I was fighting to get my money back . -RRB-
 When I saw my credit card bill -LSB- ... -RSB- Called to cancel as I only had the product for a couple of weeks and barely started it , but their `` customer service '' guy just argued with me insinuating I was some kind of moron who could n't read fine print ! And who does and why would you have to ? He also informed me that another package was on it 's way ! News to me I did n't order it . But when I did order the first package , the person on the phone was speaking in such a convoluted way , it made me feel very uneasy . I do n't even know if the lessons are good because I have n't had time to go through them yet . But this is no way to conduct a business . I 've never written a review before but feel compelled to warn people of this guy - his ads are always screening . Watch out !!!
 I ordered it direct through video professor . They ebay and said they were sending excel as a trial and I had to return the advanced Excel . They never sent Excel , they sent internet security . When I wrote them through their website they never responded . Their website said if I returned without a code , I would not get credit so I waited . I called the next week and they told me I was past the return period . It cost me close to $ 200 for CD 's I never ordered !
 Beware of this guy ... he will send you unwanted videos and keep charging your credit card $ 70/month month after month ... no customer service to respond to complaints ... will report this scumbag to better business bureau
 Like another reviewer mentioned , Norton 's Antivirus product gets more buggy with every new release . Norton 's customer service is non-existent with FAQ with some suggestions which simply do not work.Instead , I recommend Trend Micro 's PC-cillin Internet Security 2005 . PC-cillin has worked well , scans fast , with frequent updates to their database . It has already prevented several new viruses from taking up residence in my computers .
 I purchased the Norton AV 3 pack . It would not load on one computer and cheated us out of a month on the subscription on another . Norton never answered any emails or online complaints sent to them . Now to make it worse all 3 computers that were running with Norton AV 2006 have been infected with a virus and are inoperable . The cost to repair will be in the hundreds . Norton AV was updated and run on every computer everyday , but the virus was not detected . Run as fast as you can from this product .
 For some reason every time a new version of Norton comes out , I try it ... not any more ! I installed Norton to protect my computer and almost immediately I started to notice problems with it . It slowed down my computer to a crawl and made it perform as if it was infected by the worst spyware program in existence . But worst of all , my spyware free computer got infected by every spyware you can imagine while I was downloading updates from Norton . And to top it off Norton could not fix the problem . It took me three other anti-spyware programs to fully undo what Norton did to my computer . Avoid Norton at all costs , if you do n't heed my advice you will regret it . Look for other programs such as McAfee AntiSpyWare 2005 . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 Yesterday , I installed Norton AntiVirus 2005 on 3 machines running Win XP SP2 . The Gateway laptop with NAV 2004 installed with no problem . Two newer Gateway desktops that came with a tral version of Norton installed , did not .1 . The trial version of Norton did not expire for another 15 days . The NAV 2005 installation expires 366 days from now instead of one year from the trial expiration . I feel cheated out of a half month of protection . Class action lawsuit anyone ? 2 . I got a `` Repair is not a feature supported by Norton AntiVirus 2005 . Please uninstall and reinstall '' message . I did so and got the same error again . The Symantec online support documentation was not helpful .3 . The LiveUpdate works and the program will scan for viruses . However , none of the help screens work , probably related to the failed installation .4 . Today , I got Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Errors on both machines while running Internet Explorer . The error states `` This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way . '' I suspect that these errors too are related to NAV 2005 , since I 've never seen the errors before and the only recent change is the installation of NAV 2005 the day before . Again the online documentation does not appear to be helpful.I 've been a loyal Norton customer since Peter Norton owned the company . However , if problems like these continue , I 'll be looking for another AntiVirus application when my subscription expires .
 It slows down your computer , even if you have the most powerful processor . Acts like a trial version asks you to activate every week . Strongly advise against buying
 If you wish to purchase this product be aware that the each of the three licenses must be renewed seperately - even though at the time of renewal , it will still call the renewal `` Norton AntiVirus 2005 3-Pack Subscriptions '' . I only found this out after I renewed the subscription . I believed that the `` 3-pack '' meant 3 licenses , and that was what I was subscribing to . WRONG ! My experience with customer support to gain a refund or credit has been miserable . I will not be renewing any more of my subscriptions with Norton , and after this event I will not recommend them to ANYONE ! Be warned .
 They are now telling me that I have to pay $ 25 per machine to renew the subscription ! This is more than the cost of buying the product brand new through their web-site . So much for customer service/retention . Looks like I will be shoveling more driveways this fall/winter to pay for this baloney . Or wait , maybe I will switch to an open source solution . Hmmm ...
 Each successive release of Norton AntiVirus -LRB- NAV -RRB- gets more difficult to install , more buggy and more loaded with bloat . I used to be a big proponent of NAV , telling all my friends to use it , but this release has finally turned me away from it.Actually , installing on XP is not that bad . Do n't even think about installing it on Windows 98 SE . I was ready to open a vein after installing and uninstalling -LRB- as per the Symantec website -RRB- over a period of several days.And why do they have that Recycle Bin uneraser code in there ? What a bother . Had to turn that off on the two XP machines where I managed to get the install to work .
 No problems with the software , but Symantec Co. is awful . I paid for a subscription renewal , but my subscription ran out and there was no way to re-activate it and no way to get a refund . It is IMPOSSIBLE to obtain any customer service from this company . The instructions on their web site do n't work , and good luck trying to get through on the phone . Their web site refers you to their customer service phone number , but when you call it , it refers you back to the web site . This is the second time I have had this type of problem with Symantec , I will NEVER do business with them again .
 A Norton AV user for years , the upgrade to 2005 made sense . Actually bought a 3-user package for my household 's 3 PCs . On 2 PCs , it slowed the PCs down considerably and causes system crashes on one.On the 3rd PC , it installed and activated fine , but the subscription expired -LRB- actually a previous version 's subscription expired , not the current one , but it did not know that -RRB- . Re-installation did not work - activation of the software told me that the CD KEY is invalid -LRB- after long , long waits for the activation to run -RRB- . Symantec online diagnostics did not help . Tech support performed an `` over the phone '' activation . A few days later , the software said its trial period has ended and ceased to work . Tech support -LRB- again -RRB- told me they would email me instructions that would definitely restore the software and 1 year subscription . They never sent the email.Ultimately , I purchased another brand of AntiVirus software and will be asking for some money back from Norton -LRB- although I know that they will tell me I have to go back to the store I bought it from - too late for that -RRB- . In summary , Notron 2005 's performance reminds me of , well , like a virus on my PCs . They 've lost a long-time customer . Do yourself a favor ... DO N'T BUY IT .
 I have just removed Norton Antivirus from 6 computers because it would repeatedly shut down , allowing all of the computers to become infected.Having removed Norton Antivirus I find that all of the computers now run approximately 30-40 % faster ! I will never use Norton again , and I would urge anyone else not to even consider it . This program is awful .
 At the very premiere location on John Patrick 's website is this testimonial ... ======================= `` Last night I walked away from the casino having turned a $ 1000.00 bankroll into $ 8381.00 . I 'm glad I learned about the WIN GOALS and LOSS LIMITS or I would have blown my $ 1000 on a few games and tables . Tomorrow , I will do it all over again . I do n't ALWAYS turn such a huge profit but I always turn SOME PROFIT each day of gambling under your system . I have even applied your system further than you mention . I am lucky enough to live in a location with a big choice of casinos . If a CASINO is cold for me , I 've learned to apply the DISCIPLINE enough to leave that casino and enter another . I 've expanded your suggestions beyond just switching TABLES.I now sometimes think about how the casinos can take such big loses daily from me and I realize that the players who are n't using your system are the ones who are supplying the casinos with the money for my wins . I suggest every player get your books , tapes and NOW DVDs ! The only worry I have is that if too many people know your strategies of gambling success , the casinos would soon go out of business because of all the people taking payouts instead of paying loses.I used to think that your books , tapes , and NOW DVDS were expensive . I now wonder , what was I thinking ? I challenge anyone to find an investment that pays off even 1 percent of what the JOHN PATRICK SYSTEM did for me ! `` Mick Schofield ========================== It is total BS . I know for a fact . I wrote it.I was at his message board and a lot of people were posting negative things about JP which were all being deleted seconds later , including my own.I then decided to write the outrageous nonsense you see above . Not only was it not deleted , it was elevated to the absolute most premiere area of the site.I have confronted JP on this many times about him knowingly posting a false story . He knows the testimonial is bologna but he refuses to take it down.From what I 've seen of his products , his central advice is to change tables when you are on a losing streak , the DISCIPLINE he keeps harping on.His self testimonial `` I may not win much but I do n't lose much either '' . This is the most positive thing I have ever heard him say in reference to his own track record.Not really much of an endorsement if you ask me.Seriously , I would bet with no fear of losing , that JP 's record is of a slow gradual losing of money . Sometimes up for a while , usually down . The overall situation a constant descent.I do n't know how he got so well known to be able to write and sell his useless products but that is his true winfall . ================================= I got this for $ 3.20 . I just started playing Texas Hold Em and really enjoyed it -LRB- The game not this dvd -RRB- . This was cheap enough in a discount store where I also get an additional discount.At the time I was entirely unfamiliar with JP but since have got to know about him quite well.The dvd basically is a `` for dummies '' explanation of HOW TO PLAY Texas Hold em . There is very little strategy given . Basically he advices to walk away when on a losing streak . I have since found out this is his central advice for every one of his very prolific set of products.As for some of his strategy on best hole cards , he has it pretty much correct but some are out of correct order . He freely admits he does n't know the mathematical statistics . So basically he assigned a dogmatic ranking of the hole cards that pretty much conforms to statistics but where there is doubt , JP prefers to use his hunches and experience instead of bothering with figuring it out mathematically.I am not sure why an odds calculator is included since John Patrick tells he to not waste your time on finding out statistical odds to make decisions.Seriously , John Patrick IS NOT a good gambler . As evidenced by his many writings he is a poor gambler at best . He has barely progressed from novice status.I do n't know how he got well known but clearly if we were able to see his tax returns , the income would be from products not from gambling.On this dvd JP claims to be very accessible at his website and it actually is an absolutely valid claim . I have been there many times and -LRB- positive -RRB- messages addressed to him will be answered by him usually within minutes . He also is his own monitor and every time I have been there he is busy deleting criticism.JP does seems to be cracking up from the stress of his website 's message board criticism.One thing JP is known for doing now and then is responding to criticism by claiming to have done the posters wife and that he left her a $ 5.00 tip for the effort `` which should have been more than sufficient '' . Then JP will delete any follow-up messages giving himself the last word .
 A natural painting program intrigued me . I went to their site and there 's a Trial version of 30 days available . Worked for just 1 day . Every time I try to run it , it claims that it was `` damaged or illegally modified '' . I tried reinstalling as it suggested and now can not even open it -LRB- I keep getting that error -RRB- . I searched online and found I was n't the only one running into this error . Apparently it 's been happening since version 7 and not to just the Trial versions ! If you can get it to work , good for you , you might be able to enjoy it . I 'm currently waiting to see if their customer service responds . I 'll keep you posted.Customer Service finally responded and said there 's nothing they can do . They transfered me to Tech support and they said there was nothing they can do . They said the only way they can help is if I purchase the program and then proceeded to tell me there was a 30 day refund policy which they said makes it just like a trial version . Yeah right.I tried contacting `` Rick '' the program manager who posted what looked like a helpful comment here . He did respond . But just transfered me to someone else and claimed that that person would get in touch with me soon . That was over a month ago and I still have n't heard anything back from anyone . ** update No one ever got in touch with me.This lack of support has left me with a bad feeling and I do n't want to struggle with it any longer . If you 're interested , definitely try out their trial before buying . At least to see if it will even work for your system . God forbid if you run into any future problems though .
 I did like this program . There are shorcomings . The selection tools are nowhere near as good as what Adobe supplies but it offers some options that Photoshop does n't have that are really useful for one who combines natural drawings with the digital medium.Then , for no apparent reason as I do a file save every few minutes , it crashed . And it destroyed a file that I 'd worked on for a week . There 's 128k left -LRB- out of about 35MB -RRB- and I ca n't recover it . I phoned customer support . Their recording had all the information about how to buy things but ran for several minutes before -LRB- finally -RRB- giving an alternate number to call for tech support . I did n't call that one . After several minutes of listening to a recording that had nothing to do with my needs at that moment I was in no mood to listen to another . The support number SHOULD be listed on Corel 's help page along with the other numbers listed . A customer SHOULD N'T have to jump hoops to find it!Does anyone from Corel read these things ? I hope so , because this is where I stand now.They are not getting any more of my money . Crashes do happen . But they should n't take the last saved version with them when they decide to explode . In eight years I 've only ever had something like that happen once . It was with GoLive 6.0 and that appeared to be caused by a memory management issue as well . But that program creates back up sites as one works . It does n't log all of the small saved changes so what 's left after a serious crash may not be a completely up to date but it did leave something that could be worked with . Painter did n't . It does offer the iterative save feature -LRB- which I will do when I use this program again -RRB- but that tends to seem wasteful since each iterative save puts a completely new file on the hard drive . I would n't be so mad if there was support staff on hand to suggest options I might not be aware of . But there was n't . As is often the case now support for a product is moved to the back of the bus where it 's hard or impossible to find -LRB- which is probably done in the hope that customers wo n't use it -RRB- . This could be a great program . It offers digital artists an array of brushes that 's to die for . The effects pallette is impressive and the lighting pallette is a joy to work with . The selection tools are another matter . To begin with they 've barely been improved on since version 4 when they were owned by Meta Creations . And the old ones used to shut down properly . The current ones do n't always do that too well . And they are n't very good about showing the user when it 's happening either . It 's probably something to do with the memory management issue that another reviewer mentioned . Whatever the case these tools should n't wipe out files that have been saved at least a hundred times over the course of a week . Right now they 're fully capable of that.The bottom line
 I am `` using '' the trial version as I write . Wonderful new auto-painting , underpainting effects ? Try entering those words , or variants , in the online help . Nothing . They ca n't even be bothered to put that in . Cynical is n't the word . Slow too , on my powerful Mac . AND - the image changes its magnification - size on the screen - randomly !!! No other program does that on my computer . A bug , perhaps ? You get a feeling from software , from Corel 's home page , from other sources
 Ca n't get Painter 9 to work on XP at all . Very frustrating . And here I was thinking Corel must have finally figured out how to release software without major bugs . Wo n't buy anything from these guys again .
 I found this product to be a major letdown . The disappointment began with the goofy `` finger '' package -LRB- which does n't really convey the product is a painting app -RRB- , and continued with what is inside the package . I found the performance sluggish , and the program crashed on me numerous times . Also , the interface is not well designed , and I did n't find it intuitive at all . Luckily , I did n't throw down any cash for this product , as I was lucky enough to have a friend who had a copy . We were both disappointed , and are thankful that there are other , better painting products on the market these days .
 I 'm running Windows XP , service pack 3 and have plenty of room on my computer for Painter IX . The trial version that came with my CorelDRAW X3 worked fine , but now that I 've bought and installed the program it continually crashes with certain brushes . Corel support for the program seems non-existent . I evidently bought a useless program . I ca n't find updates or patches . I 've been using CorelDRAW programs professionally ever since Corel 4 , both the vector and the painting programs , and had nothing but respect for Corel , but the lack of support for their older programs seems to say the company wants to force you to buy new computers and brand new Corel products .
 I loved this program . Used it for years . Now probably because of some update to windows XP it does not work anymore . Tried everything even seeking Customer support from Corel which unfortunately has a justified reputation for terrible support.You would think they would release a patch that fixed it . So far no patch . . no program that works . I even tried buying an upgrade . Corel painter !! in hopes that I could get back to work . But nope . It is so buggy that it is useless on any machine I load it onto and again , Corel has no patch to offer that makes it operational and no help is offered or to be begged , borrowed or stolen.After years and years of using Corel products . . Painter , Photo-Paint - Coreldraw I finally have to admit defeat . I advise anyone reading this to benefit from my experience with corel.Going to wave sadly goodbye and try Adobe now .
 I have been a Painter user since 1995 . I started out with version 3.1 on a Mac Quadra 700 . Painter has gone through a few owners in its lifetime . It started with Fractal Design . It then went on to MetaCreations . Then Corel bought it and has magically transformed a once reliable , stable , intuitive art program into a crashy , overly complicated pile of junk.I 'm running 9.5 on an intel Mac Pro and I can not believe what a nightmare this thing is . Unfortunately , I can not run my old MetaCreations version 5.5 on OSX because it will no longer support classic applications or I most surely would.My advice to new artists is to learn Photoshop and stick with it . I never thought the day would come when I would say that , but Photoshop has become vastly improved , while Painter has gone straight in the toilet.If you do n't think it 's that big of a deal , imagine learning to play the piano and getting damn good at it . And then suddenly , the only manufacturer of the piano decides he wants to put the keyboard on the bottom of the thing and halfway through the tune you 're playing , it quits abruptly.Don ' t buy this junk . And I will bet you a dollar to a donut , that their version 10 will not be any better , either .
 And I mean `` buggy '' as in this piece of software will suddenly crash and leave you with an UNOPENABLE file , not useable at all -- goodbye to who knows how many hours of work?It 's interesting software and it 's great with a Wacom tablet , but Corel just does n't seem to be able to get their stuff together and I 'm certainly not in a hurry to spend MORE money on a new version hoping they got it right.I mean , expecting to be able to save and re-open a file is not asking for the moon .
 Frustrating . Could n't get it to work with Windows XP . Which is only the world 's most common DOS .
 We have used earlier versions of Painter and liked it . But the newly released version of Painter IX has serious Windows XP issues . Hope to be lucky or be prepared for endless hours trying to get it to run on your Windows XP machine .
 Old technology being rapidly overtaking by InDesign 2.0 , especially if you want to use OS X . If you are just starting in page layout , use InDesign . If you have been doing it for awhile and have a lot of documents in xpress format , byte the bullet now and convert them to InDesign . You are going to have to at some point anyway .
 I made up my mind a year ago to learn 4 computer art/graphics based programs , the industry leaders . These were Photoshop , Illustrator , Dreamweaver and Quark . Of the four , my worst experience has been with Quark . I find myself fighting it every step of the way and that there is no intuitive sense to its interface . To add insult to injury , it is by far the more expensive of the 4 programs . To think that this program is ... more than Photoshop , an absolute masterpiece of a program , boggles my mind ! I also find the educational support materials and online assistance for this product way below what is available for the other three . Adobe 's website is a consumer/educational paradise in comparison to Quark 's idea of consumer/educational support . I 've just seen Adobe 's In Design , the competitor for this product , demonstrated live in the classroom and I am eager to try it instead , especially since it was designed to work hand in hand with Photoshop and Illustrator . My design work uses a lot of visuals so Photoshop-friendly is very important to me . I 'd try this product and Adobe 's In Design out at your local community college first before spending this kind of money on this program . I also saw in the classroom demo that you can pull any of your existing Quark files right into Adobe 's In Design so no one should have trouble switching over to it .
 We have been using Quark in our design office for three years , and are extremely glad to have finally purchased InDesign to replace it.For too long now , we tolerated Quark 's limitations and non-user friendly interface . When we purchased it , we were sold on the program 's multi-page layout `` strengths '' -LRB- smirk -RRB- . But printing a 170 page book , three times a year , has proven to be a feat/ritual , each time we need to proof , then more problems when we pdf files to press.Maps I placed as . eps files 4 months ago have to be replaced because otherwise they print blurry . As soon as I REPLACE the map with the same . eps map file , it prints fine . Why do I only have this problem with `` Quirk ? `` What a hassle . It 's not our printer network folks , it 's not us , and it 's certainly not our G4 Firewire 800s . It 's the quirky make-up of Quark . Bugs continue to shoot out of it to this day.I have more bad examples but I wo n't go on . If you do n't take my word for it , fine . Call any design/print shop in the city you live in and ask when & why they switched to Indesign . You will be shocked.Quark is a rapidly burning and sinking ship . You ca n't say I did n't warn you .
 I have been trying to register this since the day of purchase , VERY unsuccessful ! Have tried all I can think of and my answer is
 I thought I purchased 5.0 but it 's quarkxpress 6.0 passport . I can not set it up to do the documents right . I can not do pdf files . they come out with quarkxpress demo on every page . I really needed this software for my business and I feel that I have been ripped off .
 This enclosure is great except that it does not have any automatic power shutoff and it 's passive cooling is in my opinion not enough . I have a 500 GB WD Caviar drive in there running all the time , probably wasting a lot of energy because when my computer goes into standby mode to save power , this drive for some reason continues to run , so it is always fairly warm . I have to physically turn it off at the switch to save power . Maybe I am missing something , but I guess I thought it would be smarter than that . Other than that , it is lightning fast , and it does my full backups -LRB- > 300 GB -RRB- much , much faster than USB hard drive enclosures . As far as speed goes , this is a great model . If I could do it over , I would buy an enclosure with active cooling .
 Worked fine but I used it very little and the unit has died after about a year of use .
 Could not open it the key was not correct for the disk . . The internet indicated that sever people have had the same problem !
 When I bought this game I thought it was great . Then I realized that the routes were under 3 miles long ! It is way to hard to wreck your train and when you download it takes away your best train . Try to avoid this game .
 The video tutorials are great . The program is average compared to others out there.My biggest peave is that , after trying a number of programs , I found one I liked better . Dan Oaks refunded only my purchase price -- NOT THE 200 % HE CLAIMS HE WILL DO . He continues to ignore my emails.Downside , they charge for modules and recipe book add-ons .
 I was looking for a screensaver that has an ocean setting , with fish traveling to and fro . Sea kelp swaying , bubbles rising here and there . Maybe a jelly or squid scooting at an angle from corner to corner . Maybe a fish stopping to take a look at me . Maybe an ocean floor with a star or urchin moving about slowly . Maybe a rock outcropping with an anemone . But this program does not deliver any of that . It is a cheap ocean setting , with basically a blue shaded screen with a few sunshine rays streaming through , and several fish types traveling accross the screen both ways . No kelp , no bubbles , no random movements . No up , down or diagonal . Looks more like a shooting gallery where the ducks just travel along in a straight line one after the other , then roll over and go back to the other side . BORING ! I feel ripped off . I am returnig this product to Amazon for any refund they will give . I do n't want anyone thinking I felt this product was worth buying .
 I was all excited to have a modern 3-D saltwater fish screensaver , but the best thing this program can manage is to take your money . Sure it puts fish and the occasional dolphin on your screen but comes up `` criminally '' short in entertainment or fascination .
 Jeff Carter said he bought this because he liked it when he saw it on display at Office Depot . I believe he is mistaken . I was just at an Office Depot and saw a beautiful aquarium screen saver . I asked what it was , and the clerk said it was from Microsoft Plus for Windows XP . I checked , and Microsoft Plus does include an aquarium screen saver .
 Wish that i han read Mr Litman 's revue before i bought this.It 's defently boring , no real settings or adjustments , and it 's just a one way thing back and forth . Boring . This ? screen saver again ? has NO action at all.If i could it would get 0 stars .
 This screen saver is awful . It offers NOTHING in the way of joy . I bought it with the idea that it 'd give me a nice PC aquarium of nice things to see , what a laugh . All it does ... and I mean ALL IT DOES ... is have you pick from a basic list of promising fish & then has them swim back & forth ... left to right ... right to left ... sometimes in pairs ... but always the same TIRED thing over & over again . The fish never interact with each other , they do n't have any kind of background whatsoever to see except for a -LRB- the only thing you can adjust -RRB- ray of sunlight , whoopie . It 's not even worth the postage if someone offered to send it to you for free . Shortly after buying this wretched piece of junk I did buy a beautiful PC aquarium , I love it . It comes with 3 different types of fish tanks , you can adjust them by many things including types of fish , backgrounds , etc. . The `` carosuel '' setting lets you pick from ALL of your screensavers , it 's great . If you want a really great PC aquarium at a fantastic price , pick up a copy of Encore 's Aquarium 3-in-1 Limited Edition . I give it a 5 star rating for sure . If I could I 'd give Ocean Aquarium 3D a minus 5 , that 'd be my true rating .
 The Compton Interactive Bible was not advertised correctly as I would not have paid 129.00 for a program which is unloadable on my computer as my computer is 63 bits while the program is 16 bits . If one is going to sell outdated software one should at least put the date it was published along with the correct publisher . This is the most dishonest transaction I have ever been a part of and will be settled in court . Golden Retrieval said he had to protect his business . It seems to me that the best way to protect ones business would be honesty with ones customers . Mary Himes
 Honestly , you should n't waste your money . I was hoping to get a computerized coloring book for my girls -LRB- less mess that way -RRB- , and have a fun way for them to play on the computer like Mommy and Daddy . However , this seriously fails to capture their attention for even a second , and honestly , it 's not very interesting at all . The pictures are very poorly drawn , and look a lot like someone used Microsoft Paint to sketch out a rough drawing of something ... it 's all pixelated -LRB- all the lines look like little blocks -RRB- . None of the animals or people have faces ! At least not until you pick a color for them , and then the whole thing -LRB- a lion for instance -RRB- is colored in one color ... eyes , mane , fur , tail , everything ... all the same flat color . And there is no texture to anything . There 's no way to animate your pictures unless you choose this random paint tool which sprays everything in some weird assortment of patterns and colors . And the selection of colors is very limited . Oh , this is terrible . Do n't waste your time or money on this one .
 Although the software works to clean up the hard disk . It is not useful to prevent unwanted spying on your Mac .
 The program is slow and tedious , and seems to concentrate more on games and videos than on teaching the language . It 's extremely complicated to follow , and the only thing I 've gained any useable information from are the vocbulary CDs , and you can get those with many other , far less expensive programs . Few people are going to sit by their copmputer waiting for videos to load so they can take a multiple choice test , which seemed to be a large part of the practice . I got more out of `` The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Learning Italian . ''
 My daughter wanted a computer game for Christmas and since she loves Lego Friends I thought she would enjoy this CD . This is not the NEW Lego Friends . This is a CD that was created in the 1990 's and is now out so you think it is the NEW Lego Friends . The one character -LRB- that they happen to mention -RRB- is named the same , but the others are not ! She was very disappointed .
 this was not what i thought it was . i thought i was buying lego 's , but it was a dvd.need to send it back
 I recently purchased TV SlideShow Studio and spent many hours creating a presentation that would be shown at my daughter 's wedding reception . What I found after the effort was that , despite periodically saving my work -- or so I thought -- NONE of my work was saved.Abacus Publishing 's Tech Support , after waiting more than a week after I asked how to get a file to save properly , finally responded -- by noting that the problem was apparently known , and the problem would not appear in the upcoming Version 2 of the product . That , of course , did me no good whatsoever ; I paid for a product that does not function properly.There are some very nice features in this product and it offers much promise , particularly given its relatively low cost . But if the presentation can not be saved , what good does any of this do?Look elsewhere if you 're seeking software to put together a presentation of your photographs .
 I purchased this program to put together a 20 minute project . I also saved the project every 10 minutes only to find out after the program was closed that the file never actually saved . Lost hours of work . Avoid this software .
 I recently purchased and installed TV Slideshow Studio 2.5 ... it was a BIG mistake!Every time I tried to select a transition from the transition screen by double-clicking , the program aborted with a ` memory could not be read ' error.When I tried to create a VCD slideshow -LRB- NOT a VCD disk -RRB- , the compression progress screen would abort with an ` Invalid Pointer ' error.This program has many nice features , but it 's definitely not ready for prime time ! Save your money !
 If you have a newer computer using USB connections , do n't buy this kit . The cable they supply wo n't work , and you have to find a USB to MIDI adapter somewhere else . I got fooled when I saw it was designed for use with Windows XP , and did n't realize that they meant it could be used by older computers that have upgraded to XP.So , I 've got to spend more money . ... The software is useless without the right cable connection.I was also disappointed to learn from the manual that their software wo n't convert the MIDI files to . WAV format for creating my own CDs . Voyetra recommends you buy some more of their software -LRB- `` AudioView '' -RRB- to do that job.This product may have some value if you have an older computer , but it is not what they claim to be . It does not include `` everything you need to create great sounding music ... ''
 I used voyetra orchestrator for over 5 years . I think it was a great learning tool for both digital audio and midi . I record 100 % digital and wanted to replace my older version with a newer one . I found this starter kit and thought that it was basically the same as I had before because I looked all over the box and could n't find anything that said it only includes 4 digital audio tracks . -LRB- how can anyone get started with two stereo channels ? -RRB- . I would n't have purchased it if I would have known that . Now I am stuck with it . If all a person does is midi , I guess this will work , but if you want to `` start '' incorporating digital audio , you should buy something else . I do n't enjoy it when companies try to slide one by it 's customers by not listing important info that should be disclosed even if it ends up hindering sales . shame on those Marketing people !
 I agree with the Jan. 3rd 2003 reviewer . The enclosed cable will not work with my 2002 Dell laptop . -LSB- -RSB- This is double the price of the Software , which , by the way is OK . If the correct cable -LRB- s -RRB- were included , the package as a whole gets 4 stars ...
 I am no guru on IT security , especially being able to appear `` invisible '' on the WWW.That 's why I bought this software.I know that for years , anonymizer has offered this sort of thing.But I beleive it was via the use of their websites , which acted as proxies . -LSB- not with simply a standalone software package on your desktop -RSB- . Well , if you surf long enough , just shopping or pricing out consumer goods , eventually you 'll come across a website that says something like , `` Welcome IP address 120.35.45.10 -LSB- or whatever your PC 's assigned address might be -RSB- `` Usually such sites go on to tell you stuff about your pc like : - browser used -LSB- netscape , IE , mozilla , etc -RSB- - your pc network name-amount of ram-hard drive size-on , and on , and onI use pc-cillin 2004 with anti-virus and firewall.I thought everything was set to avoid any disclosure of networking information about my pc . Since I had my settings cranked up to the HIGHEST privacy settings withinpc-cillin . Well , after cranking up everything to MAX privacy levels within GHOSTSURF platinum , I flushed my cache , cookie and such.I renewed my IP address via DHCP.Then I went a surfing.As soon as I came across a site that `` claimed '' to know everything about my pc , I compared their data to mine.At the command prompt , I typed IPCONFIG/ALL and sure enough , my IP number matched the one -LSB- that they said I appeared to be using out on the web -RSB- !!!! So what exactly was this ghostsurf `` supposed '' to be doing to protect my privacy?Why WAS my pc 's network address , IP address , and so on , STILL being seen by the outside world ??? I was supposed to be all setup to be surfing in an INVISIBLE mode !?!? My IP address was supposed to be blocked and my pc 's name and so on.Oh well , back to the drawing board.But the package did include an anti-spyware package called spycatcher . It 's is not the greatest ad-ware , mal-ware detector/cleaner , but then again it is not the worst either.Finally , it offered a set of `` cleanup tools '' , if I rememeber correctly.I got this software back during a huge a rebate-type-of-sale . It was almost a FREE-AFTER-REBATE , but not quite . Make like 5 or 10 bucks , final price.In today 's world , complete `` Invisiblity '' is quite unlikely . Whether via software , or hardware , or both.Just my .02 cents .
 I wish I could give this -5 stars . This is a bloated software with bugs . I ran this software for 4 days , looked at the memory useage and it was a whopping 640MB !!! Yes this one program was using that much memory . So I shut it down and restarted it again . At start it uses about 12MB of Memory . I left the computer on overnite and no one was using it and in the morning it was using 64-68 MB or memory . It is leaking memory like crazy .2 . Another problem . . It has a list of sites that you can not use proxy on . eg , yahoo.com requires cookie 's set , etc. . After a reboot the whole list is gone . Now I have to manually enter these .3 . It is slow ... slow ... ssssssssssssssslllllllllooooooowwwwwDo n't waste your money on this . Donate to charity instead .
 Who ever buys this please be warned the ST number on the packagewill not work so you ca n't unlock the ghostsurf to use it .
 Beware ... I bought a new PC with XP and then `` Teach Me Piano . '' Only to find out that `` Teach Me Piano '' will not install on XP , even though voyetra shows XP support ...
 Beware !! You cant use this program if you have or upgrade to Windows XP ! Voyettra website states that ther is no patch or download available . But , they do recommend spending the extra 29.00 to upgrade to the `` Deluxe '' version so that you can use it in XP . This is from their website ... `` If you 're using Windows XP we would recommend upgrading to `` Teach Me Piano Deluxe '' on our website : '' Very poor customer support . I guess Ill be buying software from another company from now on .
 If you buy this program , it may not run on the systems that it is purported too . They promote a new version of their product on their web site and then sell old versions through dealers that are incompatible . Then when you contact support about the problem they tell you that you should have bought it direct from them if you wanted a copy of the software that would run on the computers they claim it does .
 During the first chapter we quite enjoyed the software and learned the initial steps . Once we wanted to continue the next day we kept getting error message about the `` SPW Font '' not being available . Subsequently we spent several days to work this out but had absolutely no support from the manufacturer . It appears that some people were successful installing the program . Any hint would be appreciated .

 There is one caveat that you should be fair warned about before buying Voyetra 's Teach Me Piano . I went through Voyetra 's portal to purchase the software and it is stated that they do support Windows XP . For the most part this will not work out of the box on Windows XP SP2 and there are NO plans for Vista support . The software requires Microsoft RLE Codec which was removed from Microsoft 's distributions . The other required codec is the Intel Indeo Codec . Voyetra 's tech support responds quickly to your requests but when it comes down to it they suggest reinstalling your OS and trying again . After reinstalling XP SP2 and the additional codec the application still did not work for me . This only impacts the video tutorials all of the other tutorials work great and the lesson plans are well designed and appear to be easy to follow .
 Warning
 I was taking lessons from the internet FREE and decided to get Teach Me Piano with a gift certificate . This is without a doubt the worst software EVER . I installed and uninstalled it 3x . After muddling through the lack of any START instructions , I could play -LRB- I think -RRB- the beginning of the course until I exited and try to return later . Each time the software was `` performing an illegal operation and will close '' So unless you can spend the next year or so of your life while the software is working to learn the piano , forget it , you 'll never get back in . I emailed the company 2x and have yet to get a response . So much for technical support . I have returned the junk for a refund . Thanks to . . great return policies . I 'll go back to FREE internet instructions .
 THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7 64BIT . I WISH THEY HAD BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT . THE DESCRIPTION SAYS WORKS WITH WINDOWS 7 . BUT DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE 32BIT AND THE 64BIT . AGAIN IT DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7 64BIT .
 THE BOX LOOKS PRETTY LIKE MOST OTHER HOME DESIGN PROGRAMS BUT THIS SOFTWARE IS GARBAGE . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY . I SUGGEST BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS HOME DESIGNER AND HOME DESIGNER 6.0 THEY ARE EXCELLENT PROGRAMS WITH AN EASY LEARNING CURVE .
 My daughter , who aspires to be a marine biologist , received Aquazone as a Christmas gift . During installation the program asked if we wanted to add fish and accessories to the aquarium and we said yes . After adding quite a few items our daughter realized she had too many . Unable to find a way to remove them she deleted that aquarium so she could start over . When she tried to add fish to a new aquarium she was told she could n't because the original fish were n't there . Even after uninstalling it and reinstalling it we were unable to use the fish . Granted , we did not read the instructions in the program before adding fish to the tank but this was because we were n't offered the opportunity prior to being asked if we wanted to add fish to the tank . We visited the aquazone website and in the FAQ it indicated that once the fish were gone they are gone . We contacted tech support by e-mail and they did provide information to get the guppies back but not the speciality fish . My daughter is very disappointed . Beware !
 The first two discs of the program loaded fine , but the final disc -LRB- the one needed to make the program work -RRB- refused to load . I contacted the company 's `` customer support '' and gee , no surprise , they blamed it on my computer . I had tried loading their disc in three different computers , and that last disc refused to load on any computer . Their customer support refused to provide a new disc . NOT WORTH A DIME !
 Suse/Novell would like for you to believe it works out of the box . It does not!I have run many Linux distributions since 1995 and Suse/Novell is just another distro and still not quite ready for the desktop.I currently run multi-boot systems which most distros handle very well . Not Suse ! The install is only geared for existing windows or a blank hard drive . In order to load Suse , I had to unload three other systems -LRB- the Suse install actually removed them itself without letting me know -RRB- . After install I had to tweek the video and network card , and the sound system just barely works with only a few of the ` installed ' packages . Fortunately I know how to adjust scripts to ` make things work ' but sound is still an issue . Some things do work nicely but for the cost of Suse I suggest going with Fedora download and save your money , you will be much happier . While reloading Fedora and my favorite
 If you want to go back about 10 years in computing thiswill surely take you back in time.First problem , drivers lack of them.Second problem , if it do n't like your hardware you areout of luck.Third problem , my C :\ has now been destroyed.I now have a machine with a blinking cursor .
 Installation went relatively smoothly on a Dell Dimension 4100 . Following a reboot , everything seemed to work ok except for the sound system . After spending a considerable amount of time searching for a solution to this problem , I sent a request for help to SUSE tech . support . My purchase came with a promise of 90 days of support for installation issues , but SUSE replied that this did not include help with configuration of sound cards . So far , I have been unable to resolve the problem . But I have decided that any company that weasles out of a technical support agreement is not a company I would welcome as software provider for my production network .
 SuSE 9.1 pro was very nice which prompted Me to check out SuSE 9.3 pro.I was surprised to find out most of the standard features in the command prompt were taken out by Novell.PineMuttfd _ locate_pkgapache , now has apache2 which no one usesnmaplynxSome other stuff also , some you can directly find the download and . / configure ; make while others SuSE requires many rpm dependancies which starts to become a bit of a headache.A few other ` Novell Nightmare ' touch ups include ssh which is a bit of a nightmare using their version to tunnel and network with , and their ssl and apache2.conf filesIf you are a KDE and/or Gnome user , and like to chat with a friend on msn messenger thru Gaim or Kopete , good luck keeping O.SSL updated . I never had this problem before on Fedora RedHat or GentooAlot of dependant rpm 's needed . Being this rpm dependant may as well use fedora Red Hat . At least they have a good rpm manager.I can understand wanting to simplifing things but they shouldnt have dropped their ` personal edition ' as in 9.1 build , and make their ` pro ' watered down.The sad thing is , on Novell 's offical site for 9.3 they admit to taking out these tools and programs from the shell or ` personally customising ' to give it their own touch , which helped screw up alot.They did however add alot of unneeded fluff which you dont need with linux unless you just want to chew up cpu 's like the pretty menus and such , but if your going with a pro linux build your just in the command prompt most the time anyhow.I do hope their new 10.x build is better but Im not going to waist My time to check it out . Going back to R.H.I did give it two stars because if your a home user and nothing more , the 9.3 is great ! But if all your going to do is home use and not program or admin , go with something cheaper thats set up more specifically for a home user such as Xandros linux made by Debian which is also a bit cheaper for the new home user to try out too .
 I was an early adopter of version 1 ; version 2 has just been released . While this software does what it purports to do , the issue is with Quicken 's installation and support practices . QMEM requires the use of . NET framework v 1.1 ... NOT version 2 . If you install it over . NET 2 , its buggy and their techs online suggest you uninstall . NET 2 . Catch - uninstalling . NET 2 will , on many Windows XP systems , make . NET 1.1 unstable.Further , it is not possible to talk with Quicken MEM support . You can post a problem , leave you phone number , and they will contact you at their -LRB- not your -RRB- convienence.What am I left with ? 1 -RRB- Back to doing my medical expenses by hand and 2 -RRB- facing a Windows XPsp2 reinstall .
 I found the 2.1 version -LRB- the latest version -RRB- slow and inflexibile . It actually produced the wrong answers for my health insurance policies and the results could not be adjusted manually . Also found the `` Help '' section far from helpful although on-line assistance was responsive -LRB- although unable to make it right -RRB- . I think Intuit just got this program into the market too quickly without proper testing .
 I 've been a devout Quicken user for years , and I had high hopes for this program.Today , after two months of use , the program refuses to open my data file . There 's no help at all to be found as to what the problem might be -- the file is there , it seems to have data in it -- but it 's effectively gone . Fortunately , this happened just days before the 60 day guarantee ran out , and I was able to get a no-questions-asked refund from Intuit.Had I not been stuck wuth the product , would I have started afresh ? Probably not.The interface is a little quirky , but you can used to it . It also seems very sluggish ; there 's a slight delay involved with doing just about anything in the interface , which quickly becomes very annoying . The value of the product is minimal relative to the problems with entering data -LRB- and now the uncertainty for me that my data might disappear at any time -RRB- . Take your money and buy a good book on using Excel , and roll your own medical tracking spreadsheet .
 I loath dealing with medical bills -- trying to reconcile medical bills that may or may not have insurance payments credited , figuring out deductibles , etc. . I usually ignore the bills 'til the pile gets too big just because I hate doing it . And I freely admit that doing any sort of math makes my head want to explode.So I thought this program was the answer . It really could have been , if Intuit would listen to feedback and would give it attention . But as willing as they are to provide email assistance , they never fix the problems , just give workarounds.In many ways , it works OK . You wait for your insurance EOBs -LRB- claims processing reports -RRB- to arrive , and then fill in the blanks , then pay your medical bills based on what the EOB information was . Once you figure out how to enter your deductible limits , that is . And therein is one of the problems.There are limits to what it will allow you to enter . For example , my insurance provider calculates individual deductibles toward individual limits . When 3 people in the family meet their individual limits , the family deductible is considered met . That 's fine . But this software has no way to tweak this type of limit -LRB- it just calculates the amount paid toward deductibles by ALL family members -RRB- , thereby making the reports on family deductibles somewhat unhelpful and useless . That 's just one issue -- and I 'm no programmer , but can that be so hard to adjust ? And heaven forbid you have a payment that is not part of the deductible -- they sent me a workaround for this problem that still has my head spinning.I agree with the other reviewers that it 's slow -- it sometimes just loads one 2 inch square area for a few seconds before the page appears when it 's loading . And I have a new fast computer.After several years on the market , I think it 's unconscionable that they have n't streamlined this product . I ca n't be the only one who has left them feedback of this sort , but they have n't updated this software for a LONG time . Based on the ratings for other Intuit Quicken products , it may not be a problem with just this product .
 I love all quicken products , except this . It is basically useless . It takes an incredible amount of time to simply input a medical bill , it does n't even have the simple ability to to tell you how much your total expenses are and what is left in your HSA/FSA , seems like they could write a little code to for some simple addition and subtrction .
 Quicken Medical Expense Manager was bundled with one of my annual updates of Quicken a few years ago . It has generally worked OK through versions 1 and 2 for me in Windows XP SP3 , but has apparently been abandoned by Intuit/Quicken and is not supported at all . If so , I recommend that you avoid it . How would you like to consolidate 4 or 5 years of medical and vet records for your family into a program such as this which stops working properly , and have zero recourse ?
 This is the second time I have tried to order the correct , classic version of this game . I just received the wrong thing yet again . YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE PHOTOS AND PRODUCT DESCRIPTION ! In fact , almost every one who claims to be selling the original game needs to take photos of the one they have in stock so we have a chance of knowing exactly what we are paying for !
 I bought this thinking it was the Carmen Sandiego from the mid-nineties , which is what the product photos show . The actual game for sale is the 2001 `` Treasures of Knowledge , '' which is a great game , just not what we were looking for . The product description is correct , but the photos should be fixed to avoid future confusion .
 I was under the impression that I had ordered Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego -- the original version . What I got was a terrible version . My son and I played it for 5 minutes thinking it was the version we had rented from the library but it was n't -- it was horrible -- graphics-wise and content . I ca n't tell you how disappointed I was !
 i own a mac , i specifically bought a version that would be compatible with my version of mac , since i remember playing thison my mac se , YES MAC SE ! in like 1989 but unfortunately its not compatible with mac osx . beware before you buy on what you are getting and if you can actually use it . !
 dont let the pictures fool you . . its not the same game . . i had to return it because it ended up being '' the travels of marco polo '' . I already have that one and it isnt as much fun as the original
 I tried several times to get this game to load on my XP system with no success . I am a geography teacher and thought I could use this game in my class , but I was sorely disappointed . It was a cheap price and I see why now .
 I bought this game because I loved playing it when I was a little kid . This game was supposed to be compatible with the latest operation systems such as windows 7 which is what I have . The game crashed very frequently making me lose my place in the game every time . Very upsetting .
 I did n't have a chance to give this to my son because the description said it was for windows 7 . When I got it home it WAS NOT . Amazon was very nice to me but the seller gave them and me a hard time . Sometimes the description from the seller is not quite accurate . Of course I had to return it ...
 I contacted the publisher , and this game will NOT run on any 64 bit PC . Big waste of money . It should be noted in the description .
 OMG this is the most boring game in the world all you do is buy land which is very expensive if you wan na have a good park then you buy a dinosaur witch is half of your money they you have to spend 25.00 on one thing of food which it eats in like a day . so DO N'T waste your money .
 I bought this CD title b/c I wanted to learn how to play the guitar again . My decision to purchase this was based solely on all the Amazon reviews that I perused beforehand . You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this , but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date . Furthermore , there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming . His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons , and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught . Again , the software is good but may not be the best on the market . Then again , I 've only purchased three titles , and this one offers a few things that the others do n't include .
 Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could . It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff . The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord , you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds , then you have to stop and click play again . I wish there was an option where you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again . The other thing is something a little more important . The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play , its called OLGA . Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore . So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else , and thats what they advertise `` Play hit songs '' . So overall , knowing all this I would have shopped around more . Especially for the price , its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs .
 This program is very difficult to for U.S. users . It uses the international phonetic system vice the American -- you have no choice but to learn the international which to me is more difficult . Also , they limit the number of times you can load it onto your computers . I have both the Pronunciation Power 1 & 2 -LRB- very expensive -RRB- and now they wo n't allow me to download them -- they say I 've loaded them too many times . How can this be when many of us purchase new computers every 3 or 4 years ? Also , using the dictionary to look up a word is very very slow . For example , if you are looking up a word such as women , you have to go thru all the w 's until you finally reach the `` wo 's '' for women . Besides all this , it is too expensive for what you get and the limitations they put on it . There are better , less expensive programs .
 This cd set is useful for children learning the alphabet and numbers.There are a lot of tedious musical numbers for the child to sit through to earn a star . After getting all the stars you can print a certificate.This was somewhat amusing for my 3 year old but does not teach sounding out of letters or other important reading skills.If you want something to help your child really advance in 1st or 2nd grade this is not the software you want.If you want something to amuse a preschooler or kindergarten child , you may find this useful , especially if your child likes singing along . -LRB- My child does not -RRB- . This is a 2 CD set . The second CD `` Smiletown '' is rather poor quality with these annoying `` pokemon '' type characters - younger children may find it interesting but not much educational value .
 I have not been able to load this on my computer which is new . Would cost me more to send it back .
 When I got this 4CD software , I had trouble setting it up . You have to actually Explore the CDROM and find the right Setup file that actually works when installing the North America Birds CDROM . The autorun will bring up an error . Keep this in mind if you want to buy it . As for the rest of it , I can say that it is pretty good . I have yet to see movies of birds , just pictures . In Websters Birds of the World , you can at least save the pictures . In this , you ca n't . If you find a bird you like that you want to put on your desktop you have to use the Print Screen function then open up your favorite paint/photoshop program and paste it , then you have to crop it how you like . I think that it really sucks that this CDROM does n't offer video clips . Who wants to see an some guy talk about birds !? I want to see the birds ! But , that is all the video you really get . I started with a rating of four stars , but as I write this review , I have brought it down one star , then another . I give this program two stars , and that is mostly because it at least works with Windows XP . I really think that these companies should come out with a better bird software . Websters was awesome , but alas , you can not use it on Windows XP . And they told me that they are coming out with a newer updated version ... but I have yet to see it , and it has been about 2 years since I contacted them . Anyways , get this software if you have Windows XP ... if you have anything below that , get Websters Birds of the World .
 Purchased as a gift , but when we tried to install on a Windows XP machine , it was the first software I installed that gave me the `` blue screen of death '' . Definitely wo n't run on XP and even tried all the possible settings in the Compatibility Mode , all with error messages . Site support is totally lacking as I could not find the product on the company 's web site . The poor documentation lists several other web sites to search for tech support , but little or no info found that was any help.Definitely not on my `` wish list '' and I have asked for a credit or refund .
 What can I say . This is the only software I ever intalled that generated the `` blue screen of death '' on my Windows XP computer . This software is NOT compatible with Windows XP as far as I can tell . I tried everything I could think of to try to install the first disk including a variety of settings under XP 's Compatibility Mode -LRB- Win95 , ' 98 , 256 colors , etc. -RRB- . Error messages each time . I linked to the company 's web site and the product is no longer listed as far as I can see . The one page documentation indicated that I needed to visit other web site for support and there is little information on those sites that help.Basically - this software is not recommended !
 I 'm amazed to see so many positive reviews . We 've tried this on at least two computers , under Windows 98 and 98 SE , and it crashed a lot on both of them . On our current Win 98 SE computer , it crashes once per page at least , making the program effectively unusable . Sadly no patch is available.As another reviewer points out , it does n't autoplay when you insert the disk .
 This item is rated for 3-7 years old . However with this age group it does not automatically run when placed in the CD Drive . This make it impossible for the younger this age group is to use on their own . It seems an auto run command should be used on software used for children to provide them with hassle free use of the product.If it does ' t run what use is it no matter who the writer is . I have Windows 2000 .
 I bought this program thinking I could make nice slideshows with transitions and effects to play on my dvd player -LRB- vcd -RRB- . Unfortunately transitions and effects do n't work when you make a video cd , when you go to broderbund help page they tell you that 's how it 's supposed to be . If I had known that I would not have gotten this program . I gave it two stars because I suppose if you 're just using it to make e-mails or cd-roms it would work all right .
 Product may be OK but I will never know . Could not get it function although it installed perfectly . Broderbund is immpossible to contact if you have a problem . Their software support -LRB- Encore -RRB- does not have an 800 number and you can hang on long distance for an hour before talking to someone.Frustrated and waste of time due to Broderbund lousy support.A .

 If you live in the state of Louisiana do n't buy this product you can not use any of the forms . You will not find that out until you purchase the product .
 This could have been a great software program to own . There are several useful forms no matter what your situation is and it is easy to use except ... it wo n't save certain files . And if you get an error under a user name that user profile is corrupted so you have to start all over . I gave the product the benefit of the doubt , that I had possibly done something wrong , but when I tried the same files on a different user it did the same thing . Even when I set up 2 new clean users it would n't let me switch back and forth . I am ditching this version and getting the 2006 version hoping they have worked out the technical issues .
 The MS Office Professional 2007 that came with my new Toshiba laptop locked up after a couple of months with no immediate warning . It was a `` trial '' version . I preferred my 2003 version of Word , and I much preferred the Lotus WordPro that I had previously until it became incompatible with everything else . When Microsoft locked up my trial version it required me to convert to a full version , not an upgrade , at a very high price . But the conversion was n't working the day I was excluded from the papers that I was writing . In desperation I ordered the upgrade from Amazon with overnight delivery . It arrived in good time and installed easily.Word 2007 continues to exhibit the bugs that it has had for years
 1 star is far too high for this junk.I installed it this morning . The screens were blurry and hard to read . I used to be able to read my email from halfway across the room . Now I have to squint and get up close . Everything is low contrast , the fonts are blurry , the menus are byzantine at best . From an useability standpoint we were better off with WORDSTAR . After a few painful hours trying to figure out how too make the software minimally useable I 've uninstalled it and am reinstalling 2003 . Even if I lose all my settings and old emails , it will be worth it . Heck , it would be worth it to roll all the way back to DOS to avoid this ill-conceived piece of junk.For the record , I 've got a high-powered machine with dual high quality monitors , this is n't a hardware issue . If I display Office 2007 on the right monitor and something else on the left , I can easily read the left monitor , but not the stuff from Office on the right . This happens even when the fonts are smaller on the left monitor .
 Unless you need to build an entire Office solution using Access and VBA the Microsoft Office is just a gouge.Plus I hate the Ribbon . Bring back menus and toolbars .
 After I bought it but before I installed it , our hired office geek told me it 's one of the worst MS Offices created . I 'm glad I learned that before I installed it . Phew ! Saved by the geek .
 I really hate this version of Microsoft Office . It takes more steps to do basic stuff than it did in the 2003 version . It is NOT as user friendly as 2003 Microsoft Office . I have not found anything yet that has given me an Aha moment with this version . I personally think Microsoft took a step or two backwards on this one .
 2003 gave me all the feature I wanted and they were easy to find . In your efforts to make things easy to find , you have made the product far more complicated and features I used regularly much arder to find . I 'm still looking for improvements .
 Having suffered through Office on Win98 - ME - 2000 , I was actually pleased with Office XP . Vista is a letdown . Two major oh-no 's : - The help is useless . Searching for a unknown term or reference produces a long list of possible articles , but the searched term may not show up in any of them . I do n't have hours to puruse through mindless unrelated articles . XP help highlighted the searched term ; it worked fine . Why did they ruin it ? - The location of various menu items is scrambled . I do n't mean ` rearranged ' , I mean scrambled . Drawing in Word or PowerPoint is an exercise in frustration . It 's one menu to create an object , a different one to flip or group , etc. . I 'm sure the new arrangement makes sense to someone , I 'm just not sure that someone is playing with a full deck.I 'm still looking for redeeming features . I 'll update this if/when I find some .
 Perhaps my rating is too low . Word and excel work great . My big problem is the second disk will not load . I have been talking to microsoft and they told me the reason was that I had the 2003 professional and the academic versions of outlook 2007 and word 2007 still on my computer . I thought I had to have them or the upgrade would not work . I have since deleted pro 2003 and the academic versions of 2007 . However , the second disk will still not load . It always stops on the first download on something called SQL server 2005 express . I keep writing microsoft and they answer me about once per week.If I had to do over I would just buy the standard . The only good thing about pro 2007 is it will still let you save documents in the 2003 version . Apparently , I am the first in my business to have purchased the pro 2007 . If you send a document that was saved in 2007 those with 2003 can not open it.As a result , I am really not using 2007 but saving everything in 2003 so my colleagues can get my emails.But the second disk still not loading after all this time does tend to upset me.Good luck
 It took approx 60 hours over two month to sucessfully complete the installation . I had many problem with Microsoft of the past comflicting with Microsoft of the present . When I shared my frustration with employees at Microsoft I learned many of the employees at Microsoft use Mac for their home use . They suggested I Buy a Mac.At one point I just wanted to return the product . The seller was great and he was willing to take the product back .
 Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade , but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system . I was wrong.You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software . But after a month of using Office 2007 , you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release . Microsoft should be ashamed.I do n't know the root cause of my problems , but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista , so there should n't be any software conflicts or issues.So what are my issues ? The list is long : -- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls . It can making editing a document very painful . I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document . But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue . Oddly , if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003 , the problem goes away ! What ?! It 's killing my productivity . -- When ever I cut and paste from an old document , Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds . And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire . I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things . This never happened in the old Word . This is another time killer . -- Every few days , Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it can not display my email folders . Uh oh ! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again . -- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess . It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine , not Internet Explorer to display email . I have no idea why Microsoft did this , but they have got to fix it . -- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still have n't been fixed . If you place an image , it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly . Why ca n't they solve this one ? -- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface -LRB- which I like -RRB- , some programs like Visio 2007 do not . So you have to remember how to use two interfaces . Could n't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs ? Give me a break . -- On a few occassions in Visio 2007 , my files have failed to save correctly . At first I thought this must have been my fault , but it 's happened to me a few times and ca n't be a coincidence . A few times I 've gotten an error message and lost my work . Ug . -- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format . So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed -LRB- which is n't likely the case -RRB- . To get around this , you can save it down to a 2003 file format , but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format . What a pain ! Also , there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files . Could be the cause of many of my problems , but there is no way I can avoid using old files . They should have worked harder on compatibility.There are good things about the new 2007 . I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar.But I do n't think it 's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious , serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work . I did n't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and do n't think the public should have to suffer . Surely they can afford to do better!NEW ADDITION TO MY REVIEW : Today I discovered that I can no longer paste Excel charts into Word like I used to . When I try , the chart goes in , but any bars/lines disappear .
 I deeply regretMicrosoft Office Professional 2007 UPGRADEupgrade . The new ribbon means that I have to completely relearn commands that I have used effortlessly for years . Some users find the ribbon to be intuitive ; to me it is cluttered and obscure . It has become a game in my office , when we are searching the first time for a command , to see whose guess will lead us to the hidden treasure . Unfortunately , in our intensely busy , deadline-driven office , we do n't have time for this.Especially disappointing is the lame Help , which I have finally abandoned . I 've had to resort to Google-searches for the commands I need.The only way I have been able to get any work done in Word or Excel is through the prior version 's keystroke commands , which are still built in . But you have to know the entire series of keystrokes.I feel betrayed by Microsoft . Such a sudden and dramatic change with so little support for users of prior versions has slowed my work to a crawl.You would probably like Office 2007 if you are new to Office , if you tend to use just the basics or if you really like exploring new software . If you have invested a lot in using prior versions and just want to get your work done , be prepared to lose a lot of time . Either way , I strongly recommend downloading a trial version before buying it .
 I excitedly upgraded to Office 2007 ... '07 Outlook is FAR slower - ties my reasonably powerful machine up in knots -LRB- 110 % of resources -RRB- for minutes at a time inexplicably ; spell ck does n't work consistently ; HTML emails have lost functionality I used to use often with 2003 ver ; Excel opens MUCH more slowly ; no real gains in Excel fuctionality ; various add-ins essential to my biz no longer work in Excel 2007 ; Access 2007 was billed as much easier to use - FALSE ; Word has a couple of improvements but messes up spell ck with Outlook if you keep both Word 2003 & 2007 on yr machine ; the highly touted `` Ribbon '' is mainly cosmetic ; I believe 2007 's indexing is at the heart of some of sluggisness which might be ok if it worked . . but it retruns strange results ... NET , NET , I am uninstalling Office 2007 and going back to 2003 with all its stupid faults ... it 's too bad no one at MSFT actually uses thier products to realize how defective they are .
 I recently bought a new laptop , and the changeover involved an `` upgrade '' to Office 2007 . I was aware that there was a new user interface , but was not aware that Office 2007 is , in almost every respect , an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!I have used MS Office for many years , and am what could be called a `` power user , '' especially for Word and Powerpoint , which I use weekly.One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable . For those who use office frequently , it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available . Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks ... Until Office 2007 ! In Office 2007 , hardly anything is customizable ! You have a constantly changing tool ribbon , which takes up a lot of screen real estate.The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it `` thinks '' you will need at the moment . It is rarely right ! ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier ! There is one small `` tool bar '' up on the title bar that you CAN customize , but it is not convenient , and will not hold many icons . It has the option of being moved below the ribbon , which takes up even more screen real estate , but is still very limited , and can not be docked or moved from there.Granted , there are third party programs , such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle , that add back some of the ability to customize , but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!Even the third party programs , however , can not get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one . In previous versions of Powerpoint , you could add a set of icons that , with one mouse click , allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text . That has been omitted in 2007 . In the `` improved '' 2007 version , you must open a dialog box , and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!To make matters worse , Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions . After spending years establishing formats such as . doc and . ppt as industry standards , Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats ! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 -LRB- or any other program that reads . doc files -RRB- you need to remember to save it in that format . The default 2007 format can not be opened by earlier versions!Office 2007 CAN open the older formats , but even in opening earlier Office formats , there are problems . For example , most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen . Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed . When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version , your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text . When a slide appears , the shadows of the letters are already in place , and the letters animate in on top ! Mircosoft 's only suggestion ... go through your slides and take the old shadows out , and put new shadows in ! -LRB- I tried this ... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation ! ... And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file ! -RRB- For someone who never used Office before , or who just uses Word to type simple letters , 2007 may be okay , but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity , 2007 is a nightmare.I have always loved Microsoft Office . It has been an industry standard for ease of use . In my opinion , that is no longer the case . I believe Microsoft tried to produce something `` different '' to attract new users , but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past . If you have the option of staying with an earlier version , DO NOT UPGRADE to this product !
 Along with many others , I 'm a longtime user of the Office Toolsuite . I had hoped that the latest release would boost productivity and would automate common tasks . It 's unfortunate that it did neither . Even with top of the line hardware , this Office Suite is incredibly clumsy . Programs like Powerpoint take over a minute to save and close out , common tasks require more hunting in the `` ribbon '' than anything ever took in a menu driven system . Luckily , there 's still a sliver of an area where you can add customized buttons to get some functionality back . There is no way to switch back to a `` non-ribbon '' driven system in case you are curious.The equation editor , a feature I use quite a bit , has been reduced to non-sense and has become nearly unusable . Gone is the ability for you to move the editor box close to your working area on the page , instead , you constantly have to scroll to the top of the page to enter the equation components . Gone is the ability to use superscript , subscripts , integrals , etc. . in the editor with a highlight and select . After selection , your cursor is placed outside the component field and you have to click to get back in . Trying to use the keyboard to move around may close the equation editor completely . Luckily , Equation editor 3 is still available if you can find the `` insert object '' icon in the ribbon bar.Object Linking and Embedding has been reduced to a monster chore . You must wait forever to move objects between applications , and you have to click a dialog box to retry on top of that , and wait even more . Many of the other complaints have been well documented so I wo n't bother going through them . In short , this is most certainly not an upgrade . It is bloated , has worst features not better , it is painfully slow , and worst of all , not intelligently thought out in terms of automating or speeding up tasks . Unfortunately , MS Office is the standard used everywhere so switching to other toolsuites is not trivial . However , do yourself a favor and wait for a better version than 2007 . This one is definitely not worth your hard earned money .
 I have had every version of office and this is the first time I have unloaded the program after installing . It is so incredibly slow that I went back to Office 2003 . It does n't help that they have an advertisment show before it opens each module . Outlook is the worst of all and I have no intension of using it unless they can improve performance . What a disappointment .
 I have used nearly every version of Microsoft Office since 1994 . So , I looked forward to using Office 2007 . To say the least I was disappointed . I feel that this product is aimed at novice or weak users who might feel more at home using a product like Microsoft Works or perhaps the `` Home '' version rather than a professional product version . I suppose that its new `` ribbon '' interface would be of some value to new users of Office who might not have much previous experience with the product . However , I 'll bet that after a bit of use the `` ribbon '' will become as tiresome as it became to me.From my point-of-view , I had a number of problems with the product .1 . The old `` File '' functions -LRB- Save , Open , etc. -RRB- are hidden until you click on a non-descript icon . Why not have `` File '' option on the menu bar ? If the term `` File '' is too passe then at least call it something .2 . Each one of the new `` ribbons '' is loaded with stuff that is seldom used by most Office users . And , in so doing , these always take up an excessive amount of screen space . I did n't like that I had to click on each of the menu choices to drop down the corresponding `` ribbon '' . These were not organized in the manner I was used to and I did n't know where some things were that I often use . In previous versions just moving the mouse pointer over the menu item dropped the corresponding list of functions . Maybe there is an option for this buried somewhere to do this but it could n't be found if so .3 . The installation default for the ribbon is to disappear after one function is performed . I found this very frustrating . At last I found an option that would retain the `` ribbon '' after each use but then I was stuck with it until I turned the option off . The old pre-defined -LRB- but customizable -RRB- toolbars , which usually take up less space , are gone . Yes , you can make an optional custom toolbar as well . However , you can do the same in previous versions without the `` ribbons '' clutter .4 . There is no option to revert this `` ribbon '' setup to the Office 2003 menu / toolbar setup . -LRB- I 'll bet that there will be one in the next release or two -RRB- .5 . There are very few new capabilities in this product for most mortal Office users.In short , I recommend that you find a version of Office 2003 rather than buy this one . If you already have Office 2003 , save your money .
 You 've got ta love Microsoft . They must spend more time protecting their monopoly than preparing their products properly before release . I have the hardware to run this suite and I installed it on a clean Win XP SP2 system . All patches and updates are current.Excel crashes constantly and I lose all my work -LRB- in spite of setting up to auto-save every 2 minutes -RRB- . It wastes a lot of time . The number of `` error reports '' that my machine automatically sends every time Office encounters an problem must be huge . Here 's an error report , Microsoft
 I have been a loyal Microsoft user for many years and a real fan of Excel.The radical changes in the menus require relearning this software , which appears to be an unnecessary change.It 's difficult to find some of the same previous functionalityI want my dog back and the prior menu setup .
 MS Office 2007 is the worst Microsoft product ever develpoed . I would like to use Excel 2007 as an example to explain my point of view :1 -RRB- The so-called `` Ribbon '' is so tall that it occupies almost a quarter of my notebook screen , further more , you get status bar and task bar , NOT MUCH SPACE LEFT for you to work in . The thumnail in the ribbon is not nearly as nice as those pop-up windows in older versions .2 -RRB- When you try to change a line style in a graph , this version update the entire screen instead of a sample-view in the pop-up window , thus , comsuming a lot of CPU power and slows down computer tremendously . You really need to upgrade your hardware to run office 2007.3 -RRB- If you have multiple data sets -LRB- say 10 sets -RRB- in a graph and you want to change the data range , you 'll find that it 's a big headache to do so in version 2007 , because you have to pop up new windows 10 times instead of once in older version .4 -RRB- When open my old Excel files in this version , all VBA codes got lost .5 -RRB- Overall , the Office 2007 has a new look but much worse performance . I would not spend a penny for this junk !!!
 I installed Office 2007 as an `` upgrade '' from Office 2003 . Word and Excel are OK - the user interface changes in Excel are a little annoying , but the XML capabilities -LRB- for pro version -RRB- are necessary , and I wrote it down to natural human resistance to change.Outlook 2007 , however , was so slow as to be unusable . The thing literally took 2 minutes to open -LRB- that 's with a 2GHz chip and 3G of RAM -RRB- and the normal operations , while I 'm sure I 'd become accustomed to the slowness after a while - just are n't worth the wait .
 I have been using Office 2007 Professional on my corporate laptop running XP for a few months now and I must say it is the worst version yet . It is extremely irritating to me for companies to change so drastically the user interface to the point that you have to totally re-learn the product . I am working here ... do n't have time to re-learn staples such as word processors , spreadsheets , and databases . Jeesh ! Give me a break Microsoft ! In addition , I think it has to be the buggiest version yet . It is also a huge problem transferring important files to clients who are still on the older versions of Office ... that part alone has been a disaster . If you have time to piddle around re-learning ... buy it . If you have to work for a living ... save yourself the money !
 We purchased this upgrade because Microsoft no longer supports the version of Outlook we had on our computer and we needed to link with other software so we had to upgrade . We decided to upgrade the whole suite -- big mistake . The helpful folks at Microsoft have come out with another unintuitive product that makes more things `` automatic '' , which is very unhelpful . It has removed or hidden some features I used in the former version on a daily basis -LRB- for example , the ability to add columns in a simple table in Word -- now I have to import an Excel spreadsheet instead -- although I can add all sorts of more complex formulas to a Word table -- that 's just strange -RRB- . Yet again my Big Brothers at Microsoft have decided that THEY know what I need better than I do so they will make my choices for me . By doing so , they have also made the program much slower and , surprise , sloppier . It 's pretty , though -- lots of new icons instead of WORDS -LRB- imagine that in a WORD PROCESSING PROGRAM ! -RRB- . Guess it would be great if I were ILLITERATE !
 I had to purchase the 2007 upgrade when I bought my new computer and could not find the disk for my earlier version of Office Professional . They have changed it so much to look like adobe that I spend more time trying to do simple task as center a column in Excel than working on the project . If I ever find the disk for the last version I will reload it into my new computer .
 I believe the next time Microsoft makes a new version of the Microsoft Office Suite , perhaps they should go back to DOS . I have never had the displeasure that I have now since purchasing this software suite . Imagine everything you know about Microsoft Office being stripped away and being replaced with a new program that has the same exact functionality -LRB- nothing new what so ever -RRB- , only every button , check box , function , and flexibility being stripped away . What you are imagining now is the new 2007 version . If you buy this program , the moment you start it for the first time , you will realize you made a mistake . Go back to 2003 .
 Sorry Microsoft , but your `` ribbon '' user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever . It renders all your Office applications useless . I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again -LRB- I 'm not even sure if it 's even possible to customize the `` ribbon '' -RRB- . The ribbon is ugly and WAY , WAY , WAY , WAY too big.My advice
 I have upgraded my office product every time Microsoft has provided an update ... this is the first time I am regretting that choice . I like and use all of the suites in MS Professional , I am completely frustrated with all of the changes to the tool bar in Office . It took me 1 day to learn to print and save a document in Word . I may actually have to read the instruction manual after being an Office user for over 15 years . Ridiculous !
 The new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use . It may be for some new users but for experienced users , it is n't . This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform . This is not due to the learning curve , it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works . Once you are familiar with the program , nothing is faster than the old menu structure . If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons , it would be the best of both worlds , satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users . The new version does not run macros as fast however . My recommedation for existing users
 You can try this for free for up to 60 days by registering with Microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy . When you 're sure you want it , permanently activate it with the product key you get in your Amazon package.The new version of Excel has two huge advantages :1 . It removes the old 256 column/65 ,536 row limitation . You can now have 16,384 columns and more than a million rows .2 . Excel 2007 can use all the cores/processors in your computer -LRB- or you can restrict it to use only some , so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine -RRB- . On my dual core computer , Excel 2007 is ** way ** faster than 2003 at almost every task.I 've seen no crashes , hangs , or hiccups.But everything else about Excel 2007 is frustrating . The new `` ribbon '' interface is unnecessary and awkward -- almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases . Bypassing the ribbon with the new `` Quick Access Toolbar '' is problematic because -LRB- bizarrely -RRB- Microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons , leaving them with identical green circles.Right now Excel 2003 costs more than Excel 2007 . If the two plusses do n't help you , you may think that 2003 is worth more .
 Office 2007 offers no new or useful function to Office 2003 users . It does have a new and confusing user interface so that you will have to search for even the most basic functions to save or open documents.So far , I have not found any fault in 2003 that has been addressed in 2004 . I only purchased it because 2003 would not load in Vista 32 . However , due to a hardware failure I found that Office 2003 does load and operate in Vista 64 . Spend your money on a 64 bit processor and keep Office 2003 .
 The latest version of Retrospect Mac is 6.1.126 , which was released in October 2005 . Yikes , that 's a long time . Old enough so that the Bootable CD disaster recovery method is not supported on any of the Intel Macs , which makes the product worthless for my needs . The only supported method of disaster recovery is to rebuild with OS X first , reinstall Retrospect and go from there.I do n't know what EMC 's been doing in the past 1.5 years , but they 've clearly dropped the ball in the growing Mac market .
 The user interface is the least intuitive I have ever used . The software does backup nicely , and reliably , once you have taken the time to understand the product . However , if you are not a professional or a dedicated hobbyist you will not enjoy , respect , or trust the user interface.If you are using this in a small office then you will have incentive to learn how to configure this and your time will be rewarded . However my suggetion is that it not be purchased for home use . I 'm an engineer and I have to think way too hard each time I need to backup a different configuration with this product .
 Before upgrading to MAC OS 10.4 I used the convoluted `` help '' system with EMC and was told my backed up information would be fine but that I might need to install an updated driver to make Retrospect compliant with the upgraded OS . Turns out this `` updated driver '' is a complete software purchase to the tune of $ 89.00 . My backups are stored in a format only readable by Retrospect . If they had n't lied to me in the first place I would have simply opened and saved my backups in a readable format before doing the upgrade . They have me over a barrel and offer no apologies .
 I have been trying to get into their website for about a week . Apparently , they are not even aware of the problem . Is EMCinsignia even there ? Does n't seem to be because you can not even get to the front page of their website.HELLOOOO !!!
 After laboring for a long time to set up a backup server , I get a kernal panic -LRB- probably not R 's fault -RRB- but -- OH JOY -- the crash corrupted the config file so NOW I GET TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN !!! This is the first time I 've seen it , but it 's the single most frustrating failing of the program I 've encountered so far . Another fun one is when a TOC file for a certain backup gets out of sync , so the program SHOWS YOU A DIALOGUE BOX ABOUT THIS AND DOES NOT EXECUTE ANY BACKUPS WHILE THIS IS SHOWING . There 's no way to make it automatically fix the problem , which it could do . There 's no Applescript support so you ca n't check to see if it 's in a stopped state or anything . There 's no way to stop the constant corrupting of the TOC files . I am an experienced user and have had nothing but problems with this pgoram . Since it has * no * future on the Mac -LRB- the company is not working on an Intel version -RRB- , and since `` schizo '' is the only way to describe the engineers who made this program , you should NOT buy this program unless you know what it is -LRB- a full featured backup took for Mac and PC , but a crappy one -RRB- . .
 Like other reviewers , I used to swear by Dantz backup software . I used its DiskFit for years . When I upgraded to OS X , I got Dantz 's Retrospect and have had a fair number of problems .1 . Dantz gives you one free tech call in the first 30 days and then charges like $ 70 if you have a problem after that . I think they should give you one free tech call ANYTIME . Most users wo n't have a problem in the first 30 days -- and when you have a problem after your first hard-drive disaster , getting hit for $ 70 just adds insult to injury .2 . In order to use an external hard-drive as a backup location , you 've got to select this option inside a couple of screens in preferences . This should be the default , especially since this is the favored way of backing up an entire internal hard drive . And even if you 've selected it in preferences , if you crash and have to restore from the original CD , you 've got to remember this minor selection or your restore wo n't work , causing much panic as I found out .3 . The program has behaved differently with different backups , causing confusion . For months it performed the backup simply to my external hard drive , then one day it required that my external hard drive be erased to do the backup .4 . When I did experience a problem that required a restore , the program crashed AFTER erasing my hard drive but BEFORE restoring anything . This was distressful .5 . I 've had to use the manual many times in my backups because the program simply is n't intuitive.I give it two stars because I was actually able to restore my data and the thing grudgingly does its job . But , man , I wish it worked more simply for the average user who does n't give a darn about scripting and network backups .
 I use to swear by retrospect and it never let me down until OS X . Since Dantz started to support OS X its been `` You can purchase Retrospect Support , for $ xxx a year ... '' and how good is this support ? Not very I have a very common DVDR Drive that they still do n't support , I would n't complain if I owned the express back up , but I own the Pro package and the support is lousy ! so many $ $ $ a call to find out that I need to update to their new software after I had just purchased an upgrade and then they still ca n't say they know if they support a Pioneer A107 DVDR !? $ 150 plus a year for support I do n't think so . .
 If you 're not already a user , Retrospect for Mac is not a product you want to buy into . The interface has n't been substantially updated in over a decade . In this decade Dantz -LRB- EMC -RRB- has charged it 's users half a dozen times for `` upgrades '' which should be free updates as all that was added was the ability to actually work with the current operating system.The interface is obtuse and backwards . For example , in a slap in the face to anyone with usability experience , Retrospect demands , in a modal dialog , that the user approves and affirms the desire to back up . Gee , let 's see , I just got through booting Retrospect , selecting `` Back Up '' and about 45 other steps directly involved with only one purpose
 Over the past two months I 've tried to get this software to create two sets of incremental backups of a Mac on two USB2 hard disks . Despite more than 20 years experience with computers , and a successful installation of Norton Ghost 9.0 backup software on a PC , I have not been able to get dantz Retrospect Backup 6.0 Desktop Macintosh to work on my system . I 'm sure that a dantz -LRB- TM -RRB- engineer could sit down in front of the Mac , execute a dozen or so commands and get it to work properly , but that would not in any way prove that Retrospect Backup 6.0 is an acceptable product . The problem of this , and many other software packages , is that there are a huge number of combinations of optional settings that do n't work , so if the errors are intermittant , it can take years to debug without proper guidance from the designers . The Retrospect Backup 6.0 backup manual is at least six times thicker than the manual that came with first MacIntosh computers . Its content usefulness is next to zero . The same can be said for the usefulness of the online help menus . The consumer expectation for a desktop backup solution is a single button guiding you through menus and getting the setup done and verified in five minutes . With so much easy-to-use and intuitive Mac and PC software available today , it is next to criminal for the dantz -LRB- TM -RRB- marketing materials to claim ease of use , especially software written for Mac , where the ease-of-use standard is very high . I recommend that people never buy any dantz -LRB- TM -RRB- software product . If the CEO feels otherwise , I 'd like to hear his/her case and I may reconsider . When they call I will only charge two dollars per minute .
 Nobody would give the authors of this software an ease-of-use award . From the outset it behaves as if it were written to please IT specialists and others whose careers depend on things being complicated and incomprehensible to mortals . Even when Retrospect is being directed to do something simple , it is not simple to do because it speaks some alien jargon . It could really serve as a model for bad interface design.It is n't much discussed , but the Mac is really lacking quality tools for backup , file synchronization , and similar critical tasks .
 ` Bought it , and sent it back for a refund . I should have believed all of the negative reviews that Retrospect received -LRB- on the Amazon site -RRB- . I am a skilled personal computer user who has installed and successfully operated a large amount of both software and hardware . However , I was unsuccessful at getting Retrospect to perform properly . My rating of Retrospect is `` Junk '' . Worse yet , I could not find a Help Line telephone number to talk with a real person - that might have made a big difference . They want you to use their website for ALL problem solving . Well think of this
 Loved Retrospect when it first came out . I 've used this version on 3 different computers . Some with freshly formatted source and destination drives . Never completes without errors that render the backup sets unusable . If you buy it make sure you suspect Retrospect first and not waste your valuable 30 days free support working on the drives as I did .
 Retrospect is a terrible software application for the ordinary Mac or Windows user . Both versions are complex and difficult to use , and the interfaces are extremely unintuitive . To make matters worse , EMC will want to charge you $ 69 if you need help with this indecipherable mess . I only hope that the Time Machine backup feature that debuts with Mac 's Leopard version of OS X will finally put this product out of business .
 Do n't buy this product - it just does n't work . I hoped that the other reviewers who had problems were using underpowered computers , but I could n't get it to work on my 3 year old Dell , with 2.4 GHz P4 , and 1MB RAM , which are far beyond the requirements Pinnacle specifies . The captured video was so jerky , it was unwatchable . I emailed Pinnacle 's tech support and got an automatic response that said I would hear from them in 24 hours . I think they meant 24 years , because 4 days later I have n't heard a work . I do n't know what works better - maybe a firewire capture would work .
 this product is terrible ! Does n't help me any to review it after all the time and money down the drain , but I just want to save someone else from making the same mistake . The software has so many bugs in it I ca n't believe that they can get away with marketing this garbage . The hardware does n't work any better . Tech support is non-existent unless you want to pay $ 40 per call -LRB- which I did and still proved to be another waste of money , they ask you questions like ` do you have the movie box plugged in ? ' -RRB- . Do Not waste your money or your time ! This company needs to be put out of business or drastically improve and take their clientele seriously .
 It is impossible to capture old VHS cassettes with this crappy product . It drops frames , makes picture go green sometimes and makes error sounds of its own when there is a worn-out spot on the tape . Definitely NOT recommended .
 I wasted more time trying to get this to work then it was worth . Tech support was marginal at best . If you have the perfect config and are lucky enough to get it to work than you are one of the lucky ones . I would look elsewhere .
 Terrible product from a truly awful company . Do yourself a favor and just do n't enter the world of frustration that is Pinnacle Systems . I hope this company goes out of business soon .
 I was seriously thinking of getting this product , but there are so many bad reviews about Pinnacle products , and especially their customer tech service I have second thoughts . Here I see several bad reviews from all over the country , suddenly followed by a `` great '' professionally sounding review from CA from `` A Reader '' . Pinnacle is located in Mountain View CA . Who do you believe ??
 My system is a 3.2 GHz P4 with 1GB RAM and an 80GB hard drive . First time I used it I could n't capture audio along with video . Upgraded from 9.0 to 9.4.3 which fixed audio problem but I was losing capture after 16 frames . Found patch for just this problem and applied it . In capture settings could not find description of VCR check box option and this cost me an hour trying to figure out why it would n't capture.Finally got capture working and it worked beautifully . Then when went to render movies I kept hitting scenes that `` stuck '' - audio continued but video froze . I would delete the scenes causing the video freeze to get around it . Finally got good quality AVI and MPEG movies from analog camcorder video.Next day I restarted system , started video feed playing and preview screen in Studio shows video and plays audio . I click Capture and the preview goes blank . I 've restarted Studio , unplugged Movie Box Deluxe , tried toggling the settings per Pinnacle 's suggestions but can not now capture video . Nothing has changed on my set up.Can you tell I 'm frustrated ? When it worked it produced high quality video but it 's too flaky to use . Try another product , it ca n't be any worse .
 * THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE REGULAR STUDIO 9 MOVIE BOX USB * The difference between the two seems to be a few more options in the software -LRB- I 'm guessing it 's stuff that Pinncale tries to get you to buy after installing the regular version ! -RRB- Otherwise they are the same.I purchased this THING at Best Buy after getting gift cards from Mother-In-Law and my wife with the explicit directions that I was to get some form of video capture and editing for all the Hi8 videos of our 11 month old daughter . I really wish she had asked me before she did this ... I would have told her to make sure that I can get something for my Mac , not for the PC . Anyway , I got the box home and began to install it . The software took a while but finally loaded and my PC recognized the device . Hooked up the camcorder , made sure all the settings were right -LRB- file storage , file type , etc -RRB- and pressed play on the camcorder . I noticed that the video and audio were very choppy in preview . I wrote it of as processing time . After capture -LRB- loooooooooong time ! -RRB- I checked the file and played it in preview ... audio and video still choppy , @ % * & thing droppd frames ! Grrrr.Tried it again , a little better . Tried to use the software to edit this video I had finally -LRB- after two days for two hours of video -RRB- captured . Crash ! Rre-open software try again , Crash ! Silly me ! I actually thought I would be able to use my software to edit the video that I captured ! What was I thinking !?! Studio 9 would not even recognize the video clips made on my Sony CyberShot . The software insisted that they were in PAL format!I had also tried to use the Dazzle DC80 , same results ! Same waste of time!I returned everything to Best Buy and tried to get them to give me the return amount back on my credit card . Unfortunately because the items were bought on gift cards they could not refund the money to me . Even after explaining that what I needed -LRB- Studio 9 Movie Box DV -LRB- Firewire -RRB- so that I could use my Mac - the better choice for video editing -RRB- So ... I was stuck with the gift carsds . I bought the ADT TV Wonder card last night , first 5 hours of video capture so far are great !
 I was so looking forward to using this software to capture & edit my video tapes , and put them on DVD . The moviebox & software did okay capturing the video . The editing & adding of chapters also went fairly smooth . But no matter how hard I tried I could not get the software to render my finished project to DVD . I checked pinnacle 's online tech support & forums . The only usefull info I could get was I was not the only one having this problem . I decided to return it to the store I purchased it from & take a $ 43.00 bite -LRB- 15 % repackaging fee & shipping back to store -RRB- . I 'm really not too disgruntled , it was a decent product otherwise . I just thought I 'd pass this info along . I 'm now looking into Adobe Premiere Elements & some type of capture device or card . We 'll see . Good luck to you . I know I 'll need it .
 When I first bought this I wanted to transfer my old video tapes to DVD . I have a very powerful Dell PC with plenty of RAM and free memory . At first the biggest problem I had was capturing video . Capturing directly from my VCR did not work well at all . The picture was skipping and the screen was distorted . I gave up on trying to transfer old videos and instead tried to copy programs I had recorded on my DVR directly to DVD . This process worked much better although I found that a huge buzzing sound was captured with the video which I still can not get rid of short of turning the volume on my capture all the way to zero . I burned two DVDs without trouble . Then inexplicably when I tried to create a new project the stupid thing had an error rendering to DVD . I tried everything that Pinnacle support said to do -LRB- which I read from user posts because it has been weeks and Pinnacle Tech support has still not answered my email -RRB- and the project still encountered an error during rendering . This caused many days of frustration as I tried different settings , recaptures , project recreations until finally , one day it decided to render . The DVD turned out pretty well but for some reason , I ca n't burn it nor watch the DVD on my computer . I can watch it on my DVD player and wanted to make a copy for my friend but ca n't . So , I recaptured the video and put it to the same settings that I had it when the project rendered sucessfully . Here we go again . The project encounters and error -LRB- by the way , that is the only info you get , a message saying `` The project has failed to render to DVD . '' -RRB- I have been going through the process again for days . The people who wrote good reviews for it probably had the same experience I had when I first used the product and it worked . However , try running it a few more times and its inconsistency will drive you mad . It amazes me that a program like that can be so blatently bad . One day it might work . Run the same exact project the next day and it wo n't . At first my problem was getting a good video capture , but I long for those days because now it is all about the programs refusal to render the video to DVD . It belongs in the garbage .
 Needed a method to convert some old VHS and digital videos to DVD 's for archival and future family use . This product looked like the solution . I wish . What I found was that the software , at least , and potentially the hardware were not up to the job . First , the software -LRB- with the latest 9.4.x update -RRB- is very poorly documented , and so one struggles to determine how to use the tools , and what thw workflow should be inside the three `` Capture - Edit - Make Movie '' steps that are provided . Second , watching the movie as you edit in the preview window I saw a number of times where the video and audio were repeatedly out of sync by a matter of several seconds . Would this show up on the completed movie ? I ca n't tell you because the rendering software required HOURS to render a 50 minute video . I ca n't tell you how many but I know it would be around 4-5 hours , however in every case the software froze before completing . In one case , it decided after hours of rendering that the video would n't fit the DVD-R media when it had told me the 50 minute length would fit the 80 minutes available on the DVD . Technical help in the package is very weak . I have a fairly decent Dell system with 628 MB of memory , and it runs other significantly strenuous software -LRB- Photoshop , ProShow Gold , etc. -RRB- with no problems . I would have liked to at least gotten one DVD compiled and burned to view the output - that might have provided some motivation for sticking with it , but , I can not recommend this package to anyone , beginner , intermediate or advanced user .
 This is absolutely the worst software purchase I 've ever made . Never have I had such a problem with an internet security program before . The previous edition worked fine , this one endlessly freezes up my computer , I have problems using the Mozilla browser , the list goes on and on . And in order to uninstall it from your system , you have to go on the Symantec website to get the instructions to remove it . One thing is certain , I 'll never try an updated version of this product again .
 They shipped the wrong product I asked for 2000 they sent 2005 which is not compatable with my operating system so Now I ca n't even use the product .
 I had to send back to Symantec . It would not download on my computer as I have Windows ME . I was told the 2005 edition would download on my computer , but it would n't . They are sending me a refund.I appreciate the fast service and the good attitude on the phone , and politeness given to me . They were ready to please the customer.Rita C.Clark
 I have been a Norton software user since 2000 . I switched from the AV to NIS in 2004 . It took me several months to get my computer setup where I was n't having problems . . problems which were sporatically added to support page gradually . Finally got it to work . However , when my subscription runs out in 2006 , I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER SYMANTEC PRODUCT again . It is the worst software for using up resources . I had it on 4 computers and all of them slowed down considerably . I have now switched to using Trend Micro 's PC-Cillin Internet Security and free Adaware , Spybot S&D ; & SpywareBlaster . I am amazed on how much faster those computers run.I have not had any spyware , adware , or viruses using this setup . I also use an on-line virus/firewall scan just for my own satisfaction.I might also mention that uninstalling Norton is not enough . You have to clean out the registry also . Not something for the novice user . I do n't think installing over parts of the old Norton is a good idea as that is where problems occur . I have two friends who installed NIS/antispyware and are now having problems with sending/receiving email thru Outlook Express . Got no help from Norton -LRB- $ $ for phone call -RRB- & Norton says it is n't their problem but the provider or Outlook Express . Nothing like taking your money and then not resolving the problem . That is how they make up for giving it to you `` free '' . If you want it free , there are free antivirus & firewall software on line that are rated very good . If you have doubts , check some of the computer help pages . . see what they think about Norton.Buy it thru Amazon BUT do n't buy Norton !!
 `` Halo ? dis is Shbismeeerischkabob , kahney elp yu ? `` I loved Norton for years and never had to call them before . So what if they had a cash cow ? My computer was fine and it was well worth the 50 bucks a year.Not anymore baby . . You WILL be calling them eventually and the people on the other end are HELPLESS . You barely get through reading them the error code -LRB- because they have to repeat it -RRB- when they -LRB- somehow -RRB- manage to repeat your email address only to send you a ` stock ' fix-it document that MAY work.Eff You Norton!AND GET READY TO PAY 30 BUCKS PER INCIDENT !!!!!!!!!
 Upgrading two Pentium 4 computers from Norton Internet Security 2005 to Norton Internet Security 2005 AntiSpyware Edition resulted in the loss of Internet browsing capabilities on both machines . Suggested solutions on the Symantec web site were of no assistance . These machines had run earlier versions of Norton Internet Security without any problems . E-mail access works but internet browsing , whether through IE or Firefox , is disabled . Turning off Internet Security does not restore browsing capability , the computer must be rebooted with Internet Security disabled in order to browse the Internet.Live technical support is provided only on a charge per call basis .
 I purcashed the new NIS 2005 to replace my older copies of sameit wo n't un-install what it needs to by itself , i was on a help chat for 4 hours , trying to re-configure my computer , constantly re-installing and un-installing . now i have complelty removed all my anti virus and security software . and have nothing but a mess . if the box says it works for windows 2000 it should work without having to find on-line patches and fixs that take up your day and make your computer crash
 I have NIS 2004 . Ever since I installed it , Outlook Express frequently crashes when I boot up . Also , if OE does n't crash on booting up , I have to close it and open it up again , or trying to use the `` copy to '' function of OE will cause it to crash . The Microsoft Online Crash Analysis says these are problems caused by Norton Antispam , which is a component included in NIS . I have Antispam turned off . At the Norton website you have to negotiate a maze of support information which does not include soulutions for these bugs . After long searching I found a well-hidden support e-mail address . -LRB- There is no telephone support without paying a small fortune - even when the software is brand new . -RRB- I emailed a detailed description of my problem to the support person . He replied with a request for more information , almost entirely the same info I had included in my original email . I replied with everything he requested -- and never got a response . I emailed him a couple weeks later and still got no reply . So I 've been living with these problems ever since . One day I 'll get into the registry and see if I can remove Antispam as a start up item , even though it is turned off within NIS . I 've been using Norton products since I had an all DOS computer many years ago . I think their products have always been buggy and resource hogs . But at least they had some modicum of support . Well , that has been dialed back over the years to the point of being , in my opinion , effectively non-existent . . Plan on being on your own if you buy a Norton product .
 After reading many reviews , both postitive and negative , of the Norton Internet Security 2005 Antispyware Edition , I went ahead and purchased it . I have been a Norton user for years , so I decided to take a chance . It installed easily and worked beautifully for almost two months . Then my computer started crashing . After many attempts to find the root of the problem and after much expense , I am convinced , as other reviewers warned , the Norton software is to blame . Now I can not turn off my computer without its crashing ; I am unable to update my antivirus protection because I get a message via the Norton software that it can not make an Internet connection . -LRB- I have followed all directions for correcting this that is found on the Norton website , but nothing works . -RRB- Also , the software really slows down the receiving of email . And forget getting any help from Norton other than what is written on their website . In essence , I have paid a hefty sum for software that causes crashes , causes sluggish performance and worst of all , can not give me up-to-date protection . I feel totally ripped off . So tonight I am going to uninstall Norton -LRB- which from past experience I suppose will involve more than a simple uninstall click -RRB- and try PC-cillin . I would recommend any potential Norton buyers to beware .
 This would be a fantastic product if it did nothog all you resources . I bought it and finallyuninstalled it because it slowed down my systemway to much . If Symantec reads these reviews , which I dought , since this has been a problemfor years , please work on this problem . If theycut resource useage they would probably win backalot of coustomers .
 I 've used Norton for many , many years and have always sworn by it as the best anti-virus protection available on the market . With the 2003 version , I switched to Norton Internet Security and loved it . It 's always worked perfectly , and I 've bought a new year of definitions each year . I planned to update my NIS 2003 version again this year when it expired , but about a month before the expiration , I got an offer from Symantec to buy the NIS 2005 Antispam version for a low price . I decided to go ahead and upgrade from 2003 to 2005 at the low price.Last weekend my subscription to NIS 2003 expired , so instead of re-subscribing , I instead downloaded and installed the NIS 2005 version . That 's when the problems started . After downloading and installing , I updated the virus definitions . This went fine , and I thought I was through with it . A while later I went into the NIS program and when I opened it up , only part of the screen appeared -- the border , without the middle with all the buttons to click . It did this everytime I opened the program , so I decided to reinstall the program . After restalling and updating the definitions , again I thought I was through.Little did I know my troubles were just starting . After installing the NIS 2005 , I could no longer go onto the internet . My computer also started freezing up . I had to restart it numerous times and as I tried to troubleshoot it . After about an hour , I just said to myself let my computer work long enough before freezing up so I could uninstall NIS 2005 . After a while , I was able to do that.Once I uninstalled NIS 2005 , I again assumed I was back to business . I would just look for another anti-virus and firewall program . But no , I could not go on the internet . I checked my wireless connections and found the IP addresses for my network were all screwed up . I worked on it for hours , checking and rechecking my network connections . I reinstalled my wireless card . I tried another wireless card . Nothing worked , after a whole day of working on it . Finally I had to admit that NIS 2005 had completely hosed my computer and my network connection.So after many wasted hours , and many more curses at Symantec for its product , I had to use Windows XP System Restore to roll my computer back to how it existed prior to the NIS fiasco . I decided to use the free McAfee anti-virus and firewall available to me from AOL . However , McAfee could n't install because it detected an existing anti-virus program on my computer , even though I had deleted Norton NIS 2005 . I had to go to the Symantec website and download 3 different programs , and run them , along with deleting various files and registry entries , in order to finally get rid of all the various pieces of NIS 2005 and my prior NIS 2003 . So after being a good Norton customer for many years , I 've now gone to the other side of another good customer who has now been hosed by Norton software that screwed up my computer and internet connection ! I hate to say it , but now I 'll never be a Norton customer again , and can not recommend the program to anybody . The risks are n't worth it.Raleigh1208
 Norton Internet Security 2005 will completely take over your system processing time bringing your computer to its knees !! . NIS will protect your PC , but it will also convert a P4 2.66 GHz with 768MB RAM in to a lethargic computer . For NIS to run it uses more than 21 processes that take almost 40MB of your valuable system RAM , it is absurd.Worst of all , try to access their inexistent support ... you do n't have the right for even one call . They only take calls from corporate customers/products . Go for some other product , RUN AWAY ! do n't use this one ! . I did not followed others reviews , what a big mistake !!
 -LRB- . , . . -RRB- I have used Norton AntiVirus for many years , and thought I would dutifully upgrade . After many hours of struggling , hitting about 1/2 of the first two depth levels of installation problems for WinXP in their online installation help pages , I gave up . I read the little installation guide , I did what it asked , and I got nothing for my money . And my operating system had to be re-installed in the end.NIS 2004 was installed , but had to be removed ... manually after the `` removal of -LSB- co-branded product -RSB- '' failed . I did NOT appreciate having to manually hack my registry as they recommend at one point , nor to download and run an MS windows installation repair tool to clean up all the Norton install failure garbage , nor to have to install a Verisign cert into my Internet Explorer -LRB- required for downloaded ActiveX automated installation assistant , netscape not allowed -RRB- so that another piece of their software can start running on my computer . Get real ! They should be paying us to debug their installation software ! NIS 2005-ase did not install for me , and my OS was left trashed.Thanks to Amazon , though , for a prompt friendly refund of my unopened second NIS package.Addendum
 I have uninstalled this software , which came on my new Dell Computer . The problem with the firewall is that it is heavy handed and blocks many things that it should n't . For example , Musicmatch super-tagging ca n't connect -LRB- and I certainly tried to configure NIS to allow Musicmatch to connect -RRB- ; blogger.com 's click-to-edit function vanished ; Diskeeper 9 could not install ; and so on . Once I went back to Windows XP firewall , all these functions resumed working . I went to Webroot 's Spy Sweeper 4.0 , and it immediately found 6 spyware cookies that NIS had allowed . I tried turning off the anti-spam function because I use the uncannily accurate Cloudmark -LRB- www.cloudmark.com -RRB- , but the Norton anti-spam toolbar kept returning every time I restarted Outlook . I tried to get on-line help from Symantec , but it was useless . I would avoid this product totally .
 I have used Norton Utilities programs for years and had upgraded to Internet Security 2005 a few months before this came on the market . When a scan alerted me that my computer was n't fully protected because my version lacked spyware detection , of course I upgraded immediately . My computer has n't worked properly since . My email started filling up with spam , the computer started losing internet connections , reading errors , and slowing way down . I kept checking Norton 's status and running scans and updates , but to no avail . I tried online diagnostics , online help suggestions and finally live online help , but no one even understood what I was talking about . `` If everything has a green check mark then it 's working fine - do n't worry about a thing . '' Except that it was n't working at all . I finally purchased MacAfee last week and it immediately detected 3 viruses and a Trojan horse that the `` working perfectly '' Norton had n't . Symantec ca n't explain themselves and is giving me the runaround on a refund , so I 'll never trust them again .
 After installing this product yesterday , having my computer repeatedly crash whenever outlook is open , calling long distance and speaking to someone who does not know English , and learning that it will take 6 to 8 weeks to get a refund from Symantec directly after I pay to send everything back to them-I want to warn everyone not to get this product . I have had norton antivirus 2003 and it worked great . My subscription ran out , I decided to upgrade and caused myself nothing but trouble !! If you do n't use Microsoft Outlook for e-mail , you might not have problems , but literally my computer continuously freezes when retrieving e-mail . I had `` i-hate-spam '' and `` i-hate-pop-ups '' and I highly recommend that product along with a virus program , maybe AVG . I read the negative reviews and ignored them because of previous positive experiences with Norton . This product is BAD !! Do n't ignore the warnings !!
 - NIS 2005 is not smart enough to install over and earlier version of internet security - NIS 2004 -LRB- yes , 2004 -RRB- was not uninstalling itself completely -LRB- it still kept it 's CD deep in the registry -RRB- and I followed all uninstalltion steps , including Windows Utility cleanup - NIS 2005 is not smart enough to remove any REMAINING old components of earlier versions of internet security - NIS 2005 , now confused with 2 CD-keys deep in the resgistry , will no longer go beyond the install link on the setup diskIn other words , NIS 2005 is by far the dumbest program as far as installation and uninstalltion goes . When a user tells the computer to install/uninstall , is needs to do exactly that , and no other bullshlock . But for some ineptitude reason , Norton just has to be an ass.It gets worse . Because the spyware edition would now , no longer even attempt to install , I decided to reinstall NIS 2004 . According to the installation process , everything installed fine . Yeah right ! It did not even re-ask me for the CD-key , that 's why I knew it was still embedded in my system !! After I opened up NIS 2004 for the first time -LRB- after reinstallation do to failure of NIS 2005 -RRB- , two major problems occurred
 I am a long-time fan of Norton , and have used it for many , many years . Hence my extreme disappointment that when I installed this Spyware version as an upgrade to NIS 2004 , it refused to do a System Scan , or to scan my incoming or outgoing email.I spent a full day with their tech reps , priority/work job # 23218850 , who were completely unable to solve the problem
 Shortly after I purchased this product I found out that it can be downloaded free from Microsoft . My loss should be your gain . please do n't make my mistake . the downloaded product is identical with the exception that no license is required to use it .
 I am supposed to use this product to update the web pages monthly for a non-profit organization . After exploring the menus and the manual , I still do n't know how and where to start . I usually can figure out in a short time how to use new software however complicated , such as QuarkExpress , InDesign , PageMaker , FrameMaker , Illustrator , Dream Weaver , Front Page , etc. , by exploring the menus and the samples with the help of its manual .
 Purchased the product a month ago via Amazon from a third party supplier and it is yet to be delivered . Amazon should review some of their partnerships as I purchased a laptop at the same time directly from Amazon and I received it almost 3 weeks ago .
 I would like to say I could give a review , but I never recieved the product from Swallowtrip . It would have been nice to know how they were sending the product or have some tracking info . I waited for a month and never recieved the product . The only way to contact Swallowtrip it by emailing through Amazon . I got one response from them and I sent them 3 other emails with no response . I do n't recommend buying through Swallowtrip . Fortunately , Amazon took care of the refund .
 TO ; Amazonseller15@yahoo.comI emailed you last night concerning my purchase . On closer examination after checking my Amazon purchase recent I noticed that the software you sent was not what I ordered . My order was for the Small Business Full Version 2007 whereas the one you sent was a scaled down version Office Professional . I feel like I 'm being scammed here . I expect you to rectify this . I did open the software and install it thinking it be the one I ordered . In spite of this due to the wrong being shipped I expect a full refund or the correct software mailed to me . MR . Monkiewicz
 What can anybody say about software for which there is no choice but to buy ? Ca n't do without it - had to buy it . Therefore I think the deal could be better .
 Microsoft Office 2007 is really bad . It has lost functionality . Programs that worked simplyMicrosoft Office Small Business 2007 FULL VERSIONnow hide all the basics that we use all the time.Outlook should be renamed LookOut!Programs really are not seemless . Word and Outlook should be under one source.I hate it ! My wife went back to the old version and I am thinking of doing the same.What was Bill Gates thinking ??
 I have been using a trial version of Office 2007 and it has been nothing but difficult and frustrating . I am an advanced user of Excel and PPT , however in this version I feel like a beginner - as if I 've hardly ever used Office products before . The use of the ribbon instead of the drop down menu completely changes the entire user experience and I will definitely not be buying ' 07 . I recommend going to the MS site and downloading a free trial of '07 prior to purchasing - I really had no idea how different the interface would be and I 'm glad I only have a trial version and can easily get rid of it .
 I believe the next time Microsoft makes a new version of the Microsoft Office Suite , perhaps they should go back to DOS . I have never had the displeasure that I have now since purchasing this software suite . Imagine everything you know about Microsoft Office being stripped away and being replaced with a new program that has the same exact functionality -LRB- nothing new what so ever -RRB- , only every button , check box , function , and flexibility being stripped away . What you are imagining now is the new 2007 version . If you buy this program , the moment you start it for the first time , you will realize you made a mistake . Go back to 2003 .
 I ca n't review a product that I never got . I bought Office 2007 and received Office 2002 . No response after two attempts to try to get seller to correct the sale . Fraud !
 I ordered what I thought was a new Microsoft office 2007 - Full Version . I received an envelope with a copy of a disk in it with a Microsoft authorization key . I do n't believe it is a legal copy . I asked for a refund and return instructions . I emailed my request to the seller and was asked `` Huh , who are you ? '' . Included in the email was the amazon order number .
 Sorry Microsoft , but your `` ribbon '' user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever . It renders all your Office applications useless . I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again -LRB- I 'm not even sure if it 's even possible to customize the `` ribbon '' -RRB- . The ribbon is ugly and WAY , WAY , WAY , WAY too big.My advice
 I was under the impression I was to receive a full version of Office Prof 2000 instead I got a key number that has to be used with a new computer that is not over 90 days old . I have an old Windows vista that had the trial verson but the computer was purchased at Sam 's as the display so it was over 90 days old . I spent right at 200 dollars on a key number I can not use . I have emailed the company and I have not gotten a response as yet 5 weeks now . My husband bought a laptop 6 months ago but never tried to use the office and I tried to use the key on it with no luck so I guess I am out 200 dollars that sucks . The company needs to say it is for OEM -LRB- new computers -RRB- before they sell it to people that do not know what OEM means .
 Office 2007 is designed to make things easier , but it just kills your productivity . I spend more time hunting for features I knew how to use in previous versions or trouble-shooting bugs on features that were incompletely tested in the rush to market . I do n't want to watch the MS tutorials or look at all the MS cross references to find out how to do something , I 've been doing for 15 years . Software is supposed to automate processes and make tasks easier -- Office 2007 really missed the boat . I did figure out how to add the commands I use a lot to the Quick Access Toolbar and if you right-click on some things , familiar windows and menus pop up ... but it now takes multiple clicks to do something you used to do with one click.I had downloaded the 60-day Trial Version and hated it and was actually going to try to find an Office 2003 version , which is compatible with Windows 7 , to load on my new laptop . However , the older versions were about the same price as 2007 and I thought I might be forced to upgrade in the near future ... just to stay compatible ... and did n't want to pay another hefty license fee again . I only bought 2007 , because it came with a free option to download the 2010 version for free-which I 'm hoping will be an improvemnt to 2007 . Stay with Office 2003 -LRB- or even older versions -RRB- until you have to upgrade .
 Amazing that a company would release a 2007 version of their product with less functionality than the 2000 version , but Microsoft did.And what 's with the Ribbons crap . You want me to send all of my employees to a training class because you decided to file all the commands in new locations.You disabled hot-keys - that 's insane.Thank goodness we saved the Office 2000 Disc.For a few applications we are using Google docs.I see a huge opportunity to replace Microsoft office.Monopoly today - gone tomorrow !
 The new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use . It may be for some new users but for experienced users , it is n't . This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform . This is not due to the learning curve , it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works . Once you are familiar with the program , nothing is faster than the old menu structure . If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons , it would be the best of both worlds , satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users . The new version does not run macros as fast however . My recommedation for existing users
 I 'm an expert user of version 2003 . Our work computers are now v2007 . So far , there are at least 4 things that I used to use/do on a daily basis that are not available in 2007 -LRB- e.g. , no drawing or tables tool bars -RRB- making my job infinitely more difficult and slower . I learn quickly , but this program is not intuitive when changing from 2003 . For example , why would `` page break '' be on one ribbon and all the rest -LRB- e.g. , the variety of section breaks -RRB- somewhere else . The whole list of choices is there somewhere -LRB- I found it once -RRB- , but finding it takes way too much time . When I am in a time crunch -LRB- typically -RRB- I take my work home to use my 2003 . Why is n't there at least an option for the old style menu so those of us who used to be experts could get up to speed more easily . I 've been using 2007 for about 6 weeks now and have been acutely wary of the change over phenomenon that creates resistence to using something new . I 've really tried . I 've used several kinds of external programs designed to help find things -LRB- including the 2007 help menu -RRB- . This helps occassionally , but I often get the answer that this function is no longer available in the 2007 version . I 'm thinking I need to bring my own computer to work to get something done . Avoid 2007 if you can .
 After all these years , the trolls in Redmond still have not learned how to produce user-friendly software . There was no reason to make the changes to Office that they 've made ; it was simply a way to justify an unnecessary upgrade that has turned out to be a downgrade . Users with a moderate understanding of how Office operated will find themselves flummoxed when attempting to do things they had finally learned how to do in the old version.The much-vaunted ribbons are confusing and counter-intuitive . Microsoft addresses this problem by offering free self-paced trainng courses , apparently oblivious to the fact that time iS money , unless of course , it 's Microsoft 's time.At the very least , one expects backward compatibility , that is unless you 're dealing with Mr. Bill 's minions . I loaded Word files created with Office XP , only to find the Office 2007 converted them with serious defects , like inserting tabs in all paragraphs whenever you inserted one in a single paragraph . And , of course , if you delete a tab stop from one paragraph , you delete it from all of them.Useless .
 I am a long time and heavy MS Office user . I have a 2-year old computer with 1-gig of ram . My operating system is XP . I installed Office Small Business 2007 and found it running very slow even after doing all updates . I have uninstalled the program and gone back to Office 2000 . Ahh , what a relief!A key problem for me was if I had 2 different Word documents open or a Word and Excel document open and I wanted to switch back and forth between them -- I 'd get an hourglass for 30 seconds or more ! With Office 2000 there is no delay at all . Also , having to `` Save As '' a version that I can email to others just seems dumb . Extra steps in my work day are not wanted ; - -RRB- There are many features such as using Autosum , Spell Check or Insert which require extra clicks to get to in 2007 as well . Things are arranged in tabs so you have to click on the Format tab then click Auto Sum . Later if you want to do something else you have to find that tab and then click on the feature you want.Other issues ; the programs take quite a while to open initially , I color areas in spread sheets a lot . In 2000 I can pull the pallet down and access any color in 1 click . 2007 does not allow this -LRB- so at least 2 clicks are needed -RRB- and there are less colors available -LRB- unless you perform 3 clicks to get to get to the expanded pallet -RRB- .
 Vista has a twin , and its name is Office 2007 . And I 'm embarrassed to admit I failed to do the research I should have done , and typically thoroughly do before buying anything . Yes , it got me . I was lulled by thoughts of , `` I know Windows and Office applications like the back of my hand -- how different could it possibly be ? '' And why should n't I think that given the compatibility and cohesion of past Office versions ? Like many I 'm sure , even with new or updated MS products I 've pretty much always been able to , at the very * least * , intuit and immediately execute core commands -- read
 If you are a serious user of reference books and you intend to buy multimedia encyclopedia because of its text content and not multimedia features such as videos and animations , you might be interested in this brief comparison between Microsoft Encarta and Encyclopaedia Britannica -LRB- in both cases I 've been trying 2002 Standard Edition -RRB- . Some of the Encarta 's plusesCharacters displayEncarta displays practically all foreign characters correct -LRB- e.g. Slovenian and Czech c with a circumflex , other Central European characters , Portuguese a and Spanish n with a tilde , French e with a grave accent , etc. -RRB- while Britannica does n't . Two concrete examples
 I bought this program to make a website and it has been a big disappointment !!! After I click on something -LRB- to move , or edit , or whatever -RRB- I ususally have to wait about 10-15 seconds for whatever I clicked to highlight so I can work with it -- It 's terribly slow and makes working a drag . What 's even more horrible is that it repeatedly freezes up and crashes my computer ... I 'm lucky if I can work in 5 minute incriments before having the program freeze up . Unfortunately , the book that comes with the software is nothing but a book of clip art images ... It has no troubleshooting . If you want to call Microsoft for help , it gives you a Toll charge number . It also gives an 800 number in which you are charged `` a fee '' . What awful service !! And beware too -- stores wo n't take back opened software packages due to copyright laws and such . So I 'm stuck with this awful dud !! A total waste of money.PS -- The web templates they include in the package are very amateurish and a real disappointment too . If you 're looking to get a good web-building program , I have used Microsoft 's professional publishing program , Publisher 2000 , before and was really impressed . I wish I would have bought that , even though it is ... more expensive than Picture It!Publishing Platinum . The only good thing I can say about Picture It ! Publishing Platinum is that the clip art collection is amazingly good . Other than that ... . thumbs down !
 Was upset to see all the bad reviews after buying in the store . Anyways , decided to install the program right away and test it out to make sure all was working well . GladI looked at the other reviews . Turns out I can not even get the program to run on my computer , something is very wrong with it . Even uninstalled & reinstalled to make sure.As the other reviewers stated , Microsoft is no help and has absolutely no customer support for this product . IT 's going back to the store ...
 Bought this program because I had home publishing 99 and liked it a lot . Program takes up almost 3 gigs -LRB- ! -RRB- with full install . If you want , you can do the minimum install -LRB- 700 megs -RRB- and spend your day swapping the 5 cd 's . Program is very slow to respond ; 5-10 second delays after every click -LRB- Pentium 4 3 gig , 250 meg harddrive , gforce4 ti4600 -RRB- . Program also crashes quit frequently . But , the most annoying thing is the advertisements for scanners , digital cameras , books , etc that take up the left third of the screen . In addition , there is no way to turn them off . Called Microsoft tech support and was informed that the advertisements are hard-coded into the program . The tech suggested I purchase a bigger monitor -LRB- LCD - expensive -RRB- or that I disconnect my broadband internet connection -LRB- not ! -RRB- . That 's when I asked for an RMA number . Sent it back yesterday after 6 hours of frustration .
 I have used an older edition for some years and just loved it . Thought it would be good to upgrade with my new XP operating system.I paid for this program at least twice with all the tech calls I made trying to get it to stop crashing not just the program but more seriously the system as well . After my 5th call to Oregon , and an hour or more on the phone , still crashs the system . It is now toast as far as I am concerned . Reinstalled my old program and it works fine . Keep your money .
 I have had this program and used it for a couple months now . It is absolutely awful ! I have Picture it 2001 and loved it . Somebody broke one of my discs and I am unable to use it so I figured I 'll just upgrade . This program does crash way to much . Try every project I have ever worked on . Picture quality is not there . Very little templates compared to 2001 version . It is a very sad product .
 The packages says there is a 30 day money back guarantee . The thing is , stores wo n't take it back , so you have to figure out where to send it to . The time involved , cost for packing and posting are not worth the effort . So , do n't even think about taking the box off the shelf!I bought this porgram to catch two birds with one stone - I wanted to create flyers and manipulate my digital photos . There are better packages out there for the latter . Even Kodak 's standard software that come with EasyShare cameras delivers 10 times better results . As to the flyers , the few provided templates are lousy . If you want to change them , the software starts to act strangely
 I found this program easy to use to create my documents , especially to incorporate digital pictures , but have difficulty printing . The file sizes are huge and the program itself takes up a lot of memory . I have tried printing at kinkos and several other printshops , all unsuccessfully . I will go back to microsoft publisher .
 I feel lucky if I can run the program for 15 minutes without it locking up on my XP machine . I bought it for the feature of being able to do things like a newsletter , and save it as a webpage , which works slick . But , the program hangs a lot , runs slow , and behaves strangely . One example , I added a 2nd page to my newsletter project , but it would not allow me to add anything -LRB- not even a text box -RRB- to the 2nd page . Not worth the money at all .
 I purchased this software thinking it might have a few more graphics than the 2002 edition which I used all the time . Install was a nightmare . It kept telling me to uninstall 2002 and yet XP would n't let me -LRB- P VI - XP Home -RRB- . Finally my geek used a work-around to install it . Once I got it up and running it placed little green squares wherever a graphic was supposed to be . I finally called Microsoft and they knew of the problem but informed me that `` there is no fix for that . '' I asked when they thought there might be a fix available . `` Never . '' Why would you release software with a major problem such as described and never provide a fix for it ? I returned it and got my money back . Only problem is I can not find a replacement program that I like as well as PIP 2002 -LRB- and that was uninstalled -RRB- . Bottom line
 Installed OK on XP/Home and have tried every conceivable way to simply open a JPG file on a LAN based server . Twenty minutes later , all I see is the hour-glass cursor -- not even a file dialog box.This product is going back to the store .
 Do n't buy it . It does n't even crop well . This program is impossible to use . It takes me forever to fix a simple thing from a picture , even croping out parts of a picture is nearly impossible . THe program has features such as edge finder and color edge finder but it 's just impossible to use . Buy Adobe Photoshop instead . For nearly the same price , it 's so much better .
 Although this package comes with several disks of print templates and a large , searchable list of clip art , it is not worth the money -LRB- even with rebates -RRB- . It does not work reliably on the two machines I 've tried it on . Both machines had all of the prerequisite software installed and working -LRB- Internet Explorer 6 and Outlook Express 6 -RRB- before installing PIP Platinum AE.It still crashes and freezes way too often . I 've learned to save every time I make even a minor edit knowing that I WILL have to restart the program and/or the computer . In addtion , all of the graphics included in the many greeting card templates -LRB- birthday , Mother 's Day , etc -RRB- are blurry and look amateurish when printed.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a print package .
 First used on Win 98 ... locked up constantly , then tried XP , runs agonizingly slow . The `` Help '' is not so helpful , basically it is a terrible package . Wish I had checked the reviews first .
 This program has been a big disappointment to me . I have Picture It 99 , and it is great . But I thought an upgrade would be good . I want to work with my digital pictures , including the ones that are already stored in the Picture It 99 program . But I ca n't find out how to move those picture over to the new program . And in Picture It 99 , I can put in one word for a Search , such as `` Mexico '' and it will bring up every file with that name in it . I ca n't find out how to do this with the new program . Every thing I have tried to do has been a failure , and the built-in Help does n't help , as evidently I ca n't find the desired capabilities because this program has LESS features than the previous one.I believe it does have some new features such as Illusions that might do great things with pictures , but I ca n't bring up my pictures to use the new stuff . So again it is a disappointment .

 This software stopped my Encarta Reference Suite 2001 from working and it automatically installs Internet Explorer ver . 6 which made it impossible for me to download images on AOL . I would prefer software that does n't affect other software that is already installed on the computer .

 With so many versions and variety it is hard tom make purchasing decisons . THe product information is not much help in deciding between need for UPGRADE version , full verion , box with product key etc. . I am not buying because I cant figure out what I need to buy and the differences between the version products .
 Microsoft Publisher 2007 Version UpgradeI purchased this upgrade expecting some new tools and better templates but I was disappointed . Not much new in my opionion . I like the older versions better . As Publisher gets upgraded over the years it does n't change enough to make the purchase of the upgraded program worth it . Save your money .
 I ordered Microsoft Home and Student 2007 . When I recevied it and tried to use it it would not work . In looking at some of the files I found that this Copy was no longer valid after October 26 , 2009 . I could never even get up the screen to put in the registeration key . I needed this software very badly to prepare resumes because I am unemployed . Now I do n't have what I need and will have to wait for my refund before I can purchase a valid copy . Please be very careful of any software you purchase from this seller.Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007
 Do n't buy this upgrade ! It is cumbersome and not at all user friendly . On top of that ... the website portion DOES NOT WORK . It does not `` upload '' to your website . After much frustration trying to update my website with this software ... I went back to Publisher 2000 and everything worked FINE using the old version . The old version is so much easier to use . This upgrade is definitely not worth getting . The changes made make the product HARDER to use . . not easier . It 's a stinker .
 I had the required software for an update -LRB- according to the update software -RRB- . I had/have MS office Pro 2003 with publisher 2003 and the software would not load . I got a message of `` can not file a file '' and the install set-up would stop and exit.Piece of crap !!! Lucky the seller was willing to give me my money back .
 I have used other versions of M.S. Publisher , what I can not fathom , is why this driving need by people to `` fix '' that which is not broken and in the process make a complete mess of a great product . Publisher is a great example of what Microsoft does to so many of it 's base programs . They have taken a product which had wonderful capabilities , then gave it to a team of people who DO NOT USE IT ON A DAILY basis and told them to `` fix '' it.And `` fix '' it they did , each time an upgrade now is released from Microsoft you can rest assured that everyone involved did not have the end user in mind when they began to change the program.I do not need to go into what is wrong with this upgrade nor the new publisher which has been released . Everyone who uses it knows what is wrong with it . Microsoft would do well to quit trying to repair that which is not broken and try a new approach and ask end users what they would like to see added to enhance a product , not take away from a product or change in such a way that you can no longer rely on the product.Personally after putting up with years of Microsoft changing every program which I enjoyed using , thinking things were going to get better , only to discover that they did not . I went back to Mac . At least now , I know that I can rely on the changes to work with the previous programs.Yes I still keep a PC in the office as the rest of the world has not yet changed , but Microsoft is the best reason for people to change systems . And that is truly a great shame as years ago , you could rely on Windows to work , the biggest problem was security which they have never bothered to fix , repair or secure.As always this is but one man 's opinion , no matter how right I choose to believe I am at the moment I write this .
 It 's you basic email program , it does absolutely nothing special , except cost a fortune . Try the free program Thunderbird , it is made by the same folks who make the web browser Firefox . Works very well and its free . Excellent interface
 Before you buy this product you need to know that most of the new good features that Outlook 2007 contains , do not work without the rest of Office 2007 . The new features specifically are not supported by Office 2003 , so Outlook 2007 is pretty much a downgrade from Outlook 2003 unless you buy Office 2007 as well . I hope I can return the product and reinstall Outlook 2003 .
 Well , i had high hopes for this product , but once again Microsoft ca n't program themselves out of a paper bag . Same problems as with older versions , use this program to sync to my Verizon Pocket PC for the Calendar feature , but it takes 4-5 tries to get Outlook and Vista to work together to even see my phone , let alone the 4-5 times it takes to get everything to sync into my phone ... Went back to Mozilla -LRB- from Firefox -RRB- as my workhorse e-mail gatherer ... I just wish Microsoft would get off their `` high-horse , '' admit they have messed up since the first incursion of Windows and re-write the OS so that it can run correctly . If the door is broken and does n't open right or ca n't locked , painting it a bright color and putting a new doorbell on wo n't help !!!! And Microsoft still wonders why you need virus / security suite protection , when Apple 's stuff does not need it ... . oh well , `` if it 's broke do n't fix it '' is a big neon sign in Seattle , WA inside Microsoft headquarters ...
 What a disappointment . I have a dual-core , 2GHz processor , 2GBytes of RAM , and Outlook 2007 on Vista is too slow to use . When I try to compose an email , the busy cursor is almost only on . When it goes out , all that I have to do to bring it back is enter a single key stroke . It can not begin to keep up with my typing , and editing a typo is impossible.I 've turned off as much of the indexing , as many of the widgets as I can , disabled all the RSS feeds , etc. , but no joy.At this point , I 'm hoping a service pack will fix my problem , but I am not a happy camper .
 This is the most unstable software I have ever used . It has crashed at least 50 times this weekend , as I ca n't even keep it open long enough to fix it . Google `` Outlook 2007 crashes '' and you 'll see I 'm far from alone . If you can get it running , it 's apparently the slowest email client ever . Yeah , Google `` Outlook 2007 slow '' , too .
 Microsoft obviously has no problem releasing products that do n't work the way they should . When I first bought Outlook 2007 I could not even perform a simple transfer of `` emails '' or `` email contacts '' from the previous version to the new one . It was unreal as it actually took MONTHS for the new version to update itself to the point where I could FINALLY perform those simple tasks.The worse part about Outlook 2007 is that it is unreliable . Even after 2 + years , the program is always shutting down on it 's own ; and then every time it restarts itself , you have to reset the window pane view to your preference , just another annoying procedure to put up with.While Microsoft is always constantly reminding me with endless , annoying warning that I do n't need . Microsoft does the unthinkable in Outlook 2007 in that you can accidentally delete your all-important `` Contacts '' WITHOUT ever knowing it and if you do n't realize or catch it , THEY ARE GONE ! All you have to do is accidentally hit the wrong key while your contact list is open and you will find out ! How could Microsoft overlook something so important ?! It 's the little flaws that end up being so annoying that take the fun out of using the program . For example , The `` auto fill '' drop down -LRB- when entering a persons email -RRB- is always inconsistent . Sometimes it works , sometimes it does not . Basically the program does what IT wants to do , not what YOU want it to do.UPDATE 2011 , I grew to like this program as many of the kinks were eventually worked out , but the program still fails miserably for the mere fact that Microsoft released when they did with little regard to the hell it put me through for the first 1-2 years since the program was not even close to being fully functionalIt only took a few months and a little luck that I happened to come across a hint that you can enter a contacts `` birthday '' and or `` anniversary date '' that will show on the calendar . While you might think this should be intuitively simple to figure out , there 's a little trick . Of course they could have made it easier , but they obviously did n't want to do that.There is really nothing smooth or intuitive about Outlook 2007 , like so many other Microsoft products you can spend hours trying to figure out just the very basics . Of course if it was an iPhone , you would probably be able to figure things out on your own with simple common sense , but not with Microsoft products . Overall it 's a frustrating program , while there are times that I have liked it , the whole experience of learning this contraption has been draining over the past few years . It 's a shame there is n't more competition for Microsoft as nothing ever seems simple with their products . The bottom line is that if the program does n't work properly , then it probably should not be released to the public .
 Prior to August 31 , 2009 Outlook 2007 was a useful and versatile tool for managing contacts , schedules , Email etc. . However , if you are an -LSB- ... -RSB- user and are considering buying Outlook 2007 to expand your Office or Email capabilities I HIGHLY recommend saving your money , or changing from MSN to another ISP before purchasing this product . Microsoft changed it 's MSN servers effective Sept. 1 , 2009 which caused many issues effectively negating many of the reasons why you would use Outlook , and are literally not supporting the problems caused to Outlook by their server changes . They 're only response is to download Outlook Connector which will enable you to `` use '' Outlook 2007 & 2010 but it will not resolve the issues with synchronizing Outlook with your MSN mailbox etc. . They want to force you to use Windows Live ! web based mail services which effectively removes the need or usefullness of Outlook . I , as many others have been trying in vein to get resolutions from Microsoft , but they are not addressing the issues , and refuse to comment or acknowledge there even are issues . If you have n't purchased Outlook and are on MSN for your ISP and Email services , do n't waste your money . Wait to see if Outlook 2010 resolves the issues , or change your ISP before buying Outlook 2007 . Otherwise , you 're just burning $ 100 for nothing . Believe me , you will spend hours and hours of time on hold at Microsoft 's Tech Support phone support , or waste countless hours researching their support `` solutions '' only to find there is no solution as of this date -LRB- Feb. 24 , 2010 -RRB- , and that nobody at Microsoft will acknowledge the isssues , much less offer any workable resolution that will fully recover all the features you 're buying Outlook for . If you 're going to use this in an office environment with an Exchange Server , and have an IT staff and internal support system , then you will be fine . Home or individual users however , have been virtually swept under the rug at this point.Update July 2011
 This was purchased primarily for the calendar function and address book . It is slow , requires more key strokes and requires that my Dell Inspiron 1100 have additional RAM . It will not do certain functions necessary to preserve an accurate record of appointments when the appt . is recurring and I want to edit one or more of the series . It restores all previous edits to the original series status , deleting any individual appt . edits . It also deletes records older than six months according to what colleagues have said . BUT , it has n't locked up my PC like the very user friendly Palm OS did , resulting in whole days worth of lost scheduling .
 You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have .15 years of Outlook and you ca n't print a single address label or an envelope with one click . -LRB- or 10 clicks for that matter -RRB- There is no function to easily print out mailing labels either.Lets remember Outlook is a Contact manager ... next to many other things ... Maybe Outlook 2010 will be the answer .
 I have used outlook for years because I like its potential . However , it is the hardest software to set up I have ever experienced . The is no live person or chat support to assist one in setting up e-mail . Neither Quest or Bresnan support Outlook . Why not ? Your software is supposed to save me time and make me more productive . All it has so far done is take up my time and cost me money .
 This is a good product if you are familiar with current word procedures and functions.No handbook or instructions are included and would have to be purchased separately . I had not used word since 95 , and had a very hard time figuring out what was needed to be done to make the type of document I wanted.I was disappointed , and still learning . Templates that are user created are available on line , which can be a security risk , and for my needs none were available .
 I purchased this product without giving much thought as to what I was buying . I was wanting Microsoft office 2007 and I did not know that outlook was sold as a stand alone . I could have purchased office 2007 which includes outlook for the same price . I am now stuck with a product which I have no use . I have no one to blame but myself , so fair warning to anyone who might find them self looking for Microsoft office .
 I have so many problems with this specific Microsoft product but what am I going to do , they have the market on email applications .
 With Outlook 2007 Microsoft went backwards in a fundamental concept of Windows by moving and relabeling icons in an application that has been around for a long time . For me , this means re-learning where Microsoft has moved/hidden everyday buttons like `` Print '' . For my 80-year old parents this has brought their usage to a standstill . Windows brought a standardized GUI - consistent standard icons in consistent application locations - that changed the world . The Office 2007 apps have apparently lost that compass . Unfortunately , if you 're on a PC , you do n't have an alternative ... except maybe to start looking at OpenOffice . Does n't help my parents .
 For those considering Outlook 2007 , beware of my experience
 I was mistaken . I bought and installed Office Student Home edition on my 2 new Windows 7 computers . I decided I would still like Outlook for e-mail so I spent the money and bought this software . Well guess what . Since it was not purchased in a bundle , some of the features are n't functional . You ca n't use themes or stationery . Word will not be the text editor for e-mail . Spell check will not work without connectivity to Word . I am sure there are other missing features I have n't discovered yet . Microsoft knows all about this yet they did not make it plain enough for me . I am very frustrated with MS for this shoddy system . I bought 3 new computers for home and church in the last 2 months . If I knew how , I would rip Office out of all of them and send it back but what can I do now ? BE WARNED . Oh for the old days when Office came with everything.Randy Rusconi
 I purchased Outlook 2007 because Microsoft has now chosen to exclude it from certain versions of Office 2007 . Well , it has way less features than my previous Outlook : - no animated GIF 's - no support for Outlook Personal Address Book -LRB- PAB -RRB- - the Outlook Text Editor has been eliminatedAnd now I find that if you purchase this ` stand alone ' version of Outlook 2007 the ` Themes and Stationary ' feature is disabled . It only works in those versions of Outlook 2007 that are bundled with the Office Suite , not this version!This is NOT AN UPGRADE , it 's a DOWNGRADE !
 I bought 2007 Outlook , including Business Manager , hoping to finally have an Outlook that could manage Tasks Better and do customized reporting.It has been a Horror . I am running this on a fast PC with tons of memory and harddrives ... Switching Views -LRB- where it builds a view -RRB- takes minutes . The software crashes continuously during the day -LRB- twice or more hourly -RRB- . It is undependable and the new views take forever to load.NOT RECOMMENDED . Use Outlook 2003 if you must use Outlook at all.If anyone has recommendations for an effective email client with a real task manager and report manager , please post them somewhere!Frustrated beyond belief with this `` new '' unimproved outlook.This was a downgrade . It does n't work as reliably or as simply as the various webmails available these days.Actually , it just does not work AT ALL . Perpetual crash and burn .
 Received the software in the factory box . The seller placed a secondary sticker over the factory sticker that lists the product key needed to install the software . The secondary sticker could not be removed . Amazon also would not replace the product since the order was fulfilled by a third party .
 I purchased this product for my new Windows 7 HP Quad-core i5 PC because the MS Office 2000 that I was using on my old Windows XP Dell PC , would not install at all . At first , it appeared that MS Outlook 2007 would be very good , but after awhile -LRB- after just 3 months -RRB- , the RULES feature began going haywire . I lost the Rules for moving specific emails into specific folders . Now , they would either go into my Junk email or sit out on my mail server and JUST SIT THERE until I finally realized where they were ! I used the free upgrade for 2010 and it just got worse from there . Now , I barely , if at all , get a lot of my emails . I have to go out to the server manually to see them on a daily basis . Microsoft , you are getting worse and worse in your development . If I could return this terrible product , I would . It is definitely NOT for the novice . I only gave this a 2-star because of my 15 + years of experience with Outlook , starting with Windows 95 and Outlook 97 . This is such a great disappointment , I can not begin to tell you everything this program has done to destroy my emails . BTW , I am a Computer guru and have been since 1984 when I had my first IBM Jr. . I am a degreed professional Software Engineer , so it is not as if I do n't know what I am talking about . I DO.Beware buyers , of this product ! Be sure to really investigate Outlook on MS 's web site for FAQs and problems others have had BEFORE you purchase this product . I would recommend an alternative if you are a novice , like Pegasus or a FREEWARE alternative . This sealed it with me and Microsoft . I am getting rid of it all and going with Linux and other software alternatives .
 I got Outlook 2007 with Office 2007 . As the title of my complaint states , the software seemed wonderful at first . I especially liked its capability to set up accounts . After about five months , however , reception of email became spotty , then failed altogether . A reinstallation of Office , which happened when I upgraded to Windows 7 , 64-bit , got Outlook back in operation for about two more months . Microsoft 's answer seems to be to sell a new version of Office . At least a stand-alone of Outlook 2010 is available . I will have to check to see whether it works with Office 2007 . Stay tuned ...
 I wish I could give a better review on this product but I 'm unable to get it to install on my computer . It seems to have a problem with Vista and my student edition of Office 2007 . As it turns out Microsoft seems to be incompatible with Microsoft . Who would have thought ? I 've found many blogs posted by folks with the same issue but no one seems to have a good solution .
 I guess it 's alright , but most of the time it wo n't open . when I boot up my computer and open outlook 2007 it works . If I close it , it wo n't open again and I will have to reboot the computer again . I had 2003 for a long time and had no problemm with it untill it got some bug in it and I lost everything and I could n't get it to work again.So why not update to 2007 , more bells and wistles , sounded good to me but not so . I tried half a dozen cures from Google but to no avail . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 As a satisfied professional and private user of Outlook for at least 10 yrs , I was looking forward to upgrading to Outlook 2007 . Once I did , discovering I can no longer use animated graphics in the body of Outlook email messages was a MAJOR disappointment . I should not have to open emails in a browser to see animation . Despite the `` security '' and `` simplicity '' reasons Microsoft gives for removing this function , this is definitely a step backwards .
 Once again Microsoft has shown their distain for their customers as they release a mediocre product that has less functionality then the previous version . I think since Vista , Microsoft 's main goal has been to make all previous versions of all software obsolete . It must be , because they sure are not offering s product worth the price they are charging . Well . . Let me qualify that . If you never had an Outlook , then 2007 might be nice , but if you have Outlook 2000 , then do n't throw your money away on 2007 . Here is what you get .1 . As is usual with MS , you get a lot of NON-VALUE ADDED changes , that will tend to confuse you and slow down your productivity , at least in the begging . The user interface is completely different .2 . If you use a lot of Emil accounts -LRB- for your business , etc -RRB- , you will find it a royal pain-in-the-neck to try and transfer them to 2007 . Oh . . You can get them out of 2000 just fine , but forget about getting them into 2007 easily . And worse , you will have to enter them all manually and Outlook 2007 will hang up on you while it tries to figure out if you set them up ok . The best thing to do is set up 1 until you get it right , then use that to setup the rest and then hit send/receive to test them . There is duplication and some things are not clear i.e. Is account AccountName or AccountName@domainname . It is both , depending on where they ask for it .3 . Contacts . I ca n't figure out if you can move your contacts to 2007 , but so far , it does not look like it . In 2000 , contacts are in the outlook.pst file . When you open that on 2007 , the contacts are gone . Well . . At least they do not show . Terrific huh ? Look up `` Import Contacts '' in Outlook 2007 help and it tells you how to get Google contacts , Hotmail contacts and even Facebook contacts , but that 's it .4 . The preview pane has been moved from under the list of email to the right of them , which squeezes everything together and also slow down the preview .5 . Here is one that takes the cake . MS changed the engine for HTML rendering from Internet Explorer to Word . Most will not feel the pain here , but if you need to reformat emails , you will quickly find yourself in trouble . This really sucks . As a business owner , I get up to 70 emails for orders and use templates to read them and reformat them for my distributors . Thanks again to Microsoft 's ignorant wisdom Outlook 2007 does n't seem to understand CSS positioning , so none of my template will work . I just got to go to unix and get rid of ALL things Microsoft.Now you might say something like `` Just move your Emails back to Outlook 2000 . Remember the start of this review when I said `` I think since Vista , Microsoft 's main goal has been to make all previous versions of all software obsolete . '' ? Well once your Email are in Outlook 2007 , Outlook 2000 will not accept them , even if you repair the . PST via Scanpst.One thing I did like a lot about Outlook 2007 , is that the search is extremely fast and it searches all of your . PST files.In conclusion I am going to continue using 2007 on 1 of my laptops until I feel comfortable and feel I do understand it . I will add to this post at that time . But for now , I would like to chastise the Microsoft programmers for removing good solid working functionality , for God knows what reasons , and ask Microsoft management to bring back the writers of excel -LRB- arguably one of the best pieces of software ever written -RRB- to teach the new programmers how code should be written .
 I purchased Outlook 07 to sync my iphone with my laptop . Outlook 07 wreaked havoc on my computer , so much so , that I bought a new laptop . Instead of installing 07 on it , I installed Oulook 03 . It has one small glitch that Microsoft refused to help me make work . So , I 'm out the $ 120 for Outlook 07 , AND my Outlook 03 still has a functionality problem . I would have to rate Microsoft with a big fat ZERO .
 This program is very buggy and I wish I did no even purchased and upgrade . Very disappointed
 I have used and loved Outlook for many years , along with the rest of the Office suite . To get up to date , I just bought the home & student Office suite 07 sans Outlook and bought Outlook 07 separately -LRB- thinking $ 200 total was better than $ 400 -RRB- . Fine - except this Outlook does n't hook up with the suite , wo n't let me set default fonts , and is driving me nuts . I sometimes receive a message in white font on white and ca n't read it until I hit forward to put it into a message whose font I can change so I can finally see it . I looked it up on Microsoft . It 's designed to act this way . Thumbs down .
 Installing stand alone Outlook 2007 will corrupt your Office 2003 suite . Tech support will advise you to erase the components of your damaged 2003 in order to install Outlook 2007 , promising to send you a 2003 replacement disk if you do n't have your old disk . By attempting to install Outlook 2007 , you will lose your entire 2003 and can only obtain a replacement disk for an additional $ 25 . But it gets worse . If your system came pre-installed , they wo n't send you a replacement disk ; they 'll refer you to your computer manufacturer . Ever tried to get a disk from Compaq ?? Or Dell ? Or Best Buy?BEWARE OF OUTLOOK 2007 !!
 I have been a satisfied user of Outlook 2000 since it came out . I bought Outlook 2007 for my wife , since we switched from Comcast to Qwest broadband . As it turns out the Qwest sub-account emails can not be set up to send mail using SMTP protocol -LRB- can you believe it ? -RRB- So we were forced to upgrade since you can set up Outlook 2007 to do http email . After numerous tries to install it and having the install abort every time , I read reviews on-line and discovered that you actually have to uninstall the entire Office 2000 suite before you can load Outlook 2007 . Now that sounds like the evil empire Microsoft market development team finding a sneaky way to make you have to go and upgrade everything ! The diabolical fiends at Microsoft ! Fortunately I had purchased Office Home and Student and Outlook in a bundle package , since I needed to upgrade my copy of Excel Office 2000 -LRB- another fun MS story ... -RRB- Once installed , it works fine , and is oh-so-pretty with colors and neat new colorful wonderful , exciting , thrilling , and fancy things ! Oh My!The search feature thing is irritating and slows down performance while it is out gathering eggs on-line , or whatever it is doing that you do n't have a clue about , yet is hogging your resources . Now I am afraid to try to install Outlook 2007 on my machine , and since Outlook 2000 is working fine , I figure I 'll wait until Microsoft figures out a way to make it quit working with a `` security patch '' that will kill it dead
 I am very disappointed in this software . Microsoft is usuall a good product , however Outlook 2007 is awful . I had Outlook and was having problems , so I upgraded . Because I have Windows XP I had to get a service pack just to make it work . It is slooooooow , it frezes , there are too many layers to go through and nothing works smoothly on this software . It 's just terrible .
 Well , they 've done it again . Microsoft has introduced a `` new '' product that does the exact same thing as the `` old '' product -LRB- Outlook from Office XP Professional Edition -RRB- . But with the introduction of the Vista Operating System , the `` old '' version no longer works properly . So , Microsoft has again forced my hand into buying a new product that I do n't really need because I already own a version , but I am forced to buy a new version in order to get it to work properly on my machine.Thanks , Microsoft , for continuing to take my money for things that I already have and am forced to buy again .
 Have constant problems with this product . It will not close - sends error messages but problems are not corrected . More often than not when you imput data or try to access information you get the message `` not responding . '' I 'm just glad the developers of this product were not responsible for developing critical hospital patient care programs as most patients would have died a long time ago .
 I added Outlook 2007 to the Office 2007 I installed which did n't come with Outlook . I had been using Office 2003 with Outlook 2003 on an XP system and it had worked fine.Outlook 2007 is incredibly slow to start downloading emails and slow for each email . It may take it 5 minutes to download a couple dozen emails-no attachments or anything . These will download with Mozilla Thunderbird in maybe 20 seconds . And during that time it basically locks up everything else you want to do until it is finished . I 've tried turning off everything that has been suggested that may be slowing it down but no success.I 'm now using Thunderbird for my emails . Outlook 2007 was so slow the frustration level just got too high.I do n't recommend buying this . Outlook 2003 was just fine but Outlook 2007 is a disaster on my machine .
 Microsoft Outlook 2000 still has a tendency toward locking up and is very slow . I would appreciate a better , more reliable program .
 On the edge of the box -LRB- several ounces of high quality plastic , over an inch thick containing 1 DVD and a product key slip -RRB- is a pair of ribbed tabs to hold the inner box by when you pull it out.The more firmly you squeeze the ribbed tabs , the more firmly you lock the inner box into the outer . If you ignore the tabs it opens easy!Who designed this . It must be the same guy who put the OK button on a VGA resolution Display Control Panel , off the bottom of the screen , so that you could n't increase the resolution.He probably thought up the form `` Do you really want to Quit ? '' with `` Continue '' and `` Quit '' buttons.The software ? - as feature ridden as the previous version - which is n't to say it does a lot . Just that it needs a lot of features in order to do a bit.Lets hope Bill 's exit timing from Microsoft proves to be as timely as Tony 's from No 10 . Come on Amazon , send them a complimentary beginners guide to user interface design . It can be your penance for having a 5 star scoring system where the user can not select zero stars . 8 ^ -RRB-
 Office 2k7 suite was enough to finally send me to the other side . Have made MAC purchases since , and will be soley MAC soon -- w / the exception of Outlook due to the business contacts.As a Computer Engineer , I can no longer accept the Microsoft woes . It is funny , but I swear Office 2k7 has been the most anti-productive SW I have every had to deal with . Will continue to avoid Vista as long as possible .
 I bought this product for a specific purpose and later realized that it was not everything it was suppose to be . It was very expensive and had very little utility .
 I bought this program -LRB- Outlook -RRB- and found it to be of little real value.Wish I could get a refund from the `` richest guy in America . ''
 I can not ereally rate the product , because I never recieved it . After more than six weeks of waiting I received an email notfying me that I would be rebated the amount of the item less shipping since I had sent it back . Want to bet if I 'll ever use Amazon again . Do n't hold your breath !!!
 I purchased Outlook from Amazon.com . It was the first thing I 've ever purchased from them.Now they are spamming me and I ca n't seem to get off their email list.This is the lastest insult . They want a review from me.Please take me off your email list !
 I purchased a new Compaq desktop with Vista Home Premium .32 bit . I also purchased Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 for my college son and I also bought Outlook 2007 , as stand alone products , not upgrade versions . The new machine had no Microsoft products other than Microsoft Works already on it . When trying to install Outlook 2007 , you get a popup and choose Run the software . It asks you for the product I.D. number , and that 's fine . Then it starts installation , but then stops and says
 I purchased Word 2007 and Outlook 2007 as they link -LRB- or are supposed to -RRB- with some other software I use regularly at my office . The link for Word has never been a problem but only some of the features of Outlook 2007 actually work with that software . For example , the calendar in Outlook is supposed to sync with the calendar in that program -LRB- PCLaw -RRB- . It never has.I have found that Outlook 2007 is very unstable as well . It is very prone to lock up . Also , quite frequently , I will have to open it in safe mode as it tells me the program did not exit properly the last time . Even more annoying is that Outlook 2007 will suddenly not allow me to click on a link in an email even though the program allowed it in a previous email . A reboot may or may not solve that problem.Overall , I need that program for the links to PCLaw , but it has been a very frustrating program .
 The Business Contact Manager was a huge disappointment ! Clunky , not-intuitive , and SLOW . I spent half of my time using it waiting for it to catch up.How about getting some of those Google minds into Microsoft ?
 I swear
 Horrible . I recently upgraded from Outlook 2003 . I never had a problem with 2003 . Outlook 2007 freezes 90 % of the time I use it , locks up on downloading email , and frequently has to start in `` safe '' mode because it claims it was not shut down properly . Tremendous waste of time.are the features better than 2003 ? I do n't think so . Although I ca n't really say for sure -- I have such a hard time using it that I have n't had the chance to explore the new features . I do know that it is much more difficult to assign categories to calendar entries , and the shortcut keys are not the same.A quick internet search shows that this is common . I recommend sticking with 2003 as long as you can . It 's easier to use , and more stable .
 Getting the case opened to access the Outlook CD requires a sledge and a strong arm.Furthermore , the Microsoft product code is glued to the case , so you better save the parts
 I uninstalled this product . It slowed down my system considerably . I would NOT recommend this product at all . I am VERY disappointed in it . It also does not allow you to use stationery . What a bust !
 If you are a serious user of reference books and you intend to buy multimedia encyclopedia because of its text content and not multimedia features such as videos and animations , you might be interested in this brief comparison between Microsoft Encarta and Encyclopaedia Britannica -LRB- in both cases I 've been trying 2002 Standard Edition -RRB- . Some of the Encarta 's plusesCharacters displayEncarta displays practically all foreign characters correct -LRB- e.g. Slovenian and Czech c with a circumflex , other Central European characters , Portuguese a and Spanish n with a tilde , French e with a grave accent , etc. -RRB- while Britannica does n't . Two concrete examples
 Insert those Encarta CDs into your PC and you will notice , that not one , but two installation processes start . Microsoft updates your system with Internet Explorer 6.0 and Oulook Express 6 , deleting scores of registry entries and seriously `` updating '' your system settings.There is NO hint that this will happen , there is no way to stopp it and it 's irremovable . The new explorer crashes frequently on my system , it 's much slower and a million things go wrong that worked perfectly before.The content on the other hand is closely focused on use in schools and is so politically correct that it will hardly satisfy any critical mind .
 The product is functional ; however , the way the information is presented is clunky and navigation is akward . I have tried to use this product with my 10 year-old on projects and 90 % of the time Wikipedia is more useful .
 After buying this product vendor was contacted for support or refund on shipping costs due to installatio failure . What they never said was that this product only works with Windows 98 -LRB- who has windows 98 nowadays ? and who really knows if it is going to work with windows 98 ? -RRB- Vendor never refunded shipping cost . They should not be selling an obsolete product . My guess is that they have a large quantity in stock and are just getting rid of them in any which way the can .

 When it worked , it was a very nice addition to my reference library . But after the relatively short warranty period expired , it began displaying blank pages instead of articles , or sometimes the error message `` This page can not be displayed . '' Maps continue to display correctly , but the `` About Encarta ... '' command has the same problem , so that the product ID can not be read . The Microsoft Knowledge Base had a number of suggestions , some of which were very time-consuming to follow up . Nothing worked.So be aware that when you buy Encarta , you run the risk that it will become inoperative at some time in the future .
 There was a time when Microsoft Office Word 's most recent incarnation was held as the Gold Standard of word-processing programs by most casual - and many professional-computer users . This `` article of faith '' was so ubiquitous that the pre-installed downgraded word-processing program , part of what is called Microsoft Works , was held in some contempt by most users and usually deleted right away and replaced with the most recent version of Word . No more.Office Word 2007 is packed with things no one needs and wastes every user 's time trying to figure it out.Compared to the over written and unnecessarily complex Word 2007 , the basic templates in Microsoft Works -LRB- version 8.5 -RRB- are refreshingly appealing , simple to use and entirely adequate for most writing and word processing tasks.Unlike the older versions of Word and the Works Word Processor , Office Word 2007 opens to seven separate template tabs - Each with its own full range of choices and each with own set of multiple and complex tool bars and options . These view pages include 1 -RRB- Home , 2 -RRB- Insert , 3 -RRB- Page Layout , 4 -RRB- References , 5 -RRB- Mailings , 6 -RRB- Review and 7 -RRB- View . Without going into detail , suffice it to say that the truly necessary aspects of each were once contained on the two simple toolbars most commonly used in the earlier versions of Word , Editing and Navigation.Navigating between these seven tabbed templates is like moving from room to room - or from house to house - to complete one meal or one conversation . It is simply a user-unfriendly , ill-conceived design . The multiplicity , design and inclusion of many useless options on the production default page -LRB- `` Home '' -RRB- alone are distracting , delaying , complicated and yield no better product than the earlier , simpler versions.Word processing should be straightforward , easily navigated and complete . The basic tools of spell-checking , formatting , cutting , pasting , highlighting , etc. should be positioned so as to make them immediately available while working . With Office Word 2007 , Microsoft has abandoned these basic precepts and needs . Every time a different tab/template selection needs to be entered to accomplish a necessary task , the writer is distracted . Any writer - including many of you who are reading this , will agree that adding distraction reduces productivity and efficiency.Microsoft 's Office Word 2007 was appears to have not been designed by writers , but by software engineers rewarded for building bigger and more complex programs.The same strategic error was made by Microsoft in its current operating system , Windows VISTA . Most users of the Microsoft XP system found it perfectly adequate . VISTA bloated a good operating system until it became a gargantuan program of gigabyte-guzzling proportions while adding little if any functional improvements . Yet another example of size and complexity winning out over necessary functionality . Office Word 2007 is a repetition of the self-same misjudgment.Time is of the essence to most people when they write . It took me nearly ten minutes to figure out how to change a default that double spaced every line I wrote ! The Style templates are simply bizarre and distracting , taking up fully half the toolbar space in the basic `` Home '' production tab . The more functional and necessary functions are squeezed into mini-size half icons making the necessary navigation all the more difficult.Yes , there is a way to customize one 's own toolbar - but why should we have to spend our own time to re-simplify what Microsoft Word 2007 has literally encrypted and hidden in a maze of overlapping separate templates , options and useless features!There is talk of VISTA being replaced sooner rather than later and that , as heavily promoted as it was and with the talk of ceasing to provide support or updates for XP in the coming year , it will be piled atop the ` it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time ' junk heap along with Windows Millennium . I expect Word 2007 to wind up there , too.In the meanwhile , there are good choices , even if you choose to stay within the Windows ` family ' of word processing programs . Most simply -LRB- and inexpensively -RRB- the aforementioned Microsoft Works 8.5 actually turns out to be a pretty user friendly and functional package that includes a more familiar and easier to use word processing program , an Excel-like spread sheet as well as an Access-like database for keeping and sorting information.Office Word 2003 and XP software is still out there and is getting pretty inexpensive - And it is far easier to use.As a former admitted `` Microsoft Word snob , '' I must confess that I have learned something from these experiences . Bigger is not necessarily better . The principle applies to software as well as to cars . Microsoft should not be rewarded for bringing this ` upgrade ' to market any more than the developers and promoters of Hummers ought be acknowledged for their ecological contributions to the well being of the planet.I have also learned that the earlier and simpler versions of Microsoft 's word processing programs are far superior in ease of use and essential , efficient functionality than is its newest product , Office Word 2007 . I encourage every new computer buyer to give Microsoft Works a try before automatically dumping it in favor of Word and its related programs . You might be in for a very pleasant and economically satisfying experience !
 Word 2007 is a perfect example of why you should n't try to fix something that was never broken . Instead of improving Word , they made it ugly and just plain annoying . An experienced user can figure out how to use it ... but the hunting and searching for functions that used to be a snap to find is a frustrating , time-consuming waste . The toolbar is now a `` ribbon '' cluttered with icons instead of quick , simple pull-down menus . I wish I 'd done more research , and I 'd have ordered an older version of Word with my new laptop . THIS SYSTEM SUCKS .
 The license prevents you from using this product for any commercial use , even non-profit business use . Do not buy this product if you have any intention of ever using it to make money .
 The way to create Headers/Footers in Word is illogical and with 20 years of software experience , it took 15 minutes to figure it out . MICROSOFT WORD is idiotic . I am going to wear a black arm band for WORDPERFECT . WORDPERFECT was so much better and SO MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY .
 Disappointing , this is not what I was looking for . The product just gave me Word . I wanted Word , Excel , PowerPoint etc. .
 Beware of `` EastWest ProSamples '' libraries . THey are not clear samples . You need to buy a seperate license if you want to use them professionally.Since this series is typically a cheap abridged version of older sound libraries , I recommend buying the older full version of the discs if you need to work with them . Typically these older libraries have professional licenses and are clear .
 From 3 CD-s I received one is defected , one partially defected . It even does n't include all samples played in availible mp3 demo . Support will only offer you to buy more CD-s :--LRB- -LRB-
 Microsoft Streets and Trips ReviewI have only limited experience with GPS navigation systems , so this review is not a comprehensive overview of either dedicated systems or laptop-based systems . My total first-hand experience is a few hundred miles of RV driving with the 2005 version of Streets and Trips and over 7,000 miles with the 2007 version . . BUGS , QUIRKS AND SHORTCOMINGSBUG
 The best part of this application for me has been the new SIRF receiver . I 'm impressed with the sensitivity , which is much better than the WAAS receiver on my handheld . I 'm far less impressed with the actual trip planning software . When the GPS is taken away , this is really a $ 29 application , and it shows . In fact , if I were Microsoft , I think I would be a bit embarrassed . I agree with other reviewers that the rural road detail could be much better . My old Atlas that shows one state per page has better road detail than this app . But the real annoyance has been that the software forces me to set trip preference and then trys very hard to cram everything into those preference . Concepts such as `` I want to take this road , not the one recommended , '' or `` I want to stop here for the night , even though it 's 1 pm '' are very difficult to incorporate , and often have unexpected consequences . At one point , the app changed my start time to 3:17 pm from 9 am , I think because I picked an early stop time . Also be careful about losing your route . There are about 5 ways to delete a route -LRB- `` clear '' is the word used - not delete -RRB- and there is no confirmation - your work is just gone . I 'm sure you will find your own personal favorite annoyances.Overall , I do n't regret the purchase , if only for the GPS receiver . I also will continue to use the planning software , and hope I eventually find it more useful by learning its nuances . But I still find it very frustrating at times and everything takes longer to accomplish than I feel it should .
 This software was written by a person living in a cubicle and maybe it performs well there . Meanwhile in the real world I 've been 12000 miles in my RV with it -LRB- and also ST 2006 which had the Pharos 360 receiver -RRB- and at best it is intermittent . I bought the 2007 edition because it was advertised to have improved reception with the Pharos 500 receiver . Recently on the stretch of I-10 between San Antonio and El Paso , where there was a clear blue sky and no trees or hills to block the sky , it lost satellite signal at least a dozen times with the pharos receiver out on the roof . It 's an interesting toy but not a real GPS mapping system . I would be so embarrassed if I worked at MS on this product , that I would just tell my friends `` I 'm in accounting '' . If you depend on GPS , DO NOT buy this product .
 You would have thought that with the power of a PC behaind it this will be the most capable navigation program . Unfortunately , it is by far the worst navigation software ever devised . Combined with a crappy receiver that takes forever to aquire the satellites -LRB- initially I thougt that hardware has failed ! -RRB- and loses them often , it is a complete waste of money . Too bad there are no negative stars , one star is way too high a rating.I would provide all the gory details of my experience with this product but I am barfing on my keyboard every time I think about it.If you are a masochist , you 'll really enjoy this product !!!
 Before buying the product , I did not think to test my laptop in my vehicle . If I had , I would not have bought this product . I have the 2004 version of Streets and Trips on my desk PC and use it a lot and thought it would be cool to get the GPS version for my laptop to actually use on a real trip . The first time I tried to use it , I realized my laptop screen went unreadble in bright sunlight . My entire justification for buying went out the window . I did not need a second copy of S&T for a laptop and I certainly did not need the pricier GPS version .
 I 've used the gps twice , and had some difficulty getting it to reconize where I was the first time . The second time was even harder , the program keeps telling me that it ca n't find enough signals . This with the `` GPS '' attachment stuck to the front windshield.I also was disappointed that I could n't cut and paste addresses into the program to search .
 I give this product 2 stars . When traveling gps voice does not indicate street names . insted it indicates yard or mile one is from next exit . When looking up a location complete address has to be entered . When searching for a location ie search looks throughout the united states and not the state indicated.Ok program . not worth the money . Better off getting a real GPSthe one feature it has going for itself is the trip planner . However , shortest distance , frequent use of highway options are not available . It says so but hard to tell the difference if any between routes . I have also found myself getting lost more frequently with the GPS . Cross refrence with google.maps if in doubt .
 I 've not been satisfied with this product . Software should be intuitive , and it seems I continually need to refer to the manual to figure out what 's happening . I suppose with enough practice I 'll get it all ironed out , but competing products seem much more intelligently designed . I 've seen a DeLorme in action and it appears to be a far better design , so today I purchased it . I 'll provide an eval on it in the future .
 I hate this unit . The software sucks but on top of that , the product is flimsy . The GPS unit -LRB- a square button thing -RRB- is supposed to be attached to a USB stick . One end of this stick is attached to the GPS unit and the other end into the computer -LRB- or the supplied cable which then inserts into the USB port of your computer -RRB- . This USB stick which sits in the middle is the worst product I have seen -LRB- from a quality standpoint -RRB- . The USB stick has a seam which is coming apart . In my case it came that way in the box but I am telling ya , it is easy to break that seam ! I am not sure you can get the replacement USB stick or kiss your GPS setup goodbye but in my case , I do n't wantto take chances . I am gon na return this and try out the Garmin Mobile 10 GPS -LRB- with Software -RRB- Garmin Mobile 10 Bluetooth-Enabled GPS Systemand see if I have better luck -LRB- its much costlier though -RRB-
 OK , the maps are good , but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car . It is very disracting and can easily cause an accident . Does not work aroung Lincoln tunnel area . Also would not find my home street , and I have been there for 2 years . Either the one I got was defected , or its not what other make it out to be . I had to return mine .
 I 'd been reading reviews on the techie blogs about the S&T ; with GPS . They were * very * mixed , with many people saying they were having problems with acquiring satellite signals or even getting the GPS device to work . I should 've heeded their recommendations to look at other products.I 've had this for two days now . I get the message that the S&T ; application is `` receiving data '' , however , I should mention that it also says this even after I disconnect the GPS device . Odd.Only once has it acquired a signal
 Bought MS Streets/Trips -LRB- with GPS -RRB- 2007 expecting it to be a serious product with some degree of reliability . Not ! The Pharos 500 GPS receiver will not stay connected to the satellite signal for more that a few minutes , and once it loses it , you have to start over by shutting down the program and re-launching the ap . It 's a mess . I 've used this in totally wide open areas of Dallas , TX , and there is rarely a time when the satellite signal is found , much less kept connected . Perhaps the most ironic thing about it is the GPS receiver works best when sitting on my 2nd floor window sill , exactly where it 's never going to be used ! Once it gets into my car , it loses the signal . Buy a different GPS system if you expect to own one that works .
 We used Streets and Trips for an 8-hour road trip . The GPS unit lost and failed to reacquire about every 15 minutes . We had to fiddle and restart the program the whole trip . We were frustrated and worn out just fighting with the computer software . When we took a wrong turn , it told us `` off route '' and `` proceed to route '' -LRB- no help -RRB- and then lost the satellites again . The little maps of the intersections that we printed out from the program were too small to get a perspective of where we were . On the return trip we ditched the dumb Streets and Trips and used our old fashioned maps and enjoyed the trip home without getting lost .
 The GPS unit stopped working the first time we tried it so we had to return it for a refund .
 This program stinks . you need to enter a new starting point every time you use it even though most people start from the same point usualy . The user friendly aspect is poor , the maps are only so so . I found much older products to be much easier and smarter . I bet whoever designed this product does n't actualy use it !
 I recently hauled my laptop to Hawaii solely for GPS . I also bought car inverter for long trips . I was really disappointed by the results . The GPS took long times to lock to satelite -LRB- as much as 10 mins sometimes -RRB- . On highways its sensitivity was really low . The driving directios for lot of points was screwed up . Do n't drive to Hanauma Bay using MS S&T. ; The biggest problem I faced was that the driving directions will not specify which direction to take on HWY -LRB- I mean w , s , n or e -RRB- . It will just say take H1 and I had to guess H1 E or H1 W. Try HNL to Hanauma Bay Natural preserve Honolulu.Further more this GPS solution is very cumbersome -LRB- especially since the included suction cup -RRB- does n't stick very long , thus the gps receiver keeps falling off.The reason I bought this unit was to postphone buying a real GPS for a year or two . In retrospect it was a bad decision ...
 Read the other reviews . All the problems they 've had , I 've had as well-plus some . Install does n't work without a lot of help , and tech support is nonexistent . On one problem , still not solved , I 've e-mailed for help to Britannica three times , with no reply . This lack of replies is consistent , at least . It goes well with the first set of several e-mails sent to them on problems I was eventually able to solve by other means , sometimes after several hours , even , in one case , a few days . It 's sort of a challenge , but that 's not exactly why I purchased this thing in the first place.When it works , it 's not bad . It appears to be more complete that the other three I 've tried -LRB- Grolier , Encarta , and Compton 's -RRB- , although I agree with time_velocity that it 's far from what it could have been . It 's a little short on visual media . Its search engine works pretty well . The articles are not deep , but are deeper than the competition.If I had it to do again , I 'd wait another year-or more .
 Do n't buy this product . I wrote the long review below -LRB- Dec. 5th -RRB- about the headaches involved , but at the time I was trying to use the product anyway . It has since crashed my computer repeatedly . It interferes with other software apps -LRB- for example , if the EB app . is running while MSWord is running , I sometimes ca n't print my Word documents -RRB- . I can not print the EB entries without logging onto the EB website , where the word is looked up there -- and then when I try to print the entry from the website , it sometimes crashes my browser . And annoyingly , even after you 've paid for the CD version , you are not allowed to log onto the EB website directly , which you might want to do to avoid having your CD stumble around and then log you on to get what it needs . I hate this CD ROM . I ended up subscribing to the online version after all . Even though the website crashes soemtimes , it is far more useful than the CD ROM . But I still harbor ill will toward this company for causing me so much pain . I had to UNinstall the program AND everything else on my system because this CD ROM introduced some kind of bug into my system -- the problems did n't go away just because I stopped opening the EB application .
 Good graphics -- poor tech support , hard to load , locks up machines , custom version has problems .
 What is EB afraid of ? That we will print our the 40,000 pages and bind our own set for the bookshelf?They could really have a great product , but they do n't seem to have their heart into the computer version . EB seems to treat this as a teaser for the print version . I hope they get this right in the future . I hope they avoid the flavor of the other CD references , and stake out a high ground of scholorship , relevance , and authoritative fact checking . They could fill a large void in education , business , and home markets with such a tool .
 This product is not ready for prime time though the content is great . The installation is proned to errors . The product does not follow the standard Windows interface and can not be re-sized which means you get very small text on a large screen -LRB- I assume it was ported from a Mac without regard to how it functions under Windows and it shows in many places as you try to navigate -RRB- .
 At first , Britannica 2000 CD worked reasonably well . However , now , it does not work at all . It hangs during application start-up . I suspect it has a problem sharing one or more DLLs with other applications , since there was an update to Britannica 1999 to resolve a similar problem . The excellent content is of NO value if you ca n't access it -LRB- and I ca n't -RRB- .
 Britannica is now owned by ... -LRB- are you ready ? -RRB- ... Matell Interactive . And this product shows it.I have tried two separate versions of Britannica -LRB- most recently the DVD version -RRB- and neither one loaded properly . Thinking that there must be something wrong with me or my machines , I went to the reviews at www.cnet.com , a website frequented by knowledgeable computer users , and found that a lot of other users were experiencing the same frustrations.A real software company would post a downloadable fix , but if you go to the Britannica website -LRB- www.britannica.com -RRB- , you wo n't find one . There are two possible explanations
 The user interface for the Brittanica has gotten worse in every year since the first CD-ROM version was isssued . Too many bells and whistles , all of them amiguously named and idiosyncratic in operation . The current version has irritated me so much that I unistalled it and went back to using the 1997 version , which has a very simple interface using Netscape 2.0 . The material the encyclopedia provides is still excellect , but it is very difficult to find what you need .
 What a disappointment . What a waste of money . I can find data faster using the ` analog ' method , i.e. visiting the public library . I 'll NEVER buy software from Britannica again .
 With so many audio editing programs out there that are easy to use and productive , this one was a complete waste of time and money . Editing is cumbersome and much for difficult to do than should possibly be . Burning your project to disk is even more unhelpful . Additionally , customer service was even more unsatisfactory than the product .
 This is a nice looking audio package for Windows , it has a nice feature set , and some good plugins . It has several major drawbacks however . The biggest one is latency . I experienced as much as 100ms latency with this product using _ all _ audio devices I have . I tried under WDM , ASIO and MME drivers - and it made little difference . This product was unusable for me . Not only that - if you are a consumer looking to experiment with home recording , this will not work with any Sound Blaster products . I purchased an M-Audio Duo box -LRB- $ 259 -RRB- , and it finaly recorded , but with 100ms latency , which was terrible . I tried it on two different computers both running windows 2000 and had the same results . Midi input is n't bad , but there is no good mapping file for Korg Triton.I would recommend looking at Cubase SL/SX instead which I have purchased and am very happy with so far . It 's a bit more fiddley than Sonar , but it actualy works , and they have a very nice effects mechanism which is easy to use . Latency practicaly went away when switching to this product . I give Cakewalk a big Thumbs Down - Unusable !
 Simply put the images on this cd collection are of extremely low quality . Images turn to pixilated mud as soon as you try to zoom in , also many have watermarks through them . Save your money .
 First of all it is simply a re-branded SafeNet SoftRemote client I have used with Watchguard and other hardware vendors for over 10 years . The client comes with no presets or Netgear specific advantages . It is just as tedious to setup as any other client including free ones like TheGreenBow and Shrew . It does not work with Vista 64bit . I see no reason why this client which has been around for MANY years should be an added cost , or why there is not a Netgear specific client that could work with Netgear hardware . In any event , not a happy camper . To be fair I will say that if and when you get it connected it is a solid client - and also that I have never had it crash on me .
 I purchased several copies of this product . They were intended to connect remote employees to Netgear 's FVL328 router . Needless to say it was extremely difficult and time consuming to setup . And I consider myself highly competent in Server-Client network setup and configuration . FVL328 supports Dynamic DNS services , but the Client Software or FVL328 documentation says nothing of such setup . In fact it is full of typos and inconsistencies . By secondguessing the online posted manual for FVL328 -LRB- make sure you get the latest one -RRB- and using my experience I was able to connect to the FVL328 . Then we upgraded the McAfee Viruscan from 7.0 to 8.0 . Client computers -LRB- WinXP or Win2K -RRB- started to crash to Blue Screen of Death -LRB- BSOD -RRB- . Clean installs and reinstalls in various order did not hel either . Mcafee has this bug in their knowledgebase and said that the SafeNet SoftRemote software -LRB- OEMed by Netgear as Prosafe VPN Client -RRB- release 10.1 had this issue but was corrected in release 10.3.5 . Netgear does not even want to provide an update to this and is still under release 10.1.1 for 2.5 years . So either buy SafeNet SoftRemote or do not relly on Mcafee , hince the 2 stars
 The bummer about this software , and other reviewers tend to agree , is it 's so buggy . Installation and configuration are easy , but diagnosing connection problems is a nightmare . This is especially true when trying to connect to another Netgear VPN router , which seems almost like an exercise in futility . Seeing that their software has n't been updated in over 3 years points out Netgear itself is n't even behind this product anymore.Buyer Beware
 Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point . There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client . It would be similar to , say , allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet . In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network . The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working.Added to my woes I ca n't tell you how often I saw ` the blue screen of death ' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution .
 I think the title about says it all . I could n't get the software to work with my Netgear router so I called support . Since my router was out of warranty , they would n't provide me support even though I just purchased the software from Amazon the week before . They indicated that had I purchased it from them , they would support it . -LRB- I 'll check tomorrow , but I think I have a newer router elsewhere that I can use to get support -RRB- . However ... even if I can get it to work , I did n't see that it does n't work with Vista . Luckily , I have an XP computer I can fail to get it to work on . -LRB- I ca n't fail on the Vista computer since it wo n't even install -RRB- . Needless to say , I 'm somewhat disappointed . The only document that describes how to get it to work with the router I have is inaccurate -LRB- and overly complicated -RRB- and in the end ... failed to set up the software in some way that would make it connect to the router .
 Few clicks during the first installation , blue screen ... . It killed my networks -LRB- Ethernet & Wireless -RRB- configuration . Very poor quality . Never consider it for your business .
 It says it works on Vista , but what they do n't say is that it only works on Vista 32bit . If you have Vista 64bit , it will not install at all
 I used to be a big proponent of Netgear . Not anymore . First off , after reading the package on the VPN box , I believed the software client was included , but no . Once I figured that out , I bought the software , which costs more than the router . After a week of hacking , I finally got the software to work , on one out of 4 machines . One machine hard re-boots if you try any kind of network activity once the VPN is connected . I 've disabled everything I can think of , it just wo n't work . It wo n't work with Vista either , no word from Netgear on a date . All other VPN software has to be un-installed , so forget using one machine to connect to a Netgear , Watchguard , Cisco , etc. vpn.Very frustrating software .
 The product I recieved from Amazon was a very outdated version . It was approximately two to three years old . The version was so old I was not able to get an upgrade to a version that works with Vista . Fortunately , I found a very nice representative at NETGEAR that sent me a link to an upgrade . DO NOT PURCHASE UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THAT AMAZON HAS THE LATEST VERSION !!
 We purchased a Netgear FVS114 VPN Firewall and VPN Client package -LRB- VPN05L -RRB- from CDW on 25 Jan 2008 . We are told by Netgear Tech Support that the BIOS was changed in the device and it is no longer `` stable '' . The previous BIOS version is no longer available . They are unable to resolve the problem -LRB- netgear tech support case
 If you are using Windows 7 -LRB- or planning on upgrading to Windows 7 -RRB- , this software is not going to work for you . This is old software -LRB- as others have noted -RRB- . This software is VPN05L . For Windows 7 you need to buy the newer software VPNG05L . Fortunately , Amazon 's return policy is very good so this did n't turn into an expensive mistake . However , Amazon should update the description so that other people do n't fall into the same trap .
 Amazon did a fine job of distributing this product , but sadly , the product and the support is a mess . I have very good IT support personnel who have spent far too many hours trying to manage this software and its associated hardware . Netgear 's customer support , if you find a CS staff member who does n't elect to hang up on you , seems generally unaware that they market a software product at all , let alone this specific product . Anticipate the level of support you could provide under those circumstances and act accordingly .
 This is not Amazon 's fault , it is Netgear 's fault but this is an OLD version of the software
 Stay away from this product . It requires a degree in network security to even understand its terminology . There 's no `` common settings '' feature that would allow you to easily set it up with say , one of Netgear 's own products , like the ProSafe VPN firewall that we tried to use it with . You have to understand every tiny detail of VPN operation to get it to work which we never ended up doing . And of course , the help is helpless.If you need an easy , small office VPN solution , pay for the Himachi service from LogMeIn which does n't require any hardware and was easy to get working .
 This software was not what I expected . It was an old version and could not be used with Windows 7 . However , Amazon was terrific and they refunded my money ASAP . Be sure this is what you need/want before you buy it .
 I have had nothing but problems with this software since purchasing it several months ago . Sometimes -LRB- rarely -RRB- it will perform , other times it just freezes up or refuses to burn a CD . I have wasted countless hours and numerous CDs that failed to be written , not to mention hours on the phone -LRB- $ $ $ $ -RRB- to technical support , all to no avail . Unless you enjoy frustration and throwing away a lot of money for absolutely no end result , I would suggest buying anything but Toast .
 I bought this close to six months ago , and I still ca n't reliably burn data or music CD-R or CD-RW . Roxio 's tech support sometimes neglects to respond to queries , and their repertoire seems to consist of 1 -RRB- blame the drive -LRB- i.e. , have the consumer get a new one if it is still in warranty -RRB- and 2 -RRB- blame the OS -LRB- i.e. , the drivers are part of Mac OS X , not Toast , so the problem must lie there -RRB- . Neither of these are acceptable without some diagnostic information .
 I bought Toast Titanium so I could record LP records and cassette tapes to CD . Spin Doctor has turned out to be an extremely poor application.It will not allow me to turn down the recording volume enough to prevent distortion . The application crashes constantly while I 'm setting up beginnings and endpoints of the digitized music . Roxio support told me to delete a file which did not help . With Mac OSX 10.2.3 you can not listen to the music as you digitize it . Roxio support says this is due to Mac going to OSX and that they have no plans to fix it . There is no `` help '' icon . If information is not addressed in the hard copy instructions you are out of luck . This appears to be a quick and dirty application for OS9 that does n't function well with OSX 10.2 . * or later . Spin Doctor was the entire reason that I bought Toast and frankly iTunes -LRB- V3 -RRB- is easier to use than toast when it comes to organizing and using music .
 Yes , I read all the reviews before buying . I needed something simple with absolutely no programming involved . Since I did n't like any of the templatesthat came with the software , I decided to build my own . Well , to sum it up - after 3 very frustrating days of trying to build my own template , I accomplished zero . I read the manual from start to finish . It is VERY poorly written for anyone who wants to do any of their own designing in Namo . In fact , after getting on their website and looking at the forum topics , I discovered that you CA N'T build your own template for your entire site . THAT VERSION IS GOING TO BE RELEASED IN MARCH 2004 !!!!!!!!!! As soon as I discovered this , I went to Best Buy and purchased WebEasy Pro which is much cheaper . It is also much easier to learn and extremely user friendly with a super help section . I would highly recommend that if you want to make your own design in ANY way - do not purchase NAMO ! Buy WebEasy Pro which is cheaper and far superior to Namo ! Thanks Namo for wasting my time and money . Just wish I could get a refund !
 Aside from the fact that this program is full of bugs -LRB- for example , you create a page , then view it in preview and it comes out all scrambled up -RRB- , Namo 's customer service is non-existent . They have an alleged registered user 's forum on their site , but the software wo n't allow you to type in a question -- and when I tried * on several occasions * to point this out and to get my questions answered from Namo customer service and technical support , I got no response . Nothing.Don ' t waste your money . Find another product .
 This program is waste !! I created my website with this , and it took me almost 3 months because this program would n't work properly . . -LRB- At all ! -RRB- , and would blow me out of it if I just tried to save something . Nothing worked ! If I needed to just publish an edited page to my website , supposedly , you can just select to publish the edited pages . Well , when I tried doing that , it blew me out of the program . So , I tried to psychronize the pages . Well , when I tried doing that , it blew me out of the program again . So , I had to publish the entire thing all over again , just to get one page updated . At 99 % , it blew me out again , and of course no changes were made on the site !! Total junk , total joke , TOTAL WASTE OF TIME & MONEY !!
 In short , you get what you pay for . Although inexpensive , webEditor is n't quite the deal it is made out to be . It is neither intuitive nor consistent with the usability of other publishing applications like Front Page , Publisher , or GoLive . While I did n't use all its features , it does appear quite powerful . But for more basic page designs , it is excessively time consuming to use . I highly recommend downloading the trial version to use before purchasing . It helped me decide not to buy it .
 From day one this software has been a nightmare with nothingworking right , a so-called beginners guide that guides you into a mess and more questions than it answers.Add to this the worst possible support where you can not ever speak with anyone , and have to rely on a forum or e-mails and wait and waste time awaiting a reply which is normally very short and requires numerous follow ups to have any idea what they are saying.Stay away from this garbage unless you want a lot of headaches or have a lot of intuitive skills to wind your way through this thing .
 My 5 year old son loves to watch the Blue 's Clues TV show , and we have the Blue 's Clues Treasure Hunt movie . But the computer game leaves a lot to be desired . When you first start the game , Steve does a lot of talking - so much so that my son asked , `` Is all we get to do is watch ? '' . Finally we get started , but there is still too much waiting in the game - waiting for Steve to talk , or catch up . Also , when you are doing the activities , you do n't know how long you have to do them to earn the clue . Finally you quit the activity in frustration , and there 's the clue waiting for you . After this happened a couple of times , we realized we can do the activity as long -LRB- or as short -RRB- as you want , and still get the clue.We enjoyed playing going on the treasure hunt , but at times we shut down the game because we were frustrated and did n't want to wait any more .
 Its OK . I was surprised that it does n't teach you to count or the alphabet . It 's more geared towards vocabulary than conversation , so if you want to say , `` This is my window '' in Russian , than this is the one for you .
 I purchased this program so I could work on my will on my laptop . I found nothing in the information about the product which indicated it does not work on the newer Macs . It was a disappointment . The the company took it back with no problem .
 This product was totally out of date . The cd would not load , although on the book cover it stated that it is also for Mac . I called the company and they said that they have not made a cd for Mac users for many years -- last century !!! And they are up to Willmaker 12 or something -- VERY out of date !
 After nearly a year of using ME , I am sick and tired of it . At least six times , I have had to uninstall it and reinstall it after the system restore calendar and main help section have vanished from view . The last time I had to do this was this week and within a minute or two of establishing that the missing parts were there , they disappeared after opening MusicMatch to hear a cd . Whenever these two sections vanish , the send page function of the email program sends dat attachments instead of viewable pages . I am not alone in experiences these problems . I have talked to , at least , a dozen others who have had the same problems with thes turkey.When I first install it , it caused my computer to stop shutting down properly and I had to take it to the store where I bought it and have them put it in.This is a very poor product . It does n't start up any faster than Windows 98 and really does n't seem worth the trouble I have experience in the past year . The System Restore is one of the `` vaunted '' new features , but if it is n't available what so good about it?Complains to Microsoft are no good because they wo n't take responsible for an OEM . Complains to the computer company that put the OS in the computer are no good because they say Microsoft is responsible.I think I 'll hire a lawyer and sue Microsoft for false advertising .
 `` With the cutely named Windows Me -LRB- for Millennium Edition -RRB- , Microsoft raises the bar a bit with a new operating system that you 'll certainly want to consider for your next new PC . '' - Editorial ReviewI have ME on my desktop computer and I have so many problems with it , that I rarely use it . I have XP on my laptop computer and find it much easier to use with fewer problems.I constantly have to restart my ME computer because I get the blue `` System Not Responding '' screen . I have also had a lot of software trouble with ME . I ca n't even install AOL 9.0 because ME refuses to run the program.So , I have to spend the extra money to upgrade to XP on my desktop , but as long as it runs better , I 'm not going to complain . I would just like to use the computer after paying as much as I did for it .
 What makes Windows ME so bad ? for starters , The team of programmers that worked on it had no concept of memory management . Therefore , the operating system seems to crash at any given moment . On the other hand , my MAC owner friends have no problems with OS 10.2 Jaguar . Probably because Mr. Jobs was smart enough to base his system on UNIX . If only Bill Gates would see that a parent-child kernal like UNIX -LRB- developed thirty years ago !!! -RRB- is still more relieable than his over priced operating systems ! oh yeah , and UNIX is FREE !!!
 I have an Athlon 1.4 GHz machine . The temperature monitoring software came with my motherboard indicates a cpu temp of 59 under ME consistently . The funny thing is this same software shows my cpu temp is always 46 under win2k and xp.This is not the only problem I had with my ME . There were also millions of crashes , software failures , reboots . I just finally gave it up for the sake of machine . I wonder why MS released this garbage at all .
 Windows ME is even worse than Vista . Vista is much better than ME . I installed Windows ME on virtual machine , and on its first start up after the installation , it gave me the famous `` blue screen of death '' . Because of that , I 'm mad at the OS and I 'm going to be infecting it with malwares and have fun . I 'm gon na slaughter ME with viruses . No one should pay for this crap . Get Windows 7 .
 Windows Me is basically Windows 98 with a fancy new name to allude to the year it was released -LRB- 2000 -RRB- ... it was just some PR stunt . As with Windows 98 , Windows Me is crash prone ... so expect to see one BSoD -LRB- Blue Screen of Death -RRB- after another . I tried Windows Me back when it was released ... I went right back to Windows 98 ... and since then I have migrated to Linux.Really , there is no reason to use Windows 98 or Windows Me on ANY computer . If you have to have an OS but do n't want Windows XP or the upcoming Windows Vista , then your best best for your Wintel PC is to switch to an easy-to-use Linux distro such as Xandros , Ubuntu/Kubuntu , Linspire , or Freespire .
 This thing worked fine for a long time . I bought my laptop used and the old owner reported no glitches with Windows ME . But then I started having major , major problems . My computer would not shut off properly . It gave me the blue-screen of death , as SEVERAL tech consultantst called it . It also would n't allow me to install software without an uphill battle . I was new to computers and had n't heard the term `` firewall '' . So when I finally got a clue , I bought the Norton Personal Firewall 2004 -LRB- very good by the way , my next item on the list of things to review here -RRB- . Well , it would n't install . The old owner -LRB- a family friend -RRB- said he could install it while I did something else . It took HIM -LRB- my free consultant -RRB- about five hours to put it on . I thought that it might just be a problem with the software but that problem was not a one-time thing . When I finally upgraded to XP , it went on in 15 minutes tops as did everything else that needed to be installed . XP is so much better . ME is a waste of your money.I 'm only giving it 2 generous stars because it worked well for several months before it went bonkers . Oh yes and if you upgrade to XP , make sure to get Service Pack 2 , that has a firewall on it already . It 's not a really good one -LRB- and I would recommend adding Norton or Zone alarm to the Windows firewall -RRB- but it 's better than the nothing that you get with ME !
 I have Windows Me on an eMachine 667mhz 64 mb ram 13 gb hd . I see blue screens all of the time ! When I quit an MS-DOS Program -LRB- properly -RRB- I get 5 blue screens ! Then windows throws a dialog box at me then 5 more blue screens ! I am sick of Me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want stability , get Mac OS X , or if you hate Apple , get Windows 2000 or Windows XP -LRB- Pro or Home -RRB-
 Windows me is so unstable when I was in setup I would get errors . When finally got in windows I was getting errors like it was a joke . I personaly think windows me should have stayed beta because it could have been better than the one out now . It is so unstable and unreliable . When I first installed it I went to windows update there must have been over 20 critical updates already regarding windows me . So I recomend everyone to get on the nt kernel becuase 95-me was a JOKE ! nt kernel is so stable . I recomend windows 2000 or xp they are serious when it comes to computing .
 When they made Millennium Edition Microsoft invented the cure for which there is no known disease . There is no point to it.The real reasons for ME were Microsoft product lifecycles -LRB- 98 was getting to the end of it 's period and XP was too far away -RRB- and practicality . ME was a stepping stone to XP - but that was for MS 's benefit - not the poor soul who got stuck with ME.I have to add that I think that most of Microsoft 's products , including their operating systems , are generally fairly good , but Windows Millennium was a shambles and I bet Microsoft themselves are glad to see the back of it.Although a few people have said they have had good experiences with ME , they are the lucky ones . The main problem seems be to be device driver related . I bought a new machine with ME installed and the fun started when trying to use all of my existing peripherals . Although my CD writer software was ME compliant I still had massive problems with stability . I know a few who had problem with ME without having any legacy kit . A non-technical colleague said to me `` my machine came with the version of Windows that crashes a lot '' - no suprises which version.Microsoft added a few new features , such as system restore . It is a pity that it is so bug-ridden and resource hungry . On one occassion the system restore took me back six software installations instead of the one that should have been rolled back . After testing the concept out of us ME users you will be glad to know that it now works well in XP.Unfortunately if you like making HTML/ASP pages Microsoft saw fit to remove Personal Web Server from ME , although you can get it to work if your nerves are strong enough.Most of the other useful bits -LRB- latest versions of media player , IE -RRB- could be downloaded for 98 . Lets face it , if it had been any good Microsoft would have charged a fortune for the upgrade .
 This was my worst purchase in several years of computer use.It is not compatible with my Visioneer 7600 USB . I think bothVisioneer and Microsoft have problems . I spoke to severalgurus who service many computers and their consensus was thatthey would n't purchase it -- Windows 98 is much better . Somestores wo n't even sell it anymore ! It just is n't worth theproblems . Save your money and wait another year when Microsofteliminates bugs from XP .
 This product is just a piece of junk . Believe me , it is not worth the money it takes to buy it . My computer came with this automatically installed . Our last computer had windows 95 and i wish this one came with it too . Yes , it was slow , but at least it worked !!!!
 Be careful . Most DSL providers do not currently support this OS.If you want broad band access via DSL check with your provider first before moving to ME . SBC one of the largest providers of DSL in the US has no ETA set for supporting this product .
 I bought a brand new computer and it come with me installed on it and it has been a nightmare ever since . This system crashes all of the time or locks up and I am constantly turning it off at the surge strip because it has locked up and wo n't shut down . My husband and I bought some games to play and it locks up and wo n't even run the games . I have called to get technical support and they dont ' have a clue and I have had it . Going to take it in and get xp installed and save my self the headache !
 I program computers , and we had number of compatibility problems with this OS . MS dropped much of good old DDE , causing number of shell application to crash , including number of uninstall programs .
 When I went to Best Buy , I told them I wanted all the latest stuff for my PC . I did not buy mine right off the shelf . Unfortunately they hooked me up with this piece of junk OS . Of course at first I did not see anything wrong with it really but throughout the times I have used it , I wish I would have told them to put Windows 98 SE on my PC instead . Windows ME is not worth the disc it 's copied on , seriously do not bother with it . You will get error messages more than you would like to , and that includes the Blue Screen of Death . Anyone who would say to me , `` Oh , you just did n't know how to work with it , '' I will slap you silly . I have had this PC and Windows ME for about 4 years , so do n't you tell me I do n't know how to work with it . I tried to work with it , and it gave me nothing but grief . Now after getting a copy of Windows 98 SE just recently and applying some serious elbow grease to my PC , I now have a much better OS . If you have Windows ME , get 98 SE as soon as possible because it is still the best OS out there . All you people who say that Windows ME is good , you just have no idea what kind of crapola you have on your pc.This is the worst OS ever created , do not buy it .
 I have already written a review below . Titled `` Dissapointed '' It 's a more indepth review on Windows ME . This review focuses on my recent experiences with the `` Help & Support '' option.At first I was very excited about a new intergrated with Windows ME help option . HOWEVER I was extremely fustrated with it . I completely dislike the intergration with the Microsoft Passport option , with the logging in . I am also more fustrated with the option itself.I have tried around sixteen times to submit a report , and it consistently freezes my brand new 850Mhz PIII w/384MB of RAM PC . It freezes to the point of totally crashing my system and re-booting , or CTRL+ALT+DELETE to close it down . The Help section itself needs help only with the online surpport portion . The offline support option is very convienent and well made.I just wish that I could submit a problem at Microsoft 's Support web site . Everytime has been unsuccessful because it automatically opens up Help & Support . Overall it needs working and I hope to see a Patch very very soon .
 I thought i wasted money in getting games . Now I think i have wated money in getting yet another useless MS product . All the features provided in the ME version are either available for download free of charge , or are utterly USELESS
 I 've been a computer user since the pre-hard drive days and have experienced every version of Windows from 3.0 to Windows ME . Windows ME is the least stable of them all . It hangs frequently and there have been periods of time when I 've dread having to reboot because it was likely to hang again . I 'm tired of always seeing the Blue Screen of Death . We 're getting a new computer with Windows XP . I plan on wiping the ME off of the old one and reinstalling the more stable Windows 98se . Shame on you , Microsoft for foisting this program on the public !
 ... and I realized why . Rember GPFs ? -LRB- Global Protection Faults -RRB- from Windows 3.1 days ? Well , they do n't happen with newer versions of Windows -LRB- because applications are forced to run in their own protected memory space , and ca n't corrupt the other applications , because the OS -LRB- Operating System -RRB- prevents them from destroying each other . -RRB- But now Microsoft is increasingly integrating IE -LRB- Internet Explorer -RRB- into the OS . Likewise , it 's integrating Office into the OS . So bugs in IE or Office often cause the whole OS to act up , and force a complete reboot . For example , when I click on a link in an email in Outlook , IE , Outlook , and the OS and whatever other applications I 'm running freeze up until I kill IE . I 've reinstalled IE and Office , but it does n't help . This happened when I upgraded my Win 98/2000 IE5 .0 dual boot system . I tried to revert back to IE 5.0 , which had been working OK , but I ca n't , without -LRB- according to the warning message that pops up -RRB- breaking every MS application I 've installed - Word , Outlook , Excel , FrontPage , Access , etc. . I was better off before I upgraded .
 Why not the dos programs ? I ca n't believe that you guys would stoop so low not to have access to the program that made you born .
 First let me say this , do n't even bother thinking about purchasing this software !! This has to be one of the most unstable OS out there ! If you so much as even look at it wrong you have to restart it . Notice how they say `` System Restore quickly restores your computer to a previous state '' , it 's because you 'll need it when you have to reboot it 3 times each day ! It does have some great features bundled up into this packaged , but seriously , wait for the 2nd Edition to come out . In addition to they new features , you 'll find that it uses more RAM than previous versions . This can be bad news if you do n't have ample memory -LRB- what they have listed in the system requirements is a bare minimum . Maybe then they 'll fix the bugs , but for now it 's not worth the price they 've put on it . Stick with 952ndEd or 98SE .
 Trust me ! Stay away from this piece of garbage . If you like system hang ups and blue screens then this is the product for you . Driver incompatabilities and it will not recognize non plug and play devices . It you buy this GOOD LUCK .
 This has got to be the biggest waste of disk ever . I 've used different sorts of operating systems , from OS/2 , WIN 3.1 , WIN95 , WIN98 and Windows NT . Thankfully I did n't shell out any cash for this junk - it came prepacked with my HP Pavilion . It locks up the machine at the blink of an eye . Printing with my Canon Multipass has ceased . The help function is a joke - it needs help itself - it fails to initialize and displays a charming number to notify MS suppport with . The real kicker is that the help automatically pops up if there is a cancelled function or error in some other application that you simply backed out of . So , the helpless help comes up and locks the machine . If you want to spend lots of time rebooting the machine - go ahead and buy this . At least this OS boots real fast ... I 'm replacing it with Windows 2000 Pro .
 There are too many problems with this OS to count . Not to mention the other Microsoft programs that come with it , like WinDVD and Win Media player , which both stopped functioning 6 months after I bought my pc . There are problems with restarts and shut downs , as well as the occasional freeze-up . Although there are some handy new features , they definitely do n't outweigh the many and frequently occuring problems . Microsoft , like usual , fails miserably . Go buy a Mac .
 Having been a long time Windows user , I looked forward to each upgrade of the OS which Microsoft put before us , hoping for some improvement which would provide increased stability and improved memory management . And of course , to remove the need to reinstall every 3 months . Well , Windows 2000 was a total change in the OS , but not for the better for home users ; the NT core proved to be quite a problem for running even some of the latest software , not to mention hardware driver issues . And now Windows Me , which is targeted at home users , is just a facelift of Windows 98 , and not worth the money either.About eight months ago I decided to switch to the Macintosh for my home computing needs , after doing a bit of research on software availability , etc. . Let me tell you , I have never been more satisfied with a computer . All the ` good ' Microsoft products including Office are available for MacOS , as well as plenty of other productivity and entertainment software , including games.In short , I have saved a lot of frustration by leaving Windows behind . And believe me , I have n't looked back . - Michael
 I made a big mistake when I purchased this piece of junk version OS . It causes my computer to freeze up a lot , The Blue screen of Death is common in Windows Me , and it is very unstable . I would advise anyone who fell victim to this OS to consider purshasing Windows XP Upgrade . XP is a better OS . I 'm glad that Support for Windows Me will end on June 30 . 2006 . It is outdated , and will expose users to security risks . If you happen to have a copy of Me , please throw it away in the garbage and upgrade your computer to a more decent up to date Windows OS like XP and XP Home Upgrade with Service Pack 2 .
 I usually spend considerable time crafting my reviews on Amazon . However , in this case let me make it short and simple
 i had win 98 and got a new comp . and is awalys crashing bugging down and it dont run that many games . Also the internet programs run slower
 simply put . . why did my dad spend hard earned money on this trash ... i have to admit . . it was fun deleting the worthless shortcuts on the desktop
 For those who says that ME works properly , I would like to know which computer they have . ME is garbage ... I was going crazy everyday , reinstalling the program . I was a master , an expert doing that . An everyday new crash . I bought XP and my life changed , My girlfriend now loves me and everything is different in my life .

 Well yet again , people who rarely use their computer for anything more that a net-appliance have jumped on the microsoft bandwagon once again to support another lame implementation of the Win9x kernel.Lets face it folks , all it really is is Windows 98 TE -LRB- Third Edition -RRB- with some Win2000 ripped chunks stirred into the batter . Why would you buy a product that provides you with everything that is FREE off of windows update ? All the supposed benefits of ME -LRB- IE 5.5 , DirectX 7.1 , etc -RRB- are all FREE downloads ... so who cares if Win98 did n't have auto-backup of system files , and ME does ? Why do n't you use a REAL operating system like Windows 2000 ? Windows 2000 has a full repair process just like NT4
 We bought 2 HP Pavilions for our office with Windows ME loaded on them . They are a nightmare . You just simply have to get used to re-booting several times per day . I habitually restart the pc every few hours just to avoid the inevitable crash ... BR > At the very least , get XP or 2000 . Anythind but ME .
 1 . Fatal hardware conflicts .2 . Incompatability with everything . -LRB- Even itself -RRB- .3 . Consider yourself lucky if you get through the installation .4 . But if you thought that 's where the nightmare ends . That 's only where it begins . After installation is when the headaches stat to kick in .5 . Unexplained reboots .6 . Unstable .7 . Bug ridden8.POOR SUPPORT .9 . The Upadate package that Microsoft offers is useless . As are most of their updates concerning ME .10 . Trying to find a solution -LRB- on Microsoft 's website -RRB- for a specific error is a frustrating task . Microsoft just clutters everything into one area and you have to rumage through hundreds of pages just to find what you 're looking for . In many cases the sollution is not on thier website .12 . AND IT CRASHES ! I have n't gotten through one day without this happening.This is just touching the surface.Go to Yahoo and type Windows ME complaints and look at the thousands of results you 'll get . You 'll hear people say the same things over and over again
 Windows Me is completely incompatible with my Dell Dimensions 8100 series . I have investigated into every possible solution and the only one is to upgrade to the new and better XP . I hope this will work considering Dell is making me pay for the upgrade while my warranty is still in effect .
 ... it was invented . Windows ME came with my new machine a P1500 with 128 Megs of RAM . When the machine is turned on it loads at lightning speed.It 's all downhill from there . ME is unstable , crashes and locks up regularly . It is slower than my old pentium pro 200 with 96 megs of RAM running Win98 -LRB- which I have been forced to pull out of the closet to setup once again -RRB- If you are interested in connecting a web site to a database , or even just learning how to do it , -LRB- with a program such as Macromedia UltraDev -RRB- ME does not support Personal Web Server , so you will have to go back to 95 , 98 , or get Win 2000 to explore this arena .95 , 98 , or 2000 may be better choices than waiting for XP to come out . If you change the configuration of your computer `` too much '' , XP will lock up your computer and you will have to call Microsoft to get an code to unlock it . What will they think of next ?
 Well , let 's start from the beginning . Microsoft wanted to get something out for the big `` Millennium . '' So , they beefed up 98 with a few `` prettier '' functions , made things look a little different , packaged it off , and whoosh-an easy ten million . Now us , the people who rush out to buy the `` new '' Microsoft product and set it all up . Before you know it , everything 's gone wrong . Your RIO does n't work , your games are n't playing , and every time you try to fix it-something else goes wrong . Welcome to Windows ME . Ha . The only , possible way if you would use this is if this is your buisness-only computer because it 's okay at formatting . But anyone that 's a mediocre gamer , uses cameras , downloads games for palms , or does anything else except type . This not for you .
 It was an extremely painless and efficient installation process . However I was incredibly dissapointed with the OS . First all there is n't anything exclusive , besides the Windows Movie Maker . This software is n't that great . The video quality is so terrible . You can only save in Windows Media Format , not a plus for your friends that only use Real Player or Quicktime . And the choices for video quality is extemely limited . Unlike most video software , you can NOT choose the quality to crisp . It has high , medium and low . Low looks terrible , medium looks ok and high looks fair.It 's mainly intended for emailing these clips . Sometimes I like to make video clips , burn them to a CD/Zip disk and send to friends that way to preserve quality and sound . I also prefer Real Player files , over Windows Media.The System Restore feature is n't all it 's cracked up to be
 About nine months ago I decided to I wanted to use the Web so I bought my first Windows machine after using DOS3 .12 for over 11 years . It was Windows Me and I found it a completely unstable OS . I spend more time fixing things than using my machine . My help screen was reduced to four lines and some links that did not work . System Restore showed a date of December 1899 and would not work . IE crashes or hangs all the time . M$ knowledge base has such a poor search engine I literally spend hours trying to find an answer to my problems . I manged to get System Restore back but it still wo n't work . What kind of an OS is this ? I also get problems with WORD 2000 but as this is a review of Windows Me I wo n't go into that , except to say that M$ 's troubles are not confined to their OS . My TV set has run over 20,000 hours without a fault but I ca n't get 10 hours without a fault with Me . Bill Gate 's dream of the computer being the home entertainment centre is no dream - it 's a nightmare . If Micro $ oft ca n't produce an OS that is stable and reliable after 20 years in the business than they better give up . As for me I 'm putting LINUX on my HD and bye bye M$ aka WGIII.I would not advise anyone to buy this product .
 During the installation process for Windows ME -LRB- I was upgrading my laptop from 98 -RRB- I was presented with a myriad of screens telling me how great Windows ME was and how much change was influenced by `` customer requests '' and issues from their support department.Ironically , after the install completed and machine rebooted , Windows ME greeted with the infamous `` blue screen of death '' . After spending a couple of hours using the diagnostic tools packaged with ME and troubleshooting the problem , I was finally able to get my system up and running.After using ME for a couple days , here are the cold hard facts as I see them . This is a patch to 98 , this is not an upgrade . It contains a lot of multimedia extras that are available from Microsoft 's download site . The OS performance was not noticeably improved to me in any area . The startup process seemed faster by maybe 5 seconds tops on my 400mhz Pentium.The price of ME hardly justifies the added functionality that a previous Win98 user gains .
 I bought the computer from Dell , so I do n't have to bother to install it . However , the installation of other hardwares was like being grilled in Hell . My PC camera , my scanner , my printer , and lots of other drives are not compatible with WinME . The worse is most of manufactures do not have WinME compatible drivers ; or they just claim their drivers are compatible , and they `` should '' work ... Since my computer is still within 30 days after purchase , I am considering to change it to Win98 SE , I feel that 's the most stable edition .
 ... to release such a bad operating system.When I ordered my brand new computer with Windows Millennium Edition , I actually thought that is was a good idea . Oh boy , I was so wrong . The thing that persuaded me to buy it was the multimedia home-oriented goodies that after all proved to be totally useless . Believe me , you do n't want to spend 200 dollars in this OS only for Windows Media Player and the Movie Maker and stuff , the latter is awfully horrible.This OS is , as I 'm sure you 've read , the worst Windows ever released -LRB- and that will ever be released ! -RRB- . I 'm going to tell you about some of my problems with WinME . For some reason , it just has an EXTREMELY serious unstability problem . And I really mean that . And even though boot time is fast , I admit that -LRB- like 20 seconds or so -RRB- , I 'd rather wait 2 minutes in boot time but not have my PC crash about once every 30 minutes . For real . I find myself stuck hitting Ctrl + Alt + Del way much more than I should , and sometimes , the reset button as well.The networking code in ME is horrible . I 've had lots of problems with my cable connection because of the operating system.Another serious problem is the system 's extreme ability to get corrupted . And I am not talking about viruses here . Just install some hardware and see how ME becomes your worst nightmare.Just to show you the size of the problem , I 've been forced to reformat my hard drive 4 times in the last six months . That is an awful lot.Windows Me also seems to have a big problem with managing memory , and I find my computer freezing a lot with few applications open with a 256 MB RAM memory.I 've had problems with applications like Macromedia 's Flash and Shockwave players , Norton AntiVirus and Norton Utilities and I could n't install DirectX 8 the first time I tried -LRB- I had to reformat my hard drive later -RRB- . The System Restore program , which indeed seems like a nice idea and has been improved lots in XP , is totally useless . It wo n't return your PC to an actual working status , and when you are able to revert your computer to a previous moment , the saved copy is just way too corrupted to solve the problem . So ... a nice idea , but idea anyways.This OS was targeted for home use . But it 's the other way around . Forget about flawless gaming , downloading stuff from the internet and using your MP3 player or your digital camera.This OS is the maximum expression of unstability and unreliability . It 's plain crap . Simple as that.I really really recommend you to save yourself the headaches , the rants , and to prevent losing years of life by NOT buying Windows Millennium Edition . Do n't get fooled by the pretty packaging and the `` fancy '' multimedia apps . Do n't pay attention to those that say that Windows ME works great . If it does ... they have been extremely lucky . Just read most of the reviews and see for yourself.On the other hand , I do recommend you to buy Windows XP if you can get the extra bucks . Or get Windows 2000 . If you ca n't , then just stay with your Windows 98 SE or downgrade to it . But , stay 30 feet away from Windows ME . It 's not worth it . Believe me.I 've read several reviews and it seems that all Dell PCs wo n't be saved from WinME 's evil wrath . That is my case , too . Pretty odd . I read in one of the reviews that you 're making Dell pay for the WinXP upgrade . Seems like a good idea.SURGEON GENERAL 'S WARNING
 Okay , I have to admit , it really looks like Microsoft took Windows 98 SE , and added a few upgrades , like Movie Maker , WMP7 , a few new drivers , and slapped a new name on it . It crashes even more than the disappointing 98 versions.You really need to consider if it 's worth buying Me . I would reccomend sticking with your current operating system , upgrading to Windows 2000 -LRB- MUCH better -RRB- , or waiting for the final release of Windows Whister -LRB- A.K.A Windows 2001 , Windows NT 5.1 and Windows.NET 1.0 -RRB- , which will be Microsoft 's first consumer-targeted NT version.Forget about me .
 You could n't pay me to keep Windows ME on my machine . I was unfortunate enough to have it rammed down me throat as pre-installed software on my new Dell Inspiron 5000e , and have been going nuts ever since . In the three weeks that I have owned the machine , I have spent more of my time on the phone getting help trying to solve compatablity problems than I have spent actually using my computer.I estimate that I have wasted over fifteen hours in a failed attempt to make this OS do that which it can not
 I have to say that ME is the worst Operating System I 've ever encountered . Blue screen after blue screen error is all I get every time I played games on it . I even blue screen errors when I 'm not playing . I finally got fed up with and switched to XP . Much better OS than ME . Do n't ever consider buying this . It 's not a good idea .
 What ever you do , do not and I mean do not `` INSTALL THIS PIECE OF CRAP WINDOWS ME '' . I had It on my computer and It gives you errors . These errors are from the OS . The OS was not setup properly , Microsoft just rushed through with this OS to get it out to the market . Who ever `` UPGRADES TO XP '' is stupid . Buy the full version of XP . For example `` AN UNTRUSTED PERSON COULD UNINSTALL UPGRADE XP BECAUSE IT 'S IN THE Add/Remove PROGRAMS '' ME should n't even cost 55 bucks , It should be 99 CENTS for this garbage WinME . Even when I bought ME 6 years ago , I could n't get on the INTERNET ! Even when I set it up correctly and I was only 9 years at that time and now im 15 ! and I can build a computer from scratch ! If you buy ME your a dumb person . Id rather buy Windows Media Center or perhaps Windows 2000 , Windows 98 SE ! But Im telling for the finnal time If you buy ME do n't come crying to me because I know what this software can pull and It wo n't be somthing like `` THIS OS ROCKS !! '' and your gon na complain in 3 to 8 days saying `` OH MY GOD I CA N'T WATCH VIDEO '' and then your screwed . PLEASE GET SOMTHING XP BECAUSE I HAD TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THIS ISSUE AND I HOPE YOU PEOPLE WO N'T COME CRYING TO ME
 This is the worst Windows operating system I have ever come across . My computer crashes constantly and I have noticed many flaws in the performance of ME . I would have to say that chossing ME over 98 is the biggest mistake I have ever made and I hope that you read this and wo n't do the same .
 A recent newspaper software reviewer from my local area regarding the Windows ME operating system was quoted as to saying it was in fact , `` brain damaged . '' Upon first use by the average consumer one can see why such an accusation would be made.In this reviewers opinion , Window ME was found to be nothing more than an exercise in aggrivation . From all of the software crashes , mouse freezes , and system lockups there is no way the average user can call Windows ME an operating system at all . The only productive session I 've had was with the box that Windows ME came in . The box is a nice space to store more important software after the Windows ME OS materials have been emptied from it.There really is no need in trying to revamp or patch-up a product like this through upgrades because it seemed to be a lost cause from it 's inception ...
 Being a hardcore gamer and long-time user of Windows 98 SE , I was one of the first in line to buy Windows ME . At first , it looked like a no-brainer ... faster boot-up time , much bigger driver database , built-in IE5 , and 100 % compatibility with all my games -LRB- or so I thought -RRB- . To be completely honest , for the first few weeks I was a happy gamer . I liked all the features ME borrowed from 2000 , such as the customizable start menu . Then I found out that ME removed native DOS mode support and most of my pre-1998 games no longer worked . Then came the crashes ... not once has a day gone by without ME crashing.I like to compare Windows Millenium to Chinese water torture ... every time it crashes it usually does n't hurt anything but it sure is annoying . After almost a year of suffering , this POW is finally ready to talk.Benefits of Windows ME :1 . Faster start-up and shutdown times -LRB- at the expense of native DOS mode support -RRB- 2 . More customizability3 . Much bigger driver database -LRB- at the expense of HD space -RRB- Drawbacks of Windows ME :1 . Higher system requirements2 . Incompatibility with some ISPs -LRB- AOL , some broadband providers -RRB- 3 . Integrated features like IE 5 and WMP 7 are impossible to remove , so I hope you like them : -LRB- 4 . Poor stability -LRB- worse than original Windows 95 -RRB- 5 . Severe memory leak problems6 . System Restore feature rarely works and takes up massive amounts of HD space -LRB- mine reached 700 Mb before I figured out how to disable it -RRB- Here are my recommendations -LRB- caveat - Windows XP is n't out yet -RRB- : Windows 98 SE - Gamers or those with older computers -LRB- < 400 MHz or < 128 Mb RAM -RRB- Windows 2000 - Everyone else
 many problems with this slow , os . either stay with windows 98 or upgrade to windows 2000 professional , much more stable , then all of them
 The title says it all . Deserves a 0 star but that was not an option .
 It was really the worst exeperience I 've ever had with an operational system . I think I could even say it was the worst thing I 've bought over the past 20 years . I had to re-install the program literally more than 10 times . The system always crashed and it was impossible to work for a couple of hours withot having to reboot the comp for at least 3 times . I could never use my web cam , Windows Me always caused a a strange protection error . For several times the system became abslolutely impossible to use , whenever I did anything I got a message saying explorer has caused an error in a damned MSCVRT file . I had to start the computer using the inicialization diskette and lost a lot of information , not to mention that all my programs , including all of Office applicatives -LRB- like Excel and Word -RRB- stopped working . Windows ME was intended to be an operational system for the 3rd millennium , but it sems a first millennium abacus would do better.Artur Steiner
 I installed Windows ME over 98 hoping it would be a nice upgrade . I did n't expect a lot , but I did expect less crashes , better networking and generally better performance . Upon starting up ME for the first time my sound was not working . I called Creative for tech support on the card -LRB- SB Live Value -RRB- and they told me the drivers for 98 should work on ME . I uninstalled the card , re-installed it and then installed the drivers again , and my sound worked . I restarted the computer , and my sound stopped working again . I uninstalled ME after that , not wanting to deal with the problem that should be a very smooth transition . I also had a few problems with networking as I could not connect to things I previously could with ease . The majority of the programs it installed were programs I could download for free off the net . It installed things I did n't want installed like MSN and other Online Services and such . Overall I was not pleased at all , and I expect to see a Windows ME 2nd Edition coming out soon . I 'd only reccomend ME to someone brand new to computers , and does n't expect much from their computer usage , as it does have a better help guide and is generally more friendly to the common user . But that 's about the only positive .
 MSFT is tanking and maybe this is another ditch attempt by the Gates camp to charge once more for something that is not nearly as valuable . I wouldnt chip out 10 bucks for the ` extra ' features that this OS provides me with .
 this , in my opinion , is a pre release of Windows XP , which will be as stable if not more than win 2000 , but i ordered a new laptop from Dell with WinMe on it and it started with blue screen errors and random errors within probably 2 hours of use , luckily i could change to WIn2000 from Dell free of charge , it does n't matter how powerful your coputer even if it is 1.8 Ghz P4 , WinMe is toatly buggy you get very mad and frustrated with it very quickly , , do n't waste you money ...
 Actually , the worst operational system I 've ever had . I could even say it was one of the worst items I 've bough over the past 20 years . The program was always crashing and I had to re-install it more than 10 times . It was impossible to work for a couple of hours without having to reboot the computer . I coulkd never use my web camera , I always got a protection error in a damned MSVCRT file . And for several times the screen would become completely blue due to an obscure unexpected error . After re-installing it for more than 10 times , the system got into a real mess and whenever I did anything I got a message saying Explorer had caused an eror and would be closed . I had to start the computer from the initialization diskette and lost a lot of information , not to mention that all of my programs , including all of Office programs , stopped working . I had to re-install everything again . This situation happened twice . Windows ME was intended to be a software for the 3rd millennium , but it seems a first millennium abacus would do better . JUT TERRIBLE !
 You get errors/XP installs the Internet for you . ME hates you . XP is your friend . I had ME and I thought It was good . Then I discovered the truth . ME is n't good at all !!! It should be 5.00 instead of 199.99
 I have had ME since March 2001 . It has turned out to be the worst piece of junk you could imagine . Bill Gates should be ashamed of himself for sticking it to the public by ever releasing ME in the first place . I spend more time with boot up problems , shut down problems and `` just trying to get things done '' problems . This system could n't manage memory resources if it 's life depended on it - which I guess it does as it keeps dieing on me . In a nutshell
 I have been running ME for 4 years . It came bundled with a brand name system I purchased . I had so much trouble with it that I returned the system almost weekly and had it sent in for repair . I had the Hard drive replaced , the CD-Rom , and eventually the whole motherboard . Come to find out from my peers and online
 it chrashes more then all the cars around the world do in a day
 This is the single worst operating system i have ever used . I average approximately 4-5 crashes per day . God help you if you play any dos based games , most do not work on ME due to the way it handles memory .
 Well , lets just say that although I am a Microsoft fan , this piece of garbage should have stayed where it belongs , on the archived shelves of Bill Gates garage . Terrible , terrible , terrible ! ... Blue screens are much more evident , crashes , incompatability with many programs . Example : Winfax requires you pay for the 10.0 upgrade in order to keep faxing in ME . This is one of oh ... , about 10 of these experiences . Love , Win95 , love Win 98 , etc , but ME , a waste of the consumers time . By the way , the interface and tasks are not much different than Win 98 . What a waste . Stay away ! ... ...
 My dad just bought a 866Mhz PC with Windows Me on it . Within a month I had to reinstall Windows because the computer kept freezing up for no reason . Even now that I 've reinstalled it , there are still problems . Certain programs freeze up . The computer does n't always shutdown properly , causing me to turn it off manually . It takes two minutes from the time you fire the computer up before you can do anything . Of course , as Windows Me was part of a package , we did n't have to pay for it separately . But I would n't pay $ 5 for this `` Operating System . '' I hope you know that the letters ME stand for
 First there was windows 95 ... in 1998 there was win98 , in 1999 MS released WIn98 Second Edition , and then an all new Windows!not ... OK , in my humble opinion Windows ME is just windows 95 , 4th edition . After five years of having the same user interface , they 're close to getting it right . Furthermore they have included some new drivers for some new hardware , and a few minor apps to make video and stuff ... All in all not very exciting and nothing more than your average run-of-the-mill -LRB- FREE ! -RRB- Linux update . Certainly not worth the money ... And if only it would crash less ... alas!I realize this might sound like someone who drinks vinegar for breakfast , but I 'm pretty sure only very few people find what they really NEED in Windows ME.Just think about what you really need in an Operating System , and check what you can download from the internet . After all , the newest drivers can also be found at the site of the manufacturer . Also , Windows Media Player 7 -LRB- like anyone wants to use that ! -RRB- and Internet Explorer 5.5 can be downloaded for free from the web , so what 's the point of spending your valuable dollars on this misfit ?
 I bought a comp with windows me on it and tried to use nortons anit-virus 2002 without realizing it has an in compatability problem , now my whole hard drive is fried !! THANK YOU MICROSOFT !!! if you can avoid it , do it .
 Very unstable . My computer -- with 356 megs of memory -- crashes at least once a day and often several times because memory runs out , even though I do n't use anything more complicated than spreadsheets -- small ones at that -- and rarely have more than three applications open at one time -- a spreadsheet , word processor and browser . Locks up during shutdown about 50 % of the time , requiring a cold boot and scandisk . Then , scandisk often locks , requiring a second cold start , skipping scandisk . I had to reboot twice to get on-line to write this . Loading any software , even Microsoft products , causes problems -- the loaded software does n't work , something else does n't work , or the computer becomes unstable . These problems are are often difficult to fix and waste a tremendous amount of time . Stick with 98 or go to NT -- do n't stop here . Better still , go to Linux .
 I recently bought a new Dell computer -LRB- P4 , 1.8 GHz , 256MB RAM , 80 Gig HD -RRB- with Windows ME installed on it . Yes , I spent a fortune on this computer . NO , it was not worth it!First of all , I have to stare at the blue Windows ME screen for 5 MINUTES waiting for it to boot up . I have 98 on my old computers -LRB- from 1995 , and one from 1999 -RRB- they both boot in less than 30 seconds . -LRB- And YES , I do have all of that extra stuff in start up menu - msconfig - turned off -RRB- . I am running at 90 % free resourses.I have a Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart P1000 printer and a HP 5200C Scanner . I have not been able to successfully load the software from either one into Windows ME . NOTHING WORKS . I can get both items to do the BASICS , but I did not spend lots of extra money on the printer and scanner to just do the basics . I have even downloaded drivers from HP 's site for each product for ME , still no success.I get at least 5 runtime errors a day with this OS . And , I am only on the computer a max of 2 hours a day.I just ca n't use a computer if my hardware will not work . I have called Dell tech support multiple times over these issues . Each tech invariable states Windows ME incapatibility issues with hardware and software not made exculsively for Windows ME.Basically , this product is terrible - and , since I have to wait up to 2 hours to get support from Dell on every single issue , I have decided to return my entire Dell system - ME and ALL !!
 If you want a more stable OS , go with NT or 2000 . Maybe even Linux or Unix if you really want great stability.Let 's start a bit earlier ... CRASH '98 was a lot better than CRASH ' 95 , but only when it was up and running . '98 had a lot of startup AND shutdown problems . I downloaded a few patches from Microsoft 's site , but nothing helped . When it was up and running , it did stay up most of the time , even with some serious multi-tasking going on . It only crashed on me a few times during the year or so I had it . But the dreaded reboots would get me just about every time , and just about destroy my whole system.So I upgraded to CRASH Me . Now I have no more startup problems , but still have stutdown issues . And I get visited by the friendly blue screen of death again ! It is a multi-tasking nightmare , even with 512 megs of RAM , and even using Microsoft stuff -LRB- Access , Excel , etc -RRB- . Stick with NT for now , then maybe if Linux gets better go with that platform . Because it 's ovious Microsoft is n't .
 Since buying Windows ME when it first came out , I 've had to reinstall it several times -- every couple of weeks seems to be the average -- due to crashes and other mishaps.Also , the automatic update feature does n't work as well as hoped . I downloaded and installed some updates just fine , but was not able to install certain other updates.The System Restore function , which is supposed to let you restore your system to a previous point and was a major reason for my move to ME , only worked about a third of the time I had to use it . The other two-thirds of the time , WinME told me that I was unable to restore to the point I wanted.I 'd say , stick with 98 , as the new features are only incremental in nature . Or go with Windows 2000 , which is what I plan to do very soon .
 Bought a new Compaq Presario that came preloaded with Win ME . My biggest complaint is that they -LRB- Compaq and Microsoft -RRB- have cluttered the desktop with commercial inducements , some of which can not be removed ! It 's like buying a new TV that plays Sony commercials every 5 minutes no matter what content you 've chosen . I paid for an intellectual tool and I get someone else 's marketing platform . When are companies going to learn that we 're all not stupid consumers and that they have to show respect?So I upgrade to Win 2000 and find that the Compaq modem does n't work and Compaq informs me that it will never work under Win 2000 . Since the Win 2000 installation reformatted the hard disk and Compaq did n't include Win ME disks or CD-ROMs , Compaq expects me to pay for new software ! Over my dead body!Frankly , `` Pride comest before the Fall '' - Compaq and Microsoft should be taking that piece of wisdom to heart . Maybe I should look into Linux .
 Ive worked with microsoft products for over 10 years , and with all the hype behind Windows ME to make a change for the better , they should have just trashed it and started over . Since windows 98 microsofts attempts at making a better OS has been failing . I will say win2000 Is awsome . But this last attempt at a win9x system is sad . I have never had programs sit and wait before like in ME . Waiting for what ??? I have no idea . But the programs sit for 10seconds to 1 minute waiting to run . Or the programs get paused and you cant access it temporarily . No other version of windows I have used has done this to me . The internet connection lags alot also . If you need a OS to get your PC going , This one doesnt seem to be the right one to go with .
 the only reason i even put a star is because you have to . this is the worst attempt by microsoft to `` make life easier '' for the computer world . i have spent 2 days trying to install this software and now it cant locate my USB 's . DO NOT BUY THIS !!!! microsoft should have called this Windows NE -LRB- Nightmare Edition -RRB- .
 I have this OS on an old laptop and it is truly madning . Crashes like there 's no tommorw . Security holes the size of the ozone .
 If you like frequent crashes , freezing and the inability to use certain programs such as System Restore , by all means , go with Windows ME . I bought my computer new with the ME program on it and within 3 months I was an expert at re-installing the ME program . Every time I would download clip art or anything from the internet , ME would begin going haywire . I would have to erase my download immediately or ME would continue to disentigrate until I 'd have to totally erase my computer and re-install the ME program , as well as all my hardware software ... and after a while , ME did not want to accept any of my printer , scanner , camera or drivers hardware . It would just keep telling me it could n't find it . Ca n't wait to get rid of it !!!
 I Have a Windows ME Computer and a Windows XP Computer . The only reason why I am keeping ME is because I can play Star Trek TNG
 It is the worst operating systerm I have ever used . I ca n't hook my webcam or microphone up . DO NOT buy this product !!!
 2 and a half years ago , I purchased a major brand PC that came bundled with Windows ME . I can not overemphasize how unstable and prone to daily crashes , freezeups , and error messages this lousy operating system is !!! The PC has plenty of muscle , with over 300 MB of RAM -LRB- expanded -RRB- , and a P3 , 1 gig processor . Obviously more than enough power for Win ME . To add insult to injury , even the ` control alt delete ' function ' did n't work in many instances when I needed to get out of a frozen screen ! Multiple e-mails and calls to Microsoft were NEVER returned ! I realize Gates is in the catbird seat when it comes to operating systems for PC 's , BUT you would think that THE major international giant for this kind of software would put more effort in creating and TESTING a major consumer O.S. BEFORE releasing it , and that they would care enough to issue recalls for it , or at least answer any customer service inquiries regarding this dog of a system . My respect for Microsoft has plummeted bigtime after being saddled with an essentially inoperable O.S. that hinders my productivity . What a black eye for Microsoft and a waste of money for consumers . Let 's not even get started if you want to count all the aggravation and agita Win ME is responsible for !!!
 Very unstable .

These problems are are often difficult to fix and waste a tremendous amount of time . Stick with 98 or go to NT -- do n't stop here . Better still , go to Linux .
 My experience with Windows ME has been horrible -- and I see no improvement on the horizon , short of going back to Windows 98 or paying Microsoft more money for yet another Windows release . In four months of use -LRB- ME came with a new Dell PC -RRB- , I 've suffered two major crashes that service technicians attributed to ME . There seems to be some glitch between ME and Word 2000 , which also came with the computer . Further , as an AOL subscriber , there is some kind of incompatabilty betwen ME and AOL . Get used to waiting to get quick access to AOL and do n't be surprised when you 're given the news that AOL has disconnected you . A problem with AOL ? No , when I revert to Windows 98 , using the same AOL access telephone numbers , no problem.I 'm profoundly disappointed with Microsoft for apparently rushing to dump a flawed operating system on an unsuspecting public . Equally disappointed with Dell for distributing this horrible software.Where are the lemon laws for software ?
 I got a new laptop with ME installed . Its a 750 PIII with 128 mb ram and 12 . gig harddrive . I 've had nothing but trouble with ME since I first booted the machine up . I ca n't get hardware to work with ME , even though it 's listed as ME compatible so far I 've tried several different mouse , a printer , digital camera and a zip drive . I 've downloaded drivers for the different items and still no luck , I want to go to Windows 2000 but will probably lose some features like FireWire . If you want to ever be able to hook up any addtional hardware to your system then do n't get ME .
 Unfortunately , ME came with a brand new computer that I purchased last year . I have had nothing but trouble with this operating system . It 's terrible and full of bugs . I wish I could give it less that one star .
 Windows ME is not what I expected . I would n't even give this product a 1 star rating -LRB- no other choices -RRB- . It has crashed my computer so many times since I got the software , I 've lost count . It is not worth the money you pay for it . Microsoft should give it away for free . Even then I would n't touch it . I 'm going to enjoy deleting it when I get Windows 2000 .
 This program has so many bugs and problems that I ca n't even begin to list them all . The sound wo n't work , and the video wo n't work , because it assigns the wrong IRQs to the cards . When you shut it down , the only way to get any life out of your computer is to unplug it and plug it back in again . I have tons of hard drive , memory , processor speed , and so forth , but Windows hangs up and freezes two or three times a day . I 'm buying the Windows 2000 upgrade , just so I can get rid of this turkey ! It really should get zero stars , or even minus five stars .
 When I bought my computer 18 months ago , it came with Windows ME . After reinstalling it 3 times in that 18 months due to its instability , I finally broke down and bought XP . You see , if you try to install an application built to run with Win95 , not only will WinME not run it , it will gradually cause the system to fail . Then again , sometimes it will just go on the blink for no reason at all . All of a sudden your modem gets a configuration error , or your sound stops working , and you have no idea what caused it . For some reason , it would load extra devices like crazy until it dragged performance down to nothing . About every 4 months , I would have to go into safe mode and delete the extra devices from the device manager . At one point , the device manager showed that I had 60 primary and secondary IDE controllers loaded for my hard drive.Anyway , take my advice and buy the Windows XP upgrade instead . It 's cheaper and more stable by far .
 just got windows me . It is the worst o/s I have ever seen . It crash 's 10 times more then windows 98 and if you work at home and have windows 2000 and like to make the computer a twin boot it wo n't work well with it . Just do n't buy it .
 The result of an incestuous union between Windows 98 and Windows 2000 , there was always something about this inbred child of an operating system that just `` was n't right . '' As the Millennium is fast receding into a foggy distant memory , so too , thankfully , are instances of this ill-conceived operating system on the desktops and laptops of the world.It is not just the familiar freezing and random crashing of programs , the ubiquitous blue screens of love , or even the maddeningly mismanaged memory resources that causes the most anguish to the Windows ME end-user . It is , ultimately , the overwhelming sense of betrayal felt by those loyal Microsoft customers , tired of waiting for Windows 2000 to appear when this petard was hoisted by the mega-company , that stings the most.If you happen to purchase a used pc containing Windows Millennium on it , please be kind to your tech support guy and let him reimage your harddrive with Windows XP , rather than subject him to the sleepless nights and loss of hair symptomatic of that pitiable breed of IT professional
 Windows ME came with my computer and I 've had lots of problems with it ... it crashes much more frequently than it should and every time I turn on my PC , Norton Anti-Virus pops up with an error message about `` suspicious script '' which I think is actually a glitch in Windows . The worst was when I installed a scanner and the windows explorer program stopped working altogether ... I had to use system recovery and lost all my files and programs . Ouch . The guy who works at the computer help center at my university advised me to switch to Windows 2000 as soon as possible because ME is notoriously bad .
 In March 2001 I purchased my fisrt ` home PC ' , a Dell . Within the first week I had problems with the MS Win Me OS that included -LRB- but is not exhaustive -RRB- : Frequently having to use ` control-alt-delete ' to get out of various Outlook Express e-mail functions that I grew to live with.Inordinate long time to bootFrequent ` seizing up ' of computerInability of Millennium to ` accept ' my HP CDRW . -LRB- HP techs spoke of ` ghosts ' on my OS . I was unable to access ` Safe Mode ' to allow the HP techs defeat the ghosts . -RRB- But what was most annoying and troubling to me was that it sounded as though my hard drive was ` on ' as though it was continually ` looking ' for ` something ' that was n't there.It seemed that invariably the advice that I got from Dell was either to reset the ` registry ' or to reload Millennium . Mind you that this is advice after only a month.I called for Earthlink -LRB- my ISP -RRB- , HP and Dell tech support -LRB- the latter two in particular . MS tech support is a joke - but that 's intentional , right ? -RRB- often enough and displayed such copious quantities of frustration with what Microsoft calls an ` operating system ' that they often took pity on me , let down their professionalism and confessed to me that in their opinion MS Millennium was junk or in their words , `` extremely unstable '' . After about six months of utter frustration I purchased MS Win 2000 -LRB- with trepidation
 Do you miss having your computer suddenly freeze on you leaving you no option but to praise the almighty and whoever invented the reset button ? Do you want to gnaw your nails , tear out your hair and coming within an inch of going postal and wasting whoever crosses your path over the next 24 hours ? Do you want the experience of contemplating suicide while looking at a blue computer screen ? Purchase Windows Millenium for these life altering experiences and more . Guaranteed for maximum frustration and inducing the impulse to smash your PC . `` nuff said '' .
 If you consider yourself an expert computer user , there is absolutely not a single reason why you should upgrade to Windows Me . First of all , it is merely a point release to Windows 98 -- like a bugfix . Except that they accidentally created hundreds more bugs along the way , so you 're still not getting a benefit . Most of the added features are big , bulky gewgaws like Windows Media Player 7 , which sports quite possibly the most insipid user interface of any application I 've used since 1986 , and is impossible to remove once it is installed . Internet Explorer 5.5 is included , except that it 's not the _ final _ build , so you 'll have to go to Microsoft 's web site and download an 11 megabyte IE upgrade the instant you install WinMe.Old-school folks who are into DOS games and apps will find that Windows Me has completely removed the `` real mode '' DOS startup option , so you are effectively screwed there . You can get creative and make boot disks with some files from Windows 98 , but it 's ridiculous that this is even necessary . Windows Me is still running on top of a 16-bit DOS operating system ; Microsoft is just trying to make their product look better by hiding that fact , to the detriment of us all . No one is helped by the removal of a menu option to boot to real-mode DOS . NO ONE.Professionals who tinker with Photoshop or other development tools are advised to get Windows 2000 . It 's incredibly stable . Gamers and novice home users are advised to stick with or obtain Windows 98 Second Edition . There is absolutely no reason to get Windows Me . The new features they added are unreliable , and beyond that there is no difference between WinMe and 98 -- other than the fact that WinMe crashed my system twice as often and took real-mode DOS support away . Real helpful.Avoid Windows Me like the plague .
 I 've just signed for a new computer with ME installed and your reviews have scared me ! They would n't be so scary if they were more specific
 I bought this because of the low price and learned the adage -LRB- once again -RRB- `` you get what you pay for '' . The box is pretty , the manual confusing with a very non-standard way of describing keystroke actions . Most importantly , I could n't keep the program running without a crash for any length of time -LRB- I have a 3 year old PC system running Windows 95 with a 266MHz processor -RRB- . I finally gave up trying to use it .
 Locked up somewhere in this program I think is some very useful software -- but how to get at it ? The brief tuturoial is full of non-standard usage and poorly defined concepts , plus following it exactly does n't give you the indicated results . Technical support from Data Becker is non-existent . No technical support toll-free number , no FAQ list on their web site -LRB- I thought maybe I was the only buyer of this program -RRB- and e-mail to their web site goes unanswered . I have used other CAD programs that were SIGNIFICANTLY more intuitive . But buy it if you have the time to experiment and play with it -- maybe you will have more luck than I.
 Plenty of hints that this was tranlated from a German Software product , including mis-spelled English field names and some even left in German ! Obivously not designed for non-engineers . There are no simple project examples , arcane instrucitons , and some translation issues that are strange . Worse problem of all is that printing is nearly impossible without someone to teach you specifically how to set it up with a particular printer and driver . I was completely unable to get it to print on 8x11 paper , and the system will not subdivide a project like a spreadsheet would in printing . No print to size command either !!! Really a waste of time unless it comes with course . JL
 If you are used to using modern programming IDE 's such as Visual C++ , you will hate using this . It 's like going back to the coding stone age . It has a bizarro interface that some code monkey must have designed all alone in a closet 10 years ago . It does n't look like it 's ever been updated . NO automatic syntax completion ... UGH ! C'mon , this is 2001 ! This means always digging through Palm 's Acrobat Reader -LRB- ick ! -RRB- files for the function parameters , etc. . This will burn up some serious time for you , especially if you 're learning . Online help ? Yeah right . You 'll spend 1 - 2 weeks just getting this thing configured , and learning how to use it 's arcane interface . But once you 're going - as another reviewer stated - it has integrated debugging , etc. . So apparently it 's the best IDE for Palm development going . -LRB- sigh -RRB- I 'm going to see if I ca n't configure Visual C++ to write the code , and just use this for debugging.Metrowerks makes specialized IDE 's that nobody else wants to bother with because of the comparatively small developer market - such as for game consoles , etc. , so typically they 're the only choice . 3Com now has their name on it , maybe they 'll rework it and bring it into this millenium .
 This is 3 versions back from the current version but I 'd be VERY skeptical about purchasing anything from this company if they released something like this.As I mentioned , it 's buggy . On the minor side , the help files are n't complete . I 'm constantly getting messages about missing files . I 've even checked the disk and they are n't there either . The tutorial that comes with it is n't bad but sometimes references options that are n't available on this version of the application . It 's like they wrote it for a different GUI.On the major side , I 'm constantly having to close the application after debugging the app once . It 's possible this is caused by me using the Palm emulator instead of my Palm device , but I really have to doubt it . In fact , one error that seems to cause me to close and reopen is publicly known by Metroworks , but there is n't a patch in sight.In the middle , it just does n't help the developer . For instance , I wanted to add a resource file to one of the groups of my project . Their is no `` Right mouse click , add '' context menu , only delete , like that 's the only option I would want to choose for a folder . So , up to the menu bar I go to choose `` Add file '' only to be given the error , `` At least one file could n't be added to the selected target . '' To fix this you have to choose a a linker and post linker from the projects setting options . If that was the case , why not tell the developer that this is what needs to be done . The error message they provide just leave one wondering what to do next.It 's possible I 've gotten use to using Visual Studio , which actually helps the developer in the creation process . This apps only strength is the form creator . For one thing , it seems to work , but when I drop form components onto the form , it 's just an outline . Again , I 'd like to see something like what Visual Studio shows in form creation.I really wanted to start writing some palm apps but I 'm starting to think it 's not worth it.I know Palm offers a dev environment , but I do n't see a trial version of it so I ai n't paying $ 20 for something that could be just as useless .
 Windows ME has made me Windows SICK ! This thing crashes more than a drunk in a game of bumper cars ! I ca n't run multiple programs at the same time without the thing freezing ! I 'm taking a BIG risk right now because I 'm downloading an MP3 as I write this review . This is the second time I have to download it because Windows ME shut down half way through the last time I tried it ! -LRB- ... -RRB- Do n't buy this junk !
 I just installed this yesterday and have already uninstalled it becasue it causes major computer problems , including tons of crashes on a three-month old 933 Mhz P3 with 256 MB RAM and plenty of HD space that NEVER crashes with Win 98 . Now that I unistalled it , Win 98 is working fine again and relatively error-free . Most of what comes with it is available without the upgrade.It also appears to be a sorts of `` Windows for Dummies '' version . A lot of the control panel options which allow you to make changes are hard to access or gone . The only advantage seems to be that it lists things in the Start Menu in alphebetical order and that it loads faster , when it loads correctly -LRB- about 33 % of the time -RRB- .
 Ok so in November of 2000 I got my first computer not knowing anything much about computers back then I got a Gateway 900mhz with an Amd Atholon processer and guess what it came with Windows Me . The sales person was boasting all of this bull **** about how much better it was than windows 98 and yes I bought his bull **** story and got the computer for 1200 bucks . Ever since then I have always had probelms with it it would freeze up a lot and I would always have to use the control alt delete feature to get it working again and sometimes I would have to shut down the computer manually to get it to work right . One day my printer stopped working and I was on the phone for like an hour with the tech support and could n't get it to work . Since then I have n't had a printer . And then about a couple of weeks ago I bought an HP psc 2355 printer and it printed and it copied but I could n't get it to scan !!!!!! And I could n't get any of the printing software to work !!!!!!!!!!! . I was so frustrated because when I called hp and talked to their tech support I was on the phone for f *** ing two hours and still could n't get it to work even the guy from hp said the operating system sucks . So then I took it back to Wal-mart where I bought it from and got my money back . And then I went to best buy and got me an epson 4600 all in one and the sales guy from epson told me that it would work with my system and the sales guy from best buy told me it would work . And when I got home and tried the printer it would copy but it would n't print or scan and if I turned my computer on with my printer on it would n't boot up to the desktop I kept getting all of these error messages . I could n't call tech support because it was n't toll free so I tried reinstalling the stystem and reinstalling the software but it was doing the same thing and even worse to where the computer would n't boot up at all the computer would n't shut down at all with out turning off the surge protecter so as frustrated as I was I went back down to best buy and got a refund for my printer and talked to somebody from the geek squad and they asked them to diagnose my system for probelems . The guy said well ... it would cost sixty bucks but he said honestly it would be a waste of time he told me that I should put that sixty bucks toward an upgrade to windows xp so I took his advice and I did , but I had to pay one hundred bucks for the software and sixty for the installation but it was worth it my computer is running better than ever before , even though I have n't bought another printer yet , the tech guy said it would work for sure . So in conclusion if you do n't want to go through what I went through do n't get windows me get XP . Me is fore more errors .
 It freezes if you actually make your computer work . If you do n't ever try to multitask it wo n't freeze . Duh . Hey , if you only bought that $ 1000 dollar computer to play Minesweeper and check out spam ads for septic-tank cleaners and Viagra , feel free to use Windows ME . If you actually want to play real video games , play media files , surf the net , and chat -LRB- all at the same time -RRB- , get Windows XP . ME stands for Many Errors -- be warned !
 All I can say is , the computer I had with Windows 95 on it is still running strong at my parents house , whilst this one I bought new with Windows ME on it constantly hangs up and crashes.Thank goodness all the new computers have XP on them now . I ca n't wait to get one .
 Windows ME is basicly a poor attempt by Microsoft to get people to upgrade from Windows 98 . This OS works ok on most peoples systems for a while , but about 10 people I know who have this OS , or had this product , moved to another Operating system eventually . It seems to be great the first couple of months you have it , but then starts acting weird , and eventually crashes . I have had windows 98 on a computer for years without having to reload . Probably explains why Micriosoft took it off the market so quickly .
 I used this software to upgrade from Windows 95 and the only advantage I 've found after using it for three weeks is that my computer shuts down a little faster . Other than that , everything else happens much more SLOWLY than it did before . This has been a big disappointment.TO MICROSOFT
 Awhile back I had purchased an upgrade to ME for my 98se machine , thinking that it would run OK even though everyone that I talked to that knew what they were saying said that it was the worst . I happily installed it , restarted a couple times for my hardware to configure itself , and watched my computer blue screen after about 5 minutes of personalizing my settings . At first I thought it was an id10t error -LRB- idiot , haha -RRB- , so I ignored it , rebooted , and continued to be appalled at the frequent number of crashes and bugs Microsoft loaded this hunk of junk with . Half a day later , 98se was back on my machine and normal as usual . The end .
 Windows `` Me '' is very unstable and bug ridden . If you have '95 or '98 then you are better off keeping it.However , if you have the money for Windows 2000 Pro , go for that .
 I have completed a few Windows upgrades before . This by far was the most difficult to complete . First there were the multiple driver updates I needed as reqirements . Then when I completed the updates and the install I found more problems with Power Management . I am returning this product immediately .
 First there was windows 95 ... in 1998 there was win98 , in 1999 MS released WIn98 Second Edition , and then an all new Windows ?! not ... OK , in my humble opinion Windows ME is just windows 95 , 4th edition . After five years of having the same user interface , they 're close to getting it right . Furthermore they have included some new drivers for some new hardware , and a few minor apps to make video and stuff ... All in all not very exciting and nothing more than your average run-of-the-mill -LRB- FREE ! -RRB- Linux update . Certainly not worth the money ... And if only it would crash less ... alas!I realize this might sound like someone who drinks vinegar for breakfast , but I 'm pretty sure only very few people find what they really NEED in Windows ME.Just think about what you really need in an Operating System , and check what you can download from the internet . After all , the newest drivers can also be found at the site of the manufacturer . Also , Windows Media Player 7 -LRB- like anyone wants to use that ! -RRB- and Internet Explorer 5.5 can be downloaded for free from the web , so what 's the point of spending your valuable dollars on this misfit ?
 Hello ; I thought I would give you a review on this program . It has to go a long way to beat 98 , but it is getting there . It has some bugs in it and I am havoing a hard time finding out how to deal with them . I have tried all I know which is n't much , but still not able to get it working the way it should . If you have any ideas and can help would love it . I do like the program but liked my old one better ...
 There is no difference from WinMe form Win98Se , you can just download Media Player and the new IE , and you got Me . All Me is , is a graphical user interface built on Dos without any stable foundation , All it is is a 1985 Graphical Dos Program
 When I got my new computer from gateway , it came with windows ME . At first , I thought it was better than Windows 98 , until I tried to run Microsoft Word 2000 . Crash ! When ever I try to run any program , 95 % of the time it crashes ! I had to erase the hard drive and install windows 98 !
 It was worthless ! Could n't use it because it did not havea code enclosed . Maybe it was an oversight.At any rate , it is totally useless to me . : -LRB-
 Generally speaking , to get the best performance from any operating system a clean install of a full version is recommended . The best choice is to choose a full version of the product and enjoy the benefits of not being left with artifacts and leftover 's of your previous operating system which can lead to instability in certain cases . I would only buy this on a limited budget .
 Actually , blue screen special . With words not meant to endear one to the product - like `` error '' over and over again . I have followed all the advice from Compaq - my new `` computer '' with no luck , including BUYING ... restore disk - guess what did n't get restored . I should have bought a Dell like the young man says - and a Windows 98 V. 2 OS .
 Wow ! Now this is trash . Bought it at 10 am , and just finished uninstalling it 7 pm the same day ! The install was going great , although I did have to uninstall Norton Internet Security before I could continue . After the install , my system froze up at least 30 times . I can verify that the boot sequence is very fast , almost non existent having watched it sooooo many times.Couldn ' t even get on the internet after I installed it either . Dialed up , verified name and just hung ... had to try reinstalling modems , drivers the whole deal.Uninstall went great so far and as you can tell , I 'm back online.Windows Me -- Windows Must eliminate . Or just wait for the WinMe 5th edition . They should have the bugs worked out by then : -RRB- If you had a similar problem with WinMe , let me know if you fixed it .
 There is very sketchy industry support for this release of windows . Do n't assume that if the software is recommended for 95/98/NT that it will run on ME . It probably wo n't . I have a brand spanking new P4 with which I can do next to nothing without seeing kernel32.dll errors . ME gracefully handles these by freezing . I had to unplug my computer in order to reboot.Looking on tech support sites -LRB- not MS 's of course -RRB- it is clear that I 'm not the only one having problems.Here 's a list of what I 've found that has conflicts with ME
 Me does crash your sytem more often ! Not just me , but friends pc 's also . It consumes more memory resources . System restore is at times unreliable . Most people I know have went back to Win98 SE or 2000 professional . You be the judge .
 If you are tempted to buy this product just back away from the computer . If you feel you will be unable to control yourself then rip out your connection to the internet and do not , I repeat , DO NOT visit any software stores . Windows ME is the fowlest software to be released by Microsoft since it 's ill fated release of Windows 3.1 . It is highly unstable , and if anything goes wrong you can not tweak it easily . Stick with windows 95 or 98 , if you want to upgrade choose Windows 2000 , and if you have Windows NT you should n't even be thinking of installing Windows ME .
 A waste of money and plasic . The installation was a nightmare . After I finally got the system up and running , I walked away from it for 10 minutes , came back to only find the `` Blue screen of death '' waiting for me . And then periodically , I 'll walk away and come back to find the entire system has frozen , mouse and everything . This is all Bull Sh -- . Come on Microsoft , we made you the company you are by buying your crap , stop marketing unstable crapware . -LRB- Thank god for Linux -RRB- If your upgrading from win98 make sure you take out anything that automatically starts up , ie . startup folder , run registry key . Also uninstall any anti-virus software and disable any networking you have for a login . Bottom line is
 I upgraded one of my 95 machines , and the problems started immediately . The system seems to go into a `` let me think about this awhile '' state , that is not explainable . Maybe some of my drivers are wrong , but hey ... shouldnt the install find that out ???? I had to wipe the HD and install 98 , which is performing quite well indeed ! The features that this version gives you are not much of an improvement over 98 . If you want a more powerful system , NT is alot more stable than this `` attempt '' . There is also always Linux : -RRB-
 I was having numerous problems with my Windows 98 crashing , freezing up , error messages of all kinds and appearing everywhere , plus `` Extended Memory SB16 Emulation Driver '' not loading . I had gone to on-line tech support countless times trying to get my problems fixed . I then ordered `` Windows ME '' thinking that might solve some of my problems and EVERY review I could find and every individual and tech person I talked to about `` ME '' said , DO N'T buy `` ME '' . -LRB- Now I have to return `` Windows ME '' -RRB- . I was told it only creates more problems than it fixes . So I bought `` Windows 98SE '' , -LRB- Second Edition -RRB- and after installing it and with a little more tech help , my computer is fixed . I will wait for `` Windows XP '' which is to be released in October to upgrade further .
 I attempted to load ME as an upgrade to Windows 95 on an older computer , a 200 MHZ Pentium . When the upgrade was complete , Windows ME no longer recognized that I had a CD-ROM and I could not log onto the Internet . Windows ME did not recognize my Network Card , a Linksys Etherfast 10/100 PC Card , and I could not upgrade the driver . Luckily , I could easily uninstall Windows ME and will never again make the mistake of upgrading an operating system . A total waste of money and a piece of software junk .
 We are at a point where 10g + hardrives , 128m + memory , really sophisticated drivers , Shockware , DirectX files and the like have become a way of life . So , having to rebuild your system from scratch from time to time -LRB- some folks luck out and never have to do this , I do -RRB- can take 10 - 12 hours.With what appears to be an exponential increase in the amount of files , drivers , applications , OS that have to work together harmoniously , upgrades -LRB- as opposed to the full product -RRB- are becoming a not so good idea . Reason
 Let me play the devil 's advocate -LRB- but a nice guy -RRB- ; As the hard drives go from kilobytes to megabytes to gigabytes & shortly terrabytes , and as we install more and more memory , 128m + -LRB- I remember when only Main Frames had 128m ! -RRB- we are going to continue to put more and more and more stuff on our disks.How will these dozens/hundreds of applications , countless thousands of application/system files , and many many drivers all work together harmoniously ? They wo n't . Why ? because they ca n't . Too much stuff!The solution that worked for me ; I reformatted my disk -LRB- forget uninstall programs , they miss stuff , wipe that sucker clean -RRB- and I installed the 25 % that I really needed and forgot about the other 75 % that I just wanted . The wanting , and all of that enticing free space on my disk is what caused the problems.If you say , ah , the heck with that ! I want lots of stuff ! Fine . O.K. fine , it 's our God given right as americans to complicate our lives and take as many tranquilizers as we want . But in this case , I believe it may be to one 's advantage to think of the full OS , rather than an upgrade . Upgrades and lots and lots of stuff can not co-exist . On the other hand , lots and lots of stuff and buying the full operating system will probably cut your tranquilizers in half . If you stop and think about it , in this `` I want a car that I can drive 75 mph and get 80 miles a gallon '' society , that 50 % savings on over the counter drugs is n't such a bad deal.It 's a start , anyway . Peace , pax -LRB- whatever -RRB- - a lonely -LRB- but nice -RRB- guy .
 Everything you hated about Windows 98 , but accelerated !
 I only rated one star because zero stars is not an option . It has taken me six days with a lot of expert help to get back on the internet . Windows ME is a complete waste of time and money . The only good thing I have to say is that Windows ME makes it easy to uninstall . If you buy this product be sure to back up your system files as I can guarantee you will need to go back to your original system . I wanted the upgrade so I could download files from a gift digital camera . -LRB- Would n't work with Windows 95 -RRB- . I am now getting Windows 98 and will use it to upgrade my system . Suggest this or Windows 2000 and skip Windows ME .
 I would n't have believed you could come up with an OS flakier than Windows 95 ! My brand new laptop that came pre-installed with ` Me ' blue-screened before it even got completely booted when i started it up ! In four days of use I 've had to use my ` Recovery ' disks twice already . Buying this new computer would have been a great excuse to switch to Apple and get a Powerbook but i thought i 'd give you one more chance ; my mistake .
 Windows ME is not capable of ever being compared to Windows 2000 , not even Windows 98 . It is a good upgrade for those of you running Windows 3.0 , but if you have Windows for Workgroups v3 .11 or above , with the exception of 98 second edition - stick with it ... ME is 98 with some bugs taken out , more added into it.Most software does not work with it , if you have an older computer , get NT or 2k , or switch to Linux , you will save yourself a ton of hassle ... or just upgrade your PC and use XP .
 The ONLY reason I 'm even giving this software a 1 is because negative numbers are n't available . My computer did fine with ME until I installed Office 2000 pro , and updated my office files . After that , office did n't work anymore . I had to uninstall and reinstall office to get it to work again . Then after I did that , the system became unstable , and when I rebooted the computer , it corrupted my registry , and told me I had to reinstall windows . Upon trying to do so , the upgrade created more problems trying to install . It kept corrupting my registry , and would n't install without a hassle . Like someone else said in a review , Windows ME is nothing but a cardboard box with a label , and a CD . This operating system IS A VIRUS ! Stay away from it . Windows 98 SE , or Windows 2000 would be your best bet , and if you do n't mind living in the cave man days , and for as long as programs are compatible with it , you 'd be better off staying with Windows 95 -LRB- as long as it is version B or C -RRB- . I hope this review will be somewhat helpful . The ONLY thing I miss about ME is the movie maker , but I can live without that . Even the system restore was junk , does n't work at all . If you need system restore , purchase Norton Systemworks 2002 , which has GO BACK on it , it 's the same function , and it WORKS !!!
 I believe Microsoft put this operating system out to not be forgotten during the Linux craze and did not offer up any real solutions to it 's stability problems . After the upgrade , I found a lot of software and hardware not compatible with the new sytem . So , if I want to use these products I 've paid hundreds of dollars for I have to buy `` more compatible stuff '' ... . I do realize the problems probably lie with the software and hardware manufacturers but Windows ME should have been friendlier with them . Do n't buy it and I 'm not all too sure about Windows XP . Am I going to have the same problems ??? I gave it a two because of it 's new multimedia features which I really liked .
 This is by far the WORST product MicroSoft has ever released ! It crashes my system nearly every hour making it necessary to completely reboot . I would n't take it now if they paid me $ 89 ! Do yourself a big favor
 Windows Me is just a carboard box with a cd inside . This is serioulsy the most horrible version of Windows EVER created . My computer does n't even function right anymore after I reformatted . Just dont buy this version . If you must buy windows 98 Second Edition . Far better ! Now i have to fork out more money to fix my computer . P.S. Dont buy your computer from Best Buy and MicronPC . I spent a good sum for a nice computer and it broke and no one is willing to fix it . They told me a software problem . WINDOWS ME . Thats the biggest problem right there . Save time , Save Money , Save your Nerves , buy another version or get LinuX .
 -LRB- ... -RRB- You got ta be a complete and total MORON to buy or want this O/S . It is a DISASTER ! Crashes regularly and randomly . It is actually a step DOWN from Windows 98 . Back in 1999 , Microsoft 's investers got a little worried that XP was taking too long , so Microsoft rushed out this piece of garbage to placate them and show that they were still in business . The result was a haphazard mishmash of their corporate and home o/s 's that melded the worst of both . Why there was n't a class action suit against Microsoft for foisting this junk on them I 'll never know . One thing though , it DID give a lot of work to computer service techs . AVOID !
 When I first got Windows Me in December 2000 , I thought it was a great improvement over Windows 98 . However , after 3 years of use , this ever so great computer has become a giant pain . I have plenty of space , yet programs freeze and you need to restart your computer again . I am constantly press Ctrl + Alt + delete to see what is going wrong in Adobe Photoshop or Zoo Tycoon . It always has a `` not responding '' sign behind it and when I press `` end task '' , my whole desk top disappears leaving me only with my background picture . Our printer and scanner do n't seem to function anymore and installing games and new programs takes atleast 30 minutes . And when you restart your computer , you have to wait 5 minutes to let everything on your desktop load before you can try anything with out it not working . Iam also frequently getting blue screens with error signs on it . This computer does n't seem to cooperate with me anymore , so I am going to buy XP .
 I purchased a Dell with Windows ME , and what a huge mistake ! ME is the most unstable version of Windows EVER ! Go with Windows 2000 Pro instead . And be aware that Dell will not work with you to correct any issues with ME .
 Too bad you ca n't buy insurance for software given how often this program crashes . I have never written a review on anything before , but this program is so pathetic that I felt inclined to warn others . Lets hope that XP saves all of us that got stuck with this software on the computers we bought !!
 I purchased a new Compaq Presario 5000 Pentium III/1 Gig machine about a year ago , and have had nothing but problems with Windoze ME that came bundled with it . I often get error messages , freezes , and crashes while using various software packages , and even when I do n't multitask ! I can be using just one software package -LRB- thus not putting demand on the hardware or OS -RRB- , such as Lotus Notes R5 or AOL , and bam , out of nowhere and for not good reason , ` ME ' rears it 's ugly head . I can not even begin to count all those wasted hours of downtime and rebooting or crawling under my desk to turn the power strip on and off to reboot , because ` ME ' has frozen my CPU to the point where it ca n't even shut down properly !!! This is simply UNACCEPTABLE , and despite my having contacted Microsoft 5 times , I have still obtained NO satisfaction or fix from them !!! FIVE times , and they have not even had the common courtesy or decency to reply to me !!! About a month ago , I decided to try Macintosh for the first time , and I am floored by how stable their OS is !!! My Compaq with ` ME ' is now collecting dust , and I have become a Mac convert . At least Macs work well !!! Shame on Microsoft for releasing a lousy product .
 Installed it as an upgrade to Windows 98SE , now I have multiple crashes and ca n't stay on the internet for more than 2 minutes without a reboot unless I use Netscape as the browser . Inlcuded video camera software is suspect at best and tells me my system is too slow ... yeah right.Don ' t buy it ... it ai n't worth it . If it was n't for the fact I have loads of Windows 9x software titles to replace , I would have boguht an Apple !
 Abosolutley Horrible A pure waste of decent greenbacks .
 After you system crashes and you have to reboot . You get many errors , lots of blue screens . And my active desktop seems to hate every program ever , even those by microsoft . I would much rather run 3.11 then Me . Me , many errors , Maniacal Enigma , Must Erase .
 Upgrading to ME has cost me a fortune in time and money . Upgrading from 95B required me to upgrade many of my applications as they would not run . I even had to upgrade my scanner as the SCSI card was not supported on ME.After all that time and expense , the system is very unstable , keeps eating disk space on the C drive , and my mouse and clock will not work correctly.Avoid ME
 Windows ME just is n't worth the investment . It is just Windows 98 with some added features . The core operating system is still the same , unreliable OS it always was.Let 's start by looking at the plus side . The new features are pretty nice . Windows Media Player is much better than its predecessors . Internet Explorer 5.5 is a great browser and not having to download the beast is an added bonus . The auto update feature -LRB- while somewhat annoying at times -RRB- is much easier than searching the web for the latest software updates . If you feel these features are reason enough to upgrade your to ME , then go for it.As I said , ME still has plenty of reliability problems . It is still possible for a single application to bring down the entire operating system . In my experience it has been rare that I actually get the OS to shut down properly . I have used Linux and NT for years and gotten used to their stability . I had forgotten just how bad the stability of this line of operating systems could be.One word of caution if you are still thinking about making the purchase
 I recently bought a new computer that was preloaded with Windows Millenium and after only a few weeks I looking to scrap Millenium and buy Windows 2000 . Millenium is mainly Windows 98 with a prettier cover , but it still has a lot of problems - sudden lock ups -LRB- ca n't kill a stalled application either -RRB- , jittery audio using Real Player and Quicktime , & overabundant memory hog . I 've got 128 MB and I need more . My advice is to keep your current 95 or 98 and if you decide to make a change move to Windows 2000 . Microsoft is trying to move that way , but Millenium does n't take much of a step closer to that than 98 does . Good luck .
 PCs would be so much better if Microsoft never existed . Windows Me crashed my computer before I even finished installing it . I have a 3dfx voodoo3 3000 card and windows me , for some reason hated it . I lost count of how many times I had to restart my computer . The biggest mistake I made was not saving my old system files when I installed it , so now I am stuck with it . Let me tell you that running a computer with Windows ME is like running your car without any oil . It lasts for about two minutes before it does some `` The program you are using caused an invalid whatever in your thingamagiger . '' Save your money .
 I bought a new PC back in September having invested a large proportion of my savings into it . When I buy a virtual top of the range machine , I do not expect the following : - Having to restart every hour or two due to loss of system resources . - Having to disable System Restore -LRB- one of the biggest selling points of ME -RRB- to give me some more system resources . - Not being able to start up with the programs I want running in the backgroud because otherwise my computer will be rendered unuseable until the next restart . - On a 1.4 Ghz machine with 512MB RAM , having a maximum of 34 % system resources free . And that was only with my anti-virus program running from startup . - Seeing friends with significantly inferior machines running more programs at a time than me , and all running faster . The difference ? They were running Windows 98 . I now use Windows XP Professional . I now run twice the amount of software with 90 % system resources free . I 've seen maybe 2 blue screens of death since using it , as opposed to 5 a day with ME . I like the new GUI in XP , others may not , but you can change back to the Win 9x style if you so wish.And also , I like my computer to do the jobs I ask it to . Windows Me did n't let me do it . It really makes me very upset that this piece of software is still out there to cause so many problems . Microsoft should be ashamed and offer free upgrades to XP for everyone in the world who is left with ME.And , as it seems , XP is cheaper . What more can I say ?
 Yes , my current operating system is Microsoft Windows ME.I got this O.S. with my new computer , does it have to crash every other second ? It 's not great , at all . My friend used it for 10 minutes briefly and came to the conclusion I came up with 2 months after living with it.Positive side -LRB- should n't take long ... -RRB- 1 . It 's got that Windows Movie Maker program , if only I could use it without risk of crashing the machine -LRB- in the bin -RRB- .2 . Media Player 's OK3 . System restore was quite handy when i had a few graphics card problems .4 . Internet Explorer 5.5 OK -LRB- but you can wazz version 6.0 upgrade off Microsoft for free anyway -RRB- 5 . All the lovely little icons are nice looking , sitting on the desktop like that ... 6 . ... mmmm , that 's it.Negative side -LRB- here we go ... -RRB- 1 . Freezing , crashing , lockups , incompatibility , sudden program closures -LRB- with data loss -RRB- and more blue screens than I can throw at keyboard at -LRB- biggest gripe -RRB- .2 . When I used system restore quite a few times to sort a graphics card error I ended fixing the problem and having all my icon labels and program titles on the start menu ALL CAPITALISED ... how odd ! 4 . I 've reinstalled it 2 times since having the computer Jan 2001 -LRB- it 's a pain , I wont go through it again -RRB- .5 . It does n't look any better .6 . It does n't like me capturing video .7 . It does n't like me.So it 's OK/adequate if your new computer came with it , but horrible as an upgrade.Don ' t buy Windows MEediocre . -LRB- look forward to XP -RRB-
 I hate windows ME ... there I said it . Its like they took windows 2000 and removed some features and made it crash more often . Devil thy name is windows ME
 If you are an AOL member and use a 56k modem , your system will lock up literally every other time you try to log on . Then after you do get online your own machine will cut you off -LRB- not AOL -RRB- . I know its not AOL because not only is the connection lost but the AOL window closes also . Microsoft is telling Windows ME users to make a toll call to its tech support line and ask for a file that will fix the problem . It took about 20 minutes to work through the menus and explain the problem and arrange to have an email sent with a link to the patch file on Microsoft 's site . Microsoft warns that the patch has n't been fully tested , which is why its location has n't been announced to the general public . Good thing . The patch did n't work either .
 Before it was released , Windows ME was widely perceived as the home edition of Windows 2000 Professional . As it turned out , it is the latest version of Windows 9x . By no stretch of imagination does it have the stability and the robustness of Windows 2000 Professional . I tried installing Windows ME on a system that had previously run Windows 95 , Windows 2000 Professional , Windows 2000 Advanced Server , three distributions of Linux and FreeBSD flawlessly . I experienced video problems , hard disk crashes and ME getting corrupted repeatedly . I tried reinstalling more than once , both as an upgrade and as clean install after formatting the hard disk to no avail . This operating system is simply not stable . Considering the fact that Windows XP is on the market , I do n't expect Microsoft to spend much effort in fixing ME . If you are upgrading from a previous Windows version , bypassing ME is a very prudent decision .
 I was very happy to receive this business plan maker in a very timely fashion . However , when I tried to install the program , it was blank ! It would not install ! My computer read it as blank . Very disapointing and it 's cost me time and money . Do n't know if I 'll order again .
 I purchased this software , hoping to experience the opportunity to design some slick personal calling cards . What I got instead was a migraine ! The design backgrounds are GORGEOUS , but you have to have a PHD in graphic design to make this software work . I spent hours trying to make my chosen design fit within the print area of my standard Avery cardstock - I do n't claim to be the brightest crayon in the box , but I 'm pretty intelligent and resourceful and I was n't able to do anything with it . I 'm glad I only spent -LSB- amt -RSB- . If you have the a lot of extra time and an unending supply of patience , give it a shot - If you do n't choose another product , or go to Kinko 's .
 This product may give you MANY templates to choose from , but unless you want to try and manually align the card by adjusting print margins -LRB- hence wasting print stock -RRB- you 're stcu using their proprietary card stock . If Data Becker wants this product to really break into the market , they need built in support for industry standard Avery card layouts . I 'm returning the product , buying a good clipart disk , and making my cards with MS Word has I have in the past . It 's much easier . Just select the Avery Card Layout , align your text and image and print . You do n't have to be computer savy to do it .

 This software requires an inkject printer which is not indicated anywhere but inside the package . The card I designed looked good on the screen but since I have a laser printer , I 'll never know how it really looks .
 Never even got it to install on my computer . Sent an email to the support center and was given a vague solution . When that failed , I sent another email . This time I had to download the 2.5 SP1 Release from Microsoft . This did n't work either . Have since sent 5 emails hoping for a reply . It has been a week . Obviously they DO NOT stand behind their product . Waste of money .
 I found this software to be user unfriendly , plus it required downloading a patch to print from an HP Deskjet 670C printer -LRB- oh , that 's right - an obscure model nobody else has -RRB- . Anyone without internet access would have been SOL.There are some nice templates but any attempts to customize or edit font styles crashed my system beyond ctrl/alt/del . I sent an e-mail to the support desk , since no phone number was provided anywhere . That was last week and I 've still had no response . I was going to make my husband some nice cards for Christmas - but I bought him a new coffee maker instead.I think the multi-star ratings here must be from company reps. I am very dissatisfied with this software .

 I bought this software and installed it on my machine . Every time I tried to use it , it crashed my system so hard it would n't even respond to ALT+CTRL+DEL . I was never able to print even a single business card .

 I used to have Microsoft 's Image Composer -LRB- now discontinued -RRB- that came with FrontPage ' 98 . What a great , intuitive little program that was for cutting out parts of photos and combining them into collages or new photos ! It came with no manual , yet I was able to teach myself to use it just by playing around and trying things out . It was that easy , and it was a lot of fun!This program claims to have many of the same functions IC did
 I bought/returned this product yesterday . On my Windows XP Pro computer , it begins installation , runs for a minute , then reports
 I wanted to try this product because I used an earlier version and found it to have the best and easiest to use cloning tool around . I began having some loading problems with the original and decided to upgrade to PE deluxe 3 . It would not install . I called tech support at Nova and had 3 conversations with them . I found the reps to be very rude and not much willing to help . I think the problem is that this software is flawed and the reps do n't know what to say to the customers . I spent 3 hours working with a tech rep from Dell . He was really nice and wanted very much to help but was unable to find an answer . He felt that the software is flawed in some way . If this software would install and function it would be easy to use and quite enjoyable but at this point Nova needs to take it off the market or fix the bugs . They boast about being friendly and willing to help with support . I did not find this to be true .
 I thought I could create some nice slide presetnations . This software is very unfriendly . Hard to figure out even with the users manual . The instructions does n't work and not explanatory . Will give you nothing but headache . I was unable to make any slide presentation . Zip . Nada .
 When I first loaded it it worked great . Then kept getting errors . Then did n't work at all . I tried deleting it and putting it back in my computer but had error and would not let me . emailed them but no response .
 Photo Explosion Deluxe 3.0 wo n't install on some computers . I have an XP and Vista laptop and the installation is interuppted . I am not alone in this problem . Nova ca n't help .
 I purchased this software over a month ago . When I did the installation it would not go from disc one to disc two because there was a file missing -LRB- although all the other files were there . After a bad experience with customer service they sent me another disc 2 . Of course disk 3 had the same problem . I was told they would overnight more replacements , they lied , 5 days later I still have not received anything . Customer support/tech support have been completely unhelpful and rude . I ca n't tell you about the product , but I would never buy anything from them again .
 I 've never had so many problems with any software program . From the first time I ran it , Photo Explosion has given me almost endless error messages , and because I thought this was due to an incompatibility with Microsoft Vista , I downgraded my operation system to XP with absolutely no relief from the problems . Any time I so much as open Photo Explosion , I get the message , `` Ulead Photo Express has encountered a problem and needs to close . We are sorry for the inconvenience . `` I sent several messages to tech support via email , and their `` solutions '' always consist of uninstalling and reinstalling the program as well as checking for updates . I 've done all of the above several times , and I 'm still unable to use the program I spent $ 50.00 on . Please save your money for a more worthwhile product .
 I 've used this product before and liked it , so I thought I would buy the newer version when I upgraded to Vista . I got the product and did everything necessary to get the $ 20 rebate but NOVA stiffed me ! After reading the message boards , NOVA apparently stiffs just about everybody on their rebates . BUYER BEWARE !!!!! This company will NEVER get my business again ... never , ever again ! I hope they are happy that they get to keep my $ 20 , I 'll buy a more expensive product just so I do n't have to buy theirs!EDIT
 I purchased two versions of this software and had the same problem each time . It worked originally , with some bugs during initial installation . It would work for a short time , then eventually the program would stop opening up and you could n't gain access to any of the templates you created . It will wait forever to open , give you errors , then ultimately crash . The older version had some options for troubleshooting , but they do n't even offer that now . They just encourage you to buy a newer version . Do n't bother . Buy something that will last for more than a year and get your money 's worth and save yourself the frustration . Avoid Nova Development Products . It looks like many others have had the same problem .
 I sure wish I had read these comments before I purchased this program . I had been using Kodak 's Easyshare program that I had from several years ago . Now that Kodak is selling , I needed another program . This one seemed to have the basics which was really all that I needed . I do n't do major enhancing or corrections on my photos , and sell them with that truth being told . Still old school for me ! Anyway , found this at a big box store and bought it on a whim . When I loaded it onto my computer , I was already having problems . I could not figure out what was going all wrong with this already . The book was impossible to understand , so I thought I would call customer support for some help to get me started . What a mistake that was ! The guy that I spoke to was obviously from another country and I 'm guessing India , but ca n't be exactly sure . I could n't understand him and asked him to at least slow down his speaking so that I could keep up with him . Before he would help me , he asked what type of protection plan I wanted to buy - What ???? I told him I was looking for tech help getting started with this program that I just purchased . He kept insisting that I needed to buy a $ 140 plus plan to get professionaL help from this company for the next year . Are you kidding me ???? I informed him that I had only paid $ 40 for this program and it sure didnt ' make sense to have to pay that kind of money for tech support ! He continued this song and dance , asking for my credit card and I told him that this was a waste of my time and that it was obvious that he was not going to help me unless I paid big bucks for his `` professional help '' . I also told him that I was sorry to have wasted his time with my call and would be returning this crap to the store later that day , which I did . Pretty sorry experience and now I have to start all over again . Their packaging looks really great on the outside and that 's probably what sold me on it intially . That shows me that I need to read reviews on Amazon and also to buy from Amazon so I wo n't have this kind of problem ever again ! So if you are thinking that this program looks good , THINK AGAIN ! It 's not!Photo Explosion Deluxe 3.0
 Shipped quickly and was reasonably priced but the product itself was not what I thought it was going to be . It did not do nearly as much as I was hopping for . I would not make this purchase again . -LRB- not cause of the seller though =-RRB- they were great !
 I bought this program to make a simple slide show for a family party . I 'm very computer literate , but even with tech supports `` help '' I have been unable to install this program -- or its Vista update -- on my computer . Tech support suggests uninstalkling , reinstalling , etc. . . but symptoms continue . I sure wish I had read the reviews here before buying it ! Do n't waste your money - I 'm going to try to get a refund from Nova .
 This product was advertised on the box to be easy to use . This was not true . I bought this to be able to combine two pictures into one by using the cutout procedure . Once I was finally successful in completing a cut out no where could I figure out what to do with it or how to put it in another picture . The manual was useless . Also , the cutout had a white frame around it which I could not get rid of . When I tried to save something , I got the message that this could not be done . After spending too many hours I decided to try to take the product back to Best Buy . They would not take it because it had been opened . So I was stuck with returning it to Nova . The customer rep said I should mail it back Media Mail and get a tracking number for it . They do not pay the postage . When I got to the Post Office they told me it was not eligible for Media Mail . It cost me $ 8.63 . Either the person who told me I could send it by this method was misinformed or deliberately lied to me . The return form they sent also said to mail it media mail . I was also informed by Nova that they would not pay the tax on the item.When I got the info that the package had been delivered , I waited two weeks and called customer service to find out when my rebate check would get here . I also told them they should no longer be telling people that they could return the product media mail . The rep told me that people from all over the country were sending things back by media mail . So I took this information back to the post office . They affirmed once again that computer software was not eligible for media mail . So Nova is telling many people to do something that is illegal .
 Originally I 'd wanted to buy the new Photoshop program but , when I saw this , in store , decided to get this instead because it claimed to easily allow me to do everything I wanted for just over half the price of Photoshop . I REALLY wish I 'd have stuck with photoshop!The product claims to be easy to use to edit photos - This is NOT true at all . The smart trace feature is not accurate and takes multiple attempts to get the area desired.The box claims to enable you to take a background from one photo and foreground from another to make a new photo . I was unable to do so even after consulting the manual AND emailing a technical support person from the company.The photo CD does have quite a few pictures -LRB- over 3,000 -RRB- but , they are useless when the program does not allow you to cut out the foreground to combine photos.The company also does not uphold they 're full refund within the 90 day warranty . They require you to pay for shipping and shorten the timeframe to only 30 days . Definitely not sticking to their word . After submitting a complaint to the BBB , they just repeatedly said that they require the customer to pay shipping and that they had only 30 days , never acknowledging their false advertising . Obviously you DO N'T get a full refund if you have to pay shipping -LRB- for which they also require tracking information which costs more -RRB- . This company and their product are not worth the time of day or the money wasted .
 As a professional photographer I use Adobe Photoshop on a regular basis . My wife however is a bit intimidated by it . She just wants a simple , `` quick & painless '' program to play around with photos once in a while.Photo Explosion looked to be a good fit
 if you try to get driving directions using this software , It will tell you to go northwest and west and southeast rather than make left and right . . very lousy software . . does not tell which exit to take and if you carry compass , then only you can figure out where to turn . . very disappointing . . I am returning this software . . rather use mapquest.com to get sensible directions . .
 I was recently in the market for a DJ software package so I could transition into MP3 dj-ing . I thought PCDJ was the best software on the market , clearly I was wrong . When the software was functioning -LRB- rarely -RRB- , the features that first attracted me to it worked fine . Then , things went downhill from there . First off , PCDJ has a sound dropping issue . Whenever one would maximize or minimize a window , the sound would stutter or skip , producing a horrendous noise . Visiosonic has addressed the issue , but has yet to produce a fix . It also turns out Visiosonic has a ridiculous licensing/product activation system that will lock you out of the application by changing even the slightest settings to your system 's hardware -LRB- BIOS update or a video card driver update for example -RRB- . I paid PCDJ and now I ca n't use it . Tech support was an absolute joke ; it took them one week to respond to my inquiry and finally unlocked my software . After the same thing happened again about a month later , I decided to forget about PCDJ all together . Think twice before purchasing any Visiosonic product , it 's just not worth the money . Sadly enough , the application lockout happened right before one of my DJ jobs , a very embarrassing situation indeed . Look at other software packages -LRB- heck , even iTunes is better than this -RRB- before stooping to this .
 I just purchased the Sketch Board for my 4 year old ... Got it home & proceeded to load the software included only to find out that this product wo n't run on any operating system higher than Win98 . Also searched for possible updated drivers & discovered that this product is being marketed as a Disney product when it really is n't . They have a big picture of Mickey Mouse on the cover & the name Disney printed all over the box ... . So if your thinking of purchasing this product & you 're running WinNT ,2000 or XP . . forget it about it .
 I also bought this but ca n't run it on my system . Disney provides an XP driver fix , but it ca n't be installed unless the program is already in your system . Catch 22 . KB Gear is NO LONGER IN BUSINESS . That is what Disney told me . I 'm trying to find any fixes .
 The addition of Adobe Bridge loses this ` upgrade ' 4 points . Bridge was always a badly-implemented idea , but now it seems to be turning the entire CS2 suite into an awkward , lumbering behemoth -LRB- and yes , I am running a very fast , modern , hi-spec computer -RRB- . What idiot dreamt up this clunky , steam-powered piece of bloatware ? It 'll make you feel like you 're trying to run Photoshop on a pocket calculator , guaranteed , no matter what kind of computer you have.Still , you can enjoy a nice cup of tea while you wait for Bridge to lumber and bumble over a big folder of pictures , thrashing your hard disk furiously in the process , and even put some toast on while you try and get any 2 components of the CS2 suite to run at the same time without bringing your computer down with virtual memory crashes . I kid you not , Deep Thought could n't run this piece of crud at a decent speed.Why am I harping on Bridge when I do n't have to turn it on ? Because it is AUTOMATICALLY on as a background process if you have more than one component of the CS2 suite active.Woe unto you Adobe , thou art become the Microsoft Office of bitmap-editing software .
 CS2 appears to have been released prematurely with minimal , if any , quality engineering . Bugs are rampant and the `` complimentary '' technical support is on the same par as the program itself.In fact , I wonder if many of the support people are experienced Photoshop users themselves . They appear to be non-technical individuals who are capable of reading support documents but the average person can access these for themselves on the Adobe website . Beyond the documents , support personnel have little to offer beyond denial , which is extremely frustrating given the myriad of problems with this release of Photoshop.I would strongly recommend staying the course with PS7 or CS . The new features , including Bridge , are not worth the hassles involved with basic functionality of CS2 . Many features that worked fine in CS do not function well , if at all , in CS2.Apparently , Adobe is more intent on integrating Photoshop with it 's so-called Creative Suite than it is in maintianing basic functionality of what used to be a great program.I would suggest either sticking with PS7/CS or perhaps waiting for the trial versionof CS3 to arrive . Hopefully , Adobe will clean up their act .
 I have worked with various paint software programs over the years , but have n't tried Photoshop until now . I personally found it very easy to manage . After a few days of experimentation , it was easy to remember where everything was and how it would effect the picture . I 've already used it for several different types of tasks such as shading comics to fixing photographs that are too dark or off-colored . It is definitely a useful piece of software for any type of artist . I 've never had a problem with the computer freezing or with slow speed of the software even though my computer has half of the RAM suggested by the listing.So why is my rating so low ? I tried the trial version of Photoshop 7.0 and found that it was very similiar to CS2 , almost identical . The only difference I can think off the top of my head right now is Photoshop CS2 has the ability to add a 2nd plane that you can put a picture on and tilt it so the picture appears to be coming out from the bottom image , sort of a 3D wall effect . Other than that , you have the same old stuff such with layers , brushes , image adjustments , and special effects.If you are not a top-notch professional and are looking to buy some Photoshop software , then save yourself some money and buy an older version . You wo n't be missing out on much.WARNING
 After 3 days of intensive learning I still ca n't do some very basic things , it takes me sometimes hours of research to do the most simple things ... like gradient painting a circle object while it takes one intuitive action with my previous software to do that . I find Photoshop CS2 is too complexe in its structure , vocabulary and workflow philosophy for the occasional user . I reckon it takes at least 2 full weeks of training to manage this software , far too much in my opinion , I mean we 're talking of image processing ... in comparaison it took me 1 week to manage Autocad and about 2 weeks for a FEA pro softaware .
 PS CS2 is a terrible program . There are a couple of major bugs I found : First , and most annoying , is it 's ` sluggishness ' . For example , there is often a lapse of a second or two from the time you try to execute a command and that command actually starts . While this may not be too serious a problem for a novice , it is a real pain when you are trying to use the program professionally on a powerful computer.Second , the new `` Bridge '' is a total flop . It 's too slow to use , and full of bugs . For example , it sometimes loses files ! That 's an unacceptable bug , but it still has n't been fixed by Adobe . Some files , like large tiffs , wo n't preview at all . And that 's only the beginning!PS CS is a much more stable and reliable program compared to CS2 . In fact , I uninstalled CS2 , got a refund from Adobe , and went back to CS .
 I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2 . It worked fine for a handful of months , and then it quit . Technical support was of no help . I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine . I am so frustrated about this . I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup , moving data , reformatting , and reinstalling . If I were a small business , I would be out of business . All because this piece of crap program , which I purchased legally , decided to quit . Totally unacceptable !
 I purchased this item thinking it was authentic . I was wrong . It kept asking me to register it everytime i opened it up . So i called Adobe annd had them run the serial number for verification and it came back invalid . The seller made a prompt refund , and had excellent communication . It was just unfortunate . So be very aware of high priced software for really cheap , even on Amazon !!!
 Sorry to offend any asthmatics , but this version of Photoshop is seriously slow . We bought this product as our printing company needs the latest in graphic design to get the best out of our work . We had Photoshop Elements for a while , but it is hard to do good printing on an RGB output -LRB- especially as we send many of our proofs via email , and the final output , in CMYK , can look drastically different -RRB- , so we made the grade and purchased this monstrously priced piece of software mainly because of the CMYK facility , but also because of the new cool techniques - such as the healing brush.Don ' t get me wrong , the new features are excellent . The design and outlook is very cool and classy . But the slowness is so unbearable that , unless it is very , very necessary , we still use Elements when designing and editing our images . It takes a few minutes to even load up , even though PE is super fast.Even opening and saving a file takes forever , and the useless Adobe Bridge running in the background does more harm than favours . I have used Photoshop 7 in the past , and its speed is relative to Elements . But for the few extras , and the near impotent Bridge , is it really worth the torturous suffering of staring at the monitor screen watching an egg timer spin round?If you are still unsure , this may make you decide . This program crashes a lot - so if you do purchase this product , then be sure to save your projects every couple of minutes at least -LRB- especially before you use some of the consuming tools , i.e. the 3D tools -RRB- . On the plus , when we got our CS2 we got three free Photoshop Magazines . Yippee . And rare these days , you do get a paper manual inside the box -LRB- instead of some sufferable PDF file -RRB- .
 The heavy handed activation system does not work with a computer using RAID storage . The software continually looks for proof of activation and that the system did not change.With a raid system , the software thinks you have installed the program on a new computer and prompts you to enter the serial number -LRB- 24 digits -RRB- then the activation number -LRB- 36 digits -RRB- and then it tells you it can not fix it online . Once you call , a telephone computer asks you to put in the same 60 digits and then tells you that you need to talk to a person.Twenty minutes later , the tech support person , who does not know enough to ask you whether you have a RAID system , comes on the phone . After verbally telling them all 60 digits of activation code and serial number , along with the required `` read it back '' to correct errors , they give you a 24 digits activation code which you put into the computer.All seems fine . When you open one of the Adobe programs , it asks for the activation again , this forces you to go through the same process again until you get smart and ask for a more experienced tech support person . Finally someone asks you if you have a RAID system . They then acknowledge a problem and offer to expedite a patch to you . Expedite means they will send it to out in a few days via email . In the mean time the software will not operate . It also prevents the Free Adobe reader from working . I am still waiting for the patch , so I though I would spend my time writing reviews.I have used the Adobe software programs in CS2 on other computers and they are not bad . I find some of the conventions counter intuitive so my learning curve is slow on this software . It is the industry standard but with service like I experienced it is questionable how long that will continue .
 I am an Adobe Certified Expert in Photoshop and have been using it for years . This release crushes my heart . It is so buggy and awful . The support on Adobe.com blames everything from other drivers to temp files to other programs . Well , Adobe , how come Photoshop 5 , 5.5 , 6 , 7 , and CS1 all worked perfectly without excuse ? Photoshop is the greatest software known to mankind . If you are new to Photoshop , please do not judge it on this version WHICH IS WORSE THAN SPYWARE ! Do n't get me wrong , the new aesthetic changes , multiple selection of layers , and spot healing tool are AMAZING innovations -LRB- also , the new Animation Palette is a great idea - I like where that is going -RRB- . Unfortunately , they are trapped in a version of Photoshop that is a buggy , slow , monstrous mess ! If you need this version , I might recommend that you get it from your friend ; you know , the guy with the eye patch with a parrot on his shoulder ? He talks like Keith Richards and looks like Johnny Depp in that one movie . He should have what you 're looking for , and he 'll help take the hurt away .
 I love Photoshop , and have worked with all the previous versions , so I was very disappointed when I found that I could not get the Bridge to open or the Camera RAW plug-in to work on my Windows XP machine . I wasted hours and hours of my life on the phone to technical support , but they could not resuscitate this version on my computer . They never were able to tell me why I could not get these two key features to work . Without them , CS2 was virtually useless to me . My computer was only a little under 2 years old . Perhaps you will have better luck ...
 I purchased a `` new '' copy from a reseller here on Amazon . Everything looked great . I am not a heavy photoshop user , but need it when I need it . About 3 month go by when I noticed some of the functions and keyboard commands did not work . I searched adobe 's user forum and realized I received a fake copy . It had a complete user manual , packaging , etc. . Even had a fake registration page that does n't actually connect to adobe . Amazon was great with their A-Z Guarantee and covered it . But , BE CAREFULL . If the price looks too good , it probably is . My copy came from FL if that helps anyone .
 I am using photoshop for professional reasons since 1991 . I am a CG Painter , and I use Photoshop to paint and create realistic special effects.I use Photoshop on a powerful Mac G5 . I upgraded to CS2 . Painting is now slow , when it does n't freezes ... or crashes ! Even with their new upgrade it 's not better . Their new brushes worked nice and quick in CS . Using the brushes for professional use is not possible any more.I hope they will fix these bugs , but it 's been months I 'm waiting for it , and it 's not better . I think I will downgrade to CS to be able to work correctly again .
 Considering how much talent Adobe puts into product development , it amazes me how user-hostile their service is . I bought CS2 last week and can not get Adobe Bridge to start . This is a critical problem since Canon RAW files -LRB- . CR2 -RRB- from my 20D are not visible in the File/Open box . My fiancee spent three hours on the phone to Seattle today to try to get help , and when she finally got through , they would n't deal with her since she was not the registered user , even though she had the licence information . There is no information on Adobe 's site regarding Bridge bugs . I do n't know if this is also a problem on the Mac , but if you are an XP user , HOLD OFF ON CS2 until Adobe fixes the production bugs in its Bridge software , and gets a better handle on both its arrogance and quality control .
 Adobe 's insane pricing and licensing makes this product way too overpriced and inflexible for anyone except professionals . The laughable part is that you dont even get * reasonable * support for such premium pricing.Every designer I know has at least 3 computers - work , laptop , and home desktop . The fact that Adobe insists that these people buy almost $ 2000 in licenses for one person to run this single application on all 3 is beyond arrogant . Even M$ Office lets you run on 3 PCs!What is even more insulting then the price is the strategic deployment of features which are held back and then launched to incite almost annual upgrades , which cost more than the full versions of this product 's competing products!Additionally , the continuous lack of evolution in this product 's UI -LRB- and lets be clear it is * POOR * -RRB- is amazing considering that so many of its users are UI professionals . When I fire it up it still smells like the version I ran on WFW 3.11 . The processing features are excellent , thats all that is keeping this product in position is its engineering team , because marketing , support , and UI are substandard.As soon as Paint Shop Pro aquired layers it completely obliterated 95 % of what Photoshop is used for daily in terms of productivity.However , Corel has really taken the wheels off of Paint Shop Pro since its aquisition.There is a lot of room in this space for competition to this product , M$ is looking to move into this market with Acrylic . Hopefully they will be successful and knock Adobe off its arcane high horse old-school marketing practices.Its really sad when a company needs to be taught a lesson from M$ in humility !
 I 've been using Photoshop since version 3 . No layers , lots of alpha channels and sweat . I use Photoshop for hours every day , for everything from retouching watercolor paintings , to creating textures for 3d models , to making original paintings . The Wacom pen is glued to my hand.After spending some time with CS2 , I can say this is the first time Adobe has gone one step forward , and four steps back on design , usability , speed and features.The first issue is speed . CS2 takes a HUGE chunk of RAM , and leaves nothing of your CPUs for other applications . Working with several low-res files open , CS2 took 450 + MB of physical memory , while CS1 took around 150MB . Moving sets or linked layers is clunky and slow . Painting is practically out of the question , as the brush lags far behind your Wacom pen , and often pauses for several seconds , leaving that sweet looking diagonal stroke across your screen that tells you `` I ca n't keep up ! '' Switching from one application back to Photoshop takes anywhere up to a minute for the application to begin responding . Let 's not even start talking about the Bridge . Seriously.Some little things are nice . You can change the opacity of the current layer while you 're in the middle of Free Transforming it . That 's kinda nice . But if you 're used to linking layers a lot , get ready for a shock . The link layers switch -LRB- formerly next to the layer visibility switch -RRB- is GONE . It 's been replaced by a link button at the bottom of the layers palette . Linking layers requires you to ctrl-click the layers you want to link , and then click the link button . It 's hard to see what 's linked , because the little chain icon does n't show up in a predictable and linear position -- they 're all over the layers palette.I 'm anxious to see how HDRI works in comparison to Debevec 's HDRShop , and I have n't tried the perspective feature , but honestly , I 'm not interested . Adobe should include CS1 with the purchase of CS2 , because there 's just so much functionality missing . I need to get work done , I do n't need to play with toys , so when it comes time to work in 2D , I 'm clicking on Photoshop CS1 .
 Installed CS2 Premium , registered the product . Then I realized I had a DOS icon for Adobe Acrobat . Double clicked and it said it was n't installed . Reinserted the cd , installed Acrobat , then it wanted to go through the activation process . Would n't activate because the other products were activated and it thought I was pirating the product . Called Adobe Help Desk . Ruthy was stumped and had me call a tech support number that I had to PAY for ! He told me to uninstall the whole product and reinstall . Uninstall took 189 minutes . Then tried to reinstall . Said Adobe Acrobat was already installed , but when I went to add remove programs in Windows , it says it is not installed . Called the Help Desk again . They tried again , could n't help . Told me I could PAY and call tech support again . I am now installing CS back on my machine . This is the worst upgrade Adobe has put out . I am frustrated because it never installed correctly in the first place , but to get help , it is going to cost me more money .
 PS CS2 is a pain in the behind to install and activate -LRB- which you have to do via the web or telephone -RRB- . But even beyond install & activate , it needs 222MB of hard drive space -LRB- versus the 136MB that PS7 uses -RRB- , takes about a minute or so to open on my computer -LRB- Windows 2000 , 260MB RAM , 18GB hard drive -RRB- , and then uses a boatload of memory once it 's running . Forget about trying to use another high-memory program at the same time you 're using PS2.I 'm going back to using version 7 . CS2 has a few more features than 7 , but its memory usage is unacceptable for me.And Photoshop CS2 literally took about TEN MINUTES to UNinstall .
 As a student who went thru design school using pirated versions of Illustrator 10 and PS 7 , I decided it was fair that I should support the company of their -LRB- previous -RRB- excellent software . After dishing out $ 379 at a reseller , and trying it out , I wish I had stuck with my previous editions -LRB- although changing the date in Illust . 10 back to 2001 is annoying at most -RRB- . Slow . Slow . Slow . I 'm running an Athlon XP2100 machine with 512ram and virtually little overhead software to bog it down . PRE-CS2 I could run Illustrator , Flash , PS7 , 8-12 web browser windows , AIM , FTP server , my Wacom software , and Winamp without any delays in any program . Now I can only have Firefox and Illustator at the same time , both fighting over virtual memory!Furthermore , I 'm afraid of uninstalling Adobe Bridge -LRB- and perhaps losing CS2 to antipiracy practices -RRB- and losing 400 bucks at the drop of a hat.Pro-Anti Piracy fiends argued recently in a Forum that college students spend all their money on their computer , so why should n't they buy software such as Adobe 's ? Well , if I spent all my money on Adobe , how can I upgrade my computer to run the goshdarn thing ? Furthermore ... why should I?Chalk one up to Piracy .
 I could not activate it and Adobe told me there were a lot of good looking but pirated copies out there.The vendor credited my money immediately .
 All pain , no gain !! This product is very slow , running on Windows XP Pro , 1.25 GB memory , and 2GHz machine . Even the menus are slow . No gain -- only one `` new brush '' the spot healing brush . If you like Photoshop 7.0 , you will really like it after trying CS2 .
 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!! I LOVE PHOTOSHOP ! SO I bought the newest version of CS2 because of all the new features.BUT , I have the fastest computer made to date . 3.2 Pent D , 4 gigs ram and 2 250 gig hard drives . I ca n't even run this program , it is SOOOOO SLOW . It now sits in its box on the shelf collecting dust . I am using 7 now , because you can actually use it to design . If you use photoshop daily . DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION ! It is garbage and a computer hog .
 If I had $ 1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work , I 'd have about $ 10 . And that 's enough for me to say , BEWARE of this set of applications ! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated , too slow , and the results are that all the programs -LRB- but principally GoLive , InDesign and Illustrator , in that order -RRB- are crashy and will quite suddenly , forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished . I can not stress how disappointed I am in Adobe , and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join , thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future . In any event , do not buy the CS2 apps , Adobe does not deserve your support !
 I have been using Photoshop professionally since version 2 , and if given the choice , I might choose version 2 over CS2 . Stick with any other version you might be using ; avoid the upgrade . If you 're a new user , `` obtain '' an older version . CS2 is unacceptably slow , beta-level software . I keep looking at the box expecting to see `` Microsoft Office
 Photoshop is a pretty powerful tool , but it is undermined by its own supremely crappy print drivers . One piddling window with maybe four controls and NO PRINT PREVIEW ! No print preview for a piece of imaging software -LRB- at this late date -RRB- is perhaps the stupidest idea since the first caveman chewed on a tigers tail because he was hungry . Seriously , without a decent set of print drivers , you might as well try to alter your photos with a crayon and an iron . Idiocy . Unforgivable.Even Adobe 's own Illustrator has a robust Print controls window .
 Franklin Planner 7.1 was to upgrade Ascend 4 that I 'd been using since 1995 . The new program has only a subset of the features the older program had . Ascend 4 worked great , but recent changes in my work Windows XP environment was causing Ascend to be terminated at odd times . The new program comes with converters for Ascend 5 AND for Ascend 4 , except the Ascend 4 converter is missing one 16 bit . DLL file . Calls to Covey only resulted in `` We no longer support this software '' . One . DLL , that 's all I needed . My last Franklin Covey software . If I 'm to manually enter my info from Ascend 4 into another program , it wo n't be any of theirs !
 This is a game . Its educational value does not live up to what is promised on its cover , very misleading . What primary resource material was it talking about ? It was a game and if thats what you want to get your kid get civillization III , not only does it have more educational content , it also is more realistic and helps them learn the complexity and hardship alongside history and structure . In other words this was a waste of money !
 Did n't work with our Mac and our OS is up-to-date . Seller could n't refund opened software . Very disappointing , it was a birthday present for our son who plays this game in school .
 Cakewalk will not give you a refund if their software is faulty or does not work correctly . They will ignore consumer inquiries and will not give any assistance other than to tell you the basics , rather than admitting there 's a problem with the software . I 've NEVER seen anything like it as long as I 've been doing music . You 'd be much better off going with a Sony product , as they actually stand by their stuff .
 Adobe assumes that their customers are their objects and may be treated as criminals at their whim . Built into the software is a humiliating exercise that inconveniences the user for greater profits for the company . It involves having to reenter activation numbers and serial numbers in order to use your property . If you have three computers you may only use the program on one of them . If you have questions , call Adobe and ask to speak to a supervisor who has no interest in speaking to you . The arrogance indicates that Adobe , -LRB- as with Garmin or Nikon -RRB- is so far removed from their customers that they are willing to ignore them .
 If I had $ 1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work , I 'd have about $ 10 . And that 's enough for me to say , BEWARE of this set of applications ! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated , too slow , and the results are that all the programs -LRB- but principally GoLive , InDesign and Illustrator , in that order -RRB- are crashy and will quite suddenly , forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished .

 The sub title of this is misleading . It says Adobe upgrade version . It is an upgrade of an existing version and can not be used as a stand alone system . I had to return mine as I did not have the original versionBlair Williams
 My son had these programs for our OLD computer -LRB- Windowns 95 -RRB- and loved them but his disks would n't load on the newer computer -LRB- XP -RRB- so we ordered new disks -- I told him these probably wo n't work either -- and they do not work on XP . Does anyone still have a Windows 95 machine in in operation ? These are GREAT games , excellent , but will not work on XP . The disks arrived well sealed and good quality .
 Norton no longer supports this product and with good reason . It was great in windows 98 . Got rid of anything you want to get rid of in your puter . It does not work in xp AND you can not get rid of it . -LRB- yes I have gone to Control panel , add/remove etc. . And I have tried the uninstall in the product itself . -RRB- Just being there taking up space is bad enough but periodically it interfers with other programs . At this point in time I would say DONT USE IT .
 Just about the single worst font product I have ever had the displeasure of using -LRB- and I 've used every Mac font manager on the market for over a decade -RRB- . Extensis Font Reserve server redefines the words SLOW and BUGGY , completely trouncing the record heretofore held by long time heavyweight champion , Suitcase 2.1.3 from way back in the halcyon days of the mid 1990s . Completely unreliable . Frequent unexplained errors , freezes and crashes and other generally bizarre and thoroughly upsetting behavior . If you 're familiar with network computing and know why it never took off , you will understand why Extensis Font Reserve Server is a complete and utter disaster . If you think you 're getting too much work done , just install this product and get ready to sloooooowwww dooooowwwwnn.If someone offers you this product , run screaming into the night .
 Ever since Adobe bought out this small operation , customer service has been severely lacking . Software will NOT work on Excel 2007 . The promise for additional POWERLOOKS has become dead . Granted that the program makes presentation more interesting , the Powerlooks that was in production are no longer on the website . This is highly disappointing as I purchased this program in anticipation for further development on the Powerlook templates .
 First , I should have listened to my instincts and downloaded the trial version BEFORE purchasing . Had I done this I would HAVE NEVER purchased this product . As it is , having bought the product from a box store and NOT online , I made a $ 99.00 mistake , plus tax.The product has too many limitations to be considered as a viable add-on to your powerpoint presentations . As a presenter , using PPT every week , in training presentations , I can tell you that this product does more to limit PPT 's slide producing capabilities than it does to add to them . As a matter of fact , I found the product to `` take away '' from PPT 's slide building procedures , NOT `` add '' to them.Save your money and wait for the next PPT add-on to come along . This product is worth neither your investigative time , nor your monetary investment .
 I use PowerPoint a great deal as a teacher and thought this would upgrade my presentations . Unfortunately , every one of my computers had insufficient video memory to allow the software to work . For now , it sits on my shelf until I can purchase more powerful equipment . Certainly not for the casual user . It is n't the magic black box that will make you a star .
 I got the trial and bought the software shortly thereafter . For those who are PPT maniacs , it 's pretty limited . For the other 99.99999 % of us , it 's great because you do n't have to spend a ton of time on animations , tweaking it , or worrying about everyone having seen it before -LRB- at least the first few times :D -RRB- . However , Adobe bought Serious Magic last year . Microsoft released Office 2007 . And having Office 2007 installed on a computer is sufficient to cause Ovation to work in creative and unique ways that are not especially helpful . In my case , I have a 1300-slide deck I use for training . No , I do n't use 1300 slides - more than half are hidden and exposed only as required . But when I open Ovation on my Office 2007-enabled laptop , I see 1300 title slides.Called Adobe Ovation support , and eventually got the right answer
 Fortunately , I tried the trial version of Ovation , now owned by Adobe . The software did not work properly . Every presentation I imported was just a collection of the title slide , over and over again.Multiple attempts to get support from Adobe , just to find out if I could get the software to run -LRB- at which point I would have purchased it -RRB- , resulted in dead ends.I was told I would have to buy the product to find out whether I could get it to run properly!This seems to be like a poor-stepchild in the Adobe family . For example , I could not find a working user forum to ask questions , in lieu of proper customer support .
 ... and Adobe as ZERO plans to EVER support Vista . It 's a seriously great program , though , if you 're planning to use XP for the rest of your life -LRB- smirk -RRB- . I 'm VERY disappointed in Adobe for dangling hope in their user forums for well over a year before finally pulling the plug forever .
 Remember when you first got Windows Me , how people installed it and how much BSOD , `` Blue Screen of Death '' you got every time you used it . Sometimes it just would give u a memory error even when you had enough ram to run 7 things at once . Well thats how Gigastudio 3.0 is except - worse . It crashes uncontrollably and as soon as it begins to work something else happens . It either freezes up or crashes the pc . I have a Dual Core 2 Pentium 4 3.04 gigahertz pc with 2 gigs of ram and enough space on hardrive . Everything is updated on my pc and yes Tascam Corp. . I turned off virus scan when running this program - not that Avast has anything to do with the programs problems with crashes as a whole . Anyway , it does n't matter how good your system is ; that wo n't do any good . I built this system especially for it and it crashed like crazy . I do n't know what is worst . I ca n't even load instruments on it let alone get to use it often . I am defiantly returning this and those of you who got it to work I wonder how . I have an Audiophile 2496 Maudio Gsif , and Asio 2 compatible sound card and still Gigastudio 3.0 gives me hell . I decided that maybe Tascam should consider finishing development of their software without just distributing it bug-infested . Kontakt 2 never crashed on me and most other music samplers did n't either . But Gigastudio is a different , one of the worst products I got and it just makes me think what the software coders were thinking when they created this product ... . I rate this program a 2 out of 5 . The 2 is for the packaging and beautiful look ... . If your seriously thinking about getting this program just make sure you are ready for the frequent crashes , and the long wait on the phone for the CSR to answer you , do n't bother emailing unless you are willing to wait a week to get an answer !!
 Remember the girl who broke your heart ? She was SOOOO magic ; Aphrodite , Athena , Artemis all in one incredible , beautiful creature . You kept trying and trying and trying.She 'd play you , too . Spend a little time with you , batting those beautiful eyelashes , brushing against you so alluringly -- then blowing you off yet again . But it was always the same story -- you 'd end up alone at the end of the day with nothing to show for all your efforts but pain and frustration.You finally wised up and blew her off once and for all -- and for three months never heard from her , until , day by day , like a nasty scrape , the pain dulled , and you would find yourself surprised that hours , even days had passed without a thought of the pain that had once dominated your entire world.Then the phone call would come , and , with a sweet , honeyed voice , she 'd work her magic on you again , and you 'd think to yourself `` maybe THIS time things 'll be different ... `` Enter TASCAM and their magic product `` Gigastudio '' , the reputed sound sampler of the gods . GIGABYTE-sized , absolutely authentic sounds from your MIDI tracks . The ability to create aural magic for the price of a small television set.And I bought the hype.Not once , but twice.Now I 'm no slouch with hardware -- in addition to a one-year tech certification , I 've got Microsoft MCP and COMPTIA A + and Network + certifications . I can build a PC from the ground up with my eyes closed and diagnose and repair virtually any problem.I 've also used a number of different audio products -- Cakewalk , Sonar , Sonic Foundry , Halion , all will generally excellent results . But EVERY incarnation of Gigastudio has only caused bluescreens or simply refused to function.After shelling out the first 150 bucks and spending months and months of fruitless tweaking and rebuilding , you 'd think I would 've learned my lesson.But no , not this hopeless romantic.When music giant Tascam bought out Nemesys , the company responsible for the first Gigascrewedio , I thought -- like so many other hapless victims -- that THIS time things would be different.And so I parted with another cool 250 bucks with the blind faith of the lovestruck.Needless to say , the relationship never got past first base -- the initial installation -- and , since I waited past the warranty date , I am , once again , nicely out of luck.So I called Tascam right before the holidays.Getting only a recorded message , I spoke nicely , calmly , and gave detailed information about the problem , along with my contact information . I sent out a follow-up email , along the normal channels.No answer.I kept trying , calling long distance at different times of the day , leaving messages with tech support and the main number . E-mail after email followed.After two weeks , my patience wore somewhat thin -- hell , even a form letter would have been appreciated as a simple gesture of courtesy.But now , a month later , it seems I just ca n't get no lovin ' from Tascam.Fact is , Tascam , she just do n't care.And so , as I finally promised , I 'm parting company with Gigascrewdio , never to look back . And to all of you hoping to make music with this expensively-wrapped , overly-hyped , perfumed piece of fecal matter , expect the same . You ai n't gettin ' no lovin ' there.I , for one , will be looking into lemon laws to try and recoup my cash so as to spend it better elsewhere.And so , that eternal advice still has n't changed
 I purchased Gigastudio 3 Orchestra 11 months ago in the hopes of updating the sounds for my synth . I was intending to use a laptop so that I could travel and gig with the gigastudio . Well ... after many , many failed attempts to get gigastudio to run correctly with my chosen components -LRB- Tascam FW1804 -RRB- I needed to call Tascam for help . Unfortunately , they were not taking calls that morning -LRB- this was during normal business hours -RRB- and they simply hung-up on my call after I had been waiting on hold for 15 minutes . In addition their support personel were NEVER able to help me set-up my system even though I was using every system that they specified on their website -LRB- no lie -RRB- . Long story short ... This was not the first incident of being hung-up on and being misguided by their customer service , but it 's definately the last for me . I bought a new keyboard instead . It was much easier to set-up , and the customer support was great.If you are reading this can can rest assured that I am an average consumer and not one of their competitors because I have never mentioned any of their other competitors in this review . Tascam 's customer service is poorly managed and it shows . You 'll be happier with a different product .
 Tascam needs to take this product off the market , because I am pretty loath to purchase anything from this company ever again , and I am a 30 year loyal customer -LRB- 3340 's , 8516-A 16 track , M3700 , DA38 's , FW 1804 , etc -RRB- . If this product is any indication of the direction this company is taking - watch out!I purchased the Orchestra version after reading the rave reviews they published , but these folks must have purchased & installed the product during a very specific window of PC hardware & O/S . Anyone with a dual core will see crashing unlike anything we have seen for many years - we are talking entire OS winks out , not even a blue screen - just launch Giga Studio when you need to do a really fast shut down . VISTA is right out , but even XP will crash ALL THE TIME on modern hardware . You will not get any productive time with the software on a modern PC.Now , you wil get to see it run if you can patch together a very old -LRB- 4-5 years -RRB- PC , but it will be very , very slow . And it will still crash sometimes , PC will hang , and it will not work well at all with any other sequencers . They say to use SP1 , but SP2 is where we are now with XP.Right now , I am fighting the license scheme because after trying to get it to run on all of these various configurations , I can not restore the license , and my grace time has run out . Which gives me time to write this review.Tascam - shame on you . You need to do a recall on this baby , and at least TRY to retain some lifetime customers .
 After first loading and playing this awhile , the images got all fuzzy.This problem was then passed on to anything my child tried to do on her computer - all games , even the opening screen.The problem did not go away until I uninstalled Rolie.My daughter loves the show but found the play value very disappointing.The computer has a 333MHz Pentium , Windows 98 Plus , 128Mb ram , 1Gb available on hard drive , and an 8Mb graphics accelerator card - so well exceeds the system requirements called for by this game .
 My son loves Rolie Polie Olie and I really enjoy reading the books to him , but I 've been pretty disappointed in this software title.In short , consistent with what some others have reported , it just does n't work very well . Despite my system meeting the minimum requirements easily , the software only works sporadically , and when it does it 's often herky-jerky with pixelated graphics.It 's also not at all clear what you 're supposed to do , which makes it a tough slog . But even once you 've figured it out , there 's just not much to it . When it 's working , it looks cool , but the 3 or 4 games it contains are n't anything to get exciteed about.I 'm giving 2 stars only because my kid is an RPO fan and because of that has still managed to enjoy the game some . I suspect that wo n't last past the novelty .
 The CD claims it works on 95/98/Me / XP . having XP I can tell it 's _ not _ true for XP . For starters , it will tell you `` no disc inserted '' unless you run the game as administrator . It defeats the purpose of creating accounts if your 2 year old son has to log on or run stuff as administrator . I ca n't understand why it 's so slow on a 2.6 Ghz computer with 1Gb of memory.Then when you exit the game , your desktop colors become messed up . You need to log off and back on to retrieve correct colors .
 This game is lame . I had no technical problems whatsoever , the game is simply boring . I agree with the other review that says it 's hard to figure out what you are supposed to do . The game does n't make any sense . It 's counter intuitive - a very bad thing for a kid game . I got it as part of a suite of kids software , and I 'm thankful that I did n't buy it separately . But , I have to live with the never-ending cycle of my 2 year old wanting to hear the song and see the characters -LRB- she cried until I load the CD -RRB- like it 's a cartoon . Then , she gets frustrated and cries when she has no idea what to do . And , my 4 year old became almost immediately bored with the game when it 's pointless nature became evident to her as well . She went back to the Scooby Doo mysteries -LRB- which are really good -RRB- . I think I 'm going to uninstall it and throw it in the garbage just to get away from it . It 's that bad .
 We waited for months for this to be released and we were thrilled that it finally shipped . Unfortunately , we had problems with it from the start . The installation crashed my machine . Then , once it installed , running the game crashed my machine . It works intermittently , but it does work , so decided to keep it . My daughter is 2 , and is definitely young for the game , but I do n't think it will keep her attention even when she 's older . It 's extremely slow and clunky too . Overall , I 'm just really unhappy with the whole thing . The only thing going for it is that it 's Olie ! And , of course , the characters in the show are cute .
 This is awful ! Some of the pictures I still ca n't figure out what they are . It was very confusing and young children just get frustrated because they do n't get it -LRB- neither do I -RRB- . DO NOT BUY THIS !!
 I was very disappointed in almost every way.The interface is archaic and awkward . This is 2007 . It looks straight out of 1997 . They need to get with the times . The least they could do is put text labels on the buttons . It 's too bad they invested in appealing packaging instead of sensible interface design.I was required by the program to change my screen resolution . This is odd because most programmers have little trouble integrating that into code . Well , this is a flash-based program , so I guess we can t expect that level of sophistication.The animations are crude . It 's without exaggeration to say that most people can hand draw better than this.The whole product amounts to little more than a mishmash of other programs thrown together by people more interested in selling than educating . There are far better resources all over the Internet .
 I bought this item to help my middle school child improve in algebra mainly . The math portion of this software is a joke . One the cover it boasts ` Over 2000 exercises !!!! ' Unless you consider it an exercise for some cartoon to talk AT you I did n't see one.The algebra section is a joke !! It skips from equations to linear graphing functions and when you attempt to see if there is anything more offered , your instructed to buy yet another possibly useless set of software.You can not learn math without DOING IT !! Someone can talk all day but without actually having activities or exercises there is no way to learn it.I actually went to the Topics entertainment site to express my disdain and GUESS What ? There 's is no way to submit an email to the company to voice either satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the company 's product . Of course a company with its ear to the ground in eager anticipation of meeting its clients needs would have no way to contact them.Save your money , tune in to Barney , its just as effective for teaching Algebra .
 I really wanted this to work it , starts of good but then bugs start flying , when the intros for most lessons begin it will race trough what they are saying at an unintelligible pace and then freeze the system causing a crash to my Pentium 4 2.6 ghz XP service pack 2 computer . If you choose to skip the intro to some lessons the will work about 50 % on a whole this software runs at about 50 % stability meaning you have a 1 in 2 chance of a problem when doing a lesson.Let this be an open invitation to software developers to fill the need that has yet to be fulfilled area for kids 12to 18 and adults who need basic math skills done in an easy to understand way .
 -LRB- Note
 The price is attractive and the kit takes up virtually no space . However , do not buy this kit until you have read Michael Reichmann 's review on luminous-landscape . com . There is a severe Micrsoft warning -LRB- XP Home -RRB- not to proceed with scanner installation . Take it serioulsy . Like Michael I did not . There is also a circular software problem in Photoshop to do with internal communications that you can suffer . Re-insatalltion as recomended by Pantone/Colourvision on their web site can lead you ino a circular need to reinstall . They also claim dual video support for SypderPro 2 . But the readme file says Windows does not support mutiple profiles with a dual video output video card . How many folks have 2 video cards on a PC ?
 This is , without a doubt , by far , the worse software I have ever seen . Perhaps the software had a malfunction , but there was no help key , and no means by which to go from window to another . After 2 hours , we gave up . We had to play a sumo wrestling game , a pac-man type game with a witch , but no chess . This was a chess software program and it was terrible . We never learned one thing about chess . It was ridiculous . My kids much prefer Lego chess to this .
 I bought this CD during 2010 and full unopened package got misplaced during my house shift . Recently i opened this CD and tried to install and use it.The installation is succeeded . But while attempt to run this CD , the software throughs error mentioning `` please insert Genuine CD '' . Seems this CD sold here is not an original one . It is copied CD . The protection in the Software does n't allow to run the copied CD.Now i do n't know what to do with this junk piece . It is totally useless.I never expected such product from amazon .
 Never able to get this to work . It would run through the story line and then crash . We use Chessmaster instead . They have a nice game area for little kids .
 I have 7 and 9 year old boys that play chess . They are also both very computer savy . I bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy , but they say they find it boring and do n't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces . The characters are very difficult to identify and confusing , they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes . I 'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club .
 It is deceiving . The jacket show it as gorgeous but the actual thing is a very cheap one . I have heard before about the Aamzon that it is a sellers ' world and buyers ' losing ground , I support that after purchasing several items from Amazon . Beware of Amazon Sellers especially for non-book items . Those are cheap and full of misleading information . There is no easy process to get refund like ebay .
 I bought this game with the intenion of learning some new chess attack techniques but found the tactics too common -- not in the specific set of moves , but in how Kasparov executes the moves on the software.Overall , 2 stars .
 I know many others like this program , I for one feel it is not user friendly . It is not easy to begin with , and the manual does not support the users ability to look up and find a specific item they need to address . The lessons are structured in a step by step process that does not allow the user to interpolate onto their specific need . There are a total of 4 only 4 activations on different computers , which means over the life of the program that if you upgrade computers frequently , you will be paying for additional activations EVEN if you experience a computer crash . Their yahoo group does n't seem to be helpful at all , and I do realize that it is not a part of the EQ network . Even activation initially was a hassle . Wish I had kept my money and found something else .
 The most valuable thing in this software is the calculation of yardage . Otherwise , the drawing/tracing tools are difficult and inadequate and it 's too difficult to import scanned images to add your own fabric to your sketchbook . Overall a clumsy software .
 I gave up on 3D Home Architect -LRB- look for my other review ; hereinafter called 3D HA -RRB- and decided to try out one or two others . Next up is Total 3D Home . As expected from other reviewers ' comments , it wo n't work for me but I 'll try to give a bit more detail on what you 'll find . Unfortunately the `` professional '' reviewers at Consumer Reports and the PC magazines wo n't tell you what you 'd really like to know.The good news with this one
 I wish I would have read reviews of this product before purchasing it . I bought it from Target for $ 30 . I knew it was not going to be top of the line software , but all I really wanted to was build a model of my home , import pictures of my furniture -LRB- which it says you can do -RRB- , and try out different paint and decorating schemes . Unfortunately , this program is incapable of doing even the simplest tasks.I have tried to create a model of my home multiple times . The problem is , once I encounter an error in the program and it shuts down -LRB- this happens pretty much every time I go from Space or Design Plan view to Walk Through view -RRB- my files are corrupted . I have done hours of work getting the measurements of rooms just right , but once the program has crashed , I am no longer able to open my file . I thought perhaps I was asking too much of the program , so I scaled back the house to one floor , then to one room . I finally tried to use one of their sample room plans . As soon as I went to Walk Through view and tried to change paint or fabric colors , the program crashed.I do not have a wimpy computer . I have an Intel Pentium D 950 -LRB- 3.4 GHz -RRB- , 2GB of system memory and 256MB of video memory on my NVIDIA GeForce 7800GTX . I can run Adobe Premiere and 3DS Max without encountering problems . I just ca n't seem to get this software to work.The only positive thing I have to say is that I enjoyed messing around in the Idea Gallery . There are 20 + pictures of rooms that you can redecorate by selecting a wall , comforter , or window covering and try out different colors and patterns . Unfortunately , even though it told me I was successful in importing my photos and custom textures , I was never able to apply or even view them in the program.Overall , I 'd have say that this software sucks . I strongly advise anyone considering purchasing it to look at other home design programs .
 I bought this software to help design my lanscaping . Before I could start that , I had to build my house room by room on the program . Tedious and frustrating ! You can use a sample house , but good luck finding one that looks like your house . While I was building my house , the program froze several times , and I had to start over . Finally , the house was built - sort of . I have a cape cod with dormers , could n't figure out how to make the roof look right . I called tech support . After calling several times and hearing a recording saying no one could take my call , I finally reached a tech support rep. He clearly hated his job and did n't want to help . When I complained about walls and windows disappearing and the program freezing , he said `` Yeah , that happens alot . '' I emailed him my design and he said he would work on it . That was a week ago . No response . I am computer literate , so this is not a case of the program being too advanced . It is poorly designed . I would reccommend a pencil and graph paper over this program .
 I really wish I had read the reviews before buying this product . Like another reviewer here , I bought this program to model my house and try some different designs . My computer is WELL above the required specs , and I am a veteran of Adobe Photoshop , so I know my way around sophisicated graphics programs.This software not only continually crashes doing simple tasks , but the simple tasks are tedious and hard to do at times . I live in a one-story house with a slightly complex layout . Because some of my rooms are not entirely square , this program has a hissy fit trying to adjust dimensions . It never quite comes out right , and constantly throws messages about rooms overlapping even when such is not the case . If you ignore the warning pop-ups about 3-8 times over and over , eventually the program accepts your changes and does n't complain . But the headache just is n't worth it.The program also suffers from lack of a good ` undo ' function . It rarely will undo more than your last change , and sometimes it wo n't even do that . In other words if you make a mistake , chances are you 're going to have to go back to your last saved file -LRB- you did save , did n't you ? -RRB- and start from that point again . Some things you place , like diagonal walls for instance , are also inexplicably immune to being deleted.I might play with this some more just to try and do individual rooms , but overall this software is a GRAVE disappointment . I could do my home design much more easily in `` The Sims 2 '' and have a lot more fun doing it .
 When I realized that what I really like about `` The Sims '' is designing their houses , I decided I could get more bang for my buck with Computer Assisted Design -LRB- CAD -RRB- software . I researched all of the products out there , and decided that the Punch ! Architectural Series 4000 was the cream of the crop for a non-architect/casual fun user . The only drawback noted to Punch ! software was the lack of Help/Tutorials . It was suggested that I buy a cheapo version to learn the basics of navigating computer assisted design.The PAS 4000 is on my Christmas list . My mom loves it when we find stuff , order it sent to her , and open it on Christmas Eve . So I ordered it from Amazon for $ 119 , and it 's on the way to her . Yesterday , I went to Target and bought the $ 30 Total 3D Home and Landscape software to bring me up to speed on CAD.It is a good learning tool , but it does crash , a lot !! In only one day of use , I 've already corrupted a file . When the program crashed , and I tried to re-open the file , it simply crashed again . There was no way I could re-open that file . And I have a powerful Dell computer that is less than one year old.So , if you want to do some serious design , do n't waste your money on Total 3D Design and Landscape . It will just be an exercise in frustration .
 I can only contribute to a lower rating . -LRB- It does n't even deserve the one star that I 'm forced to give . -RRB- Others have already properly stated my complaints and suggestions for improvement . Useless waste of time .
 BEware of this software . It is very unreliable , unstable and easy tasks become frustrating . For example some walls you cant erase , others you can.Installing is very complicated as I tried in 3 different computers -LRB- by the way , I am a compueter engineer -RRB- . After many hours of dealing with creating new directories and trying reseting the machines several times I got the softare to run . Once you are playing with designing plans , the system resets and you loose your work . -LRB- This has happened several times -RRB- . All in all , muy suggestion is DO NOT buy this software . The packaging is the only nice thing about it . By the way , the graphics do not come close to the graphics shown in the box.One last thing , once the system crashes -LRB- Which is often -RRB- , you need to shut down the computer since the end task function does not work.Regards \ Ed
 I saw this software in Staples and thought I would give it a try.Utter waste of time . I have a workstation with the latest specs . I installed Total 3D and spent alot of time inputting my stuff only to do a walk through and see no walls , no appliances , no furniture , just lots of green and bits and pieces of details in a non-sensical arrangement.Not even the samples work.DANGER ! DO NOT BUY .
 I have been using home design software for quite a few years . I frist ran across this software when it was put out by Borderbund . I thought then I had been riped off . I did not know it was the same software when I bought it again . It has not changed . It still does not work as they say it will . The graphics are horrable and even on a 64 bit 2.8 gig system take to long regenerate . You can not see any of the so called changes as you put them in . If you add cabinitry it does not show up until you render it . Even then it is hokey . You can not move arround in the layout unless you select a diverent function.If you have bought it and like it , try to stack stairs and see if your system does not crash .
 My wife bought me this software because I like to draw the dream house I would build if I won the lottery . While the software is very easy to use it does n't save what you 've done with any consistency . I just lost the house I 've been working on for months because it wo n't open . Stuff moves everywhere in the house ; walls and openings you 've put in disappear . I will be buying another product from another company .
 This is pretty ambitious software , and you will have fun - at first . Then you discover that if you make any tiny little error , such as two walls that are not quite connected , or a room that overlaps another room , or some error that you do n't even know about , THE PROGRAM BLOWS UP . And your file , with hours of work , is toast . And THERE IS NO TECH SUPPORT -LRB- they claim they will return calls , but they do n't -RRB- . DO N'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU ARE A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT .
 Have tried repeatedly to use this software to plan decor and future additions to my home . Very difficult to use ! It actually erased the floor in one of the upstairs bedrooms with no apparent remedy , is extremely limited on how you are allowed to `` size '' furnishings , creating stairways is extremely difficult , the tutorial only covers a small amount of information , and there is no manual included with the software . I do not like using this at all !
 I bought this software to design my gardens . Another reviewer here raves about how easy it was for him to manipulate , but it almost drove me to throw a temper-tantrum . He must work for the Company.Like the other reviewers , I have plenty of computer experience . I do n't understand why they make this program so difficult to use . There are buttons that work on this screen and not that screen -LRB- so many useless buttons and menus -RRB- that you lose track of what you were doing while trying to figure out how to move that blasted rectangle . You CAN form any shape desired , given that you have nothing to do for hours on end.My dad is an architect , so I vaguely know how to use AutoCAD . Learning that arcane programmer language would be much easier than using this . Now I 'm angry and frustrated and my husband is hiding in the bedroom . I should have stuck with my graph paper and pencil.I was going to sell this product on Amazon.com , but after reading these reviews , I just ca n't do this to you guys . Please , steer clear of this software until the kinks are worked out .
 Pitstop has always been a huge hassle . We have owned this at least a decade , since before version 5.1 . The software is enormously expensive , and therefore should work , have easy installation and updates , and especially great support . It has neither and is even worse than that . Years ago , it was the only thing that did what it does with PDFs , so our business needed it . Today , there are many other applications for the Mac and for the PC that do essentially what it does.The latest , version 10 , updated , for Mac to version 11 , is the worse yet . It demands install logins and passwords , on top of passwords , and activation Keys for the original and updates for the keys for the update , all of which links do not work on their web site . Links do not work . Passwords are not accepted , even after they send them , which is done automatically because Support can not be reached for direct access.There is no phone support , which is inexcusable for such a high priced application . Support takes days to respond to their hard to find web forms , and then demands what amounts to the user doing much of their work for them . A horror to deal with.For this already super expensive product , I have 200 dollars worth of latest update that does not install and which stopped the previously installed software from working weeks ago . I have had 6 or 7 communications with sales and support , sending them all the hard to find/get info they took their time asking for , and they still do nothing about it.Avoid this company and its products .
 Bought the game , loaded it and installed the patch on a Desktop running XP . Hangs up in the load scenario window . I left it running over night-still never loaded . POS .
 I installed the gameupdated to service pack 1installed the patchdeleted the videos -LRB- It would n't load till I did this -RRB- installed the directx drivers -LRB- do n't know if this was neccessary -RRB- and set compatability mode for windows 2000windows NT 4.0 also seems to run.Problem is I ca n't get it to save.I think it 's a really fun game but that the original would have been better if it had n't been even more buggy . In the original I could never capture ships which made me angry . . And now I ca n't save .
 Age of Sail II is a real time-naval combat game set during the era of the great fighting ships from 1775 to 1820 . Steeped in military history , the game offers over 100 single player scenarios , a battle campaign , and multiplayer games over a LAN or the Internet for up to 16 people . More than 1200 historical ships , primarily from British , American and French fleets , are depicted in painstaking detail . A floating 3D camera allows you to oversee large battles encompassing numerous ships.Installation of the one-CD game is uneventful and quick , followed by the now-typical opening animation sequence , which , in this case , is unimpressive with its fuzzy look and non-representative impression of gameplay . Fortunately , once the animation is over , the graphics improve . Conversely , many scenario briefings are poorly written , and do little to either elucidate the goal of the battle or induce any excitement.You begin the main campaign as a captain of an American ship with the task of subduing five British vessels . The task seems difficult for a first scenario , but in actuality it appears to be the closest thing the game has to a training mission , and the goals are accomplished rather easily . Battle takes place through the use of cannons and a targeting overlay helps in planning an effective strategy . Damaged ships from either side may choose to strike their colors and fly a white flag in surrender . During battle , ships may also catch on fire , go aground in shallow water , be boarded , or , if they get too close , get their riggings entangled -LRB- or fouled -RRB- . At the end of the scenario , victory points are awarded to both sides based on how many ships sink or surrender during the battle , and the number of points determines how much prize money is awarded for a scenario . Prize money is used to buy crew , repair ships or even buy new ships . Each scenario also provides a certain number of prestige points that may be awarded , which serve as the `` score . '' As the campaign continues , a successful player may receive awards in the form of promotions , gifts from other nations , and even public approval.The undeniable focus in the game is on the ships , with variability determined by a number of factors including hull strength , decks , sails , maneuverability and speed . As ships are damaged by cannon fire , rips appear in sails and holes materialize in hulls . The background can be adjusted with the game controls , but at its highest setting , the seas , sky and coastline are beautifully rendered . Background sounds include what one would expect from a naval game
 I got this game for $ 4 , but I loaded it up on my Vista laptop and it do n't work . I tried the compatiably to XP , but it did n't work . I put it in my XP desktop , loads perfectly , but when I pick a battle the battle wo n't load or would freeze up mid-battle .
 Tried loading it , froze up . Downloaded patches - wo n't run . Think it needs a better computer than I have .
 This was confusing for an 8 yr old who wants to learn to play . It did n't show how to place fingers on keyboard , went on from the assumption of knowing finger placement and how to read music already .
 I purchased the product and installed it . Ran an image backup and it seemed fine . Next I tried backing ups certain Quicken Data files and folders and could not restore them.Calls to Symantec technical support go half way around the world and they never get back with an answer . When I call daily to check on the status , they continue to say that they are `` still working on it . `` Buy at your own risk .
 I purchased Norton Save and Restore because I am a digital photographer with no real `` system '' for backing up important files , documents and photographs . Things get backed up when I have the time to burn back up DVDs . Very infrequently!I installed the product -LRB- following directions -RRB- on a Windows XP computer that is just barely a year old and I should state a computer I have never had a problem with . Within a few minutes of running my first backup , the computer froze with an error message about some kind of memory read issue . I then tried to reboot the system per the on screen instructions.Guess what?My hard drive had become unreadable . So instead of saving and restoring , I 'm out a lot of money - way more than the cost of this product and I 've lost photographs that ca n't be replaced along with tax information , important documents and so forth.I tired to use the product to `` restore '' my system but since the initial back up did not complete , the restore disc just froze and my computer is not much more than a memory.Symantec is not interested in my story . The drive is dead . That 's my problem . Nice ... If you want safe back ups of your digital information , buy a second or third hard drive , run a raid system or use some kind of copy technique like I did with DVDs . Do NOT trust this product . Its a five star rip-off !
 I 've used many Norton/Symantec products in the past and been generally satisfied . I am pretty good with computers , but have not been able to get this program to work properly , and I 'm left without options because Norton 's technical support is almost nonexistent . The program seems to be full of bugs , so do n't waste your money on this one .
 The program crashed my external hard drive and made it impossible to run my older version of Norton Antivirus . Even better Tech support is non-existent unless you pay an extra fee . Do not buy this product !
 ... I downloaded the trial version of this and hated it ... it 's bloatware and hung on me -LRB- some of same errors I saw in other reviews -RRB- when I was testing it out . Save your money and buy something else . I am a loyal Norton user , but having just recently upgraded to WIN XP and thus looking at 2006 Norton products , I am shocked at the bloatware , phone home , buggy software they seem to have recently turned out . Based on reviews of their products and my test of this product.This is what I want in back-up software -LRB- Norton , are you listening ??? -RRB- . I want to create an image of my hard disk occasionally , and back it up to CD/DVD/USB Drive . And I want to be able to explore the image . And do the backup and all functions under Windows while I am working on something else . I do n't want incremental backup bloatware . In other words , what I want is Ghost 2003 with extended features . WHY have you wrecked Ghost -LRB- of which this product is an incarnation -RRB- ??? If you do want to buy , my advice is to download the trial version of this from Symantec and try that before purchasing . If it does n't work to your liking , for backup software I would suggest Paragon Drive Backup 8.0 or R-Drive Image 3.0 . I am very impressed by the Paragon software -LRB- the R-Drive Image software is good also , but the Paragon software is more advanced . -RRB- Paragon Drive Backup 8.0 is very solid/stable and I only had one issue , and that was with creating the CD Recovery Disk . I e-mailed support and they were very prompt in answering and they fixed my problem first time out . Paragon Drive Backup 8.0 can also read an external USB drive from the Recovery Software -LRB- I tested it -RRB- . I felt compelled to look elsewhere for my backup needs as the reviews for Ghost 10 are depressing as well ... but Paragon did a really good job with their software ...
 After installing Norton S&R ; , I backed up 182GB of data from a 300GB internal C
 I bought Norton Save and Restore to mainly back-up stuff on my older computer . I tried to install it , and it gave me a warning popup that I was missing a driver in order for the product to work properly . -LRB- WAN Miniport -LRB- ATW -RRB- . -RRB- I contacted Symantec.Message one
 I fell for it ! I let Symantec take over my PC . I registered the product . I set a back up schedule that was perfect , every two days at 6 am . It ran each day.For a month this went on and then one morning while logging in my hard drive crashed , unrecoverable . No problem , I have a detailed back up as of 6 am that DAY!Was I wrong ! After installing a new drive re imaging and attempting to restore my data , nothing , the software would not recognize its own files . I then attempted to get help from Symantec . Chat only of course . No good they had no idea what went wrong , all data was lost luckily I was able to find an old back up a few months old.This was a tragedy . I trusted in this product and it failed me .
 I installed NSR on my new windows XP pro system . After installing all software I backed up my system using NSR and it went smoothly . After that I tried to create backups for select folders which turned out to be a nightmare . It seems you can not include same file in two different backups . Backing up on DVDs is problematic . Error messages are not descriptive . There are n't any options to recover from errors . And whenever I restarted the job , it seemed to me , NSR just assumed that the files were protected by the previous run and finished without doing any work . I have spent a whole day and I have n't been successful to make it work .
 I bought it to move my 40gb drive to a 320gb drive . I 'll admit I had a bunch of trouble doing this but after spending an entire afternoon I was able to switch drives . After that I went to conduct a backup but the funny thing is S&R ; is still reporting my 40gb drive . So being a Release Engineer by trade I uninstalled the proudct , deleted the symantec folder and then checked my registry . Once I thought it was clean enough I reinstalled S&R ; and it still listed the 40gb drive . This to me suggests the Symantec writes registry entries that ca n't be removed or modified once there . These registry entries are also hidden and wo n't come up using the search function.This is when I contacted support , well the turnaround time for a response is 48 hours which I find unacceptable since our own Tech support department does n't do that . Well over several emails that had the strong impression they were following a script that was made from keywords . Well I made the mistake of mentioning that I had itunes installed . Well that is all they needed . Symantecs reponse to me now is to install some gear security drivers . I asked what these drivers are for and was told that third party apps use them to access the cd/dvd drives . The strange thing is I use my cd/dvd drives everyday for viewing and burning of both formats and no problems . I 've also never had a problem using itunes . Well its to the point now that they wo n't move the support any further unless I install these drivers . Its strange that backup software would have conflicts with applications that are n't running , with devices connected to the usb ports and need drivers to access drives it should n't be during a backup . One of supports first suggustions to me as to why I ca n't complete a custom backup job is my harddrive must be below 1mb of free space . Hmmm its says I have 50gb free.I have n't used any Symantec products in a long time because I got very tired of working around their conflicts but wanted some backup software and boy was it a mistake . I will never ever use another Symantec product again .
 This program failed an elective restore . Crashed on first test and my hard drive is unbootable . Symantec no help but will answer the phone fpr $ 69.95 . Get GoBack , at lease it works .
 Norton Save & Restore -LSB- Old Version -RSB- ~ Windows - Too complex and potentialy unreliable for saving and restoring files . Sorry to have purchased it . I 've installed and worked with many programs for many years . Too many programs in the Norton Save & Restore that can go wrong in the computer operating system . An external drive with a back-up program can do the same job without the potential problems .
 I downloaded and tried 10 backup programs today . I am preparing for a rebuild and was looking for a backup program that would do normal backups , differential backups , and scheduled differential backups . XP backup -LRB- ntbackup -RRB- works well but I had to create a password for my Windows logon so booting up always took two steps . The only reason I installed a Norton program on my hard drive was because I am replacing the drive . Using this program reminded me why I gave up on Norton a few years ago . Why is this program so large ? It does n't really do that much . It does much less than some of the smaller programs I tried . Just the `` updater '' took several minutes to download and two re-boots . That was n't an error ; it just took that much time and work . I used to see the `` updater '' screen often when I had my last Norton product and this was not a pleasant reminder . This program is not user friendly and specifying files and folders in not intuitive . This program specializes in file `` types '' -LRB- photos , music , etc. -RRB- I am supposed to trust Norton to select which files I am going to back up . Yeah , right . It does not even perform differential backups . Performing a search for `` differential '' in help yielded no results . StorageSync works well for syncing and non-compressed files but had no scheduling capabilities . Nero seemed difficult to use , and did not spend much time with it because it changes the restored file dates to the restore date . Genie worked well but had no differential and scheduling requires a password . Acronis TrueImage also requires a password for scheduling . Handy Backup got hung up on in-use files and had no differential backup . My favorite is Cyberlink PowerBackup . TurboBackup was my second favorite . It had some extra features but PowerBackup did everything I needed and was just a little more user friendly .
 Norton Save and Restore installed automatically without giving me the options of how I wanted it to work . Now it is on my desktop -LRB- where I do n't want it -RRB- . It slowed down my email , while it checks everything for virus , it would not install without demanding that I install another Microsoft program over the internet . It slows down everything and clutters my computer . I erased it . Powerquest has a product called `` drive image '' that I have used in the past and liked . I 'm going to check it out for a version for XP .
 I have yet to understand why this product received such a good review from the editor . It 's not easy to use . There is no natural flow and progression when you attempt to make projects . Not to mention the layout of the design screen is elementary and not very pleasing to look at . If you use this product make sure that your pictures are in folders that are n't more than one folder deep on your hard drive or you wo n't be inputting them easily into any projects . This product has caused me nothing but irritiation it feels like it is more suited for Windows 98 than Windows XP , I refuse to believe this product was designed and produced since computers came in the 75Mhz variety . Save your money and use it on something else
 The editing portion of the software is completly separate from the CD portion of the software and does not store in the same file . CD 's can hold upto approx 500 photos but the softwware will not accept more and allow you to discard down to burn 500 . I was told by Nova Development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the CD writer was a free add on to the program . The box and program info did not indicate that . I offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere .
 Lacks transitions between slides of digital pictures . Makes the slideshow somewhat flat . One good thing - can put music and also is quite fast in creating a VCD
 I worked hard on a VCD project for work using Photo Explosion . I did n't think it was that easy to use , but it was okay until I got ready to burn . Got a little error message that said something along the lines of `` You do n't have Nero burners ! '' No kidding , but there are four other burn programs on my computer . Nothing but Nero would do . NOWHERE on the box are you informed of this . It says , and I quote , `` Burn CD slideshows you can watch on tv ! '' Needing more software is never mentioned . As far as I 'm concerned , this product makes fraudulent claims . I will never buy another one of their products .
 Photo Explosion Deluxe is easy enough to use but wo n't print to printer correctly.Have a canon s900 that prints beautiful photo prints but after editing with photo explosion My print quality is very poor .
 Very limited photo touch up . When it comes time to burn you might as well have customer service on the phone . Pretty much a total piece of crap !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 This is the worst company I have ever dealt with . They offer 30 day trial on this product , I was n't happy and mailed it back to them in 5 days of purchase and I 'm still waiting for the refund . I have called them 3 times , it has been almost 4 months now without a refund . I would never buy a Nova product from this company again and I would recomend everyone going somewhere else to get good customer service .
 This software messed up my computer big time . It does something first of all , to Microsoft word . Word does not work properly after installation of Photo Explosion . It then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up . At first I only suspected it to be Photo Explosion . I had to have my computer sent back to HP . When I got it back I reinstalled Photo Explosion and the same thing happenend . BE CAREFUL . Product has BIG PROBLEMS - WHICH WILL GIVE YOU BIGGER PROBLEMS - I GUARANTEE IT .
 Bought Photo Explosion - version 3 . It would not install - support told me to remove my McAfee and then it would install.It did not and support never answered my email to follow up.Returned it
 I bought this thinking it was similar to PSE but only cheaper . I used it for awhile before uninstalling it and using the free PSE I got with my camera -LRB- after that got an upgrade for it as well -RRB- . I think quite honestly that you 'd be better off investing in a REAL editing program , you 'd be much more pleased with it once you learned to use it properly.While using this program , its easy to use , I give it that much . But colors do n't come out accurately which makes the prints look bad . The light and contrast is hard to get just right as well since its preset options . I remember it being a few things I liked on it but not enough to keep it as an addition , moving files between photo explosion and PSE makes it a lesser file which usually means lesser quality product in the end.So if you 're a beginner and need something to just play with , this probably will work for you . But if you 're thinking about getting into editing photos more seriously , please reconsider PSE or a better program .
 I got this with high hopes and ... well , I think I set my hopes too high . Maybe I expected too much.I have only been getting into digital image editing in the past two years and this was the place I had picked to start from . I have a digital camera and scanner and use them both to get images to my computer and had hoped that this software would give me a great deal of choices in dealing with those images . Not so.For one , the cloning tool is incredibly difficult to use . It is not intuitive -LRB- nothing in this program is -RRB- and often you have a hard time understanding where you are cloning from . The menu buttons with this tool , as with others , are set so far out of the way that they are not easily found -LRB- bottom left corner whereas the tool options are in the top left - also that button is very much the same color as the background , making it difficult to spot -RRB- . I do a great deal of air-brush type effects in my pictures and it took me 1.5 hours to brush out one thing in a picture with this software . In comparision I used a different program -LRB- PSP7 -RRB- to do something similar in ten minutes.The rest of the options are equally as riddled with problems . Some of the filters and things that can be applied to the picture do n't seem to work as well as other programs I have seen . The standard effects often come out buggy or misapplied . I have seen the Sepia filter skew an image a few times , for instance . The Dell imaging suite offers more choices and better results in that area . The warp tool is rigid and there is no chance of doing anything artistic or comical with it -LRB- no oversizing mouths like caricutures here -RRB- . The overlay function is either a -RRB- non-existant or b -RRB- so hard to find that I just did n't see it . I was trying to meld two pictures together and could get no results with either trimming the photo to try and fit or making it transparent to set it over the other.It does capture images well though . It fixes red-eye nicely too.For those who do not need a high-powered tool , this is perhaps your best bet . For those who want something that will allow them freedom to do with their photos as they wish , I would suggest something more powerful . The up in price is worth it .
 could not finish installcalled Nova tech supportafter asking for codes from the package guy concluded : it 's an old version , WILL NOT WORK WITH XP HOME SR 2Returning it back . What a scam !!
 Kept crashing from the day 1 . Customer support mentioned that there was a bug and they have fixed it in the new version and in order to use it I need to buy new version . What a joke . Rebate took more than 6 months with numerous inquiries . Never buy from NOVA . They are simply joke
 There is n't worthless software than this I had came across . Microsoft Picture it is like 1000 times better than this .
 I bought this software in March 2005 on Amazon and it took until October 2005 to get my 2 rebates that were supposed to make it free in the end . It took numerous emails and calls to get my refunds due to me . I guess Nova hopes customers just give up trying to get their money . The software is fine for everyday use , but do n't let NOVA rebates weigh into your purchasing decision .
 I bought this program thinking it would save a lot of time . Yes , it does once you 've manually set up your state & local withholdings . But be prepared to shell out money each year to keep it operational even though the manual says the updates are n't mandatory . THIS IS FALSE ! The real problem I have with the product is that you need to buy a mandatory update each year -LRB- $ 125 -RRB- in order to access the W2 forms for the current year . For example , I bought this in 2007 and ran my company payroll through it . Now that I want to print W2 forms for 2007 I HAVE TO BUY THE 2008 UPDATE - This is BS !! -LRB- bait and switch marketing -RRB- . So your real cost will be $ 165 PLUS $ 125 update just to use it in the current year.Of course these subtlties do n't surface until after the 60 day customer support period is over at which point Checkmark will be glad to charge you for this information . I 'm giving it here for free !
 I need to be able to generate 1099 forms as well as W-2 , but this program assumes that you never have to deal with contractors . For crying out loud , would it really be that difficult to include a template ? And of course , the competing manufacturers ' business software will allow you to print 1099 forms -- unless you have a Mac , like I do .
 Ordered Checkmark payroll in March of 2009 . It came good for 2007 . Needed to pay for upgrade to 2009 . Amazon was good at returning it but I still have not gotten my shipping costs back .
 I ORDERED THIS SOFTWARE FROM AMAZON ON JULY 6TH -1 -RRB- FIRST SHIPPMENT DID NOT HAVE A CD-ROM IN IT -LRB- NO SOFTWARE -RRB- , I RETURNED THE SOFTWARE -LRB- AS INSTRUCTED -RRB- FOR A REPLACEMENT .2 -RRB- SECOND SHIPPMENT -LRB- REPLACEMENT FOR THE FIRST -RRB- DID NOT HAVE THE CD-ROM IN IT EITHER -LRB- STILL NO SOFTWARE -RRB- , WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS TO REQUEST A REPLACEMENT - THEY SENT ME AN EMAIL : `` I am sorry that your replacement shipment was also problematic.As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought , we are not able to send another replacement.We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item ; however , I can not guarantee when the error may be fixed . `` I STILL DO NOT HAVE A RESOLUTION TO THIS !
 I have no idea how good this product is because when it arrived , the cd-rom was missing . Amazon is always good about dealing with such issues , but they 've run out of stock on this item . There is another review here with a similar `` missing '' software issue . I 'm a little freaked out about what to do next . The Amazon cardboard box was intact , it 's the retail box that had the issue . This means Amazon has a problem at their warehouse , or the theft must be taking place at the software maker 's warehouse and Amazon is neglectful about checking the seal . Either case , this is a really lame situation . I 'd suggest walking into a brick and mortar store . Buy the software in your hand , sealed box , etc. .
 I have been trying , for several months now , to get a reply from these guys . They do not reply to email support questions . Nor do they provide updates `` monthly '' to the database as promised in their literature.My version does not `` remember '' the search engines associated with each Project . So it is basically useless junkware . I am not at all happy . As I understand it , they were the authors of `` SoftSpider '' . They walked away from that product eventhough they had promised life time updates when I purchased the product . There is ZERO support for that and now also ZERO support for Traffic Seeker . At least up until now , that is my experience . Stay away from this product !
 I bought the Platinum program for one hundred and ninety nine bucks and it works for awhile . Customer service is aweful . They used to be good and answer your questions , but now its like they went out of business , and guess what guys , if they go out , so does your program , no warning . All thier programs have a phone home to check to see if your copy is legit and if it gets no confirm it shuts it down . That is where I am at . They dont answer the phone or emails . Web Grip is missing in action . Right now I am fighting with them through the better business Bureau and they arent wanting to help at all . It took the BBB to get them to respond at all.Look elsewhere and dont get anything from WebGrip as you will be left holding the bag .
 ok , so the first months i had this game i loved it ... it was like all i did . But then when I played it a couple of days ago , it kept freezing and not responding . I could n't even add keyboard or string music . I paid my money for a game that keeps freezing and wo n't let me add loops ? I do n't think so . If you want to use something good that will actually work , use Acid Techno 2.0 it is awesome . Do not buy this game the next year you use it it will freeze on you !
 This cd would not work in any of our computers ... we have updated computers ... so disappointed ... i had heard it was a very good cd for children ...
 What can I say . Save your money . There are better ways to get this map . I would say just average at least for me . This map is the same as the none topo version of the city navigator except it is supposed to have topo info on it which it does but just average at that . Garmin has been eating to much big dog cat food . It has gotten too fat off it 's customers .
 I ordered this map , assuming it was based on 24k USGS maps . When it arrived , I noticed that in the lower corner of the package it said 100k . This means than one inch of the map is equal to 100,000 inches -LRB- 1.57 miles -RRB- . This compares to one inch of the 24k map being 0.37 miles . When you consider that the map is in 2 dimensions , this means that the 100k map has about 1/16th as much detail as the 24k map . When you are using a map for hiking , small scale is very important.The 24k map is available on Amazon.com at the time of this review -LRB- 12/2009 -RRB- and is only about $ 10 more.Garmin Topo U.S. 24k Mountain North - Idaho-Montana-Wyoming
 names of paths and some roads had changed . This map looks 30yrs out of date . Used map with Garmin 400c and find the points are 500-600 feet off.Save your money .
 This program does n't do any more than `` Find '' or `` Search '' in Windows . It simply looks for JPG , GIF and other files by date and gives a long scrollbox full of them . At least with the `` Find '' you can sort by size , date , etc. . I 'm very disappointed and will have to find another package to really track web usage , not just scan the cache .
 I have worked with several Broderbund products before and enjoyed them , however when I received the software in the package there was no book , no instructions to navigate through the system , and too much switching of CDs to get to a simple graphic that I wanted .
 I teach 3-5 year olds , and was so excited to see this product , but I guess I was hoping for too much . I needed some good stuff foran Easter lesson and there were only 3 projects/graphics to choose from . I was also very disappointed in the small selection of coloring pages available . For the price they should have a lot more graphics and projects . It almost seems that the whole program is geared toward getting you to purchase add-on packs . The one thing that I did like , however , was the door-hangers you can make . But , that kind of project is NOT worth the price .
 Absolute waste of money . Description clearly stated this version of PrintShop was for Linux and in no way , shape , or form is that true.I contacted the seller and Amazon and got no reply.TOTAL waste of money and no response to me believing what they falsely wrote.Cannot get any worse than that.Grade = fail = `` F ''
 I wish I 'd read C. Meyer 's review before purchasing . I ended up having the same problem . This was described as working under Linux Operating Systems . That 's why I bought it . When I received it , the documentation included with Print Shop 10 states that it only works with Microsoft Operating Systems . It seems to me that it 's the seller 's responsibility to give accurate information . I wonder if this seller always puts misinformation in their descriptions ?
 I have worked with Print Shop for years in Window department of the computing world . It works very well , and I can make many shortcuts from using my Pagemaker . However , I almost bought the Amazon version which states very clearly all the different OSs that work with it . Wrong , wrong , wrong . Lucky I read those reviews , I would have had to send it back and then go through the hassles of not paying the credit card charge.Some people are just not business people . They operate on a crook basis . Thanks.Joseph Martel
 I bought Pagis because of its full range of functions -LRB- copier , fax , storage , search engine -RRB- and its file mgt system , with easy access thru Windows Explorer-type folders . Unfortunately , I 've had nothing but trouble getting it to work as advertised . Incessant crashes , cumbersome scanner interface , patches that do n't work , I wish I had $ 1 for every time I had to un - and re-install this program . The indexing function is a time-consuming nightmare which crashed on -LRB- rather than simply bypassing -RRB- any file deemed `` corrupted . '' This aborted a 2-3 hour indexing session and required me to start all over only to have it choke again . The OCR for indexing is buggy , and I was able to show tech support verified examples of the search engine completely missing strings that were readily visible in the indexed document . I grew tired of the `` re-install and re-index '' routine and chalked it up to experience . Pagis was a monumental waste of my money and the many hours I spent trying to get it to work .
 I used Pagis Pro 3 -LRB- part of PP Millenium -RRB- for several months . It was very slow and crashed from time to time . I did like it 's features , though . I was able to customize scans and got good copies . Textbridge worked OK with b & w typed material but made lots of errors with color magazine articles and took ages to correct.Since upgrading to IE5 .5 I have n't gotten Pagis to work . Scansoft 's patch and technical support have n't solved the problem either.Overall , a good program -LRB- when it works -RRB- , but buggy .
 Go out for dinner with the money you 'd have spent on this program ! I have n't had so much trouble with software since the Norton System Works nightmare ! Not only is this program slow to operate , it tends to stop other thing from operating ... like my scanner . And that 's the device that this software is supposed to enhance . Not in this lifetime ! I spent many hours trying different combinations of scanner drivers and updated drivers from Mustek all to no avail . Nothing I tried would allow all of my scanner fuctions to operate . When I could scan photos , the Text Bridge program in Pagis would n't work . When I got the Text Bridge program to function , the photo editing portion of the scanner software would n't work . Then , when I tried to scan a picture directly into an editing program , things locked up and my only out was to do `` control - alt - delete '' to open task manager and `` end task '' that way so I could get out of the locked program.I 'm not going to take up a lot of your time or mine here . In short , find another way to do what Pagis Pro says it will do and wo n't . Fortunately , I bought this at Costco so it 's returnable . Guess where I 'm going tomorrow !
 I have had Pagis and its upgrades for a number of years . After many problems such as described in the other negative reviews , I was reduced to mostly using it to scan text to file or as a copying function . I do prefer its copying function to that which comes with my scanner . I upgraded to XP and Pagis text scanning and copy function continued to work well until I bought a new scanner . When I experienced problems with my new scanner , I paid 9.75 to Scan Soft for email technical support and apparnetly I paid that to be told that Pagis is not compatible with XP . Evidently they have no intention of upgradng or solving this problem . I 'm through with Scan Soft products !
 Do n't expect much from scansoft in either updates or customer concern . I would 've paid for a new XP compatible upgrade . However Scansoft showed me no concern or regard for us ... who bought the original pagis and then the upgrade . I will do without an `` easy '' document handling solution before I will deal again with Scansoft Inc. .
 Initially it works well with XP until about the 3rd consecutive scan . After that is jams the scan cue and eventually will hang.My advice is to save your money if you have XP . Get a Hewlett Packard printer , which has a decent driver and an excellent user interface to merge files together into a single document . Then drag the files it into Adobe Acrobat . I have a lexmark X125 , which has a very poorly designed user interface with very few options for scanning .
 Whoever wrote that glowing review must work for Individual Software because this software is garbage . If you thought the Palm Pilot made your life a little more complicated , use it with this software and you 'll really be hosed . Hmmm , where 's that appointment I entered in AnyTime and synced with my Palm ? Oh , it 's gone ! AnyTime randomly deleted it and now I 'm in it deep ! Maybe I 'm being sensational , but you 'll be saying things like this if you use your Palm with AnyTime . Get some software that was meant for the Palm because you wo n't get a refund from Individual Software once you find out their software is ruining your attempt to get organized .

 There is zero information on this product . I 'm not going to buy something when I have not the slightest clue about what I 'm buying .
 This is not worth bringing home . Its very difficult to use . I like Art Explosion Scrapbook Factory Deluxe because its very simple to use . I use it all the time for my Digital scrapbooking , card making etc. . .
 Okay , here 's the deal with several of these older Disney games that say they 're both for the Mac and the PC . The CD you receive will only be a Windows version . You will have to contact the company and they will troubleshoot and say `` did you try this , and this , and this '' and then after you say you 've tried all of that then you 'll learn it 's only for Windows and they 'll have to send you the Mac version -- which has a few bugs and runs slow . -LSB- It 's the same problem we had with Disney Princess Magical Dress Up -- but that 's VERY buggy and I would n't recommend it . -RSB- The game is not new Tinkerbell . It 's old Tinkerbell or rather `` Peter Pan '' -LRB- think of the Disney movie `` Peter Pan -RRB- . Still , if you have an older computer -LRB- it works on both our single processor PowerMac running 9.2.2 . and an ibook running system 9 -RRB- and as there are n't many options for Tinkerbell , AND if your kid likes Peter Pan , Wendy , Lost Boys , etc. it 's worth the price if you can get it cheap .
 I loaded this to Windows Media Player and all I have to show for my money are some songs that would have cost me less than $ 10 on Itunes.No instructions , nothing , I wish it would have just loaded like EVERY other program out there.It comes up ripping some Johnny Lang album.I do n't know what the heck happened.Total mess , never again !
 When I received the shrink wrapped box , it had no CD or license , just serial number for remote access client . E-bay gave my money back , Symantec said they put wrong things in box , try another order . Will try again
 Very dissatisfied that Intuit forces users to upgrade software to retain the existing service levels . This is due to their `` discontinuation policy '' , which ironically will force me to discontinue being their customer . I will not buy this product .
 I also could not download my bank info into Quicken . My banks website said it accepted both Quicken and Microsoft Money but apparently it only covers Quicken up to 2003 -LRB- or around there -RRB- when they did an upgrade and now my bank can no longer download to the software .
 None of the features in this program work right . You can only import data files for your bank account if they 're the newest type - the QIF format -LRB- named FOR QUICKEN -RRB- is n't allowed anymore except with a complicated workaround . My credit card can do `` instant updates '' - only the updates do n't add any of the new transactions ! And because I 'm set up for instant updates , I ca n't download the transactions from my credit card account and then import them into Quicken . I have looked for three weeks just to turn the horrible sound effects off and STILL ca n't find the button . And the only thing that happens when I click `` help '' is my screen fills up with a dozen script errors . I had no idea a program could be this bad . AVOID QUICKEN 2007 - pen and paper is about a thousand times faster , easier and more accurate than this horrible program .
 Quicken requires use of OFX technology to input bank data . My bank does not use this technology . So , Quicken wants me to either force my bank to add this technology or switch banks . I love my bank , it is a credit union that does not even charge for paper checks ! I think I hate Quicken -LRB- amazing how much they charge for checks -RRB- . I plan to return this product and buy Microsoft Money , which will at least talk to my bank !
 Intuit has known for several years that their Quicken products are flawed . The screen flickers repeatedly during use , as it refreshes . This happens with all video cards in XP and is not computer specific . No one has identified a `` fix '' for the problem . You should Google `` quicken screen flicker '' to hear the complaints of many people . Quicken has not responded to this problem . Instead , it keeps putting out the flawed product for people to buy . The flicker is very irritating because the display shakes dramatically -LRB- I do not exaggerate -RRB- and because it happens every time you save a transaction and also whenever the screen is normally scheduled to refresh . The refresh speed on the memorized transactions page is very slow , and the screen refreshes slowly two times for every page down . If you buy this product , you will be very disappointed . Buy something else .
 I 've used Quicken since it first came out in a DOS version in the 1980s . For a while it just kept getting better and for years I referred my professional associates to it as an example of a great UI.Not any more . Since 2000 Quicken has been suffering feature bloat . So much functionality has been added that many times the basic features do n't work . Quicken has n't correctly downloaded and posted data from my Fidelity accounts in 2 years.I bought Microsoft Money 2007 Premium about 6 weeks ago and am very happy .
 I have been using Quicken Basic 2000 for many years and thought it was about time to upgrade so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 . I am seriously thinking about removing this software and going back to Quicken 2000 . I only use Quicken for basic functions such as tracking each of our accounts , we do n't write checks through quicken . Quicken 2007 does n't provide any improvements to these basic functions and in some cases makes it harder to perform these basic functions . The Quicken homepage is entirely worthless to me , can not be edited , deleted or hidden so it is just in the way.I thought there would be some improvement in the reports and more flexibility in formats and options , but so far it appears the reports and formats are essential the same as Quicken 2000 . Unless I have missed something this upgrade was pretty much worthless and actually went backwards in ease of use . I would NOT recommend this upgrade if you are looking for an improvement in Quicken Basic
 The problems started when the install routine would not work with my Vista operating system on an HP computer . This is Aug. 07 and Vista was n't even listed as one of the possible operating systems.The written materials included with the disk were not very helpful . Overall , the package of materials seemed to be designed for someone who is updating from an older version to the 2007 version . I am neophyte to Quicken and found little to help me understand what the basics of this program are and how one goes about importing the data required from my bank accounts . The choices for this sort of software are few . Microsoft Money is the other big title . Now I wish I had started with it . Perhaps it is n't any easier , but at least it probably would have installed easily with Vista . There may even be free open software that would be better than what I got .
 I 've been using Quicken 6 since it came out and finally had to move up to an XP machine . The old V6 was easy to use , intuitive features , uncluttered and uncomplicated . 2007 is buried in extra features -LRB- which you do n't seem to be able to turn off -RRB- a display that seems squeezed even in a 17 '' monitor and the feeling that it 's going to switch off to investment or retirement or whatever without warning . I would put V6 back on if it worked in XP with no surprises .
 I discovered a bug in the program which seriously affects its integrity.Have been on the phone with Quicken techs numerous times and they finally acknowledged that there is a problem with the program and a patch -LRB- fix -RRB- needs to be developed . So far though , they have not done it .
 As of this writing , Quicken 's servers have been non-functional 90 % of the time , meaning that I can not download my financial institutions ' online data . The program itself is good , but do n't expect it to be able to download your financial data .
 I wish there was a negative star rating ! LOVED Quicken 99 but due to a computer upgrade , bought Quicken Basic 2007 . HATE IT ! So basic as to be totally useless . Ca n't download my monthly statements into this program . It does n't accept the . qif file Bank of America converts my data into . If I ca n't transfer my info from Quicken 99 into 2007 -LRB- or any other Quicken program -RRB- I AM TOTALLY SCREWED !!!!!!!! Not sure what to do but probably will move away from Quicken altogether beccause of this . I am that MAD !
 Do n't buy Quicken . I was shocked to get an email from them saying that my Quicken 2004 software would no longer work for downloading data after April 30 , 2007 . The software automatically disables online downloads after three years . This is now company policy.I have used Quicken for many years but now I am going with GnuCash -- it is free , open-source , and works great !
 I 've been using Microsoft Money since 1999 , but I made the switch to Quicken this year for the first time in part because of a positive review by PC Magazine . But oh what a big mistake it was ! From the very beginning I had trouble converting my Money file into a usable Quicken file , with things going quickly downhill from there . Online support had me download an older Quicken version in order to import my file , -LRB- yeah , my reaction was `` Huh ? '' -RRB- but that did n't work either . Having to start from scratch , I entered all of my accounts information manually and then configured the software to perform web updates . For a while it worked flawlessly -LRB- my only gripe being those omnipresent pesky little links that are there just to get you to try this or sign up for that , with no way to disable them -RRB- , until about a week later when , inexplicably , the online update feature just refused to work . It downloaded my transactions as it was supposed to , but I could n't actually get to them to review and match against my accounts . Having tried everything from restoring backup files to creating new data files and pretty much everything else their online `` support '' threw my way , I gave up in frustration and just downloaded Money 2007 . Big sigh of relief ... Yeah , life is good again and I 'm back in business with things that just work , period . So bottom line , buy this product at your own risk and beware that bugs need to be ironed out before it can actually be used for anything productive . If you 're a Money user stick with it , because I see no reason to switch over to Quicken . That is unless you 're a masochist and like to spend hours with `` tech support '' going absolutely nowhere .
 I switched to Quicken after having used Microsoft Money since the 90 's . Why switch ? -LRB- 1 -RRB- I bought TurboTax and Quicken was free after rebate and -LRB- 2 -RRB- an article in PC Magazine gave Quicken high praise . But , now I understand the old saying , ` If it 's not broken , do n't fix it . ' The Quicken interface is vastly different than Money 's -LRB- but , that 's to be expected - they are two completely different programs -RRB- . But , Quicken 's interface is poorly designed ; it 's cumbersome to try to get from one screen to another . The Money to Quicken conversion tool was n't available until well after I acquired the software . Their tech support department did n't even know a conversion tool existed until I pointed out where they could find it on their website . The payment reminder calendar is ridiculous . There is no screen to see a snapshot of your accounts . I guess it 's just not I was used to with Microsoft Money . In both functionality and aesthetics , Money is a vastly superior product .
 I 've been using Quicken ' 04 , but recently tried to download transactions from my bank . I can get the file , but Quicken refuses to open it . After a Quicken `` update '' , it demanded that I upgrade.It would be one thing if my bank stopped offering older data formats , but this is just Intuit trying to leech more money off of users.Intuit , you 've just lost a customer -LRB- I 'll never buy TurboTax again , either -RRB- . This is a terrible way to treat your customers . I 'm switching to MS Money , and if they yank me around , GnuCash .
 Before you buy this product , consider this
 I upgraded to Quicken 2007 Basic when I could no longer download bank trasactions . The people at Quicken seem bound and determined to give us features that most people do n't need . The old Quicken used open to a simple trasaction screen , but now it 's the last thing one finds . Quicken has taken a good product and made it way too complicated . I thought Basic meant Basic , but not with this program .
 I have read almost all of the reviews for this product and discovered they were all over the map . Many gave Q2007 4-5 stars saying it was great . The other half gave it one star saying that it had so many bugs in it that it did not work . After -LRB- foolishly -RRB- buying the program , I must now join the One Star Raters!I have used Quicken since 1998 and depend on it . I upgraded to 2004 and loved the program . I did not want to change to Q2007 , until Intuit MADE ME !! The whole `` sunst clause '' is another pain in my side , but not to be debated here . I bought Q2007 and it uploaded and converted my files easy enough . I had a bit of a hard time setting up the portion to download my account information from my bank . It worked well ... four times . Suddenly I received a message box that said , `` Sorry , unexpected error . Q07 needs to shut down ... '' . Sorry . . Sorry !! Now I get that error within three seconds of opening the program and have not been able to fix it . The Intuit help people have not been . They told me to remove and reload it . Did n't work . I can not get the program to work AT ALL ! I have removed it once and for all and will go to Amazon and buy Q2006 and hope for the best . Congrats to those who bought Q2007 and won the roullete game . I lost , as did many others . Make sure you want to risk it before you buy , because it appears to be a pretty good risk at50-50 ...
 If you have not bought this yet , do n't . If you have , but have n't installed it yet , do n't . I 've used Quicken for years , and this is the worst implentation yet . The major problem , an issue known to the company , is that reports will not print properly on many printers.Wait until they issue a fix before you use this product .
 We bought this to finally do an upgrade to our existing quicken 98 and this has been a horrible experience and I am now back to the older version . Very simple problem , 2007 does not recognize the old account currencies and migrates all accounts ot US dollars atthe first installation . I called customer service and was on the phone for over an hour and they tried so many different attamepts and it did not work . I was left with next steps to do myself by re-installing the older version again and then do it in 2 steps using QW 2002 then 2007 . I have not done that as I am glad I am back to my original perfectly working quicken 98 . So net , if yuou have used different currencies in your existing version of quicken , 2007 will not work properly for you .
 Do n't buy this product ! First off , they do n't disclose the considerable copy protection on this product . You 'll be forced to activate it time and again . If you have a disc failure you will lose your install . You ca n't use this on more than one computer without buying another expensive license . This product costs twice what Microsoft word costs . I finally gave up using this thing and tried for 2 years to get my money back . Please vote with your dollars and do n't buy applications crippled with heavy handed copy protection . You can replicate what this program does in Microsoft Word .
 I have been using Quicken for over 6 years . Before buying this version I used 2005 . I only had the following problem with 2005 , while my bank and other financial sites would allow passwords up to 32 characters Quicken 's PIN Vault would crash any time I tried to save them . I also was unable to input them manually as the field length was too small . I upgraded to 2007 -LRB- based on a customer service call -RRB- and it too can not save long passwords , though you can input them manually now . I am very disappointed in Intuit 's customer service and this product . I would recommend skipping this version in the hopes that they can get their act straight in the future .
 I was running Quicken 2006 with no problems until I upgraded to Vista . SURPRISE 2006 is not fully compatible with Vista , as Intuit 's website now states . I asked if they planned to fix the Vista bugs in Quicken 2006 and was told to buy Quicken 2007 !!!! Given the horrible reviews below on Quicken 2007 I am reluctant to do so . More importantly , it seems Intuit is using the 2006 Vista issues to sell a bug ridden 2007 Vista `` ready '' product . Corporate ethics at a new low . So much for their four year product support policy .
 I have used Quicken for several years and was initially satisfied with the product . Now , however my 2004 Deluxe version has been making errors in downloading transaction histories , and budget reports are displaying incorrect information -LRB- which I ca n't get rid of -RRB- . Customer support has been of no help , and on-line discussion groups are like shared ignorance . The final straw was when Intuit/Quicken will discontinue the download feature on the 2004 version , forcing people to pay another fifty bucks to upgrade to 2007 . And do n't get me started on problems with Turbotax this year !
 Am computer literate , and have used both Quicken and Turbo Tax for 10 + yrs.The product has become littered w/internal ads you can not get rid of -LRB- customization feature does * not * allow removal of Quicken self-promotion ads -RRB- . Although the software still delivers fundamental needs of Home Accounting , my comments are directed at the quality of the program and the purposeful marketing embedded into the product that you -LRB- the customer who * PAID * to use it -RRB- now has to endure . 1 -RRB- You can only use Quicken 's OFX download method for adding data to Chkg/Savings/CredCard , unless you you want to hand enter everything . They charge banks for this - so they -LRB- Intuit -RRB- benefit from this financially . And now banks are starting to charge us consumers -LRB- EX
 I own Quicken Deluxe 2006 . I used Quickbooks PRO in my office for 5 years and found that Quickbooks Pro was easy to use . Quicken Deluxe is a wreck . It is not at all intuitive . It ca n't tell that there is a difference between when a check is written and when it clears . The numbers it downloads from brokerages etc do n't correlate with what one finds on the brokerage web site . I suppose that there is a reason but I wanted this program to save me time not make more work . So far it has been much more work . If you are obsessed with money and want to spend all your time playing what amounts to an online game with Quicken then I suppose that you might like this program . I do n't have any suggestions for an alternative but there must be something better . I think that you would do better making your own Excel spreadsheet or downloading one of the free ones that are available .
 I have been using quicken for over 10 years now . I was very happy with Quicken 2004 until Intuit forced me to upgrade to 2007 . If I did n't upgrade , all of the online updates will not work.Now I am stuck with a buggy software and I ca n't go back to 2004 : -LRB-
 I purchased Quicken 2007 Download and got a refund within three days of trying to use it . The windows kept merging into each other . The images would keep shifting . I uninstalled and re-installed and it was no better . I called tech support . They had me uninstall and re-install , but no changes . The customer rep also was going through the same process on his end , and reported the same problem . He was trying to convince me to keep using the software and wait for updates . I got a refund . Such a shame that they could n't fix it .
 If you have an older version of Quicken , beware . This product does not work with some versions and the support line has no solution and wastes a lot of your time before they let you know it wo n't work .
 This is an extremely flawed software program . I have used Quicken for more than a decade , and this product is not worthy of the name . Runtime errors keep me from evening getting the program going . It contains 6 bank accounts which I can not currently print checks from . I have reinstalled the software at least 15 times with no success . I have used every suggestion from tech support and the Quicken forums without ANY success . I guess I 'll have to move to MS Money .
 Quicken Deluxe 2007 is certainly not user friendly nor intuitive . The worst part , however , is the fact that when I print I get only micro printing -LRB- perhaps 1/4 point which is too small to read -RRB- . I have tried to get help from tech support but they are worthless . I highly recommend that you do not buy Quicken Deluxe 2007 . There must be some other financial software out there , and anything else would surely work better .
 This is the first review I have written in probably a few years . Normally , I do n't feel strongly enough about any product , good or bad , to bother entering a review . With this new version of Quicken , I have something that I feel strongly enough to write about.I have been using Quicken for close to 20 years . I have built all of my finances around it . For the past 6 years , Quicken has been going steadily downhill . This latest version , I hope , represents rock bottom . I do n't see how the product could possibly get any worse.Words can not describe how bad this product is . No functionality has been added in the previous 6 years . What has happened is that the screen has become more cluttered with more links to Quicken 's `` financial partners '' , and more redundant links to other , old , program features , and more white space . In return , the user has to page through tab after tab after tab to view the same information that previously fit on only 1 screen . Further , each screen refresh now takes seconds , whereas in older versions a screen refresh was instantaneous.Entering a simple transaction may require this bloated sofware to generate 2 , 3 , even 4 complete screen refreshes , each one taking maybe 1 to 2 seconds . That means , once you hit the `` enter '' key to complete a transaction , you can be waiting as long as 8 seconds before you can move on to entering the next transaction . As little as 3 years ago the same step required less than a second . Obviously , time required will vary with your computer - but it is bad enough that Quicken now requires you to `` downgrade '' your Quicken software every few years - it is also necessary for you to replace your entire computer system at the same time just so you can realize the same performance level as you had in the previous version . All of this with NO additional features or functionality.There is a new kid on the block that I am switching to . It is called `` Moneydance '' . It can import data from Quicken , it is fast , compact , and runs on any platform , Windows , Linix , Unix , Mac , even OS/2 . It is easier to use than Quicken and the support is great . It is available for download - a functional evaluation version is free and the full version is only $ 30 . You can actually speak to a person to get help w/out having to pay . Since I have been using Quicken for years , it will take a while to test Mondeydance out to make sure it works properly . I am running the 2 side-by-side for a while to make sure the numbers agree . So far , things are going well . Then I plan to dump Quicken forever . The well has run dry at Quicken ; everyone who made the product great has apparently left the company.Obviously the people at Quicken are free to make their product as bloated and as cumbersome as they want . But they should not be allowed to force people to downgrade . Yet , that is what they are doing . I am absolutely positively through with Quicken , and I am not coming back .
 When Intuit was a small company , they created a wonderful product . Now that they own the market , however , they 've utterly stopped caring about their customers , the people who put them there . They do this by issuing a completely unnecessary new version each and every year -LRB- and each seems to be more bug-ridden than the last -RRB- . And as others have noted , they blackmail you into `` upgrading '' -LRB- for more money , of course -RRB- by actually TURNING OFF functionality -- the valuable ability to download financial information from your bank -- after only three years . My version of Quicken 2004 works fine , and will continue to until the company turns off this functionality in a few months . Then I 'll be forced to upgrade , although I neither need to nor want to . How I wish there was a viable alternative -- I 'd use it in a flash -LRB- and do n't tell me about MS Money -RRB- . Intuit has become the most customer-unfriendly software company in the world . If you have n't already started using it , find an alternative .
 I use Quicken for online banking and have been doing so for years . So this is the second time I have faced a forced upgrade to keep my online banking service operational . -LRB- The previous forced upgrade was to Quicken 2004 ; now I have to upgrade to 2007 . -RRB- What galls me is that I already pay Quicken over $ 100 a year for the version of online banking that I use . -LRB- For $ 9.95 per month I avoid having to go to my bank 's web site at all . -RRB- It 's worth the money to me , but adding a forced upgrade every three years is just unadulterated greed as far as I 'm concerned . I 'd feel less abused if they just charged an extra dollar a month for the service they provide rather than have to go through this bogus forced upgrade process.Note
 I had been happily using Quicken 2001 since its release . Every year , I checked this space to read reviews of the latest version of Quicken and upon reading the massive number of negative reviews , decided not to upgrade.Last year I moved to a new computer , and upon installing Quicken 2001 on the new machine discovered that I could not register the software , and therefore could no longer download data from my financial institutions using my old version of Quicken . I finally decided to upgrade just so I could go back to automatically downloading transactions , and two days in I 'm already regretting it . The screens are poorly laid out and fonts in many areas are so large that text is cut off . One particular help screen popped up sized so large that the close button was off my screen , and I was forced to kill Quicken to get out of it . -LRB- And I have a fairly high-resolution monitor . -RRB- Worst of all , the only reason I upgraded was to regain the ability to download transactions , and I 've so far had nothing but trouble with that . My file from Quicken 2001 was imported , but something was missed in the upgrade and I was unable to retrieve transactions from my main checking account . I tried the troubleshooting steps listed in the online help , but they did no good . I tried Quicken 's online live chat with tech support , and after over an hour chatting with an overseas tech support rep who responded very slowly to me and in broken English , I finally figured out how to correct the problem myself . -LRB- Troubleshooting the problem with him turned out to be useless . -RRB- Now I 'm at the point where I successfully connect to Quicken 's servers , but get an error code saying that `` this error has been reported to Quicken , and we will work to correct the problem as soon as possible . '' So I 've spent $ 50 , and still ca n't do anything that I could n't do with my previous version . If I could get a refund for this software , I would . Instead , I 'll just recommend , beg you , plead with you not to purchase this software . Maybe Intuit will put out a version that does n't suck someday but I 'm not holding my breath , and I wish I had waited longer . -- As a followup , in the week I 've been using this product I have been able to successfully download transactions from my bank exactly once , despite trying to update my account twice a day . Every time I try , I am told that the reason I can not download my transactions is a problem with Quicken 's servers . I upgraded from Quicken 2001 to 2007 to specifically for online updates . I 'll be taking advantage of Quicken 's 60 day money-back guarantee this weekend .
 I 've been a user of quicken for at least ten years . I 've liked the product historically , but this version is garbage . Like other users , I too have fallen victim to the ` out of memory ' error . Guess what ? There 's nothing I can do . I ca n't go back to a previous version of Quicken , because my data file is n't compatable.Honestly , I blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first . I was brand loyal to Intuit , but now I 'm paying the price . The software is garbage , stay away.Update
 Do n't buy this product!I was shocked to get a letter from Quicken saying that my Quicken 2004 software would no longer have online access after April 30 , 2007 . This is now a policy for Quicken.No way !! I am switching to another product .
 I 've been using Quicken for over a decade and have had neverending annoyances , particularly with the investment transactions . The new version -LRB- 2007 -RRB- actually ADDS annoyances -LRB- sales of options that used to download properly now come in as `` short sells '' , Quicken tries to `` rename '' every transaction and has to be told over and over not to -RRB- . More frightening though is how much SLOWER the new interface -LRB- or at least the software -RRB- is . It can take over a minute to record one stock transaction , versus seconds before . I literally have to do other things and come back while the transaction finishes getting recorded.I do n't have the latest and greatest computer , but it 's a P4 with a Gb of memory running at 3Ghz , with tons of free space , so it 's not a hardware issue -LRB- and it 's the same hardware I was running the prior version - 2005 - on -RRB- . Upgrader emptor !
 As an upgrade this product is a waste . There is hardly any difference from 2006 ! Do n't waste your money . If you are buying for the first time it is ok .
 I have been using Quicken longer than I can remember . But like most of the recent reviewers here , I learned that Intuit will DISABLE the online download in Quicken 2004 . In other words , one of the MOST IMPORTANT feature/reason you buy a money management software will be disabled three years after its release , forcing you to upgrade and give Intuit more money . I can understand if they wo n't support the product anymore , but blatantly disabling critical features is NOT acceptable . Imagine using Windows 98 , and Microsoft decides you can not surf the web anymore after 3 years , forcing you to buy Windows XP . I was considering upgrading but after reading all the problems/bugs it has from other reviews , I have decided not to send any more money to Intuit in protest.I hope Intuit read these reviews and is realizing they are losing their loyal customers . This is really bad and unethical business practices . I am guessing there will be a class action lawsuit soon .
 I tryed to register the product but as my adrs . is beyond the USA borders it was not accepted , so I registered it with a friend 's adrs . which I think is not fear . About the `` user 's Manual '' the say that there is one included in the pakage , and there was n't any , tryed to download it from the web but the site is not avaliable for me.Victor Cohen
 I have used Quicken religiously for 16 years . Just upgraded to Vista and now I have to manually find my Quicken file every time I open Quicken . Moreover , it won ; t let me back up - I have to manually back up the file each time . What really makes me mad is that Intuit claims there are no problems with Vista whatsoever , and of course product support is dreadful unless you pay . So I will wait for a fix and hope for the bets . Until then , AVOID .
 I 've been a Quicken user since version 4 , and I am truthfully sorry I upgraded to 2007 from 2001 . Every single one of my loan and mortgage accounts were corrupted in the conversion , and the corruption not discovered until a month 's worth of other transactions had been entered . Specifically , each loan now has approximately 20 zero balance transactions in the payment schedule , each with a date of 0/0/1900 . The interest rate and payment amounts have been reset to zero on each account , and while changes can be made on the edit payment screen , the changes do not stick . Automatic or scheduled transactions for these accounts no longer work properly.An hour on the phone with someone in India failed to correct the problem , so I have no choice but to re-enter new loans and then figure out a way to zero out the old ones so the balance sheet ends up right . I 've gone back to the old version , run super validate on it , upgraded through Quicken 2002 , and none of it has corrected the problem.My recommendation
 I hate when companies force me to buy their useless upgrades for no reason other then shelling more money . Shame on Quicken . Really . I have to rethink my online banking .
 I have been a loyal fan of Quicken for many years . My , things have changed for the worst at the once mighty Intuit . It pains me to report that Quicken Deluxe 2007 is a work in progress .1 . The installation CD was unreadable . To Intuit 's credit , I was given access to their download site for replacement software .2 . The reconciliation report -LRB- needed for balancing your checkbook -RRB- will not display or print for some reason . All other reports display and print just fine . Unfortunately , the reconciliation report is the only one I am truely interested in printing . I am using a Brother HL-5280DW laser printer . The printer works fine with all other programs , including the old version of Quicken . Again , the most important report -LRB- reconciliation -RRB- will not print on Quicken Deluxe 2007.3 . The software would not recognize the C-drive as a working drive even though the program is running on that drive -LRB- ? -RRB- - go figure .4 . The overseas Tech Support is willing to play dumb and pretend they do n't know there is a problem with the software , keeping you in the chat room for hours . I guess as long as they get paid it does n't matter whether they help or not . The ultimate recommendation is to reload the software - just one more time.As a past happy user of Quicken 2004 , I was forced into this upgrade.Don ' t expect the problems to be resolved quickly . Intuit has been aware of most of these problems for over 6 months.I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but this version of quicken is just that BAD NEWS .
 I 've generally enjoyed Quicken products , but they 've started deactivating the online downloads after 3 years , forcing you to upgrade or enter transactions by hand . I 've NOT seen this noted on the retail box or in the license agreement , so it can be a bit of an unpleasant surprise when you get the `` upgrade or else '' letter from Quicken !
 The few 5 star ratings on this product must be Quicken Employee 's . This version is crap . I was very happy with my last three versions of quicken but this is a disaster . I would have continued to use my 2004 version until 2008 when I plan on purchasing a new computer but Intuit made that impossible with their forced shut down of basic functions . I understand if they do n't want to support a version but to take away basic download functions from banks and brokers is ridiculous . NEVER AGAIN will I purchase a product from them . I have a used version of 2007 deluxe for sale CHEAP :-RRB- I need to purchase some Raid for all the bugs this programs has .
 I finally decided I had enough of Microsoft Money and decided to upgrade to the # 1 quicken 2007 . Per Quicken there is an easy conversion . This is not true . You have to download a conversion program and it does not successfully convert a money database . After spending three hours manually entering all of my data , I found this version of quicken slow and not easy to use . To Purchase stocks the software can not even compute the amount of shares given the purchase price and amount invested . All fields must be manually entered . Funds must be transfered into the softwares cash account even if a direct stock purchase is made , and then the second step of purchasing the stock has to be made . Even though the software has the latest stock price , you have to look up and manually enter it . I found the additional time and multiple steps to perform simple transactions are not worth the time . Back to MS Money for me .
 Ok , after believing that the Q2007 version could connect to my HSBC account , I bit . Bad , bad dog . I have spent hours online with Quicken , HSBC and my other banks . My main checking account seems to be always flagged for other transactions , but none exist . HSBC now says the only way I can get the info is manually download from their site . Tonite , for some odd reason , I no longer have a password vault with passwords and pins for all my online accounts . In addition - the upgrade/hiccup seems to have deleted all my online payees that I will now have to manually reenter , since my last backup brings the data back , but not the payees . I have been using Quicken since it came out and this has got to be the worst upgrade yet .
 I have been using Quicken since 1999 very happily . Unfortunately , I decided to upgrade from 2005 to 2007 . It will not let me print reports , and every time I try , it crashes my computer . I spent over 5 hours on the phone with Tech Support in India and they just kept running through their pre-scripted solutions which never fixed the problem . Now I 'm going back to using 2005 and will lose all the data that I entered since I upgraded to 2007 . I 'm VERY unhappy with this product and with how Intuit handled -LRB- or didnt ' handle -RRB- my problem . Stick with your current version . Quicken is a great product , but the 2007 version has too many problems .
 I had been happy with my Quicken Deluxe 2004 , and had no plans to upgrade it to 2007 . I then found out that Internet Explorer 7 will not support Quicken 2004 -LRB- Internet Explorer runs in the background when you open Quicken -RRB- . Therefore , I was forced to get the new version . As with most of the previous reviewers , I am sorry I did.When I ran into some trouble backing-up up my files to CD , I went to the `` Help '' tab to get some assistance . I can easily get a list of topics , but when I click on any of them , the program does not connect properly to the internet . I am left with an error message stating `` this page can not be displayed '' . I spent over two hours on the phone trying to get assistance from Intuit . After moving up the chain of customer service reps , they were unable to solve the problem . Despite the fact that I had no problem with this funtion with Quicken 2004 -LRB- or any other version in the past 15 years -RRB- , I was told that my computer was casuing the error message . It was all quite frustrating.My advice is to avoid this update if at all possible . Also , be prepared for a long and tedious session with customer service if you have to deal with them on the phone .
 This new interface in 2007 is so confusing and difficult to use that I have gone back to my older version so I can actually get some work done . Maybe when I have a week to sit and play with it , it might prove to be worthwhile . In the meantime , it sits on my shelf . Not worth the trouble , IMHO
 I have been using Quicken for years now . I ca n't even remember not using it . I upgraded to 2007 and everything seemed fine . I received notice that there was an update available so I updated to R2 . Big mistake . Since then I have been getting the `` out of memory '' error . Also , my online payees would disappear . I contacted Quicken 's so-called tech support but they were absolutely no help . All they kept wanting me to do was to use an old backup file . Finally I had to uninstall and reinstall quicken 2007 . That helped but did not solve the `` out of memory '' error and I lost all transactions entered since the update to R2.I am extremely disappointed with Quicken . If they do not provide a solution or even acknowledge the problem I for one am switching to Microsoft Money .
 I just went through a terrible experience with quicken customer service . The quicken 2007 revision 5 update failed with a script error problem . I went on to update my portfolio and ended my quicken session figuring that I would try the update again the next day . The next day when I started quicken it said that I had an incomplete update session and did I want to complete it ? I said yes and quicken ran for about 20 seconds and the session stopped . I went to start quicken from the desktop shortcut and I received an error message saying that qw.exe was n't there . I checked the quicken folder and all the . exe files were deleted . I did n't want to wait on the phone for tech support so I communicated with quicken via email . I had 5 techs try various methods and none of them worked . They finally told me to call tech support . I called tech support and they could n't uninstall and reinstall quicken 2007 either . They said it must be a Microsoft Vista problem and that I should call Microsoft . I had used quicken since the late 90 's . I am now looking for another product whose tech support is more supportive and can speak english without a heavy accent .
 It 's definitely an awful piece of software . It 's totally unstable under winxp sp2 and ie7 . Follow other peoples advice and get quicken ' 06 .
 After three phone calls to their India based customer support , they admitted that the product has a major BUG ! It will not back up your precious data file from within the program . They promised a pop up would show up soon ; notifying the user that a patch was ready.We are still waiting ...
 Set your printer driver `` Auto Fit '' to `` Off '' and `` Edge to Edge '' to `` On '' . That fixed one of the bugs in this program .
 Great concept , absolutely painful execution . I get accounts that subtract when they are supposed to add -LRB- until you close and restart the program -RRB- , downloaded transactions between accounts that do n't connect , screen flicker as the program refreshes for over a minute , the list goes on . And the bottom line is the numbers DO N'T add up , especially on my investments . Some of the errors amount to 50 % of the account value . It 's rediculous . I hear MS Money is n't much better , so you 're probably better off not buying either unless you really want to spend a lot of time on this to generate pretty graphs .
 I own and use Quicken 2004 , which works okay . Recently -LRB- Feb 2007 -RRB- I started getting a warning when I download financial information from Fidelity that Quicken 2004 will no longer be supported and that I must buy the 2007 version to keep the feature that I bought two years ago when I bought version 2004 . What a rip-off . Quicken is forcing me to buy someing I do n't want or need to replace something I alreay paid for two years ago . What kind of company stops supporting their product after two years just to increase their profits ? This leaves a really bad taste in my mouth and I 'm going to be looking for alternatives to this prodcut . At this rate Quicekn 2007 will have a life of about two years and all users will need to replace it at the beginning of 2009 , for no other reason than to increase the company 's profits.Shame on you , Intuit !
 I bought this program in hopes to keep track of my finances easily . I figured since most of my accounts have online access , Quicken would easily retrieve this information and publish it . This was not the case , you need to input a lot of data yourself , and I found that alot of times transactions on my Bank of America account would be lost.I contacted Quicken tech support and they admitted that this is a known problem with Bank of America accounts !! Needless to say , I took them up on their money back guarantee . Hopefully this will work better for other bank accounts .
 Quicken is annoying in that it could be so much better . Setup was not as simple as they advertise , particularly if your financial institutions do n't play exactly well with their system . The package contains NO documentation . For new users , learning to use the system requires the download of a manual that does n't exist online anymore , or relying on community message boards full of angry customers . Plus , the software is full of tie-ins to Quicken 's ancillary services that clutter the interface and feel like advertising on the inside of a fully-priced product . Customer support is perfunctory and poor . The interface is ugly and uninspired . Hopefully they 'll do better on the next one , but you have to wonder if they ever bothered to test this on new users -LRB- or any users , really -RRB- .
 I am giving Quicken a 1 star for its marketing model.I am an owner of Quicken 2004 and am frustrated that my 2004 software 's functions will not be supported , so I have to upgrade to 2007 . I do n't care about the live support , or the software upgrades , but I do want the ability to download my financial data . I think Quicken should disclose the fact that software they sell will have a three year life span and users could decide if they want to invest in using the software.I for one will be seeking another product in the future , but for now I guess Quicken 2007 will be my software for another term .
 Does n't connect to bank . It did it once , just enough to get all my data entered , budget planned , hours of planning and effort . Wo n't connect anymore . I ca n't even download files and then import them . It asks me to setup a new account each time I try to import , because no matching accounts exist . Then it wo n't allow me to set up the account because it already exists.This is a highly flawed product at this point .
 I 've been a very loyal quicken user since 1998 . I 've been generally happy with the product . However , similar to Microsoft Office , Quicken has n't really added additional useful functionality for most users the past several years . I rate this one star , although I would give zero if it were an available option.I invest heavily in equities and options plus use have a variety of online accounts . The online services for Quicken 2007 are slow , buggy , do n't work sometimes , and occasionally cause spontaneous shutdowns . I work for a software company and this looks like a product rushed out the door because some VP had bonus money at stake.Quicken 2007 adds absolutely nothing useful for most people using Quicken 2006 . After patch release # 2 the product is still just as bad . As a public service please stick with Quicken 2006 - skip Quicken 2007 and hopefully Intuit gets it right in 2008 . Quicken 2007 has become a walking billboard as Intuit looks for any way to make an extra buck from a relatively loyal user base by advertising Quicken credit cards , mortgages , etc. . In my opinion Intuit is moving away from their core mission of providing excellent financial management software for the home user .
 I have used Quicken since the first version - and been a bigot in their favor . Not right now . 07 version is horribly bug ridden.Tells me I am out of memory , but when I do a memory dump I have over 600meg free of physical memory , tells me I have low space on a hard drive with 40gbytes free . Ok , so the warnings are wrong . I can handle that.When I download , most accounts work fine . But one account of 3 I download from my bank suddenly does not work correctly . It downloads transactions - they show in on-line center and match what is online at bank , but when you go to the account register to accept them , it says no transactions exist , but account list shows flag for transactions and mouse over says I have new ones to accept.Ok so some problem , and if it were n't my main checking account I might be more tolerant , but it is and I need it to work . So I go online and search FAQ 's - do all the recommended clean-ups - works once kind of - at least finally got things done . Then it stops again -LRB- mind you 10 others work fine but are smaller in transaction volume by one or two magnitude . -RRB- I try to do email support , but they require order number which when I take it off their email confirmation is one digit longer than field on form , so it wo n't submit . Try the chat feature , it wo n't go thru , try feedback , it abends . Tried each of these during workday , at night , and on weekend - same result . Makes one think they want you to use the pay by minute call line ? Very frustrated with them right now . Have sent them actual screen shoots of problems - hope they fix , but getting very doubtful of results.I am a CTO of a major company and have a lot of understanding for bugs - these are complex systems to be sure , but this is unacceptable to have bugs and poor support functions ; and sell me an 07 version that is not much better than the 04 version I had been using successfully for years.I am trying Money 07 trial version !
 I 'm embarrassed to face any of the dozens of people I 've recommended Quicken to over the past 18 years that I 've been using Quicken.This is the worst release and most unecessary set of changes they 've made since the disastrous 1996 release.The beautiful crisp and clean interface that we 've always associated with Quicken is gone and replaced by a muddy , unreadable mess that looks like the worst of garage-based shareware . The background has been switched -LRB- with no user option to change it -RRB- to a dark blue on which you 're supposed to be able to read black and thin , red text . You ca n't . The calendar , once a besacon of simplicity has become bloated and unreadable -LRB- somehow only about 1/3 of the payee 's name now fits , so everything is swimming in ellipses and `` More ... '' links -RRB- . The software , even with R2 is among their most buggy releases . Make sure you backup plenty and keep them rotated , because you never know when you 're going to lose data . I 've also been unable to use their built-in web browser for just baout anything -LRB- which is important as lots of Quicken features depend on the web browser -RRB- . What made them think they were a browser company anyway.I have recommended Quicken to so many people over the years , and I 've already started to email them to make sure they do n't downgrade to this version . If this is n't fixed by a complete overhaul , then you can be sure there will be class-action lawsuits the next time they try to extort people to leave their stable versions and move to this mess.Why is there no zero star option ?
 Buyer Beware
 Background - senior IT professional . I have been a Quicken user for well over a decade and have always been very happy with the product until the 2007 version . First , let me point out a couple of things to like about this version : - the interface ; seems to depend on the eye of the beholder , but I for one find it pleasing and useful . - the ability to append notes and check images to a transaction . I love this feature . - the Cash Flow dashboard and the CalendarNow for the caveat
 I have been using Quicken for 9yrs now and have found it to be a good solutions for keeping track of finances etc. . I 've upgraded several times over 9yrs and had problems a few times but generally it has worked fine . I just received a notice in the mail indicating that Quicken 2004 will no longer be supported by April of 2007 . Given the number of legitimate bugs in the 07 release this company has some nerve driving customers to upgrade from versions as new as 04 . Given the amount of time and pain it could take to make the conversion and hours spent on the phone dealing with some tech support guy that speaks broken english in India I think this company is going to cut its throat . It 's pretty clear based on all the feeback that they have big issues with the initial release of 07 and are forcing good customers to make the leap . I 'm going to upgrade to 06 and see how that goes
 Finding a way to adequately express my disappointment with this program is a task that is beyond the capabilities of the best writers this country has ever produced . This program has produced nothing but misery , resentment , frustration , and irritation . The only thing saving Intuit from certain bankruptcy is Microsoft 's similar inability to engineer a competent program . I would have started using open source financial software long ago if it were able to direct connect to my financial institutions.I was perfectly happy with Quicken 2004 until they decided to `` sunset '' the program by cutting off the direct and web connect features . So I upgraded to to Quicken 2007 . I would write a review of the features of this program , except that I 've been beset by a plague of bugs that have kept me from using them . I 've installed the software 4 times , lost endless numbers of transactions -LRB- always keep good backups ! -RRB- which I 've spent hours recovering.I makes changes in one account , and for no reason , it completely messes up all of my other accounts . I have no idea why . I do n't want reports . I do n't want to attach PDF files to transactions -LRB- although I can see why some people might want to -RRB- . I do n't want to rate my merchants . I want a basic program that works and keeps track of my financial transactions without problems or fusses.If you 're not directly connecting to your banks to obtain financial information , do yourself a favor and go with a free open-source program -LRB- of which there are many -RRB- .
 I have been a Quicken user for 13 years . I upgraded to 2007 and it lost some of my data during the conversion . After several hours with support -LRB- live chat -RRB- they never found a solution.Then they say to call them and Intuit wants to charge me twenty four dollars to get assistance for their bug . Sorry Intuit , you have gotten too big and have forgotten the customers who made you . Over the last few years your customer service has gotten worse . You just do n't care anymore . I think it may be time for me to move on to other vendors.If you are happy with your current , reliable , Quicken version stick with it . I was on 2002 and am going back to it . However , I think I will try out some of Quickens competitors . Never thought I would say that as a huge Quicken fan .
 I was forced to switch to Quicken 2007 by Intuit 's policy of expiring online access . Was perfectly happy with Quicken 2004 for the last 3 years . This new version of Quicken is more cluttered and delivers little value , while adding significant extra frustration.The vaunted `` home screen '' of projected cash flow automatically chooses categories and gets them totally wrong . They neglected to include my `` salary '' in the `` In '' section of the projected cash flow . No wonder it looks like my expenses overrun my income ! Also , all my transfers between accounts -LRB- savings to checking , checking to online investments , etc -RRB- are auto-categorized as `` Expenses '' , causing all the summary charts and graphs to look wrong.The software is so terribly designed that all I can really use it for now is syncing records with online accounts and the monthly text-based budget report.Frankly , it 's amazing that a software company can go three years and make negative progress on their product . I guess that 's what comes from dominant market share . Imagine if Google or Yahoo stood still for 3 years -- they 'd be crushed .
 I finally started enjoying this software when I realized it 's not really a financial management software program , it 's a computer game ! Save the princess ? Nah . Quicken has a much more exciting challenge
 Bought Quicken Deluxe 2007 , set it up for One Step Update , linked to Bank of America . WOrked well for aruond a year , then I could n't update anymore . Kept getting a `` Quicken servers are down '' message . When you call customer support a recorded message refers you back to the website , where they say you can request a callback -LRB- fine except they also say it may cost you $ 25 -RRB- . Other support options are worthless . No response from email -LRB- and judgin by their own forums , I not the only one -RRB- . They have an online `` chat '' option , which i also tried . I did get a technician , who asked me a couple of questions and then never responded again . I tried emailing them , and got no response . Apparently my problem is widespread , and i could not find any solution in their website . I figure if I spent $ 50 on a software , i should get some support , even if it 's just to say `` sorry , we have not found a workaround for that problem yet '' . I will be looking into other options , and will not be purchasing any Intuit software anytime soon .
 I have been a Quicken user since it was first sold , and I admit it 's a great product . I have upgraded in the past and found a lot of new bells and whistles I did n't need , plus advertising for bank loans and such which I found objectionable in a product I paid money for . But okay , it works . This new tactic , though , of forcing people to buy an upgrade whether they want it or not , trying to sound as though all the improvements made it necessary and that it 's just too much trouble to go on `` supporting '' the older version , is pure bullying . I pay 6.95 a month to do my banking through Quicken and that should be enough . It 's like , after you buy your car you get an email that your car is n't going to start next week unless you pay us . Blackmail . I would rather go back to writing my checks out by hand and keeping my books on a legal pad than give in to this . I 'm sure Intuit does n't care , but that 's how it is .
 I recently purchased Quicken 2007 after attempting to dredge up my old copy of Quicken 2003 and finding out about the `` sunset policy '' - that Quicken 2003 is no longer supported and many of the online functions do not work anymore.I installed the new software and was able to connect to my credit card websites , no problem . Since they are major companies and on Quicken 's list of financial institutions it went very smoothly . However , my checking and savings accounts are through a small , local Credit Union , which did not appear on the list of recognized Financial institutions . Since Quicken 2007 does not allow for the importing of . qif files , I attempted to download and use my bank 's . qfx files , but found out , after a toll-free call to India , that if my bank is not on their list the connection can not be established . Long story short -LRB- too late ! -RRB- I have no way of importing my checking and savings information - which is why I bought the software in the first place . I advise anyone who is considering a purchase of Quicken to check first to see if their bank is known to Quicken .
 Be aware if you are planning to switch from MS Money . This version does n't let you convert the data easily . The CS told me I have to download Quicken 2004 and convert from MS Money , then to Q2007 .
 If you have tons of time and want get yourself in deep confusion , buy this software .
 Nothing but problems , crashed my computer , took 2 hours to recover
 DISCLAIMER
 If you get the above error message you have been `` quickened '' . Quicken , always a company that is on the cutting edge of profit strategies , has hit a new low . Imagine if you car stopped working the day the warranty ran out . This is Quicken 's new software strategy . They do n't just stop supporting the product , they pull the plug on your ability to download information from banks . This had made my working computer program worthless to me . What if this works ? How would you like to buy every piece of software you use every couple of years ? If you buy 2007 , you support this new strategy . I hope it falls on its face .
 If you did not buy Quicken 7 online , but from an office supply store as I did , it seems impossible to get any answers for questions . Last month I did reach a telephone helper , but Mr. Singh Pal was of no sensible help at all.Now I have gotten a $ 10 fee from my bank for using quicken , and I can not reach anyone to find out ` WHY ? ' It is not mentioned anywhere in the help , nor in the sales pitch.Caveat Emptor ! -LRB- if you DID purchase from Amazon , you are in better luck , because they ask you for your online order number -RRB- k.hazelhoff
 Do n't get this software and expect to be able to convert your data from a MAC to a Windows based PC ! I have been trying for over a week now and the online chat support was absolutely useless ! He treated me as if I had no knowledge of how to even turn on a computer , much less how to see if a file is on a disc ! I have used Quicken since the late 90 's , but I will switch in a heartbeat after this experience !
 I was hoping to come back to Quicken from MS Money , but the import was impossible . First , I had to download a separate conversion utlity after searching the tech support site . I have a large Money file , so the `` reports '' in Money I was ordered to create took over 15 minutes to run . The individual transactions were imported properly , but the accounts were miscategorized . Auto-update from financial institutions could not be configured . The maddeningly slow paced chat direct from India suggested that I create new accounts and then copy and paste transactions from the imported accounts to the new ones . A manual first download was needed for each institution . The conversion instructions said I would have to reconcile every account over again . I estimted this would take me several hours , given the number of accounts and transactions . I returned the product . Despite the good reviews , Quicken could not be that much better than Money .
 I 've been using this program to track my spending and investment . I 'm mostly interested in the investment tracking features . But after using Quicken for 3 years , I am more and more disappointed with it . It can not even deliver the most basic math I need
 I have been using Quicken for over 15 years . The first time I had serious problems with it -LRB- mostly response was bad -RRB- was in 2003/2004 . When I got 2005 , I decided to keep as long as I can . In 2007 , I got the new one and am very disappointed . It has many problems and is very unstable . I can not validate my datafile , and quicken intermittently displays blank screen and hangs at startup . I finally figured out that there is some bad interaction with Norton Conf . and un-installed it.Overall , I am not happy with Quicken and am seriously considering switching to MS Money for the first time in 15 years .
 From the Intuit Support Web site
 I have been a loyal Quicken user for over 9 years . I am currently being forced to upgrade from 2004 to 2007 in order to keep the downloading capabilities that I paid for a second time when I was forced to upgrade to 2004 . Hey Intuit , here 's a thought . How about adding some ` VALUE ' to one of these upgrades . If you 're going to put someone thru the hell of transferring years of data to a new version of Quicken that 's more bug-ridden than the last . At least ` TRY ' and make it worthwile . ` How ' , you ask ? Well , let 's start with something simple like ... instead of having to generate a report or hand calculating -LRB- imagine that , you have the latest version of Personal finance software , and yet there are things you still have to ` hand calculate ' -RRB- your scheduled transaction list to know what your monthly expenses are . How about keeping a simple total on the home page -LRB- instead of about half of the other garbage seen here -RRB- of these expenses plus a running total of the items that are n't scheduled transactions but are identified as expenses each time you download or enter a transaction . In the 9 years that I 've owned Quicken products , there has n't been a single version that would tell me right on the front page ` Your total avg . monthly expenses are $ ... ' or ` So far this month you have spent $ ... ' . This info should be available as soon as you open Quicken.Or how about this ... ` Last year your net income was $ ... ' or ` Your total avg . monthly income is $ ... ' or ` So far this month your net income is $ ... ' . Real people want to know at a glance ... ` You are currenlty saving $ ... . per month ' , or ` You are currenly spending $ ... . more per month than your net income per month ' . To be the recognized industry leader in this software for this long and not have these basic characteristics at a glance , while at the same time forcing customers to shell out more $ for an ` upgrade ' is ` Utterly disgusting ' !!!
 Fight back and buy quicken 2006 while there still supplies . the cost is about $ 22
 I have been using Quicken since a very early DOS version and recently upgraded from Quicken 2004 to 2007 Delux . I have the latest patches and yet when I click to Print the program just closes . Aparantly many others have the same issue from what I have read on varrious user sites . Intuit does not have a direct answer to fix this ; it is a series of `` try this & if that dos n't work try this '' , many of which are uninstalling & chaging existing printer drivers . All of that sound risky when my printers work fine for everything else I really do n't want to `` mess around with existing drivers '' . Others who have gone through tech support to resolve issues with Quicken 2007 have spent many hours and some even days to get their issues resolved . I can not spend that much time , I am forced to switch to MS Money .
 I tried downloading this one , as well as the free trial of Microsoft Money to compare the two . Download went fine -LRB- though they do n't offer a free trial -RRB- , installation was a bit of a challenge thanks to a very old version of Quicken it did n't quite know how to deal with . It would n't recognize my old . qdt files , so I had to start over , and it took 3 tries to do the initial account setup because it kept crashing every time I tried . My credit union is n't big enough to be recognized by the money management programs , so when I tried to export data from my bank to Quicken , I found out , to my dismay , that Quicken does n't accept . qif files , which are the only ones my bank uses . Microsoft does accept them , however . The inability to accept files from my bank was a dealbreaker , so I 'm trying to return it.The process for simply trying to send a return request email has made me scream , thanks to all their requirements , required fields and the fact that my order number was apparently too long for it to handle . I ca n't wait to see how long it actually takes to get a refund.Extremely frustrating user experience , overall , and I ca n't see how this product is worth double the price of the equivalent Microsoft Money . This may be the first time I 've ever had a better user experience with a Microsoft product than with the alternative . Congratulations , Quicken , you suck worse than Microsoft .
 I just got a notice that in April 2007 the online features such as bill pay -LRB- which I use -RRB- wo n't work . I 'm told to buy Quicken 2007 . So I come here and see the massive amount of negativity . I talked to India ... and told them all I use Quicken for is to pay bills online and why should I pay to continue doing that . Of course they had no answer . Will it indeed stop me from making online payments in April ? If so , someone please let me know if Money 2007 is better . I do n't like being forced to pay money for a feature I already have .
 It 's painful to decide to switch financial mgmt software after using Quicken since 1998 . It 's been a great program with all previous releases . But a forced upgrade from Quicken 2004 has landed me in Quicken 2007 hell which involves corrupted data , broken downloads , missing/disappearing downloaded transactions , etc. . It seems like they spent all their engineering time tweaking colors and icons and forgot that CORE FUNCTIONALITY of data integrity is PARAMOUNT in financial mgmt software.Until Intuit shows that they understand the depth of their failure here and beg forgiveness from their loyal customers , they can kiss me goodbye.I 'll be buying a demo version of MS Money tomorrow .
 Quicken has adopted a `` discontinuation policy , '' under which its users will be FORCED to upgrade their software to the latest version of Quicken at least every three years . After having been FORCED to purchase Quicken 2007 , I see why . This version is not an improvement over prior verions -- in fact , it 's slower and more cluttered . Someone should commence a class-action lawsuit for all of us who bought the product expecting it to continue working -LRB- i.e. , to continue being able to download bank data , credit card data , etc. into Quicken -RRB- and who were subsequently surprised to learn that its fundamental features would be cut-off after a mere 3 years .
 Product shipped would not even install on an Intel Mac Pro . I wrote the company and after exchaning several email , they agreeded there was a problem and send me a newer disk that was upgraded to work with the Intel Mac Pro 's .
 I bought this product spontaneously at a local store . I knew I should have done my research before ! This program does not recognize my iPod - mind you , this computer is less than a month old and far surpasses the minimum system requirements . The only way to get hold of the company is to write them a letter -LRB- some of you may not remember how to do that anymore -RRB- , Wait that means I have to buy one of those small sticky papers that you have to lick and stick on an envelope . What 's that called?This was a waste of my 10 bucks . ****** UPDATE ****** August 10 , 2008After reading another review I decided to go back and try the update -LRB- something I had done several times when I first bought the program -RRB- . Now it works alright but I honestly do n't remember why I bought the program and what I 'm suppose to do with it . I guess I did n't need it after all because I 'm really not compelled to use it . I 'll update as necessary .
 I wish I had done more research and read more reviews before buying . I 'm sure it works if you can get it to recognize your iPod , turns out there seems to be a general problem with this program NOT recognizing iPods -LRB- ummmm ... is n't that the main point ? -RRB- Do n't waste your money.At least I 'll save my money on Tune Tools , which apparently is ValueSoft 's next attempt to steal your money.Tune Tools for iPod -LRB- Win/Mac -RRB-
 I 've been a Quicken user since 1994 and routinely upgraded every two years . This version leaves a lot to be desired . Intuit is so anxious to make every feature available from every page that the layout is cluttered with dialogue buttons and useless space . For everything else a user may do with Quicken , it is still basically a checkbook . In Quicken 2005 I could view 16 checkbook entries without scrolling , now I 'm reduced to 11 . My account bar used to show 15 accounts , now it 's down to 8 . I have over thirty custom reports which now require multiple mouse operations to get through , not to mention the fact that they will all have to be re-customized and re-saved just to get rid of the graphs that Intuit gratuitously stuck in my work . Scheduled transactions ? Prepare to scroll HORIZONTALLY through columns that few of us use . Want to import your 2005 Turbotax data ? Get ready for an error message that says `` Import failed , tax year not supported '' If you use the home inventory feature you may see `` not enough room on -LSB- x -RSB- drive '' -LRB- Gee , you 'd have thought 25 gigs was enough -RRB- Oh , and the tax planner acts like it 's had a lobotomy . Darn that import bug!I 've never sent a Quciken product back in ten years but this one is out of here tomorrow . Too bad I ca n't return it to Amazon ...
 After 2 days wasting nights to use this software , I 'm giving up and sending it back for a full refund . I felt like many times ready to throw my laptop out the window . There 's no video tutorial like Quicken 6 . Intuit 's endorsed manual costs extra which should have been included in the box . There 's a very basic hand holding setup for adding your first bank account . Then I 'm left out in the cold to figure this thing on my own.This software ca n't import QIF file format from Fidelity NetBenefits accounts . Intuit 's phased out QIF support because it is an outdated format . As a consumer , I DO N'T CARE . Just make it work . My choices were to enter my 401k entries for the last 2 years manually by hand , or shell out money to buy Quicken 2004 that support QIF import , then upgrade to Quicken 2007 . I already paid $ 60 for the software to help with my hectic day to day life ; not to make it worse.There 's no transaction merging feature after all downloaded transactions has been accepted . So if you have multiple online accounts with downloaded transactions and want to transfer funds , you 'll get duplicate entries . You ca n't select the duplicate entries in each account and make them merge into one . How can the company Intuit make their software so un-Intuitive ? The software make me feel I have to use the software as Intuit expects . Without a manual , I have no way to know what they expect me to do.People who 've been using this software for years would feel comfortable with this software , but for those that are new or has n't upgrade in a while , its just too much hassle .
 First of all , Quicken does a nice job as a money manager when it works properly . Unfortunately , the company seems more interested in keeping their cashflow going by releasing a new version every year , than actually releasing a quality product.This release is rife with bugs in the most important area , the part that downloads your transactions from your financial institutions into the Quicken register . Transactions are lost , you will get `` out of memory errors '' , and the program will constantly ask you to change your passwords over and over again . Intuit issued an update to address these problems , but the fix did not work . Now if you go to their website all you get is the message that `` we are aware of the problem and are working on it . `` Its too bad because Quicken is a good product . A good product owned by a company with little interest in customer support or releasing bug-free code.One reccomendation for people using this software . Start with new data files . Like previous versions of Quicken , if you upgrade your existing data files , there is more of a chance that you will have problems due to latent data errors .
 When I first got this product , I was impressed with the new features . The only problem was that this version is so full of bugs that I could not recommend it to anybody at the time . I figured I 'd wait until they came up with a new release before I judged it , but it 's hard to tell if they have fixed much at all with release 2 . I 've been using Quicken since its early DOS days , and since that time , many new features have been added . Not all releases have significant new features , but this one has more to offer than some recent past releases . Aside from Quicken 6 for DOS , though , I 've never come across a version that corrupts my data and for which Intuit does nothing to fix it.If I had to rate this product based on its features , assuming they all worked , I would give it five stars . Quicken is a premiere financial management tool to begin with , and this version is even better . The interface has been improved to give you a lot more relevant information at your fingertips with a lot less work . For a long time user , this provides nothing that you could not have gotten on your own , and if you have customized your starting point , that part will look no different . But if you want an immediate snapshot of where your money is going , what is coming in and going out , and whether you are ahead or behind for the month , this version shows you at a glance . It can easily forecast your financial future by using your existing assets , expected income and investment contributions , major expenses or plans , such as college for the kids , and so fort to figure out if your retirement plan is on target.Another improved feature is the ability to download information more easily from many more financial institutions . It is no longer necessary to go to the websites of banks that did not connect directly in the past . A one key download -LRB- actually , one key , a password , an intermediate screen that lets you change your defaults , and another key click -RRB- will go to all your banks , investment institutions , and credit grantors , and get the latest transactions from all of them . The exception is that if your bank is not willing to pay Intuit , the product will refuse to accept your data . The data gets imported in an industry standard OFX format , but Intuit requires banks to add a single line to the file , purportedly so they can verify the validity . In reality , the file has your bank 's name and your account number anyway , and this restriction does nothing whatsoever to help you or your bank . If you modified the file to change the bank 's number , the file would import fine , albeit with the wrong bank name , thus accomplishing the exact opposite of what Intuit claims to be the benefit . The other problem is that the update process seems to go to Intuit 's server a lot , and they are unreliable . The product often gives messages about bugs on their server that they are working on . Plus , when the product fails to connect in a timely manner , it takes quite a while before it times out and moves on . So if you have a large number of accounts , what should take a few minutes might drag out to a half hour on a bad day . Intuit says that you can use the product while the updates are occurring , but experience has shown me that this is dangerous and can have unwanted side effects.This version also handles attachments a lot better . Since the idea of Quicken is to be a total solution for financial management , it makes sense that you should have statements , check images , bills , receipts , warranties , or anything else associated with a transaction or account at your fingertips . If you have a scanner , or if you merely download your statements and check images from your bank , then when you search your register or go to an account , you can pull up the relevant information and not need drawers or boxes of old paperwork . One issue with this is that they have not fixed HTML support . If your bank gives you any of this information as a web page , Quicken will accept it as an attachment , but it will fail to copy over related items such as images . Thus the relevant parts might not display , and you may get JavaScript errors popping up that do nothing to help . Overall , the way attachments are handled is much improved , and you can now attach checks written against an investment account , trade confirmations , and many things that were not supported in the past , plus there is no longer a restrictive limit on these items.I would have to make this review several pages longer if I wanted to cover all the bugs , so I wo n't get into them . It 's not that previous versions were bug free . But those bugs were more inconveniences than things that would corrupt your data . For example , in the past , if you and your spouse had 401 -LRB- k -RRB- holdings at the same institution under the same corporate account , Quicken would accept only one of them for download , and give an incorrect error message for the other . Now , they claim it is fixed , but the new version often takes downloaded transactions that belong to one spouse , places them in the account of the other , and then complains that your register does not agree with the institution 's records . It will also fail to register the transactions for the other account . Since this is a data corruption issue , I would have expected it to be one of the first things they fixed , but fixes are not coming very quickly.Perhaps after a few maintenance releases , this will become the five star product that it should be . But for now , I would suggest waiting this one out . If you are willing to avoid some of the new features , you are probably no worse off for using this version than you would be with an older one , but if you are considering an upgrade for the new features , consider carefully.UPDATE
 I have used Quicken since its DOS days , and am way disappointed with this release . Some idiot colorist has purposely screwed with the readability of the user interface . Quicken now features lots of screen of black type on a dark gray background . Whose bright idea was this ? Do n't they realize they have a lot of users with 40 year old eyes ? But what really gets my goat is the colors now employed in the net work bar graph . I am using a IBM Thinkpad T40 laptop with an excellent graphics card , and the way to describe Quicken 's color choice is PUKE green . This stuff is just awful . There used to be two finance application packages with stunningly beautiful AND useful interfaces
 I have never written a review on Amazon before , but I have been a loyal Quicken customer for a decade now and I 'm extremely disappointed with this upgrade for the following reasons .1 . If you back up to CD from a disc formatted by InCD or any other program but XP , it wo n't work . Not that Quicken tells you this ; you have to find it on their support message boards . Evidently , Intuit got tired of everyone having problems with backing up to their CDs from programs other than XP that they decided to drop the capability for doing so for discs formatted by other third party software companies . That 's all well and good , but they should explain their decision in an easy to find place . I had to screw around on their support message boards for almost an hour before I found out why I could no longer back up to the same CD that I had in version 2006.2 . If I access the help files or the web through the Quicken browser , I get runtime script errors . Tech support 's solution is to have me switch my default browser from Mozilla Firefox back to IE . No thanks ; your program should n't dictate how I use my computer . They also guided me to solutions listed in their FAQS that do n't work . Hey , I checked those out before I contacted Tech Support in the first place and I even switched back to IE just to see if their FAQ solutions would work , and they do n't . I 've uninstalled the program and gone back to Quicken 2006 . At least I know that program works reliably . I 'll reserve complete judgement on Quicken 2007 if I can get Tech Support to give me a real answer to the runtime/script error programs or if they come out with a workable patch . Otherwise , I 'll request a refund and continue using Quicken 2006 .
 Intuit has a `` sunset policy '' in the license agreement of only providing support for 3 years . I understand the sunset concept , the manufacturer ca n't support a product forever , however that is not what Intuit 's policy is limited to ... What you need to realize is that after 3 years , they DISABLE key functionality of the software , forcing you to upgrade to the next version.I was a SATISFIED user with Quicken 2004 . However , I had to upgrade because Intuit disabled the key functionality of being able to download transactions from my bank.Instead of forcing me to upgrade with a `` timebomb policy '' how about creating a product that I want to upgrade to?Imagine if Honda came to your house and disabled your car after 3 years?Look for other software solutions ! Do n't become an Intuit crack addict .
 I have upgraded from Quicken 2006 to Quicken 2007 . Quicken 2007 is constantly crashing . It does this during must attempts to download on-line transactions . ALso , I do n't know if anyone else is having this problem , but Quicken 2007 is not allowing me to use the key board to copy and paste . The enter and tab key do n't work either . I hope you like your mouse . I am returing mine to the store . I did call Quicken Support , they ran me through some stuff that helped , but it did n't solve it completely . My experience has been that every version since 2004 has gotten much worse . *** Also , Quicken makes the registration very deceptive on this one . I do n't want to use there on-line access . I have had personal information stolen twice now , so I really do n't want to give very valuable personal information to a company . *** Keep your old file if you upgrade .
 Please listen to all the reviews from long-time users.This version of Quicken is not worth upgrading to . Intuit has made a poor decision to release this unfinished product.If the features that are built in would work correctly , this would be rated much higher . If ethics of releasing such a poorly tested product counted , it would be rated much lower.The attachments feature is very much improved over prior versions . You can now scan statements , receipts , invoices , checks , directly from a scanner , clipboard , or directly select from a file location.The program has good cash flow graphs indicating amount of funds available in cash spending accounts.Also improved is the ability to update multiple accounts with fewer keystrokes and using one update button.The negatives are plenty and can be seen through other reviews -LRB- server errors that prevent updates , installation issues , tool bar icons disappearing , color change limitations , register calculation errors , flickering screens , flaky start-up screens , missing downloaded bank data , and lousy support from half-way around the world from our friends near the Indian ocean -RRB- . Three words . Do n't do it.It 's a good thing that I am a long time Quicken user and not an Intuit basher or this would really be a negative review.Select your finance program carefully because it is very difficult to change programs and move data to another program without losing significant amounts of data after you have acquired several years of data.The difficult conversion process may be the one thing that is saving Intuit with this disaster of a release.If you have not selected a program yet , would you really want to be with a company that released Quicken 2007 and provided such little support afterwards?The accuracy and stability of your important financial information depends on your decision .
 I wish I had n't bought this product , but now that I have it , I 'm kind of stuck . It 's enormously unintuitive . It only fitfully downloads information from my bank account . It wo n't let me delete old , defunct accounts . It 's difficult to navigate its menus . But , I will keep it since it lends some organization to our finances .
 I have used Quicken for 12 years and have upgraded every 2 years . No longer . There are bugs which have been around for 4 years now and still not fixed .
 I 've used Quicken forever , and 2007 Premier is a one-star dog . It is incredibly slow , and server response for things like downloading stock quotes is practically non-existent . Customer service consists of someone in India who is functionally ignorant . Complaints go unanswered.STAY AWAY !!!!!
 I had this software for 5 minutes when I decided I wanted a refund . I entered my personal info , entered my bank info and it told me that I needed a separate username and pin from my bank which could take 10 days to get -LRB- Citibank by the way -RRB- . I called Citi for the pin and they told me the arrangement with Intuit is one where they charge $ 9.95 A MONTH for access to download data into Quicken . Sorry , but no -- that 's not worth it . I 'll hop over to Microsoft for a try with Money .
 I 've been a Quicken user for over 10 years now . This new release is without a doubt , and by far , the worst offering to date . It 's not only the worst Quicken version so far , it 's the worst software products of any kind I have ever used .
 I have been a quicken user for many years , but have been getting by for about a decade on Quicken 98 . I finally was forced to upgrade when my hard drive crashed and I could n't find my old quicken 98 CD . That is a pitty because I have found this update to be nothing but frustrating.In the name of making things more automatic , Quicken is constantly `` correcting '' the things that I want to do , and `` helping '' me with placeholder transactions that serve to do nothing other than duplicate entries I have entered by hand and prevent me from being able to see the real performance of my stocks and mutual funds . Imagine Microsoft Word `` Auto-Correct '' on steroids , without the ability to turn it off.Some old features that were useful like budgeting have been made virtually useless and hard to find , while lots of useless eye-candy and an endless series of frustrating wizards have been forced to the front.In short I am hoping to either find someone with an old copy of quicken before it became so terrible , or just moving all my finances to a spreadsheet .
 I owned Quicken 2005 , it was great . Then I decided to upgrade to Quicken 2007 , horrible decision . The distasteful green look and feel is the least of the issues with this thing . Scheduled updates work alright if your data file is not password protected , but how secure is that ? If you password protect your data file like I do , scheduled updates will fail every time . Also , after configuring scheduled updates , if you have it set to prompt for vault password on Windows startup , it will ask you for the vault password , you enter it correctly but it will reject it . Works fine at Windows startup . It is a known issue , it will fail as long as Quicken is open , the workaround is to close Quicken before entering the password . It seems that it has a lock on the file so it can not access it . This version is so buggy it should be considered Beta and they should not be charging for it . If you have a previous version of Quicken , do NOT waste your money upgrading , you have been warned .
 We have used Quicken for years . Now with 2007 we have hit some problems for which there seems to be no fix . The worst thing is the support . All support is done in India , I do n't care about that , but I do care that the support people are ill-trained , are not familiar with what the program does and can not answer simple questions with correct answers . I have had nothing but trouble trying to find out when a simple check printing problem will be fixed , if ever . I would stay with the older version , if it is working for you and do n't waste your money .
 My investments screens now have both vertical and horizontal scroll bars , where previously they had none . There is too much real estate taken up by the new look & feel ; , which leaves less space for my data.Also , one of the new features allows for multiple investment accounts with the same financial organization . However , this messed up both investment accounts as it put the investments into the wrong one !
 I own and use Quicken Premier 2005 and have been an electronic payment user since 1995 . I hate Quicken , but it 's the only game in town.I first used CheckFree on the Mac and it was fantastic . Simple to use and did exactly what I needed . Then Quicken -LRB- formerly Intuit , now owned by Microsoft -RRB- took over CheckFree 's home user service and I was forced to migrate -LRB- for free ! -RRB- to Quicken . Then the problems started . There is nothing wrong with their basic service
 With quite disappointment , I found that Quicken 2007 does not convert Money files even if its sales material says so . In the Quicken support forums , Quicken Steve writes , `` The Money data converter will not be updated for Quicken 2007 . The decision was made to allocate engineering resources to issues that affect people that are new to personal finance software and people upgrading from prior versions of Quicken instead of people switching from one software package to another . `` Apparently , Quicken is more interested in new users than users who are wanting divert from MS Money . If you 're a Money user wanting to switch , please be aware of this . Save your money and stick with Money .
 I have been a gnucash user since 2002 , but needed a windows solution -LRB- also , gnucash 1.8 reporting sucks -RRB- . So I bought Quicken 2006 from Costco last year , but it sat on the shelf for quite some time as the porting from gnucash is n't trivial -LSB- ... -RSB- . By the time I had all the ducks lined up , Quicken 2007 came out and , I feel like such an idiot now , I bought the upgrade . I figured I might as well jump to the latest version.I was not able to import the QIF file from gnucash into Quicken 2007 ; each time I got a different variation of transactions that made it into the accounts !! I had success with Quicken 2006 . Once I had everything setup in 2006 , I then took the file over to the other machine with 2007 with the intention of using 2007 from then on ; I figured that perhaps the gnucash-to-QIF export program above needed to be fixed to accomodate 2007 . How wrong I was !? The bottom line is that 2007 is Beta at best . I have been developing software for over a decade and can not conceive how a reputable company with some great products -LRB- love Turbo Tax ! -RRB- could ever release such rubbish ! Downloading of the transactions just does not work ; some lucky ones make it , others are nowhere to be found.I am back to using 2006 and finding it to be pretty stable and featureful/useful product.Worst part is that I am stuck with this garbage as I tossed the shipping-box . I do n't even want to offer the CD for sale as used as the only place it belongs is in the trash !!
 I 've used Quicken for over 15 years now - since the early DOS versions . This is the BUGGIEST , version by far . Keeps crashing when I click on tabs or buttons . Sometimes you can crash it consistently by performing the same tasks . Other times it 's entirely random.Just today , I ca n't get into Quicken at all . I enter my password and then NOTHING - the program crashes before I get to do anything!AVOID until they have a few updates on this one .
 I have been a Quicken user from their start . This 2007 program crashes -LRB- screen locks -RRB- most times you use it and you must use the emergency shut down -LRB- even Task Manager wo n't work -RRB- and do a new cold boot . They can not establish a download with my bank , and say the problem is on their end and their `` team '' is `` working on it '' . The password vault dialog box often is absent . There are many other problems . If you call for help you get some one in India who speaks Indian and not American English , and quite faintly . If the problem is technical they just hang up on you . This program is unfinished . Wait until next year , then buy 2007 , if you must . Perhaps they will have fixed it by then .
 This program has reached new lows for software quality . It is a scary thought to trust your finances to a program that is so buggy ... . I have zero confidence to enter the user names and passwords for all my financial institutions . I do n't know where they will end up by mistake . I hit so many problems already ... . After I went through the ` suggested ' upgrade , the program would not start . I was getting the splash screen , and then nothing . I was asked , via the Intuit 's chat , to un-install and re-install the program . The second time the program got stuck on the update . I clicked the ` Help ' button and I got JavaScript errors and popups continuously . I attempted to connect to my first financial institution , and I was asked to ` change ' my password , even though it had failed to authenticate ... . I downloaded this program directly from Intuit and I am sending it back immediately . I should have read the reviews first , but I remember using Quicken years back when it was a really nice program .
 I 'm the last one to recommend a Micosoft product , but if you 're looking for a good finance managing application , do n't look here . Go back to money 2007 . In their infinite wisdom , Intuit has decided to downgrade quicken to some bastardized java gui . While this makes it easy for them , it makes it tough for normal users . Firstly , as is standard with any java application , the memory usage by this program is non-trivial . It has a huge footprint that almost requires shutting down every program just to run this one . Secondly , it has inherited the ability to crash for absolutely no reason . On a well running computer , this software can crash itself , without you having to do anything . Thirdly , as typical with non-native guis , this program has all sorts of quirks which can cost you valuable minutes and ultimately drive you insane . For instance , if you click a drop down box to choose a category or something , you can not just start using your scroll mouse to navigate down the box . Instead , you have to actually click on something before your scroll mouse works . This means to get the efficiency of the scroll mouse , you need to click the drop down , click a category , click the drop down , scroll to your category , then click your option . Waste of time . This program is riddled with little quirks like this.Finally , the program is busting with usability bugs , things that MS Money does without you even realizing . First off , it 's list of categories is very short , and does not reflect what a typical person may want to categorize . Choosing that you got gas at BP on 13th does not mean all transactions before or even after that show gasoline . You have to manually categorize all of them ! MS Money learns this immediately .
 I hate to come down so -LSB- . . -RSB- a program that is so widely used , but my experience with Quicken has been awful . At first I thought it was because I was simply used to other -LRB- easier to use -RRB- money programs . But I have suffered with Quicken for three years now and I am giving up and moving on.The top three problems with Quicken :1 . Typing-in the date of a new year -LRB- for example moving from 2006 to 2007 -RRB- automatically starts the new year and silently wipes out all cleared transactions for the previous year . This alone makes this -LRB- or any program -RRB- unusable . The one thing that no program can ever do is silently delete massive amounts of data without a confirmation , backup or even telling you it is happening . Because it is silent , you exit the program normally , create a back-up of the session and , in the process , overwrite your previous back-up . You lose all of your history with no way to recover it .2 . Reports seem flexible at first , but flexibility brings complexity . The problem is , there is no way to browse categories -LRB- their name for where you spend your money -RRB- and see a quick summary . You have to run a report every time you want to view an account or category . You can create them and save them , making it relatively easy to rerun them , but you have to rerun them . You ca n't simply browse and see the status of categories -LRB- how much did I spend on gas ? food ? postage ? Christmas ? etc. -RRB- nor can you quickly see which have had activity or not this month -LRB- handy for seeing if you forgot to pay a bill -RRB- .3 . Creating split transactions is harder than it needs or ought to be - it is a click machine . The number of steps -LRB- or clicks -RRB- required to do simple things does n't seem so bad at first . But once you start entering a list of transactions , you find it to be onerous . If a split is the same over and over , that 's easy . If it changes each time you visit a store -LRB- like , say , -LSB- . . -RSB- -RRB- , it is a pain.I am not a novice user . I have used personal computers since the early 80 's for business and pleasure . No program has caused me the irritation and frustration that Quicken has . I have worked extensively with their customer support and they ca n't recover my data .
 I have been working on upgrading from Quicken Premier 2004 to Quicken Premier 2007 R4 for 3 days now and I have now sent 5 emails to customer support about issues with the upgrade . After countless hours of trying things on my own and working with support one of the issues in trying to convert from 2004 to 2007 has been resolved.However , after all of that work my biggest issue is still unresolved . Investment accounts show wrong amounts in net worth graphs and reportsThe worst part is the recent steps they have suggested -LRB- which do n't work -RRB- all mention that that it could mess up certain transactions . One of the main reasons I use Quicken Premier is to help me track my investments and capital gains . If I ca n't rely on the data being accurate that is a big issue for me.This product has been out since August - they have had 4 patches for it . It seems crazy that they still have issues like this at this point . I 've been a user of Quicken for years and have purchased many upgrades along the way . Unfortuately I ca n't stay with 2004 as Quicken said they no longer be able to get any information online . It may be time for me to switch to Money . Intuit is not the company it used to be .
 I told myself to wait for Release 4 or beyond but could n't stand the itch & decided to fork out $ 39.99 today at Costo for the Deluxe version . The program freezes whenever I try to click `` Quicken Home '' or `` Cash Flow Center . '' I 've tried uninstall & reinstall without further success . Well , the program has a 60-day money back guarantee and also I bought it at Costco , which has been very lenient on software returns . I will try to start as `` New User '' and setup all my accounts to see if it 's still buggy . After that , I 'll go back to the 2006 and return this one . Believe the low ratings and do n't buy anything hot off the press unless it 's on the shelf for at least 6 months . I may even go back to Microsoft Money 2007 , which has been known to be a more stable program , although much less user friendly . The whole reason that I try to upgrade to Quicken 2007 is because Quicken 2006 still is buggy , mostly related to database file propriety matters . Last shot before going back to Microsoft Money 2007 ...
 I had no problems with Quicken 2006 , however 2007 has major problems . Support for Quicken which is apparently in India provides no help and leads you to believe the problem is with your data file . They asked to try to duplicate the problem in a new test file and now I am locked out of bank 's online banking . DO N'T BUY IT !!!!
 I have been using Quicken for about 13 years and I have probably upgraded 10 times . This is the absolute worst upgrade I have ever seen . In addition to adding the usual unnecessary weight to the program for marketing purposes -LRB- vendor ratings - who cares ? -RRB- they have now created a version that is so buggy that it crashes every time I try to use it . If I am lucky , it will stay up for long enough for me to perform a download of my accounts , but then it crashes repeatedly before I get the transactions entered . It 's April and they are on the fourth revision of Quicken 2007 , and it 's still a mess . I have not noticed any improvement to the stability with any of the revisions . I have called their support people and sat there while they did `` troubleshooting '' , which consisted of reinstalling the program , but the problems persist . When I have the time and energy , I am going to investigate switching to Microsoft Money , although since that 's a MS product I do n't have high hope for its stability either . Bottom line - if you are using Quicken 2006 or 2005 and you are reasonably happy with it , DO NOT UPGRADE . Once you do upgrade you really ca n't go back without a lot of hassle . Intuit should be ashamed and heads should role over this . In terms of recourse , the best we can hope for is a class action suit that will get us all a $ 2 coupon for our next upgrade .
 I both hate and love Quicken.Number one on my hate list is their sunsetting policy . I get that they ca n't support old versions forever , but they take it a step further by disabling key features such as being able to download your statements . Intuit , leave it to me to risk running without support , do n't turn off features that I fairly paid for . It 's nothing but a strong arm tactic to force you to buy the new version . On principle , I always buy one year old versions off of eBay ; partly to save $ 60 -LRB- I usually buy the premier version -RRB- , and partly so that I know my money is n't going to Intuit to support this behavior.That said , I never get the reporting and information that I want . I 'm very detailed ; every transaction for every credit card account , my investment accounts , bunches of spend categories , etc. . I do this so I can get an accurate picture of where my finances have been , where they are now , and where they 're going . That said , reports are never built correctly . I can usually get enough good information to figure out what I need to know , but the reports should be much more intelligent and accurate . It should n't be so hard and I should n't have to keep wondering why numbers are reported incorrectly.I 'm also weary of Intuit releasing `` tweak '' versions every year . We 've had more than a decade of tweaks . How about a new application from the ground up that is fundamentally more sound , friendlier , and more accurate?When I say I love Quicken , managing my finances carefully is important to me and I 've been using this application for maybe 15 years . I 'm in it nearly everyday . I just hate the fact that it 's not the application it can or should be . The last time I tried MS Money , I did n't like it much and there is no real other competition . That 's the problem.So when I say I love Quicken , what I really mean is that it will have to do .
 Intuit continues its streak of terrible products , August 30 , 2007By E. L. Edsall - See all my reviewsI have purchased Quicken 2005 , 2006 & now 2007 . I should have learned ; Intuit does n't care about improving their products ; just selling them . And , what you have a problem with their buggy softare ? Get out you credit card and pay $ 29.95 to speak and listen -LRB- carefully at that because the person is in India - can you say impossible to understand on the telephone -RRB- and be told that the problem is with your file . Oh , wow great but I thought it was your software . The truth is it is the software ; full of more bugs than a 10 day old animal . Do n't take my word for it ; look at the forums under quicken.com . Thousands of disgruntled users . Where are those class action lawyers when we need them !
 Unfortunately , Quicken has continued its decline with this release . There are significant problems with screen display updates -LRB- unless you like staring at a flickering display while you wait for it to update -RRB- , and , most importantly , is is almost useless for investment tracking , due to frequent errors from Quicken 's update servers . Their tech support is unresponsive -LRB- I suspect all off-shore -RRB- , and this has been getting worse for the last year.Anyone thinking of buying this should spend some time in the forums and see what issues users are having before making the decision to depend on this.I speak as one who has used Quicken since the very early days , but I 'm out of here unless they put some resources into fixing issues .
 Quicken needs to get some good updates and stio chaiging the color and a few words and call it a new version . Ca n't wait for another company . What happen to MS Money
 I 've been using Quicken for many years . While I like the interface , it has been getting more and more buggy just about every year . The 2007 version is the worst I have used so far . And their technical support is not good at all . Eventually they may help solve a problem , but it 's only after many tries.Also if you are getting the premier version because of the investment management there 's 1 bug they already told me they cant -LRB- or wont -RRB- fix . When you try to drill down into your asset allocation to understand a certain asset class , it always includes the cash asset class along with the one you really are trying to look at .
 I 've used Quicken for years . The 2004 worked wonderful . Then , Quicken automatically shut down this year and forced me to buy an upgrade . I hate upgrades but I had to get Quicken 2007 since I had years of financial history . The 2007 upgrade sucks . Checks were reported as written to unknown parties . I thought somone stole my identity . Forget about asking Quicken for help . One day I spent four hours with my banker trying to figure out the problem . Calling Quicken is like calling the moon -- forget it , Quicken , do n't just walk , run from this upgrade .
 I 'm a long-time quicken user and do relatively sophisticated things . I 've become less and less happy with Quicken the last few years . It does n't support 529s unless you fudge around with calling it something else and getting prompts for IRAs which do n't apply to 529s . It does n't support other than a few limited investment classes which do n't include for example Small and Mid-Cap Companies ... both of which were outperformers in 2005 . And it does n't support Interest Only Mortgages . It does n't let you change your columns in most views so for example on your investment purchases summary screen -LRB- when you 're looking at just a single security -RRB- , you ca n't see the purchase cost for each lot . Their rename features have numerous bugs and their basic transaction matching function usually fails to find the wrong transaction when it 's a repeating transaction ... you think it could find one when the date on the scheduled transaction and the date on the actual transaction match but instead , it goes to the earliest one and you have to match by hand ... in a screen that does n't sort . These are 6 basic things that Quicken could have fixed with this release.Instead , they choose to produce something I would have expected out of a Web startup in 2003 . Lots of crappy things allowing you to provide feedback on vendors -LRB- which Quicken can collect and sell -RRB- . A totally different look and feel which did n't fix anything and creates a whole new learning curve . And so many bugs that you can use the darn thing . I think Intuit has really taken their eye off the ball and instead of adding useful financial features , they 're just milking their current product by tweaking various things . I 'm actually at the point that I 'm going to demo Microsoft Money which I 've been completely against doing for years.So here 's my primary issues : First , my online downloads no longer work . I have to reset up all my banks and investment accounts . And this will take you hours since they 've completely changed the look and feel . So if you upgrade , expect it to take you several days until you get to the point you can work with Quicken again . Four months later and I still have n't gotten everything working again.Second , the screens are extemely cluttered . No longer can I view nearly as much data as once.Third , they added this useless ` Rate It ' feature which you ca n't turn off and it takes up all sorts of room . I 'd expect something like that in a freeware version but not in a version you pay for . They just put it in so that they can make another revenue stream not so it can help any of their users . If you could turn it off , it would n't be so bad.Fourth , the new home page will add this huge useless cash flow boxes which take up mos of the screen . You old home page will be gone.You 'll be much happier if you stay with the previous version even though you wo n't get the lastest tax rate data - which really has been the only reason to upgrade Quicken in the last few years .
 After using Quicken software for over ten years , it was with little hesitation that I upgraded to the newest version , Quicken 2007 . How I wish I had not ; this is a very flawed product . A new feature called Express Web Connect , my main reason for upgrading , is at this writing still not functional , even though there have been three maintenance releases to the software to date . Even the maintenance releases have been problematic . In the second release -LRB- R2 -RRB- , customization of the toolbar was `` broken '' , and Intuit 's recommendation was to uninstall , reinstall , and only apply the R1 patch . It 's very difficult to have any faith in a company that seems to break as much as they fix in each release.Among other complaints with the software is the quote server . While not part of the software package itself , the quote server is often inaccessible , which will not allow stock price updates in a timely fashion.Many users report problems with screen flickering and redraw , with simple operations such as backup to CD/DVD , and even with calculations of cash flow on the Quicken Calendar.If you are not currently using Quicken , either buy Quicken 2006 and go with that , or purchase Microsoft Money . I have very little hope that Intuit will be successful in fixing the mess that has become Quicken 2007 .
 I have used Quicken for the past ten years and have been generally happy with the product . When my bank stopped supporting the `` direct connect '' feature with Quicken , it said it would work only with Quicken 2007 's `` express web connect '' feature to download its transactions . So I paid $ 75 to upgrade to Quicken 2007 . The problem is , Quicken 's new `` express web connect '' feature does not work . At all . Worse , Quicken 's outsourced customer service reps in India appear to have never even heard of this feature , much less have any clue how to fix it . I have contacted them 3 times and have received three completely different but equally useless suggestions on how to fix the problem . Quicken 's help-file and support web site are equally useless with regard to the problems with express web connect . A quick search on the web reveals that the problems with the `` express web connect '' feature are widespread . Until Quicken acknowledges these problems and provides a solution , stay away from this product .
 I ca n't even get past registration without it crashing . It crashes when I try to update my accounts . Refund time !
 I have used Quicken for many years , usually updating every other year . The oldest file I quickly found on my hard drive is dated 1997 . I have encouraged others to use this product including members of my family . However , starting with the 2004 version I have become more and more dissatisfied . This new version is just more of the same junk . Some calculations are still inaccurate , the screen has become more littered with useless junk , and navigation within the screens require more mouse time . I need to view my data and I do n't need to know about Quicken Financial Services . Further , in my humble opinion , the disabling of functionality in a piece of software is certainly nothing more than an extortion attempt . Then there is the outsourcing issue ... . ENOUGH . I have created a spreadsheet to import quotes into which then calculates what I need in a flash , and I have found a neat little checkbook software application -LRB- AceMoneyLite -RRB- that based on my initial review looks very promising . You can upgrade for more functionality at a very reasonable price . So Intuit - take a hike . Time to change . I would encourage all Quicken Heads to seriously evaluate their requirements for Personal Financial Software and determine if they really need to stay on the Intuit Corporate Greed Wheel .
 This version of quicken is terrible . If you are updating from another version of quicken , as I did , you will just be heading for trouble . Several things broke when I did this . I am definitely asking for my money back . I have spent several hours with technical support without making any progress . It is absolutely not worth it .
 We recently upgraded quicken for our home due to our bank no longer supporting the older 2004 version , and since that time downloads have created duplicate entries and will not allow to manually match . Reconciliation lists items that were completed and clear from month prior . I am no longer assured of the integrity of my data due to this error . We have used this product since it first came on the market and have repeatedly recommended this product in the past to our clients and NEVER have had such poor product performance . I 'm ready to purchase Microsoft Money and not only inform my current clients , but those who I will support in the future . Trying to get free support is impossible , and phone support will take hours .
 I wish Quicken was as good at making a quality product as they are accepting your money . Their online download works flawlessly , their product operates erratically and they look to charge you $ 25 per incident to fix these problems for you . I 'm thinking I will just stick with my banks software and chalk my Quicken purchase up to a lesson learned .
 I have bought the newest version every year and this version is terrible . My screen flickers & jumps . I even tried throttling back my video card adjustment . I tried to go back to version 2006 , but once you convert your files to the newest version they can not be read by older versions . Quicken is slipping bad.I have tried working with their support dept. with no luck . They say they know about the problem , have no patch yet . Maybe I will MS money next year ?
 Like a fool I purchased this software based on the cool pictures on the box and the long list of features . Unfortunately , the pictures turn out to be not actual screenshots , and the features are , as Bart pointed out , little more than limited templates . A couple cases in point -- there is apparently NO WAY to create dormers , although they 're featured prominently on the cover . The palette of textures is nowhere near as extensive or impressive as those shown on the cover . The lighting effects displayed on the box are not possible with the basic software . To me this is deceptive advertising!The MOST ANNOYING feature is the 3D fly-through . You have two choices
 This product uses none of the thousands of user friendly improvements now available -- few right-click menus , few keyboard shortcuts . With a 2.4 ghz machine the 3D viewing is uncontrollable ! The existence of the totally intuitive useability of the inexpensive 2D program DeltaCad or the expensive Photoshop demonstrates that programs can be much more user-friendly than this ridiculus contraption .
 This is my second try with Punch this time buying the 3000 series which at the time was second from the top of the line . It has the same problems as all the rest of their products ! It 's incredibly slow !!!! My machines -LRB- fast ones < quad core > -RRB- all bogg down to almost a stop when it loads and every time you try to move something , sometimes I 'll just go get coffee while I wait . It crash 's constantly on Windows 7 and Vista even on XP Pro . If you 're trying to build a house the contractor will have it built before you get the design completed . As for customer service THERE IS NONE ! Thats right , when you buy this you 'll never get help except from others online with the same problems and there are a lot of them ! I 've run several kinds of CAD ware and this is the worst . I 'm looking for a real one now.DON ' T BUY
 Purchasing this program was an unfortunate choice . Frustrated by the limitations of the Better Homes and Gardens Home Designer Suite , the Punch Home Design Architectural Suite 3000 version 12 looked like a good solution.WRONG ! 1 . The software is extremely buggy , especially in 3D mode . It is very picky about which graphics adapters and configurations that it will work with , usually forcing you to change your display setup to 16 bit from 32 bit . I have used this program in both XP and Vista implementations on two different systems , and the program routinely crashes while working in 3D mode . I ca n't print a 3D view at all from the program , but have to resort to screen clipping to another program in order to print out a 3D view .2 . The interface is not at all intuitive , and will drive you bonkers trying to figure it out .3 . As another reviewer has written , there are a number of displayed features on the box that are essentially impossible to replicate when using the program .4 . There is a truly goofy activation process for the program when you have to reinstall to try to get it to work on a different system -LRB- although there seems to be little point in trying -RRB- . While the Better Homes and Gardens product seems like it has some serious limitations , it at least was easy and bug-free to work with .
 This software was a constant hassle from start to end . It did have some good ideas and the help files were well done but the software crashed constantly.Maybe I 'll try to see if there is a fix somewhere before I return it to the store . Needs much improvement .
 While the program has a lot of features , it is in no way possible to create any sort of drawing that could be submitted to a zoning commision or regulating body . The 3-D view is difficult to control , and the perspective inside a structure is abysmal ; it is only good for external views . Drawing a terraced home with rooms at different levels was not possible without having part of the home flying out in space or under ground . The landscape grading feature could not correct this problem.In all very disappointing .
 Do n't buy this thinking you wo n't need to pay for a professional draftsman.We made blueprints from this software , and the framer ASKED for the professional blueprints b/c he knew it was reliable and to scale . We certainly thought we had everything to scale.We never had a CAD class . We were n't taught how to use the software . It takes alot of time to figure it out . Your work can be erased easily . My husband clicked the wrong button and hours of work vanished.Using the stair feature is quite a pain . The program has outdated cabinet features , and OUTDATED appliances . A program like this needs to include side-by-side fridges , Front Load WASHER/DRYERS , or different -LRB- modern -RRB- kitchen sinks/faucets . Those appliances take more space -LRB- WIDTH -RRB- and use more depth.The progam should also suggest the 4ft of floor space you need between a kitchen island / and the counters . You DON `` T want to plan a tight kitchen where appliances can not be moved , and cabinet doors hit the opposing kitchen island cabinets.You need pop-up warnings when you 've created a space to tight to function.Creating the cut-up roofs are also near impossible . The program does n't have the best & updated window selection . Like casement windows . And some other imporant styles of windows.Just buy the program if you have the time to make a rough-draft blueprint to BRING TO THE PROFESSINAL DRAFTSMAN . !!!!!!!!!!! We are 1st time home builders , and glad we have the program for the 3D feature . If you can create your own 3D home using this PROGRAM ... great , b/c the Draftsman charges even more fordoing that .
 If you want to build a very plain house that is 4 walls and a box then this will do the job . Anything else and it will not handle the job . Do n't expect it to handle anything like different size of external walls , or external wall types other than standard 8 ' walls . Major problems with wall and foundation design .
 OK , so I bought the program and designed my house . Then I printed the house plan and proceded to build my house . When I finished construction of the new house I stood back and admired my work . Right away I could tell something was n't right . The house is really tiny ! In fact it measures 11 '' long x 8 1/2 '' wide . Great - the house is worthless ! I have a wife and 3 kids and it do n't take a rocket scientist to see that we all ai n't gon na fit in this teeny weeny house . My friend Earl says I shoulda printed the plans on a bigger printer . Now he tells me . That 's a great idea but I ca n't seem to find a printer that uses 40-foot x 60-foot paper . I do n't think I would recommend this program . It did n't say anything about this on the box .
 Horiible software ! This is the worst software I have ever used . There are many tools that do all kinds of neat views and very powerful tools except it should not be on the store 's shelves without much cleanup . The software crashes occasionally , can be extremelt slow to the point of waiting 40-60 seconds every mouse click . Walls jump around to spots you have never had your mouse occasionally . Area dimension tools are useless because all walls are considered outside wall . To draw an inside foundation wall you have to draw a complete box which means duplicating concrete lineage . The whole thing is just not ready for market crap.Each time you change floors the view magically changes itself to include other views . The options consistently change themselves . The whole thing is a waste of money and time.Avoid !!!! If Punch ! does not make a factory recall in the next few months I hope they go out of business , They deserve it after this bit of marketting hype for this piece of garbage.Don ' t take my word for it . Look in ePinions.com and elsewhere for reviews . I wish I had first . Also watch for people saying it works well and note the hype in their text . Also note they never have produced a finished product . Obviously shills for the company.Future Shop owes me , and every other victim of this junk , an apologee for this one . You will see it on the junk table for $ 9.95 soon .
 I just recently purchased this software and was completely NOT satisfied ! This is a very basic program that simply is overpriced . The box looks nice ... and it appears that you just purchased something professional ... but please believe when I say this is FAR from the truth . They claim to have all these so called wizards , that basically let you change the size of an existing object and a material from a very small list of materials and thats it ! For instance I wanted to see how my kitchen would look ... well I jumped into the cabinet wizard to find I had only two door styles to choose from ... and much worse I could not add molding , millwork , or handles . Sure , if I want to spend hours creating these things in their cubersome and ackward 3D workshop , then I can add them . This is just ONE of many examples . I tried to email my concerns , but four days later I got a reply that they believed their product was highend software . I wanted my money back but they refused and said I should have spent more time researching their product ... how is that for customer service ? They went on to say this product does not need a guarantee or even a demo version for you to try out ... even though they offer a 90 day money back guarantee with all their other products . Save your money or spend a little more and purchase Better Homes and Gardens Home Designer Pro 6 ... it is far superior in every aspect . AS3000 may claim to have all these features ... but let me tell you they all are very basic and limited . This is NOT a professional program ... it is a professional scam and waste of your hard earned money ! DO NOT BUY !
 I researched various design software prior to purcahsing Punch AS3000 and thought I did a good job of doing so ... I was wrong . I have been in construction related fields for over 20 years , and feel as though given some instruction , guidleines , etc I can learn almost anything ! Purchasing this software proved me to be wrong . Upon making my purchase I learned that there were no `` demos '' available , this should be warning # 1 ! I pursued it . I was told that I would have 90 day support via phone tech support , which I did , however , when I did call I was treated as though i was truly `` bothering '' the receiver of my call , and then treated as though they could not believe that I did not know how to do waht I was asking . The manual is basically useless as it does not walk the user through applications in any sort of logical format . The tech support is not helpful , the so called tutorials are also useless . I strongly reccomend that you do not waste your money on this program . My only wish is that I could provide an alternative solution at this time . Each task is cumbersome and most require `` custom 3D sorkshop '' design which if you have the patience and `` creativity '' to figure out how to use still do not accomplish the task .
 Extremely overpriced - customer service is terrible - real stupid looking library items - no good for cement block design or calculations - it 's all about framing - has an inconvenient ruler for measuring and it disapears if you scroll up or down - oh , so many other unfriendly moves you need to do till you get to where you want to , if you get there ... Knowing what I know now , after using this software , I would NEVER have paid $ 220 for it - For some 3D `` play '' the MOST it 's worth is $ 19 to me .
 When I came across this product it sounded like the answer to uninstalling programs from a Mac . Yes , I know , you can drag an application to the trash can and get rid of it that way . However , this procedure still leaves preference files on the machine . I wanted a complete clean uninstall.Save your money . This is a waste of time and money . Supposedly enables the Mac owner to quickly and easily remove installed apps . I 've yet to be able to make it work . It gives no indication that is actually doing anything when you go to remove an app .
 Great product but it is not keeping up with its own promises . No dictionary updates in years , software is clunky and needs many improvements . I feel like the developers have already jumped ship years ago and are no longer interested in what they have sold . It is not a cheap program and once you have 100s of songs in their database you are kind of stuck . Beware !!!
 I downloaded the trial version of Masterwriter to see if it was worth the high price tag . For me , it was n't . Most of the writing tools -LRB- rhyming dictionary , recorder -RRB- I already have in other forms that I 'm happy with . The main thing I was interested in was the ability to organize my songs . I ran into a wall there . Masterwriter wo n't allow you to change the ` creation date ' of any song you add to its database -- songs are automatically and permanently associated with the date you put them into the software . For me , this made no sense . I did n't start writing the day I downloaded the software ; there were lots of songs I wrote years ago that I wanted to be able to organize too , and I could n't do that . So I deleted the trial version.I 'm on a Mac , so I tried some other software . There 's actually a cheap -LRB- $ 5 -RRB- program for Mac called Songwriter 's Companion that seemed to do almost everything Masterwriter does , but it would n't allow me to change the creation date either . But if you do n't care about the creation date thing , you might look into Songwriter 's Companion before you shell out the big bucks or Masterwriter.I finally ended up buying a simple database program called Tap Forms that is n't meant for songwriting but allows me to set a creation date and associate audio with a song -LRB- the other thing I wanted to do -- both Masterwriter and Songwriter 's Companion can do this too -RRB- . No rhyming dictionary or anything in Tap Forms , of course , but like I said , I was n't looking for that .
 I write music for a living and decided to give MasterWriter a shot a few months ago . I used it for about a week straight and decided that the old-fashioned way of using Mac Pages and an internet rhyming website/thesaurus was more efficient for me . MasterWriter is clunky -- the interface seems to have been designed from someone still stuck in the late 90s computer-wise . Often things do n't do what they 're supposed to on the first try , and the overall experience -LRB- believe me , I gave it a chance -RRB- left me regretting that I shelled out the money for it . It 's also quite slow at times.It 's too bad because the rhyming and thesaurus features could be truly fantastic and are better than what 's out there on the web because of how they 're hypothetically integrated -- it 's just the way that they 're implemented that leaves someone who 's used to the way modern programs work with a lot desire.They need to hire programmers who are hip to the modern age of computing and work flow .
 I am glad I bought this as a `` free after rebates '' software . Tax money still goes waste . User unfriendly , lots of interactions with software you already have . Once the stealth surfer is running , you can not open a new website . The phone lines for Cosmi are always engaged and it takes them days to respond to an email .
 The idea of having a dictionary as big as the one advertised in this module is great . How many times have you wanted to look up a word only to stop yourself because you did n't want to open up that huge book ? Even for those of us who have internet connections to look up words easily , sometimes we are not around the Internet and would like to be able to look up a word on an airplane , train , or bus , etc. . The problem is with this module is the implementation . The navigation is poor , and even if you do n't use it at first , you will want navigation in it lately . I would wait until Franklin releases a better user interface .
 I was very excited to get this module . I remember having had a franklin electronic bible years ago and I was hoping to have that convenience again . Unfortunately , the interface is abominable . There 's no real concordance , and when you try to search , you can only do the Old or New Testament , and the presentation of results is lousy , and it always tries to search its topic index first . What a pain . I 'll gladly settle for a software solution that takes up a couple of Meg , because this program is so abysmal . There are free solutions out there drastically better than this -LSB- $ -RSB- module .
 Dinosaur Chess will not properly load or work completely with any operating system newer than Windows XP . This product has not been up-dated .
 Do n't be fooled . This is n't software , it is n't a book of tax advice , it may not be worth what you pay for it . This is literally a folder with a velcro seal and several tabbed sections inside for you to store tax receipts and other records . Also included in the package is a very brief pamphlet of common tax tips . There are also small labels you can attach to each of the tabbed sections.In most respects , this product is nothing more than manilla folders with a handful of labels you can apply yourself . The tax guide pamphlet is way too small to be of much use to anyone who has done their own personal income taxes once before . If you want tax advice or tips , buy one of the books specifically written for that , or get the free publications published by the IRS which are available online and often included in most `` deluxe '' tax preparation software.The folder and the tabbed sections are plastic coated but other than that it is hard to find much value-added from this product over your own folders and/or shoebox .
 Intuit Turbotax 2002 included a non-optional program called `` C-Dilla '' . That program was supposed to be a DRM -LRB- Digital Rights Management -- anti-piracy -RRB- program , but is a particularly nasty form of spyware / malware that may be difficult or impossibel to remove from your system.Before considering TurboTax , make a strong effort to find out if C-Dilla is no longer part of the TurboTax program -LRB- s -RRB- , and that it is not a part of this `` TurboTax Organizer '' . In the 2002 version of TurboTax , a great protest rose up from prominent computer-industry magazines and users , which led to Intuit/TurboTax 's somewhat apologizing for C-Dilla , and offering a program that uninstalled C-Dilla after you 'd uninstalled TurboTax 2002 . -LRB- The original uninstall program that came with TurboTax 2002 did n't remove C-Dilla . -RRB- Why dislike C-Dilla ? Here 's why : If I had known in advance that this program contains CDilla spyware / malware , I would not have bought it . I ordered the product already ... but I guarantee it will make a quick trip to the trash-bin UNOPENED.For those of you who do n't know what CDilla is : It 's spyware , which means it reports across the internet to let the mfr . know if you 're making extra copies . It 's also malware , because it interferes with your CD copying ... not just preventing certain copyrighted CDs from being copied -LRB- OK , OK -RRB- but also just plain preventing your CD burner from copying random CDs properly ... whether there 's a legitimate reason for preventing that copy or not.CDilla sets itself up on an undeclared , self-created partition on your hard disk . Yes , that means it goes in and changes your partition table !!! For some users , that 's going to be a real problems , because monkeying with the partition table is NOT a good idea ... particularly if you have several partitions , dedicated to several flavors of operating system -LRB- Windows and Linux , for example ... with a LiLo-type partition to provide you with a boot-time menu so you can choose which operating system to boot -RRB- . Here 's a quote from extremetech.com . -LRB- ExtremeTech and its sister publication PC Magazine are industry leaders . You have probably heard of their most famous writer , John C. Dvorak . -RRB- This is from one of many articles there about C-Dilla , particularly C-Dilla on Intuit 's TurboTax software . -LRB- Intuit-TurboTax-2002 's version of C-Dilla was n't different from any other version of C-Dilla . It just got alot of attention because TurboTax * was * very popular software until C-Dilla became a part of it . -RRB- From the article : `` Likely the biggest problem users have expressed , is the level at which the TurboTax licensing agreement is managed and protected with the SafeCast/C-Dilla technology . People believe C-Dilla infiltrates their system in a very insidious manner , and uses memory and resources even when TurboTax is not loaded . And some believe it has caused them serious compatibility problems with non-related CD writing operations . -LRB- PC Magazine and ExtremeTech will be conducting some tests next week to see if we can duplicate some of these problems -RRB- . -LSB- ... -RSB- or your customers still looking to exit TurboTax for good , the uninstaller at this link now fully removes components of SafeCast/C-Dilla that were previously mostly impossible to remove . `` You can use the search engine at extremetech.com to find this article and related C-Dilla articles , and the very interesting discussions about C-Dilla , what it does , why folks dislike it intensely , etc. etc.In short , C-Dilla is an extremely strong reason for any PC user to avoid this product . Buy something else instead . If you 're planning on using this product at work , forget it ... your Info Technology manager will have a cow if he/she knows that you 're installing destructive trojan/spyware -LRB- C-Dilla -RRB- on the company PCs . If you 've already installed this software on a PC at work , let your IT manager know IMMEDIATELY , so he/she can take whatever steps are possible to remove C-Dilla .
 I purchased this product to gist a large number of Japanese documents and found the software to be pretty ineffective . In retrospect , I should have noticed that both positive reviews on Amazon appear to be from Spanish speaking individuals .
 Not worth the money , time or aggravation invested in it . After installing , did test runs with sample web pages , and it proceeded to re-write and destroy basic html tags . Un-installing the program was even more of a nightmare ! Created a mess on hard drive and left remnants of it itself in nearly all WP , Spreadsheet , and Database programs . Customer support ? No such thing . Avoid this program at all costs .
 This program does not run on all systems . I have a standard , not-too-old , Pentium II -LRB- 233 -RRB- Gateway laptop with 256 RAM . The program installed correctly , but when I tried to run it two different `` fatal error '' messages appeared . The program then shut down . L & H said that this happens on some systems ; they do not know why . The company was helpful and offered to refund my money.The French and German essays that I wanted translated were ones that I had read and made notes on several years ago , and I wanted translations for my files . In the time that it has taken to straighten out the computer problems , I could have re-read much of this material ! L & H can not refund time .
 I certainly had high hopes because my company had a much earlier version . But , after receiving it , I had a list of problems including the biggest reason I ordered it , I needed to translate excel spreadsheets without losing the format . I was assured this would happen and it does not . Then , after making numerous calls , emails , and faxes , I have received NO response whatsoever . You may have to pay more for a similar product but I assure you , you will be much happier and that makes it worth it .
 This thing dont even work good , save your time and money buy a good dictionary .
 This software is intended for people with very poor learning skills . This is the impression that I have gotten after launching the program and listening to the 9 audio CD 's that are included in the set . The narrator has an unbearably cheesy voice -LRB- I call it `` the commercial voice '' -RRB- It makes it very painful to listen to CD 's . The producer stretched very little vocabulary on 12 discs to suck money out of unaware person . Poorly structured and too little information on too many CD 's . Waste of money ! The pace of the software is even offensive . Seems like they consider you an idiot with 0 IQ points . Strongly discourage anyone from buying it .
 I 've had this tablet for a week and have n't used it yet ! After opening the box there was a red tag stating that if I had Windows ME I needed to go the kb gear website to download the driver . The website did n't have the driver . The customer support # was a personals hotline . AND there was no answer from the 5 emails sent to kb gear . I got this on clearancedog website at a low price . I guess it is as they say , `` you get what you pay for '' .
 I was so excited when my Pablo Internet Edition arrived . My excitement quickly died when I discovered it is not compatible with Windows XP . I 've written customer service hoping to be able to download the latest driver , but to no avail ...
 my friend and I both purchased the Pablo Internet Edition from kbgear and the software has a virus called w95.cih.remnants that infects all . exe files and the virus is considered rare to get . and now of course we can not get in touch with kbgear , none of the 800 # 's work , nor does the internet address , so until someone rectifies my problem , i would not recommend this product to anyone !!!!! i must say that if i was n't having this problem and all was working well i would probably give it a great rating , but how will i ever know .
 I 'm a computer programmer so I know what I 'm talking about . I found a site w/drivers that would indeed install in Windows XP . I installed the drivers and plugged it in . XP did a great job of recognizing the tablet as a Human Interface Device but that 's where my success ended . This tablet does n't in any application , not even Windows XP!Unless you 're using an outdated 98 or ME machine , stay far away from this product !
 I purchased this product in November 2001 . The only part of the software package that was usable was the Adobe Photoshop 5.0 LE . Then I became even more disappointed when I tried to find the KB Gear website . It 's owned by someone else who apparently has no interest in the product or its being updated . Also called the 800 number and it came up disconnected ! GOOD LUCK !
 Do n't buy this pad . KB Gear went out of business and driver files are not available for Windows ME , 2002 , and XP . If you do want this pad anyway , contact me at tmilleroftexas@hotmail.com and I 'll sell the ones I have for -LSB- cheap -RSB- each .
 Unlike other people , I did n't run into problems installing it ... however , I could n't get the pressure sensitivity to work , so in a graphics program -LRB- Paint Shop Pro 7 -RRB- I could n't get it to vary the line thickness , density & c ; -LRB- and yes , I did check the settings in PSP -RRB- . Also , the ergonomics of the pen are horrible
 Do n't be a dummy like me , and order this product if you have Windows NT . -LRB- That rhymes by the way -RRB- .
 All the reviews and comments on this product have been wonderful . The only problem is that I 'm running Windows 2000 and for some strange reason this is the only Windows platform currently not supported.Someone else had commented on this and noted that they were able to get it to work . But , unfortunately , it appears that that person 's review has been removed from Amazon.com . If someone out there can help , that would be awesome because the manufacturer 's customer support line has been less than helpful .
 Unless you are buying this for the software package included , I 'd suggest paying the extra money and get the real thing , Wacom . The Pablo manual is useless , the web site nearly so , the 1-800 # is disconnected and the tech support appears to be an email address only -LRB- no response , at all -RRB- . On the other hand , this older version of Photoshop has some of the most useful tools for beginning to intermediate graphic artists , a good trade off between tools and price . This ` starving artist ' could n't scrape together the major amount of cash for the most current Photoshop graphics suite , but I think I 'm going to have to start saving my pennies for a graphics tablet that actually works .
 Try getting tech support for this . Just visit IBM 's site for an eye-opener . Even for a brand new product -- out of the box -- there is no personal tech support -- only tech notes . I am an experienced computer user and programmer and could n't get this program to work .
 THIS SCREENSAVER IS TERRIBLE . IT PAUSES AND JERKS AROUND . VERY ANNOYING . I EMAILED THE COMPANY AND NEVER HEARD FROM THEM . I DONT USE IT AND I DONT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY . THANK YOU
 This is a useless program . I have had to exchange it 3 times and it still does n't work . Very user unfriendly and frustrating . Definitely do not recommend purchasing it unless you want hours of frustration .
 I emailed the developers of Card Studio last year , and the response I got was ... due to the low demand of Card Studio for Mac users , it would not be cost effective to develop such a program for Macintosh.After reading through various Mac forums , I beg to differ.Some Mac users are always looking for this type of program.I have always been an avid user of Card Studio Deluxe for my pc , but would not hesitate to purchase a Mac version , as I use my Mac exclusively for graphics.I can not rate the 2005 version of Card Studio because I have not yet purchased it , thus the 1 star rating .
 Ok ; First I have to inform you that I am not the primary user of Hallmark Card Studio -LRB- HCS -RRB- -LRB- I 'm not even the secondary user . . -RRB- , my wife is . However when things do n't perform on the computer as expected I 'm the ` fortunate ' one who fixes the problem , so I feel that I 've got a good handle on the software in comparison to others.The good points about HCS are the excellent quality of the included graphics and somewhat in the ease of use . That sums up the good points . The issues that I feel break this program are the lack of options for printout and the poor to medium quality of the printouts , this in relationship to image alignment on the paper . In all cases my spouse was dissatisfied with the results . This is in respect to the ` four-fold ' types of cards . Note that I feel the same way and would not consider sending the results to a friend.In regard to this take a look at the following two programs that also make cards , the first being CREATING KEEPSAKES SCRAPBOOK DESIGNER DELUXE -LRB- Surprise ! -RRB- . This program has impressed my spouse for its flexibility in creating cards in addition to scrapbook pages . Printout is as close to perfectly aligned on a page as you could expect . Graphics look better also although importing an image is not as intuitive as the other programs but not hard -LRB- just search for ` IMPORT ' in the help file -RRB- . Note that this program does not have the fantastic images that HCS does but there 's an answer to that I 'll address later.The second program is GREETING CARD FACTORY 4.0 Deluxe by Nova Development . Another good program with good printout , lots of graphics , but again not the quality of the graphic images included with HCS.I recommend looking at these two options BUT if you must have the quality graphics that HCS has , I believe that you can export JPG images of HCS graphics and simply import them into the others as needed . It 's not the coolest way to make a great looking card , but for those who have already purchased HCS , it fixes all your woes.Courtney
 I am using Hallmark card studio 2005 not the deluxe version . Maybe that would be better but this version is extremely limited to what you can do as far as the cards are concerned and their clip art leaves much to be desired . Prior to this I had Amercian Greetings Createacard platinum 8 and was in love with the flexability and ease of creating and found their clip art endless and wonderful . The disk I used just stopped working for me and I could not find an updated version so thought the good name of Hallmark would be better . Big mistake would not recommend the Hallmark version . I am only interested in making cards so do n't care to pay for alot of things I do not use as in some of these programs . Sorry Hallmark but very disappointed.sandy
 The third disc does n't talk to the computer so I wait and get a message not responding . I call the software company . The gentleman said just send it back and they will send a new one . I took it to the postoffice and it cost me 1.74 and a jewelcase to send it back . I sent it March and got one back in May . Now I go through the job of uninstalling the first two disc because by it self no program came up to install it . I started reinstalling the software from the beginning and what do you know the third disc was n't responding again . Now what do I do . This is expensive software but how many times do you keep sending back the 3rd disc and it still does n't work .
 I have spent hours emailing , talking to , and having online tech support with Hallmark and HP . HP went beyond the call of duty to help me , but to no avail . They helped me download a patch and Hallmark directed me to another site to download a patch . I was told by HP that the problem is with the install shield . So far nothing has worked and I am left with no choice but to return the program . I was really looking forward to using the program . I have made great cards and projects with an older version .
 Purchased the Hallmark Card Studio `` 005 Deluxe while visiting relations in California last year . Ordered in USA and so far have been sent 2 copies of this disc but does not work - shows up print preview and there is nothing on the preview and unable to print any cards - friends have also tried it and have been sent it twice and still have the discs unused - Unable to contact anyone and phone number given was hopeless kept hanging on and left message and did n't hear anything - can anyone help with an address - very frustrating as it cost a lot of money and my previous 3 editions all worked perfectly.Liz - Scotland
 I purchased this before it came out and had trouble installing . Sierra was able to walk me through the installion . I was able to use it for a few and all of sudden could n't open it . The first disc would install in C drive , but the other two discs would n't . So now I am totally disgusted with it . The other Card Studios never were any trouble .
 Got this for my Dad and he liked it at first . But it keeps choking and will not run . I 've tried to uninstall/reinstall many many times -- this worked once but no longer . Program just fails to load and stops responding . When it did work we could not get the card images to align properly on standard non-Hallmark cardstock . I 'm looking for a replacement program but will STAY AWAY from Sierra/Hallmark programs ! Even the latest versions have been reported to have similar problems .
 I purchased this Greeting Card software to replace a treasured program that does not run on my new computer . The software failed to install and several long-long calls to `` Customer Support '' failed to help . They were difficult to reach and not very helpful . Finally after many struggles , I was asked to send them the first disk . I sent it . No response in 10 days . I fanally began calling again and on the third try got a response . That response ? `` We are back ordered at least three weeks on those disks . '' Extremely disappointing . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 Ca n't do a typical install . Getting error messages . Can only preform compact install which I then have to insert a requested disc to open and personalize a card . Ca n't print as the print preview wo n't show card.Hallmark Card Studio 2005 Deluxe
 Only buy this product if you want an awkward program . I have used Street Atlas from an early version . I bought the `` Deluxe '' version as soon as it came out . It 's the precursor to SA2006 . I test drove `` Deluxe '' for a couple of weeks and got VERY frustrated . In my area , the Deluxe maps were more outdated than good old SA8 - hard to believe but true . Functionality is VERY difficult . I run a laptop with GPS and find it too difficult to both drive and use the newest Street Atlas products . It needs too much `` mousework '' . My recommended solutions.a -RRB- Get hold of an old SA8 or earlier version and check routes before you drive against maps.google.comb -RRB- Use Microsoft 's Streets & Trips. ; Much better search engine . MUCH easier to use -LRB- intuitive for all Windows users -RRB- . Driving speed/distance seems more accurate . Routes are generally better . And as a bonus , the maps include Canada .
 I chucked it and went back to 8.0 . 2006 was the most confusing , junked up interface I 'd ever seen .
 cant install it under windows without going to user groups and looking through complaints to find out how to install it correctly . It 's not the best design , it 's very slow and crashes . Do yourself a favor , get borland jbuilder5
 As of 30 Nov Garmin released a version 7 . Make sure you get version 7 if you 're interested in this product . Check the Garmin.com site for the latest versions of their products .
 This product Was very good . It is now way out of date . Version 9 is the current version . This is two versions behind and does not have eastern Europe as the new versions have . Great product but of little use now .
 I was * very * enthusiastic about buying and using this software in the beginning , but after using it for a couple of months find this software to be terribly lacking in many respects.I am now well into the third unit -LRB- more than 20 lessons -RRB- and still have not learned how to say `` hello . '' They 've got the right approach in terms of methodology , but the material seems to have been lazily put together and fails to take into account so many obvious essentials that I wonder if the program was even designed by a competent linguist.Do I really need to know how to say , `` violet hat , '' `` the bananas are in the basket , '' `` the window is round , '' or `` the man , woman and baby are sitting on the tractor '' before I 've even learned to say `` hello '' ? The program abounds with impractical and even absurd phrases you would n't even use in the English language . When teaching a concept , why not use everyday language and objects ? When will the boys and girls ever be standing on the table in your world ? Or the man and woman standing on the wall ??? I 've skipped ahead and have n't uncovered any conversational material at all.All too often , they 'll dive right in with complex sentences composed almost entirely of words you have n't yet learned . Or you 'll answer incorrectly because it 's painfully unclear what concept is being taught . Again , this is just sloppy development . A bright native English speaker wo n't have too much trouble figuring out words and phrases in Romance languages , and the sentence structures are similar as well . Not so with Russian.And where 's Russia ? There is no culturally specific material -LRB- I am willing to bet that all language versions of this software use the exact same pictures and have simply been translated -RRB- . How about getting around on the Moscow subway system ? What about the dishes you 'll find in a Russian restaurant ? Russian regions , names , holidays and traditions?Of particular importance is that nearly all consumers of this product must learn to use the Cyrillic script , and there is nothing in the software to specifically accommodate this . Of course you will pick it up eventually -- and imperfectly -- by time-wasting , motivation-killing trial and error by the time you have gone through several units -LRB- dozens of lessons -RRB- . It would make far more sense to include a component for learning the alphabet and rules of spelling from the outset . You 'd learn the language faster that way . As it stands , you merely have the option of typing the lesson 's words and phrases in Cyrillic . This will prove terribly frustrating when you have yet to learn any of the letters , with the consequence that you will be much farther ahead in speaking and pronunciation than writing for many units into the course . It would be a simple matter to include an alphabet and spelling module , but they do n't bother.And the * entire * index -LRB- approx . 100 lessons -RRB- is in Russian ! They did n't bother to translate `` counting , '' `` parts of the body , '' `` colors , '' `` past tense , '' etc. into English . If you want to go back to the lesson on counting , you 'd better write the unit and lesson number down , otherwise it will become lost in a sea of Russian-language grammatical terms that you will certainly never learn with this very software.The software medium lends itself to tremendous possibilities for language learning , and ideally if you 're purchasing software -LRB- and paying hundreds of dollars for it -RRB- there would be no need to buy anything else but a dictionary to get you well beyond the intermediate level . It would include all sorts of maps , short dialogues , games , and interactive features . I can only use this software as an adjunct to the other materials I 'm accumulating -- online Cyrillic alphabet and verb tutorials , flash cards , and additional books and CDs such as Teach Yourself Instant Russian , a crash course in just what 's missing from Rosetta Stone Russian.I was initially going to give this product a two-star rating . But the cost of this software increases the degree of dissatisfaction . I am aware of the tremendous ad campaign Rosetta Stone has undertaken , doubtless with a concomitant increase in sales . If the company was new and unknown , I 'd be more forgiving of the lazy template they 've used . But the company has been around awhile and is obviously successful , yet has not bothered to make improvements and tailor the software to the particular language it is supposed to teach , in its cultural context.I 'm no linguist , but I am an avid language hobbyist and experience on a daily basis the truism that if the language you 're learning does n't allow you to communicate , then it is simply worthless .
 This product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs . The tech support emailed that any CD or DVD copy software had to be removed . I guess that sort of makes a DVD or CD R/W drive rather pointless . I removed the copy software and still have bad results . About 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it . Maybe it does n't like my corporate virus protection . I find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky . I rate this product as totally useless .
 Supposively this was suposed to be the best language learning product out on the market . Yes it was n't that hard to learn the words , but after finishing it I only knew how to stay stuff like the man eats or dances , or the flowers are blue . Nothing really practical . It 's not like I 'm going to go up to someone and German and say , `` Der Mann isst '' -LRB- the man eats -RRB- After this program I di n't even know how to say I like ... or I would like ... to eat . Plus Rosetta Stone does n't have any translations at all , and even though i believe vocab is much more important then grammar , it does n't even teach you any fundemental grammar.Basically you can buy a language book for $ 20 that will teach you a lot more german than this.Ja , ihr kauft nicht Rosetta Stone . -LRB- I did n't learn that from Rosetta Stone -RRB-
 All in all this program is n't bad but it does n't seem to have anything on grammar . Without learning the grammar of a language it is almost pointless to learn it because you will sound like a fool to someone who knows the language . The only other program I have tried is French NOW by Transparent Language which is just as good as this program , has grammar turtorials , and is much more affordable .
 Before you pay a bundle for this product , check your local library . My library cooperative , in Hillsborough County , Florida , owns a licence for the whole shebang , every language and every level . Maybe yours does too
 I ordered this product on November 28 , for my son for Christmas . It never arrived and this person would not even respond to my E-Mails . On December 24 , I had to find another gift so he would have a gift at Christmas.I will NEVER order anything from them again .
 This is a good program and method overall but the price is just too high in my opinion . I would recomend taking a look at Spanish Now by Transparent Language which is also has a good method and a very good program but much more affordable .

 Rosetta Stone was the first Spanish language program that I had tried . -LRB- I have previously studied French , Latin , and ancient Greek . -RRB- I ordered it from the company directly but returned it after about a month . It has some interesting unique features but it was not for me.Here are the positives :1 . The pictures are colorful and memorable and will help you learn many words quickly .2 . There is an interesting effective feature which allows you to listen to a word or phrase in Spanish , record your voice , and playback . Then a scale tells you how close your voice came to that of a native speaker . But I would not spend extensive time repeating the same word or phrase because it is very difficult to meet their standard for `` native speaker . `` These are the negatives :1 . There is a great emphasis on sentences that are not practical for an adult tourist , business person , or employee wanting to speak Spanish with native speakers . In addition , most of the sentences have verbs in the present progressive tense ; there is not enough practice in all the Spanish verb tenses . There are many sentences in Spanish about boys under the table , girls walking , women waving , and men falling .2 . Because I work at a computer all day at work , I am not motiviated to sit at a computer for long during my spare time.Because I am eager to learn useful Spanish quickly , Pimsleur is more effective for me . I can listen to the CDs in my car or at home . In addition , I have learned more sentences that I may want to use such as how to find a bathroom , restaurant , or pharmacy ; or how to order food.Rosetta Stone may be a good program for a child who likes to use the computer or an individual who has never studied Romance languages before .
 I really wanted to like this product . I think it can be a helpful supplement to learning Spanish . Unfortunately it is priced as a premium , comprehensive learning product , which it is not.I think you can learn a lot of vocabulary with this product , but there are numerous issues :1 -RRB- The voice recognition is temperamental . I had to use three different microphones until I found one that generated scoring above the bottom . The cheapest microphone I owned worked best for some reason . I am sure there are some tips to resolve this problem which I experienced on two different computers , but the documentation that comes with Rosetta Stone is n't that helpful .2 -RRB- Do n't even try to use Rosetta Stone on a laptop as you will have to listen to the constant whirl of the cd drive . This is much less noticeable on a desk top where the CD player is n't right under the keyboard . Also , because of the constant accessing of the drive , the software feels sluggish .3 -RRB- You can input your name , but there is no point to it . The software does n't do anything interesting to capture and save your performance . You would think this expensive high-end product would analyze your performance and customize the experience to emphasize where you are week . If it is obvious that , based on response time and percentage correct that you know a particular word well , the program should focus you on where you are weak . There is n't even a way to track your progress and I had to create an Excel spreadsheet to remember which exercises I had completed . For the price , the software is n't that smart . If the experience was customized based on performance , the product would n't feel so dreadfully repetitive at times.Rosetta Stone may be a reasonable choice for students of a less accessible language . With so many options to learn Spanish , however , Rosetta Stone is not price competitive for the value delivered.UPDATE
 For those who have never been able to learn a foriegn language this might work . It 's tediously repetitive , introducing material at such a slow rate that even the most mentally challenged should find is easy going . Perhaps this explains its popularity in the State Department.The pace of the course is so slow though that anyone trying to use this to learn a language at a reasonably rapid rate is going to find it little more than frustrating . After a few hours you will finally be able to put together sentence like ` The men are dancing . ' That 's absurd . Adults dont ` NEED to learn languages like children do . We can learn them much more quickly and more efficiently.All of the exercises provide the user with crutches . One is never forced to come up with the phrase in a foriegn language . One merely has to choose from among those provided . The written exercises are merely dictation . The accent reduction exercises are really exercises in pure mimicry . In short the software is very low-powered . There is no fancy AI here . It 's really very crude.At this price the quality is simply not adequate.So that reduces the demographic for this product to mentally challenged individuals with a great deal of liesure time , and a great deal of money . If you fit into that category , you might give this a try . Otherwise find something faster , cheaper , better .
 I am not at all happy with this product . The instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive . It was a total waste of my money and time .
 Unfortunately this course uses the present progressive tense throughout , where as in real life , the present indicative is usually the tense most commonly used . The present progressive tense indicates that the action is in progress right now , e.g. I am eating -LRB- now -RRB- , He is jumping -LRB- now -RRB- . In Spanish the present progressive tense is quite restricted and is usually limited to what a person is doing RIGHT NOW . The present progressive is formed by conjuagting the appropriate ending of one verb , the verb estar , and adding the gerund of the appropritate verb . Some examples from the course might be
 This course is completely useless as a standalone course . It is supposed to take you from beginner to intermediate level , but you will learn very little that you can use in the real world.At the end of the course you will learn how to ask for directions , but nowhere in the course are you even taught how to say basic conversational words such as hello , goodbye , please , thankyou etc. . For a course costing almost $ 200 , that 's pretty bad!Even worse , almost all of the verbs taught in the course are in the present progressive tense - a tense that is almost never used in Spanish . Worse still , there are no present tense examples of any of these verbs , so you will not be able to use them in the real world !
 Too much money for too little results . There is no grounding done up front so you have no idea how to string together the words you are learning . I had to refer to a translation service to understand what the often repeated articles were . If there were a key you could hit to get a english translation it would allow you to get a better idea of how all the Spanish words work together.It gets boring really fast too!Don ' t waste your money , try Destinos off the internet for FREE .
 This may be a good database program but I ca n't tell due to the truly awful instructions . They talk all about how to use a data base once it is constructed but how to actually create the layouts and instructions is just not covered in the provided manuals , online help or PDF file . You will have to spend hours trying to analyze the provided example files as to how to actually do things . The most basic explanation of how steps and procedure actually work or what is required is just not there.The on line help is filled with jargon and confusing explanations . Some times the terms used will change within the explanation with no warning leading to more confusion . A typical example is in the developers manual on page 12 which explains how to copy a script . Problem is when it gets to the click on copy part , there is no copy option on the screen . I guess they just forgot to include it in the actual program . This is just one of many examples I have encountered . I doubt they ever had outside users actually try to use the program so they could understand what instructions were needed.If you want to create your own system , not use one of the templets provided , then plan on many hours trying to understand how the basic nuts and bolts work . It will be mostly trial and error . And consider it necessary to purchase outside books and video tutorials . Considering I taught myself to program in assembly language in the early days and made a good living doing so and that I have learned programs such as SolidWorks parametric modeling I dont think the problem is on my end .
 This is a fine product until you upgrade past a version that uses a different file format . Then , very little will work . The company does n't tend to write very good utilities that upgrades from one file format to another . For example , version 5 to 6 was a disaster . we had to rewrite everything . You could n't just upgrade .
 I paid the company almost $ 200 for a downloadable upgrade to version 8.5 . When I downloaded it , the disk image file downloaded fine and opened into a nice CD icon . But after that , bupkus . Double clicking did NOT launch an installer , just a windoow of the file contents . Double clicking the -LRB- supposed -RRB- application file did nothing but launch an incomprehensible script window of some sort . Tried to change the file name to add a . pkg or . app extension , but no dice , locked and ca n't change it . Even went so far as to use disk utility to make a new . dmg image from the mounted cd-icon , made it read-write , then changed the file name , still no installation . Then tried to submit an e-mail help request using their web page , got all the way thru the e-mail , then got a message saying sorry we only do phone support for this . Phone support of course is only during `` business '' hours . I used to think the product was good , but their customer support STINKS .
 Ca n't really review it because AAA Liquidators never sent it to me . Nor did they send it to nearly 100 other people they ripped off .
 I never received my product nor receive any response to my e-mails to Reduction Mart . I hope that Amazon will reimburse me in some way .
 I was very disappointed in this product . Other products allow automatic fit to cd 's from an outside photo . This product is much too difficult to use and comes with no directions . The online help just is n't adequate to do what you need to do .
 Just a friendly warning
 If Max 6.0 worked as well as previous versions the upgrade would be worth $ 100 's more ... . but ... Simple things such as e-mailing multiple contacts at one time are now seemingly impossible , though easily accomplished in earlier versions . Bugs galore and by the way , these are new bugs overwriting tried and true software . But then again , I guess that helps support the $ 45 charge per tech support call . Note - you can not e-mail tech support from the Multisoft website ... hmmmmm.I removed 6.0 and reloaded 5.0 so that I can get some work done ... still waiting to get my money back.BTW - I still have my copies of 1.0 , 1.2 , 3.0 , 97is & 5.0
 I found this product to be full of bugs and workarounds . In my mind any product that you have to pay for support you should be weary of . I also ca n't understand why we the end users are forced to make edits to our regisrty to get their product to work . Just my .02
 Having used Maximizer for several years , I bought 6.0 because the people at Multiactive sold me on the MaxAction project scheduler . You design a series of tasks and assign the track to a person , then your hotlist tracks which task to do when . Problem is 1 . It tracks some tasks without associating them to the person so you know you 're supposed to call someone , you just do n't know who . 2 . Tech support says no one ever uses MaxAction so they know nothing about how it works . 3 . There is no documentation in the online help , the website , or the manual on MaxAction and how to use it . But they 'll be happy to take your money for support and then tell you they ca n't help you , but thanks for paying anyway . This was a good product once and I do n't know how others are , but I 'd look into Act or Goldmine or Telemagic before I 'd go anywhere near Maximizer . Even if parts of it work fine , the lack of support and lack of respect for their customers should convince anyone to run ... FAST !
 We had an extremely bad experience with this company . During the sales presentation `` guarantees '' were made about how their software would perform and when we received the software , more than half the functionality they promised did n't exist - most importantly their Importing Contact data from ACT and other databases did n't work at all like promised or as stated on their website . When we tried to contact them to let them know we had a problem no one would call us back . They have the worst customer service we 've had ever dealt with . We tried to return the software and we were told that they have a no return policy that we were never informed of . They take your money and run ! They do not stand by their product at all and they mislead you on functionality of the product ! Be afraid - be very afraid !
 When a software vendor suggests that after spending however much money on their software , that you then spend $ 1000.00 more for a year of tech support `` BECAUSE YOU 'LL NEED IT '' , you know you 're looking at trouble . This is what was said to a couple people I work with . -LRB- they did not purchase support -RRB- I had a couple users call & ask me to help them set up Maximizer 6 in a `` networked '' configuration , so they could share the same database . Went to Multiactive 's website for help , as my -LRB- computer-illiterate -RRB- users are in another city , and I had never seen or used Maximizer . Multiactive 's `` knowledge base '' -LRB- if you can call it that -RRB- was essentially worthless . Called their tech-support line , and was informed by a recorded voice that the call would likely cost $ 200 -LRB- !!! -RRB- UNLESS all I needed help with was installing the product on a single computer & getting it running.Maybe I 'm wrong ... but $ 200 for a SINGLE tech support call is ridiculous . Being told by the software vendor that YOU WILL NEED $ 1000 worth of tech support almost immediately is even worse !
 We had an extremely bad experience with this company . During the sales presentation `` guarantees '' were made about how their software would perform and when we received the software , more than half the functionality they promised did n't exist - most importantly their Importing Contact data from ACT and other databases did n't work at all like promised or as stated on their website . When we tried to contact them to let them know we had a problem no one would call us back . They have the worst customer service we 've had ever dealt with . We tried to return the software and we were told that they have a no return policy that we were never informed of . They take your money and run ! They do not stand by their product at all and they mislead you on functionality of the product ! Be afraid - be very afraid !
 Having successfully learned a few other languages in the classroom , abroad , and through traditional self-study , I was intrigued by what I read about the Rosetta Stone method . I 'd already had an introduction to Chinese by starting the `` Teach Yourself '' series , and picking up some tips from a couple of Chinese friends , so had a few grammatical concepts under my belt before starting Rosetta Stone -LRB- RS -RRB- . But I still found it difficult to figure out what a particular lesson was trying to teach me in RS , and what individual phrases were supposed to mean . Referring to the version of another language I know well helped me to understand the Chinese , but this is time-consuming and could be remedied by some kind of online help.Initially I enjoyed the challenge of this course , but after a while it becomes fatiguing . I feel like a pigeon earning a pellet for each correct mouse-click in a psychological experiment . Sometimes I choose the correct matching phrase because I know it 's supposed to be the longest phrase in the group -LRB- for example -RRB- , not because I know what it means . RS could be useful if you have access to a very patient tutor , but home alone I find I have too many questions about what is being said to make decent progress . I do n't believe what they advertise , that this is the `` fastest '' method for learning a language . It could make a useful supplement to some other course . And if you want to learn how to write Chinese characters , you 'll have to go elsewhere .
 The computer based speech recognition is fantastic and makes duplicating the nuances of the chinese language easier . But the fact that the computer system and accompaning texts give you no , absolutely no , english translation is the stupidest mistake ever made by a teaching system . Rosetta says it interferes with the `` full emersion '' system of learning . They forget that full emersion is when you go live in the community and can constantly receive feedback on sentence structure , meaning and tense.For instance , the standard Rosetta first lesson show a picture of a girl and a spoken phrase in chinese to match the picture . You can also see the picture and a chinese character phrase or pinyin english phrase . But nowhere is there an english translation of the phrase you are learning . So you do not know from just seeing a picture of a girl whether you are saying , `` this is a girl '' , `` a girl '' , `` girl '' , `` I am a girl '' , or `` you are a girl '' . My chinese speaking friends had to explain to me the phrase meant girl in the singular form and that the singular form was typical for all `` feminine '' objects.I have called Rosetta and there is no english translation available when it would only cost them cents to reproduce . Do not buy this system unless you have a chinese tutor available to you .
 Had I known then what I know now , I would have never bought this , at least not now.The software is in phoenetic mandarin -LRB- pinyin -RRB- which is n't helpful in understanding what you are saying . Unless you have a basic understanding of chinese you will learn chinese with no context and therefore not be able to use a word of it -LRB- or sentence of it -- we do n't know what we 're learning , so how can we use it ? -RRB- . My son and I are learning it together and though he 's a stud at it , even he ca n't figure out the meaning of what we are saying.A big disappoint given the hefty price . I thought Rosetta Stone 's expertise would deliver a useful product , but alas , the beautiful diction of the speakers is about the only upside ...
 My daughter was a veteran of Disney 's Magic Artist Classic and the current Disney 's Magic Artist . She unfortunately had problems with this program and the problem is translating the user-interface into something kids can understand . The 2D versions of Magic Artist followed the lead of programs like Kai 's Power Tools by using image metaphors for the tools . Want to spray-paint your canvass ? Pick up a can of spray paint . Want to have a crayon-like texture ? Pick up a crayon . Alas , there are no metaphors which work well in 3D artistry so the buttons and tools in this program are not immediately intuitive . You REALLY have to read the manual to understand how to use the program . 3D Artist is also a bit of a resource hog . Even with 128MB of RAM , the program will stop us in the middle of a creation to tell us that we 've run out of memory -LRB- Yikes ! -RRB- . You can also add only 1 color and 1 texture to each element of an object . You can color Mickey 's head and his nose but you ca n't paint eyes on him or draw his face-mask . Animation of objects is also limited to a few sets of actions -LRB- spinning , hopping , zig-zagging , etc. -RRB- . I should note that my daughter and I managed to deal with these problems and limitations because I 've done 3D PC art before . My advice to you is to wait until Disney Interactive comes out with version 2 of this program .
 After installing this software , an error occured . After about 2 hours of searching Disney 's website for some answers , the best they could come up with was `` return it for a refund '' . Apparently , this software does n't work with certain sound cards and video cards . The website of course could n't tell you which ones . What major disappointment . My children were so excited to make Mickey and I had to explain to them that there was no way to make it work . Thanks for nothing Disney .
 Like many of the previous reviewers , this software is interesting but not worth the money . After playing with it for alittle while , you 'll want to move on . I accidentally bought it thinking it was Magic Artist Classic or Magic Artist Studio -LRB- which I still plan to get -RRB- . Like someone else wrote , wait until they come out with a future version -LRB- # 2 or # 3 ... -RRB- .
 When you are in the store and you see this software ... IGNORE IT ! It is so limited . The box says you can draw a 3D object , but that object turns out to be a wall about one inch thick . Also , it does not allow you to layer the things you draw . The only semi-cool thing you can do is create a mickey mouse that has no eyes or fingers . This product is really for kids at the age of six or below . So if you go out thinking that you are getting a good deal for 3D animation/drawing tools , you are way off . All in all , on a scale from one to five , I give it a negative five , but that was not a choice in the ratings so I had to pick one . So in conclusion , IT STINKS LIKE ROTTON EGGS !
 You would expect a lot more from Disney , especially for the price . This software is horrible . You ca n't change much and is VERY limited in what it can do . Huge dissapointment for my child . Dont waste your money .
 You learn the language through immersion . The software immediately presents you with a set of pictures , along with their japanese text and pronounciation , and you have to match the text with the pictures . The text are available in romanji , kana , and kanji . There are no english explanations at all.First , if you 're serious about learning japanese , you have to learn how to read and write kana , and this product gives you nothing in terms of learning kana/kanji . If you leave the text set at kana or kanji , you will be hopelessly lost . If you set the text at romanji , you will be looking at the romanized version of the japanese text , which is useless because you wo n't see romanji anywhere in Tokyo.Second , you can pretty much guess at the right answer by process of elimination . The software is n't `` smart '' enough to deduce that you 've actually understood the images presented to you . Also , some of the images are ambiguous . It 's possible that you misinterpret the picture and end up with the wrong definition.Third , this software is horribly slow . You will learn very little after hours of use , and in the end , you will have little or no grammatical knowledge at all.Given the price of this product , I do not recommend it at all . I suggest you spend your money on the Pimsleur series . They are also expensive , but they will give you a solid foundation to speaking japanese properly . I suggest buying the Japanese for Busy people Kana workbook for learning Kana .
 This is a well meaning program that will leave you with nothing but doubt and unanswered questions.Fairfield uses a `` picture to words to sound '' method for teaching different languages . This is an excellent way to teach a language . It lets the user hear proper pronunciation while seeing the proper spelling -LRB- romanized or japanese -RRB- for the word . They also slap a picture of the subject so you can achieve a visual connection with the word or words mentioned . That 's it , and thats where lies the problem . There is no confirmation in English to what you just learned . This leads to doubt because you do n't know if the picture matches the word 100 % . You cant make the vital connection between the Japanese word and the English one . To make matters worse not all the picture are crystal clear as to what is being refered to . Anyone who has studied Japanese knows what a difficult language it is to grasp and Fairfield thinks that you can just jump into it with this poorly thought out program . I do n't know how well this method works in other languages but it fails in Japanese without that English reasurance . So in closing :1 . Dont be fooled by the `` impressive '' list of users of this program .2 . The poor structure of this program will leave you confused and reaching for your dictionary more than you 'll be able to stand .3 . The price of this software package is ridiculous for what you get . It does n't make $ en $ e.
 The Torah Codes 2000 came without instructions , and I was unable to do some the research that it claimed I could do . My followup with manufacturers for assistance was equally poor . The only prediction guaranteed with this product is that you 'll be wasting your money .
 I have this and was checking it out only to find it not up to date . I was checking addresses and I am not even listed in it . I have kived at this address for 2 years and not listed . But yet it is the 2001 version.I planned on using it to notify people and businesses of a new ceiling service I now provide but how many notices will I get back because either the people have moved or the businesses have closed within the past couple years .
 I was using Photodeluxe Buisness Edition and liked it but also wanted to try something else ... Because Photoimpact had received such good reviews I bought it . It is far from user friendly/intuitive for the beginner . Do n't waste your money ! The manual is n't much help either . I 'm going back to Adobe which I now really appreciate !
 I have used several programs like adobe photo delux and photoshop and microsoft programs . Although some like photoshop are difficult to use , at least they do work and with some studying and lots of practace they are useable and much can be done with them . I deceided to try photo impact based on the reviews and its reputation . Unfortunately I can not agree with those . I have found this program useless as I cant even down load pictures from my digital camera using this program . The manual is not very good and doesnt explain what to do if you cant get something to work . I have asked an expert with a degree in computer science and is very familiar with digital photography for help with this and they could not help much . On their advice I will throw this oprogram out and chalk it up to a bad investment.I would like to write a good review , but I think that something as bad as this one is , it should be known just what this program is like so others may not have the experience that I had .
 This program is awful ! You want a little button with an apple attached to it ? Buy this ... Otherwise PSP is for you . I bought this and had to return it , I 've never done that before . I admit it takes time for PSP , but PhotoImpact takes time to get something that dose n't like you used the original PC to make it . DO N'T BUY THIS , save your time .
 I bought this product with the intent of analyzing certain industry sectors . Unfortunately , information from the CD can not be downloaded into a database for cross-referencing . The first response to my call to the manufacturer was `` Where did you get this number ? '' I was later told that I needed to buy the Deluxe version .
 If you are planning to use this for mass marketing , be aware that you are limited in the number of contacts that you can export . After that , you must pay the company again.For mass marketers , this is a very useful tool . However , the methods this company uses to promote itself and it 's products are surprisingly shady .
 This company borders on deceptive practices when describing their software products . If you are wanting to use this product for mailing lists , be aware that you are limited in the number of listings you can export , then you must purchase more.I 'd say the service that this company provides is invaluable to mass marketer 's , but the way they promote themselves and their software products is surprisingly shady .
 AFTER YOU BUY THIS SOFTWARE YOU ARE THEN REQUIRED TO PAY EXTRA TO USE IT . THE OTHER SIMILAR SOFTWARE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM .
 I was told by InfoUSA staff that this was the replacement for 88 Million Households . When the CD arrived I found that it did not have the capability of searching by address . This was a big disappointment since that was my only way of utilizing this product to reach my goal . Also the constant windows with advertising from InfoUSA are an annoyance . I would not recommend this product to anyone needing to locate mass amounts of information or access to info by address search . It only searches by name or phone number .
 It is not very user friendly and you have to pay extra money to get the information you really want to get from purchasing it . It is pretty useless actually save for in a couple areas . I would not purchase it .
 After purchasing this program , I found out you can only print , copy or export two thousand records from the database before the program requires you to pay more money for more records . This program has more bugs than any other program I 've ever used . It hangs just about every time I use it and it is slow . The program also has no import features to speed data entry . Over all I would say I wasted money on this program because I can get the same data off the Internet for free , and just as quickly .
 This is another terrible product by InfoUsa . For a small business trying to extract information for mailing lists it 's a waste of time and money . It 's even worse than SelectPhone , which used to be a terrific software package . You ca n't extract more than 1000 names at a time , it 's hard to use , nothing is co-ordinated for the user . They lie on their promotion and packaging . Nothing works . Do n't waste money on ProCD either . I 'm trying to find a software program like this that actually works
 this is my fourth time baying phonedisc this time it is very slow . they are very greedy they dont allow enough printing because of this i do n't recommend it .

 I got this software thinking that , like most mapping software , it would allow me to print directions between two points . It does not . The maps are adequate but the number of features and the ease of use are pretty terrible .
 This product 's About page states that map data is from 1998 , but their information was out of date even then . Let 's take their map of Seattle , the city I know best .1 -RRB- Interstate 90 is shown as being a surface freeway for its entire length , with on - and off-ramps at Martin Luther King Way and 35th Ave. S. To begin with , it never was a surface freeway through Mount Baker . Originally , it ran in a tunnel under Mount Baker to the lake . In the early 90 's a few more blocks were put underground , and the two interchanges mentioned above were closed . West of Martin Luther King Way , the product represents I-90 as it used to be , with the freeway being carried on surface streets . This has n't been the case for over ten years and Streets USA had ample time to get correct data for their product .2 -RRB- They locate Magnolia Bluff smack in the middle of Interlaken Park . Needless to say , it 's nowhere near Interlaken Park .3 -RRB- They locate Broadway -LRB- the neighborhood -RRB- at the corner of Franklin and Galer . Broadway is in fact located along ... you guessed it ... Broadway , on top of Capitol Hill , not at its base .4 -RRB- They locate University Village in the UW 's wildlife preserve area along Union Bay .5 -RRB- Ah , Tacoma 's close enough to Seattle to count . There , they still have SR-16 routed along city streets , instead of its own freeway , which has been the case for I do n't know how long , but well before 1998 in any case.Need I go on ? With so many inaccuracies and out-of-date depictions in the Seattle-Tacoma area alone , I can only imagine how many errors this product contains as a whole.To top it off , it does n't even look good . They make the unfortunate style decision of using the direction abbreviations Ne , Nw , Se , Sw instead of NE , NW , SE , SW . Try Microsoft Streets & Trips instead -- it 's not perfect , but it 's better than this .
 I 'm actually 43 years old , but did n't want to take the time to sign up . Actual rating for this product
 I purchased this because it -LRB- very clearly -RRB- stated it was Mac compatible . It is not and the actual packaging -LRB- very clearly -RRB- states that.No time to exchange in time for Christmas , but even if I did , I think the item is incorrectly labeled.Such a shame . Sould never have happened and with a little bit of care and attention , it would not have .
 I would have thought that you could search for `` Bagel Stores '' and get 250 listings and EXPORT THEM AS A TEXT FILE . Not with this software . You can not Highlight or Print more the 30 Businesses at a time , YOU CA N'T EXPORT ADDRESSES , YOU CA N'T PRINT TO A FILE.YOU DO N'T BUY 104 MILLION BUSINESSES TO MARKET THEM 30 AT A TIME ! THAT 'S WHAT THE PHONE BOOK IS FOR . THIS SOFTWARE STINKS .
 This software was very disappointing to me . InfoUSA indicated to me that it was the replacement for thier 88 Million Households disc . That program had the capacity to search by address and this one does not . It is a real misconception and I could not achieve my goals with it .
 This is completely useless software . Gives less features than any free online yellow pages service . I was hoping to enter in SIC codes and export a calling list . -LRB- Understandable since it advertises on the box * CREATE LISTS FOR DIRECT MAIL AND TELEMARKETING * -RRB- You can only look up a business by its name . I thought , well I 'll look up all businesses with the word HONDA in them , but you can only look up by what the business name starts with . USELESS , ...
 this was the stupidist game ever madeI like little baby toys better than this
 This product is marketed as being able to import DFX and DWG files and it ca n't . The manual states that you can manipulate layers in the import preference setup and the program shows no such capability . In fact , it ca n't handle layers at all . Version 1.0 is at best beta software . Customer support is a joke . They charge $ 1.00 per minute for support calls and $ 10.00 per email . Spend your money on this program and you 're on your own . False claims + no support = JUNK . Do n't waste your money on this garbage . If I could give it no star , I would .
 I was looking for a simple drafting program to do floorplans and basic blueprints . The sales blurb implies this is exactly what I needed . However , the instruction booklet is useless , I emailed them several times asking if tutorials or templates were available and I got no response . I would have been happy to pay for them . There is an affiliated site offering instruction and tutorials , they never responded to my enquiries either . I 'm sure if you are familiar with autocad this is a good alternative to more expensive programs , but I could not be sure.I see no point in selling a product and offering zero customer service . I would return it but now it is installed I see no point in battling with amazon or turbocad , I will probably lose and end up winding myself up even more.My advice - get virtual pc and pick from numerous architectural and drafting programs available at a fraction of the cost .
 I used to use a much earlier version of turbocad for Mac OS 7 . That program was wonderful . When this was introduced I naturally assumed it would be a much better update and just as easy to use . I was wrong . The program is difficult to use , or rather get started with . and there does n't seem to be a way to easily set the grid or the final output size as there was in the previous versions.Overall , I 'm very disappointed in this product . The Manual was n't much help either .
 This product will not install on Mac OSX version 10.6.x . This is the response from IMSI : `` TurboCAD Mac v1 .1 has not been tested or is supported on the operating system Leopard 10.6.x . The newly release version of TurboCAD Mac v5 is Snow Leopard compatible , for upgrade pricing please contact our sales department at -LSB- ... -RSB- So , this brand-new software is not usable for me , and IMSI wants me to buy an upgrade . The product page only says `` Macintosh OS X -LRB- 10.2 -RRB- or greater '' . I hope Amazon will take this back , but either way it 's a lot of wasted time and effort , and I still do n't have the drawing software I need .
 I 've been using the Jumpstart games for my kids since they were in Pre-K and they love playing with them . I bought the Languages set for my 5 yr old thinking it would be a great intro to foreign languages . She enjoyed the games at first , but quickly grew bored . There are fewer games than in the other Jumpstart sets and they 're not as challenging . My biggest complaint is that the sound quality and pronounciation for the foreign words are so hard to decipher I doubt my kids will be able to figure them out . I would suggest giving this set a miss .
 Packaging
 I have the 02 version . My comments reflect on that.You will likely end up PAYING MULTIPLES OF YOUR QUOTED PRICE , in order to get a accounting and invoicing system to work correctly out of the box , with this company.As a buisiness owner , I find Peachtree 's buisiness practices to be loathsome ... Things like EMAIL INVOICING ... NOT INCLUDED in a 300 $ package . They wanted an extra 150 $ or something for an account management package.I have found the account management tools in my package to be severely cumbersome . This is completely unacceptable in a internet buisiness arena where direct sales often means one time customers.They called me for months after I registered the product , trying to sell me those features they should have included in the default package.As an owner of a Peachtree product , it is my opinion that shrewd buisiness owners would do well to pass this company and its products by .
 Do n't be fooled . If you buy 2003 chances are you 'll be purchasing a tax update in January 2004 for the previous year . Peachtree no longer supports its new customers should the IRS make changes to the current payroll year even though you may have purchased the most current software . Your W-2 formatting information if changed by the IRS during the year will require you to spend another $ 180.00 plus shipping . And then you 'll still have to buy tax service for the new year .
 One thing that is pretty much common to every business is buying in one quantity say by the case , and selling in another quantity in this case `` each '' . Peachtree does not have the capability to automatically do this simple task and it WILL complicate your life without it . In order to get this common feature you need to spend $ 600 on a more robust version of the software.Don ' t make the same mistake I did , investigate every detail of the software before you purchase it . Otherwise you will have an expensive coffee cup holder .
 Beware , both the 2002 and 2003 multi-user packages have a significant flaw -LRB- s -RRB- that are extremely frustrating.Peachtree has a problem in that it will automatically duplicate PO / Invoice / Sales Order numbers without warning . It has no system to protect against the duplication . The objective is automation , not having to select numbers from a paper log.If you try to run multiple workstations on a SOHO wireless network , expect major problems . You wil probably experience table locks that require constant reboot . We had to move from wireless to wired LAN - using the same router . Also had to purchase new LAN NIC cards . Problem fixed . The wireless network performed flawlessly for Peer to Peer and Internet access.Overall the system has some merits , but the goal of Peachtree is to maximize revenue from support calls . Do n't expect to find any relevant information on the Peachtree website . You will find more on USENET Newsgroups.Since we switched from QuickBooks to Peachtree , recommend that those in need research other systems . Our only reason for switching fromQB was to have assembly capabilities . The new version of QB now has that feature .
 This product is very misleading , in order to do payroll you have to subscribe to the ` payroll tax service ' from Peachtree , which costs -LSB- $ $ -RSB- , twice the original product price . Sure , they say you can ` edit the tax tables ' yourself , but this is actually entering an equation where you must know all the variable names the program uses .
 If you dont ' know anything about accouting , this is not the software for you . There are tutorials available with the software , but you must know the terminology first for it to make sense . There is a free trial of the full PeachTree Accounting available from Best Software , but be aware that if you try it out , you can not transfer anything from the free trial to First Accounting , since they are different versions . You could spend a lot of time working with the trial and then have to do it all again if you buy First Accounting.I am able to handle a small payroll without subscribing to the payroll service , but it did take some experimentation and time to figure out how the user-entered tax formulas worked -LRB- there are two sample companies included with the software -RRB- . There are a lot of options for computing taxes -- you do n't have to use complicate tables , and simple formulas are available . But it was n't easy and I am still learning .
 I was ripped off and sent a worthless product that is not supported by the manufacturer and when I complained was provided no repsonse
 This game is very difficult -LRB- even the easy level . -RRB- It has a lot of bugs . Clicking Help on the main screen freezes my computer . The objects are difficult to manipulate when they overlap anything . Everything has to be in perfect alignment for the puzzle to be solved , which is very difficult to do . I am returning it to Sierra for a refund .
 This game is reminiscent like `` stronghold crusader extreme '' on many levels ; both reduce audio quality , add virtually nothing , and were a money gag.Even more contraptions added puzzles that were boring and unintuitive -LRB- not to mention weird -RRB- . I was expecting something really fun , but , Sierra just wanted to squeeze the juice out of contraptions before it went into the oblivion.Buy `` return of the incredible machine contraptions '' instead , that is a game worthy of praise . Higher quality music , awesome puzzles , and simply a classic by Jeff Tunnell .
 Works great on a PC but you are out of luck if you have a Mac . Too bad as this is a game that I will miss now that I have a Mac .
 Only an account could love this package . For the rest of us , who find double-entry bookkeeping a bit cryptic , Peachtree does not a bit to shield you from the sharp edges of General Journal Entry . You simply can not use this program without a solid knowledge of debits and credits and what account flows to where . And while Intuit 's marketing is a tad intrusive , Peachtree will charge you for EVERYTHING . Want to graph expenses ? Buy the optional Crystal Reports for $ 200 . Much of the clumsiness of the Peachtree interface transcends the requirement to know the details of accounting . If , for example , you wish to enter a Visa receipt from last Tuesday , which happens to be the end of last month , plan on a half a dozen clicks to change accounting periods back and forward again . Along with a couple of `` are you sure you want to do this '' popup screens . And reconciling now takes more than twice as long as it used to , at least in part because Peachtree will show you only three transactions at a time , and not let you edit transactions during the reconciliation process!For accountants , this may well be the best small business package-I presume they need the powerhouse accounting features it offers . I shifted away from QuickBooks it lacked the inventory sub-assembly capability that Peachtree has . QuickBooks has since added that feature , and I look forward to converting back to that package . Overall , doing the books for my small business took about half the time with QuickBooks .
 I bought this for my nephew who is seven.He almost fell asleep watching this.Because thats basically all you do.You sit and watch these animal talk all throught the game.Kids get to click on bushes to see animal run past , or to look under rocks for the things on a list they are given.Thats rare in the game when the kids get a chance to actually do something.If your kids can sit through almost ten minutes of dialog in the beginning then this is for them.If they are like most kids and want to get into the game right away , this is not the game for them ...
 It put me onto the Schedule A , with a state tax deduction worth only $ 1800 , when it should have used the standard deduction of $ 5350 ! Told me I owed $ 800 , when in fact I 'm due $ 800 BACK , so that would be a error of $ 1600 ! Then it took another 20 minutes to find a cludgey workaround , feel sorry for the people that dont have a good idea of what their taxes should be ? So it 's back to TurboTax next year , got this sad excuse for a product on the cheap , who knew ?
 I just did my taxes twice
 If you do n't have a very good understanding of the tax laws , TaxCut wo n't help you at all . I had one child caught in the vicious new version of the kiddie tax . TaxCut does an ' 8615 ' for the parent and then wants you to print and copy into the child 's 8615 . The TaxCut instructions for doing so do n't match the forms . Good luck . And why , if both are being done with TaxCut , does n't Tax Cut transfer teh needed info automatically . Further , on the sale of a mutail fund , Taxcut fails to explain that you have to enter the sale info twice , once for short term gains , once for long term gains , as if it were two sales . I had to open schedule D and review what is was really looking for to get the sales split up properly . It is not that taxCut does n't work , it is that the instructions are useless . Again , if you do n't know the laws relating to your taxes , and you ca n't look at them and understand where things need to be changed , you 'll get in trouble with Taxcut.And yes , very annoying that I still ca n't file , because wven with the 1/31 update , TaxCut is still not right , and I am waiting for the NEXT update .
 THIS CD DOES NOT INCLUDE THE STATE PROGRAM ; you 're required to download it from their site and it only works on the computer you download it to.For security reasons , we do our taxes on a standalone computer -LRB- not connected to the internet -RRB- . After an extended e-mail exchange and after I spent 45 minutes talking to 4 different people at technical support , the company confirmed that there is no way to download the state software -LRB- to a flash drive , for example -RRB- for use on a standalone computer . Finally , they agreed to send me a state software CD at a cost of $ 5.95 , even though their packaging states
 Seeing how Turbotax increased their prices this year I thought I 'd save myself a few bucks by trying TaxCut Premium Federal + State for the first time . The box says it is compatible with Mac OS X and will import data from last year 's TurboTax returns so I gave it a try.I installed the program on my Mac and opened it to start my return . I have a fairly complex return so importing last year 's data is a helpful timesaver . Unfortunately , after many attempts I was never able to import anything , not even my name . I called their customer service and tried all kinds of solutions to no avail . They said someone from their `` escalation team '' would contact me within 24-48 hours . Eight days later there was no news from them so I called back . They had no record of my case and I had to go through the whole explanation all over . Once again their rep had no clue how to fix the problem and gave me a phone number to call for further assistance or a refund.I called the number and once again no case number ! A third round of explanations with another service rep and his manager followed with no solution and no money back . Now I must wait for someone in their `` escalation team '' to contact me a fourth time but they will not provide a timeframe for the call.The delays in response , their inability to track a case number , their weak product knowledge and their reluctance to provide a refund after this much hassle make this a poor product in my opinion.UPDATE : A quick update for fairness ' sake on my review . Three weeks after my first attempt to use TaxCut I finally figured out what went wrong.It turns out TaxCut can not import TurboTax files with password access . I had to disable the password setting on last year 's Turbotax and was then able to import data . The second reason I could not import last year 's files is because two different customer service reps told me the file had to end in . t05 and NOT . tax . Well , as it turns out , the latter file is the one that works . A line or a note about this on the `` Import last years data '' screen would have saved a lot of hassles.I have not finished my return yet but so far the software seems reasonably good . Turbotax seems to have more resources handy if you do n't understand a question -LRB- IRS instructions , their own take , etc. -RRB- and TurboTax also imports data from brokerages which is helpful . -LRB- TaxCut on a Mac OS X Panther user -RRB- .
 Unlike years past , H&R ; Block -LRB- founded by a guy named Bloch -RRB- decided to charge $ 16 for each e-file , Federal or state . Only one version , `` Premium Federal + State + E-file '' includes a `` free '' Federal e-file and state e-file ; but that version costs $ 70 , so there 's no free lunch at all . Seriously , $ 16 is a lot to pay for e-filing . There are websites that give you completely free e-filing ; my favorite is TaxAct -LRB- at taxactonline dot com -RRB- . With TaxAct , you get the complete Federal plus state package for $ 7.95 , which includes e-filing . Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free , with * NO * income restriction!I do n't work for any of these companies , nor any tax-related company , nor any such entity . I just do n't think it 's right for H&R ; Block to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing , whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere . BTW , if you use Taxcut to prepare your return , you 'll have to use H&R ; Block 's e-filing service if you want to e-file ; you ca n't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you . I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable . You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.Good luck .
 I used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it got better and better . Then I tried Tax Cut for two years in a row and was surprised how much clumsier of a program it was to use . I even ran into situations where I had to override TaxCut 's built in methods to get certain things done correctly . I 've never had to do so with Turbo Tax . I finally wrote on my file folder where I collect receipts for the coming tax years `` Do Not Buy Tax Cut '' so that I would n't forget.If you are doing a simple tax return then almost any software will do , but if you have a more complex return with rental properties , investments , trusts or anything else beyond normal wage and salary income and the common deductions then TurboTax is IMO the way to go.If your needs are fairly straightforward , then saving a few bucks by getting TaxCut might be OK .
 I have used TaxCut fairly happily ever since it first came out , I think it was 1998 . But after my experience this year , never again . When the program transferred my state tax payments to my state tax form , it posted one of the tax payments from my W-2s twice , making it look like I was going to get a refund , when actually I owed taxes . I just happened to catch the error , then had to spend about an hour manually reviewing my entire return to make sure they were n't pulling the extra payment from somewhere else . Then the program would not let me override the error . When I called customer service , they simply told me to override the problem . -LRB- They made no attempt to explain why the error occurred and were completely unconcerned that the program had figured my taxes wrongly . -RRB- When I told them the program would not permit me to override , a `` manager '' came on the line who told me , rudely , I was either stupid or lying . When I offered to email him a screenshot to verify the problem , he hung up on me.Fortunately , my state has an easy-to-use online program of its own to do simple returns directly on the web , so I just went there and completed my return . -LRB- The state 's program , incidentally , verified that my manual posting was correct and TaxCut 's was wrong . -RRB- In fairness , the customer service number was answered promptly , and , except for the rude manager , the agents were polite and really tried to help . But the bottom line is , what good is a tax program that posts the wrong numbers ? If I had n't caught this error , I would owe additional taxes and possibly a penalty when the state caught it . Next year it 's TurboTax for me , and I 'll do my state return directly online.But if you enjoy paying someone to figure your taxes wrongly , and then abuse you when you point it out to them , you may want to consider TaxCut .
 I switched to Tax Cut years ago after Turbotax -LRB- in 2003 -RRB- implemented their idiotic validation scheme . I figured I was doing my part to punish Intuit / Turbotax . And for all those years I 've been happy with Tax Cut.Not this year . I found some major bugs which cost me a lot of time . I had my return done , but the numbers were seriously out of whack -- I know I did n't have that much income ! Going back through the interview process did n't turn up the source of the added money . Only by checking the actual `` Forms '' did I find that several copies of 1099-Misc forms were hidden from the interview process , and by adding the same data in non-hidden copies , I was double entering the data . There was no easy way to recover . I eventually had to wipe the installation and start all over.A call to tech support did absolutely no good . The person on the other end did n't seem to understand the problem with having `` hidden '' copies of forms going into the calculations . If those are hidden , what else is it doing wrong?I 'm not quite sure how do deal with this next year . Go back to Turbotax ? Hope Tax Cut fixes its problems ? Or go to a human tax preparer?Whatver my choice , I 'm not looking forward to it .
 I bought Taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership . For the money I guess I 'm satisfied with the partnership results , but that 's where it ends.Taxcut for Federal taxes is not integrated with Taxcut for business ... ok so what do you want for cheap . But , it also is n't well integrated with the Massachusetts state tax version , leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls `` special '' situations -LRB- unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks , for example -RRB- . Overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if I override calculated data I can not e-file -LRB- not that I would trust it to e-file my taxes -RRB- . Form navigation is hopeless . I can only imagine what someone who is n't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess.I filed for an extension ; now I 'm probably going to buy Turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns.With a deep discount , I would probably purchase Taxcut again for the partnership taxes , because it is slightly easier to use than the Excel spreadsheets I 'd been using -LRB- but only because I do n't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms -RRB- . Honestly , you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional Taxcut without the overblown , fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads Turbotax alternative !
 My husband reached age 65 , and WV forms apparently require us to separate his income from mine to get a deduction . Even thought I 'd `` told '' Taxcut whose income was whose when I entered this into Federal , program failed to transfer this info to state forms , so I had to add up income amounts again -LRB- lazy programming on their part -RRB- . They also did not have in their package TWO forms that I needed for WV
 This program sucks . I used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing -LRB- i.e. unlike TurboTax and other programs , there 's very little transparency in the system -RRB- . Then I bought it again this year because the store that I went to was out of Turbotax , and I needed to get my taxes done quickly . This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating , but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense . The results for the federal return were OK , but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $ 2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return . I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap -LRB- $ 10 -RRB- online service recommended by the NY state tax website . Within 45 minutes , I cleared the online source , and got results that made far more sense . I have no idea what happened with TaxCut , but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites . I will NOT be buying this product again .
 Although the program worked fine , the program can not be used . H&R block no longer carries the State part of the program . Since you ca n't load the State the Federal wont work either . The product was useless .
 It wo n't let me e-file my California return . It gives me a bogus error about punctuation in my name . I did the online chat customer service , and they were unable to help , but said they would escalate the problem to `` tier 2 '' , and that the tier 2 people would contact me in 48 hours . That was a week ago . So I again did online customer service , and they were unable to help , but she said she 'd give me the phone number for tier 2 . The phone number just sent me to voicemail ; I do n't even know if it was H&R ; Block , because the voicemail message did not say anything about H&R ; Block , TaxCut , or Tier 2 . So then I called the TaxCut customer support phone number , and they could not help either . They said they 'd escalate it to tier 2 -LRB- again -RRB- . I asked if I could have the direct number for tier 2 , and she said , `` We do n't have it . They do n't like us sending problems up there . '' Great ! A company that really cares about its customers and wants to fix problems in their software ! `` Tier 2 '' support that does n't call back and does n't want to be bothered with our petty little problems . Great.I guess it 's back to Turbo Tax for me next year .
 Worst tax software I 've ever used . I have used TurboTax in the past and did n't this year because of the price . I wish I 'd just paid the extra money . This is hard to use and has defects that wo n't let me complete an accurate return . I finally got in touch with technical support who said they 'd call me in 24-48 hours .
 Have just spent 2.5 hours struggling with TC for Mac . Wrong info , bad interviews , uneditable forms , credits missing . -LRB- No combo of keys appears to pull up the override feature . -RRB- Dangerous . Throw it away , do your taxes by hand or find an accountant .
 I tried to use this program to file a very simple return , and it calculated that I owed the state $ 550 for underpayment , as well as a $ 230 penalty for late payment.I tried working through the program several times to find the error . I found that the program was automatically checking boxes that I had n't checked ! I have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem , which I was not able to resolve.In frustration , I went to -LSB- ... -RSB- and filed my return easily within an hour , with a $ 140 return from the state rather than a $ 780 penalty !
 It is probably too late to save anyone from this software but I had to say something about it to someone . There is apparently no way to tell taxcut about it.I have been using taxcut for several years now after switching from turbotax because of the issue of them installing spyware . I was happy with taxcut until this year . It is defective . I ca n't even believe it is n't in the news . My taxcut program is missing the `` wages '' entry on the Schedule C form . It would have been a terrible loss if I had not caught it . I went to their website to get some help or a phone number and neither was available . I ca n't believe that I have the only taxcut software that is defective but I could n't find any reference to this problem anywhere . Now I have to go through the whole tax form to make sure it did n't make any other mistakes ! I might as well have done my taxes the old fashioned way by hand .
 You ca n't print returns from last year using the new program so if you want to print you need to keep your old program and not only transfer data files but the whole dang program -LRB- if you have a new computer -RRB- ... very bush league . I will be using something else next year !
 This software does not handle common Roth IRA issues correctly . When I contacted -LRB- and paid for -RRB- an H&R Block Tax Advisor , I was told that the software has some limitations handling Roth IRA contributions and that I needed to visit an H&R Block office !
 This Tax program is woefully inadequate for other than routine returns , and even then it has some real limitations . If you have a business , trusts , etc , it tends to fall apart . Worse , if one struggles with it trying to complete the interview for forms like K1 -LRB- and others -RRB- and then go to `` Open Forms '' to look to be sure it came out OK , the forms it opens are blank ; you can not find the consequences of your interview replies . It would appear that you can not use the program without the interview either ; it blocks directly filling out forms if you just want to manually enter your tax info ; or does not include such worksheets properly . It was a waste of money for me . It gets 2 stars rather than 1 since it likely meets the needs for some .
 Continuity of direction is lacking . Often find yourself wondering what to do next ? Also found it impossible to enter the bank numbers for direct deposit
 and so when they mailed me the free software for my Mac , I decided to use it again . We have rental properties and when I started to input the information , the software quickly recommended upgrading to premium . Ok , so I did . Now , I have to ditch this whole return and buy Turbo Tax as well since it 's screwed up my rental figures by applying `` real estate professional '' to one property only . It 's mysteriously disallowed my depreciation.The questions the program asks are lockstep and do n't give enough straight forward help -LRB- like the other reviewer it was recommended that I read some lengthy IRS pamphlet - that 's a great help -- thanks a lot !! -RRB- and it is difficult to know where it goes wrong in the interview . I think this software was rushed onto the market without enough testing.However , I 'm sure that if your return is fairly simple and not 35 pgs long like mine , it works OK .
 I have used TurboTax for several years . This year TurboTax Premier cost $ 75 , so I thought I would try TaxCut Premium . On the box , it has a check mark on ESPP and Stock Option . It turns out TaxCut is only `` assisting '' on those topic . Meaning , the software will ask you a bunch of question and determine if you need to file it and roughly where in the tax form . I was shock that TaxCut was n't going to take my ESPP information and put them in the Schedule D and report the Ordinary Income . No wonder TaxCut only cost $ 29.99 and TurboTax cost $ 75 . TaxCut Premium feature is at most equivalent to TurboTax Deluxe.Beside the ESPP shock , the rest of the program seems comparable to TurboTax , hence 2 stars instead of 1 .
 I spent 2 days , many hours on the phone the phone . The program does not work with OS/X -LRB- 10.4.8 -RRB- . The program does not install properly . The navigation icons are missing , and there are multiple xml reading errors . Could not import 2005 TaxCut return . The help button/menu actually crashes the program . The tech support will tell you things like ... you have a `` bad . exe file '' ... `` press Alt-Tab '' to get to the registration screen . I tried on 2 macs . Downloaded twice . Finally , I went to request my money back the website failed with some backend Oracle database error . There is a total lack of quality control on this Mac version .
 H&R ; automatically mailed me a copy of TaxCut Premium Fed + State , which you pay for if you choose to install . I seem to recall the the Fed efile was included in the Deluxe + State version from years past . This time it 's $ 16 bucks for Fed & $ 16 for state . I like Taxcut , but come on , that 's over a 50 % increase over last years product . I 'm looking elsewhere this year before I install.Update
 I thought I would save a little money and use H&R ; Block instead of Turbo Tax . Bad move on my part.When the program downloaded my State of Louisiana tax forms , I got a script debugger error . After filling out the forms within the program , they would not print out correctly . The completed forms came out as gibberish . According to the help files , this is due to a missing font - which is incorrect . I have the correct fonts.So after buying the software , I had to completely redo my state taxes . There was no way to download the forms a second time - it can only be done once .
 Like others , I 've used this program over the yrs and one of the biggest selling feature was the included e-file . Without that , this program is not good enough on it 's own merit . Thanks to the suggestions below about other alternatives . I will look elsewhere .
 Perhaps its the latest fashion of out sourcing . Over the years I 've watched TaxCut degrade in engineering quality.Issues :1 -RRB- Mac version only runs with `` administrator '' privilidges . This is just typically Microsoft mentality dumb . Unlike Windows , the Mac OS can seperate out limited privilige users -LRB- safety mechanism to protect against malicious programs from accessing system areas -RRB- . An application does not have to have access to system files , to execute on Mac OS , unless the `` inexpensive '' alternative engineer who wrote it , is so profoundly ignorant of his/her trade that they do n't know that .2 -RRB- Last year , the Windows version would not execute on Virtual PC -LRB- Windows emulator , by MicroSoft , for Mac OS -RRB- . I did n't try the Windows application , on the same CD this year , to see if they fixed that . I 'll bet they did n't . The application tried to access a low core address or look for a low core value , and of course , was tripped up by the emulation mode of Virtual PC . -LRB- Yet another incredibly naive mistake made by the author . -RRB- When I called customer service for a work around , I was told -LRB- paraphrasing -RRB- `` Tough . We do n't support non-Windows platforms '' . When I informed this ignorant customer service agent , that my Virtual PC was running Windows XP , his response was the same . Which makes me suspect they planned to execute only on a Intel based CPU , hmmm .3 -RRB- Critical updates to the Federal application and my entire CA state application are still not available from H&R. ; The problem is that the Federal/State dead line for estimated tax payments passed on Jan. 15th . I guess TaxCut is not designed for customers who earn other than wage income . Or at the very least , H&R ; does n't care .4 -RRB- The application interview process is adequate . But , then I know the tax code and tax tricks in and out . Perhaps , I was able to navigate easier because of personal knowledge .5 -RRB- With this pre-real version `` errors '' were generated -LRB- not unexpected -RRB- . We shall see if the application will allow straight forward correction/adjustment of the various worksheets . In previous years , a few of the `` errors '' were uncorrectable , because the application either had no means to access the respective worksheet , or once encoded , data would not change , or once encoded all further adjustments were treated as additions .6 -RRB- When I imported my Capital Gains Summary from Quicken , TaxCut garbled the description . It did , this year , correctly translate dates , amounts , & gains/losses . It also recorded , this year , all entries.Is TurboTax , the only alternative I know of , any better ? Do n't know . This review would be accurate for the 1999 version I used . Things may have changed since then .
 I used the taxcut premium with state yesterday to do taxes and mine has a flaw in it . It would not give me the new energy credit for this year , but I went to the free efile site for taxcut and that version gave it to me . So anyone that has been denied this credit should recheck thier taxes . I was on the pc with support for over an hour and they could not resolve the problem , then I called support and they issued a refund for the program . My credit was $ 500.00 , Which I could have lost if I hadnt know I was entitled to it .
 Cheaper is n't always better . Next year I will gladly pay the extra cash for Turbo Tax . The Tax Cut user interface is clumsy and a bit confusing . The program itself is unstable , locking up several times . The Deduction component is almost worthless . And now there is a e-file fee!This is junk . Do yourself a favor and stay away from taxcut .
 I used the Block software to prepare my Ohio return - until I noticed that it did not provide for the tax credit for contributions to Ohio political candidates ! That item was worth $ 50 to me . I then used the online tax preparation feature on the Ohio Department of Taxation website which was fast and easy and promises my refund in two weeks or less - a refund $ 50 higher than Block would have generated.I do n't know if their software for other states is any better , but I sure would n't trust it .
 I 've used Tax Cut since 1996 . But I 'm switching products because H&R Block 's Tax Cut does not match the Federal Tax tables . I got a nice letter from the Feds two years ago that I owed money and when I checked the Fed tax table against Tax Cut 's , Tax Cut 's was incorrect . Yes , I downloaded all the updates . So I paid the penalty and owed tax and chalked it off . Until last year , when I was doing my taxes and after finishing decide to match what Tax Cut said were my taxes for my net income versus what the 1040 form said . Again Tax Cut was wrong . So it does n't matter how many bells and whistles a program has , if it is based on the wrong tax tables , your tax filing will be in error .
 On the Macintosh side , I do n't know what happened to this product during the one year they skipped development -LRB- 2005 tax year -RRB- but I was very disappointed with this year 's version . Particularly if you are a business owner or sole proprietor!In the end there was no harm done because I decided I needed to go to a real accountant anyway for business purposes ... but the flow of this year 's application was very disjointed and inconsistent IMO . In the past the forward and back functions worked as you would expect -LRB- more or less like a browser -RRB- , but here depending on which page you jump from , you might go from the end of a section back to the end of the last section or beginning of the current , instead of to the last page.Also my accountant found at least two flaws in the interview flow , and at least one calculation error based on the interview answers . Not recommended at all for 2006 unless you are filing late and work strictly on a W2 basis , with no complex investment or deduction options needed .
 Who checks this product ? Lots of bugs this year and no one to call . I 've been using Turbo Tax for many years , but I think its time to find a new product -LRB- or dare I say it -- go to an accountant ? -RRB- . It is easy to transfer the prior year information which is why I have n't ditched it before . But the numerous problems with this year 's `` enhancements '' have tried my patience .
 I have been using Turbo Tax product since 1997 . Last year 2005 tax return after I had e-filed , I got an IRS notice/fine for underpayment of estimated tax . I payed this amount and wrote to Turbo Tax about their 100 % Gurantee and interest , on any IRS fines . Nothing happened and I never got any money back . So if you depend on this claim , be sure you will not get anything back ... or you will have to really run after it to get anything back . I tried contacting them through Online CHAT . The Support folks in India passed me on to 2 of their departments and finally asked me to contact Turbo Tax over phone . Forget it ... not worth all the hasle . Next time may use a different product .
 I had come across this Mac version of the NEATO software after talking to a friend who recommended the PC version . Disclabel has some good ideas here , but the software needs to be far more user friendly than it is . Do n't be looking for much in the way of help files to help you through your initial exposure to the software either , the help files -LRB- for several versions - the latest as of 5/2/05 is 2.3.1 -RRB- are not included on the install CD . You must log on to their website to view their help - meager as it is . You are , in essence , flying blind in a snow storm here.Importing your own graphics is cumbersome . You can not drag and drop your artwork on to a blank template ; the software is designed , literally , to import directly from other software libraries - such as iPhoto or iTunes . Once there , the cryptic alignment tools are n't of much help without documentation they so desperately need.There 's no print preview either . Although it is relatively simple to use the pop-up menu to select your printer and the corresponding paper , you 'll have no idea what you 'll get until you print it out . Using my Epson R200 , I created two of my own CDR labels , but my prints looked nothing like what I could view on screen -LRB- from Photoshop -RRB- ; they were much darker , turning royal into navy blue , for example , and casting a reddish haze onto gray and black . Printing these same images directly from the Adobe software gave me results far closer to the original colors , so there must be something going on inside disclabel.There is n't much out there to compete against this product , and I 'm convinced I will be able to get this to work after much travail . I am thinking though that MacKiev 's Print Shop for Macintosh might have been a wiser choice even though it costs about double what this one does.One last thing
 Let me start by saying that I have a two year degree in computer graphics , so it 's not like I do n't know what I 'm doing . I have had Dislabel Neato for longer than I can remember -LRB- probably since before 2001 -RRB- it was a gift . When I first got it , it was fun and easy without even reading the directions . It did everything I wanted . I had to upgrade at an additional cost when my first MacBook broke down . Since then it has gotten worse with every update . I have had nothing but trouble and every task is a struggle . Simply trying to keep the text from twisting nearly drove me crazy . Every thing just became to much of an effort , so much so that I have stopped using it . That is I stopped using it until today when I thought I 'd give it another chance . Today it would n't even import my iTune tracks . I hate it ! Why ca n't people leave a good thing alone ? I tried to send Disclabel an Email but that did n't seem to work either . So , good-bye forever Disclabel Neato .
 This is supposed to be the best Streets & Trips program for the PC out there but all I can say is , if it is , it 's a shame . It ca n't save page margins for printing . Every time you open the program again and want to print 1/4 '' margins , it 's preset to 1/2 '' margins all over again , as the default.As far as I know , it also ca n't be made to save to the default directory of your choice , it always picks the place by default that it wants to save to.Like Google Maps , it 's wrong about 5 % of the time , either not being able to find some addresses here in the Denver area , or sometimes telling you they 're a couple of blocks from where they really are . In fact I wonder if both programs share the same data ? They seem to make the same screw-ups that way.I 'd also like to be able to set default colors for the push pins but it reverts to the same hard-to-see gray every time the program opens.It reminds me of Chessmaster 9000 , which is said to have a world class chess engine , but was written by game programmers -LRB- you know , the kind who write those games that used to require you to devote your entire computer to them , would n't install right and messed up in so many other ways -RRB- so it would n't even save your place in the massive tutorials when you used them ? Well that 's what this program reminds me of . They put some massive data together and did pretty darn good with that -LRB- about 95 % accurate , but we wish it was 100 % ? -RRB- and then programmed the basic shell like a bunch of beginner game programmers , not allowing you to save the most basic defaults that you desire to.Sheesh Microsoft , you should be able to do better .
 I found this 4 set software a `` survey '' of all four , successful at none . I am computer software savvy , but I found it difficult to use . Comes in a nice sized box with only the 4 CDs inside . I rather expected a book , pamphlet , or SOMETHING . I was particularly interested in the cross stitch CD , which I found completely insufficient for doing any sophisticated work . I did n't think HELP was particularly useful . I wanted to create a new alphabet to design something . This software just wo n't do it . Or I just could n't figure it out . I was unable to `` cut and paste '' my designs . I am sure there was a way to do it , but it was n't intuitive , or work like any other product I have used.I did n't attempt to use their `` organization '' CD as I found everything else so very useless . BEWARE OF BUYING 4 HIGHLY SPECIALIZED crafts consolidated into one oversized box containing only 4 CDs . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 Work fine until I go online for other project when I return program wo n't work . Do bother with this piece of junk
 it can be a help for some one did not have any idea about the english , for some to learn how to take with new pepole
 I 'm amazed at the lack of security software available on the market today for the new Mac computers . Who are these people ? I do n't want 2005 software for my G5 that was built in 2006 . Why do the PC 's get all the attention ? The G5 Quad which cost quite a bit of money deserves some attention from the big guns of the industry like Symantec , Trend Micro and McAfee . The new Macs use Unix which opens them to attack . If you search hard enough , you 'll find something like Sophos which is very expensive . I happen to own a G5 Mac with Tiger on it . It has quad processors , 8 gigs of ram and two 500GB SATA drives installed . I certainly want to protect my investment . Why is n't there more software being worked on for these expensive machines ? I will never run a Mac that can run Windows on it . Doing so is very dangerous and opens the owner to all of the grief that PC owners now have . Another good suggestion is to keep anything Microsoft off of your Mac . I just wish I could find some reliable software out there that would protect my investment .
 Do not buy this product which is both antiquated and incapable of working on Windows 7 . I was trying to update an earlier version of this product and discovered that my older version worked while this did not .
 The description said NEW . Maybe it was new but it was an old version and was very poor at that . Much prefer my old version of Street Atlas or Mapquest .
 Okay , so you read all of the reviews , right ? And they all basically said that this is a great game , right ? Well , I want to tell you from a kid 's point of view about this game . I 'm not sure if they show a picture of the back of the cover , but it has skeletons on it -LRB- just so you know some of the content of this game -RRB- . This game is like a spacy , almost alieny game where you have to do math to solve the mystery . You are in space in this weird `` space building '' and you click around on certain things and then math problems will come up . You are then guided through it by mechanical voices and must solve the problems . It 's just weird , maybe if you like this kind of stuff , then this is the game for you . But sometimes , you never know what you 're going to get when you buy it . That 's how it was for us , all of the reviews said it was an awesome game . When we recieved it , we were dissapointed with what we got . Be an informed buyer !
 After installing the game , when I tried to run it I get an error message that says `` need 3mb of virtual memory free '' . I have plenty of virtual memory and my husband who is a computer expert could not get this program to run on our computer . We have Windows XP and it will not run in the compatability mode . My husband tried to tweek it to get it to run but could not do anything to get it to recognize our virtual memory . There is no technical support available for this game any longer .
 It should be a pretty good software , but it is not updated for MacOS X , so this does not work properly at many occasion on newer Macs . Please not that it will not run on Intel Mac at all . If you are still using old Macs with OS 9s , you would be much happier .
 I 've tried to get this to run on two different Windows XP machines . Both receive the `` memory error '' commonly attributed to it . I 've tweaked and tweaked my virtual memory settings and while I have a ton of games and CDs that do work , this one does not.I want a refund .
 My 8 year old son struggled with this and asked me for help . I had no idea how to help him ! All we did was answer math questions , there was no purpose or adventure to be had . Sorely disappointed after all the fun we had playing Where in the World is Carmen San Diego.What a waste this game was , of time and money !
 I purchased this for my children for Christmas . They were very excited ! Well when I programed it to the computer , it did n't work . It said I HAD to have the color setting at 256 . If we have the color setting this low , it effects the rest of the screen , and makes it look fuzzy . But I did try and do it , and all the other things they suggested , and it still did n't work . So I emailed the company for help , and told them I had tried all that they had suggested and it did n't matter . When I got the reply , they told me to try the same EXACT thing that I had tried and referred me to their help section . BEEN THERE ! DONE THAT ! I was very disappointed that they did n't seem to read the message I had sent them the first time . So we got the program and can do NOTHING WITH IT ! The 256 color is an old setting . I ca n't believe we have to have it set there , but no matter it still does n't work , and not much help from the company !! I would think twice to buy anything from them again .
 The software indicates it will work on my computer but it will not install . I do not have a gripe with the seller though . Software was in good condition and in original wrap and I received it in a timely manner . I was just looking forward to having it on my computer as my granddaughter enjoys playing Kids Pix at school .
 I had a similar experience to the prior users . I had to reinstall after a computer crash but was left high and dry by these crooks . The program was n't that great to begin with -LRB- for the price -RRB- !
 I bought and paid for this program.My hard drive crashed . Even though I kept a copy of the program and receipts on cd , the program would not reinstall on my new hard drive . When I sent proof of purchase and asked for support these slimy bottom feeders did n't even acknowledge my -LRB- several -RRB- emails.This kind of behavior is exactly why we 're in trouble America . Please do not support these heartless crooks .
 This is a fine little program that enables you to create really nice banners using either the large stock of graphics it comes with or custom made pictures of your own.The only issue is that once you uninstall it for any reason you WO N'T BE ABLE TO REINSTALL IT EVEN ON THE SAME PC and customer service is non-existent so you are stuck with an unusable product after spending $ 100 bucks.In an age where it is not uncommon for folks to reformat their systems , this program is virtually useless.It is a one time install and if you try to reinstall you wo n't be able to do it -- not good -- stay away from these types of products unless you do not ever plan to uninstall it .
 On the package and in the advertisement , Roxio says that it 's `` fully compatible '' with TiVo recordings and yet there is absolutely nothing in the 314 page manual on the topic and nothing in on-line help . After an hour of trying to figure out how to transfer my TiVo recordings to a DVD using Media Creator 8.0 , I 'm giving up . I 'm going to try to send it back .
 I agree with S. King ntpro about the positive reviews , a lot of them do seem highly suspicious and resemble an effort to tamper with the overall ratings . Also , notice how all the positive reviews , no matter how poor , are found `` helpful '' by 80 % or more of viewers , while all the negative reviews , no matter how extensive and descriptive , are NOT found helpful by the same percent of viewers.As for the actual product , it 's a disaster , without a doubt one of the worst programs I have ever had the misfortune of installing . Read all the negative reviews and if you still decide to ignore them and be fooled by false positive advertisement , then it 's your own damn fault and you WILL know what I am talking about . The unnecessary file size , the hogging of system resources , freezing , crashing , you name it , it 's all true . Trust me , I do n't go out of my way to slander a product for no reason , but this is just a mockery of common sense . I 'll be fair , 2 projects completed successfully ... out of about 15 that is.Oh and another thing , it requires MSXML -LRB- read up on that , cause Roxio assumes you 're up-to-date with every little plugin Microsoft puts up for download on their site -RRB- to install on XP . MSXML in itself can be a pain to install , if for example you did n't know that you have to shut down Ad-Aware 's Ad-Watch for successful installation . Once you have MSXML installed , which you 're likely to have no use for other than `` successfully '' installing this buggy horrible software , installation of EMC8 will complete . The thing is , the installer for EMC8 is so piss-poor , that it installs everything first and , if you happen to not have MSXML installed , at the VERY end , before it completes , it brings up an error box that lets you know installation can not complete due to missing MSXML , and then starts rolling back the whole damn installation . You know , just so you can waste time watching a bar go right and left , cause you have nothing better to do anyway.If the installer was the only problem , it would n't be so bad . But the worst is yet to come . Anyways , no sense in beating a dead horse into the ground , just know that the negative reviews are indeed accurate , and while you 're probably not going to encounter all those problems , you are VERY likely to encounter some , especially actual writing problems . Now let 's sit back and watch Roxio employees select `` No '' one after another next to where it says `` Did you find this review helpful ? ''
 In over 20 years of working with commercial software -LRB- for 8 years as an editor for a major computer magazine -RRB- , I have rarely come upon a program as bad as this one . It crashes constantly , it runs slowly , it does not provide error messages to guide you . Prior to installing EMC8 , I rarely had problems with Windows XP Pro ; now , the system hangs frequently , always when some component of EMC8 is running . The `` support '' for this product is a joke . In my experience , on-line `` chat '' is never available . The ticket-based help system takes forever to respond -- if they respond at all -- and good luck trying to find a phone number to speak to a live person.I have no idea if other programs work better than this one . Before buying EMC8 , I read many , many reviews and they all seemed equivocal about pros and cons . I bit the bullet and bought EMC8 , a decision that I will regret for a long time .
 I ca n't use the video capture option , and try to contact their support . However , Roxio required to register to their web site and submit the request after log into their web site . But their web site registration never work . THAT MEAN NO SUPPORT AT ALL !!!!
 I really liked the earlier version 6.0 of roxio Easy CD/DVD Creator . I decided to upgrade to Easy Madia Creator 8.0 . I 'm so disgusted with this piece of software that I 'm about to throw it away . Thier are some major problems with this software . First off it wo n't completely install on my system because it conflicts with Microsofts Winsows Install Program . Reading around the net there 's a hack to actually get it to install . Then once it 's installed it screwed up every cd/dvd drive and it wreaks havoc with just about every piece of software on my system that plays digital media . My system is a total mess right now because this software is such a resource hog . Tech support at Roxio/is as thoroughly confused about the problems with this software as I am . Every solution they 've come up with has not worked . I 'm just hoping I can get my system back to the way it was before this software was installed.I know I 'm not the only one who 's having problems with it , there are many . While I 've heard rumors that there are some who 've actually gotten this thing to work on thier systems . If you 're considering buying this , do n't say that you were n't warned .
 Loaded on an eMachine and a Gateway . Both would freeze and need a hard reboot to recover . Unable to open files with my computer or explore . Unable to play cds or read dvds with roxio loaded . When removed from system , both machines were normal . Support is awful . When trying to go thru automated support , all I could get was support for Easy Creator 7 . They want $ 35 for phone support . I do n't need that .
 I 'm done with Roxio . After spending 120 hours and $ 150.00 on outside technical support , I give up . There are numerous problems and bugs with this software . My biggest problem was loading pictures into Media Manager . Beware ! You will not be able to change the name of a photo ANYWHERE else on your PC because Roxio will not recognize it . You will become very familiar with the hourglass icon . I 've taken my computer to specialists who are perplexed at this problem . I called Roxio technical support 2 days ago and got this message `` We 're sorry , due to technical problems , we can not take calls right now , please call back later . '' Friends who are computer savvy have tried contacting Roxio support -LRB- for help on my problem -RRB- and are now experiencing new levels of frustration . They 've e-mailed , checked discussion groups , asked Roxanne , etc. . I did have an earlier version of Roxio on an old computer and thought that the freezing up , cd burner dying and so on was fault of the computer manufacturer , now I know it was Roxio . Roxio is poison to your computer -- like a virus . I can not tell you the level of frustration I 've been at . The glowing reviews must be coming from the employees at Roxio . They know their days of having a job are numbered . I 've got a big mouth and am warning everyone I know to stay away from their products . It would be poetic justice for me to know that based on this review , someone opted for a different brand of software . Trust me , I 'm not a computer genius but I 'm not totally green either . I have exhausted ALL avenues in trying to get this product to work and I do n't give up easily . Now , I will uninstall Roxio , grab my hammer and smash the cd into a million little pieces -LRB- and that 's no lie ! -RRB- .
 This software has some of the worst bugs you are likely to encounter using a computer - it is a shameful mess , a total disaster . First , be aware that the word `` suite '' means that you 're getting a pile of shoddy , poorly conceived applications purchased from various other third parties over the years , which then received an update to the interface so they look like the same company wrote them . Most of these applications are trash . Further , without exception , these applications are ridiculously unstable . Many fail to start when you try to launch them . When they do run , they frequently simply quit , disappearing and leaving no trace . When they do n't do this , they more often than not lock up your computer altogether . Once in a great while the software works properly , finishing a task and leaving you with a usable result , instead of trashed media ready only for the garbage . Using the software is maddening.You may wonder how this software could be so horrible , given the 5-star reviews here . Others have pointed out the similarity in the vast majority of these reviews , and the professional marketing-speak tone of the writing . Those who have made these observations argue that the reviews are planted . This is correct . They are planted . If you look at these `` reviewers ' '' other reviews , you 'll notice that usually there are n't any . The evidence , taken together , strains credulity . Is it possible that dozens of people who have never written a review of anything else are so motivated to sing the praises of what is clearly some of the worst software ever written ? No . It is not possible . The reviews are fakes.The continued existence of this software is due only to the distribution arrangements made with hardware manufacturers - everybody gets a basic version of either this or Nero when they buy a burner . This has , in effect , locked up the market . If there were any real competition , this piece of junk would either have -LRB- 1 -RRB- been fixed by version 7 , or -LRB- 2 -RRB- ceased to exist.In short , do not buy . There are open source tools that do all the same things properly . Show Roxio what happens to companies that try to sell such shoddy merchandise .
 The product installed properly and then the problems began . I tried to get help from Roxio 's self help site , which proved to be extremely inadequate . I posted my problems on the Roxio support site , but all were left unanswered . Here 's just one problem example . There were many . I decided I wanted to create a label for a music CD that I burned . After ordering labels directly from Roxio , I found that the labels they shipped me were not supported by the EMC 8 software . Can you believe that ? Anyway , functionally the suite is very complete . If you buy it , just hope you wo n't need help from Roxio . They 're probably the worst software company I 've ever dealt with . I ended up returning the software for a refund .
 I installed the product and could neither register it online nor get any updates without hanging trying to access Roxio 's servers . Avoid this product at all costs .
 All of the positive reviews here must be from a previous version of Roxio 's Easy Media Creator -- Version 7.5 or below . I was very satisfied with the two previous versions . However , I made the mistake of upgrading to Version 8.0 , and I have had nothing but trouble . It would take too long to explain all of it.I ca n't understand how a company that had a good product could have turned it into a disaster . Nothing works , and they have had no updates to the software since it came out . I ca n't believe that -- as it absolutely does not work . To make matters worse , they do n't service or support the product . The only way to get help is to go to the discussion groups on their website , where you can read about all the problems everyone else is having and how they are trying to solve them.Bottom line
 This is poorly designed and poorly tested software . Really common and basic capabilities like file -- > open for editing exising labels do n't exist or work sensibly , on installation all dates on jpg files are changed -LRB- modified date -RRB- to the date the software is installed , slide shows do n't rebuild without fiddling around with the audio files , check boxes for audio do n't activate when displayed , sound tracks on DVD slide shows skip and do n't sync when new pictures are added to a show . Ignore the professional reviewers , this is awful.However , if you like puzzles , Media Creator is for you . Roxio did n't have a concept of how people use computers with version 5.0 , it 's gone downhill from there .
 I 've tried to use this for the plain old simple task of burning audio CDs . At this it stinks . It gives new meaning to the terms counterintuitive and user-unfriendly . It uses 98 % -99 % of my CPU capacity , making multitasking totally impossible . The disk label function forces you to use wierd patterns instead of plain labels , and does n't recongize standard Neato labels . It gives less control than you get with 7.5 . I 'm going to uninstall it and go back to 7.5 . This piece of junk was probably written by the same idiots who did Norton PcAnywhere 11 . There is a place for them , and it is n't where the sky is blue and the angels play harps .
 While I have not had any problem with the suite itself , the Cinemagic codecs it installed created problems with Windows Media Player . It also has caused problems with non-media and non-Roxio programs . Though I have been able to work around these problems , the fact that it seems to have altered my system to the extent it affects totally non-related programs is of great concern to me . Customer service has also been completely non-responsive . I would strongly suggest customers find some other software for their needs .
 Believe the bad review , this product is trash . I wasted my money .
 I have three very nice running WinXP machines and have Roxio 8 on two . I was very happy using the old software it work like a charm . When more new versions of Crator were release Roxio place an apps to try to disable my use of version 8 and trying to force me to upgrade . Every time I open the program it would not link me to the Roxio website and come back with annoying error . After I kept clicking the error box a number of times , then the program would work , but not without it starting again . I hate a company -LRB- Microsoft is another -RRB- that want to force users to do what they want . Leave use alone and remove the apps .
 Words cant describe how awful this software truly is . Just load it up and wait for it to lock up your computer.Truly terrible . I 'll never buy from Roxio again . It 's hard to believe that this junk was ever tested .
 Do n't buy it ! Does n't have support if needed.It is hard to delete once it is installed.Amazon should not sell this Item ! Later versions work better !
 I 've used a number of versions of Roxio over the years , and they have gone steadily down hill . Their support is nonexistent . Registering does n't work , and you ca n't send them a message if you do n't register . Very cute . Their forums lead to dead pages . A frustrating crock . I 'm shopping for a new product . I 'm done with them .
 After being a long time user of Roxio 's easy CD Creator 5 , I was excited to learn about Easy Media Creator 8 . I purchased it and found it to be the worst performing software I have ever had the misfortune to purchase . It is `` Clunky '' in operation . It does not follow the standard protocols for drag and drop or some other standard protocols . It has many other flaws which are too numerous to mention . Even the patch to rectify one flaw does n't work properly . As someone else mentioned , it is PAINFULLY slow in some respects and it 's CD disc copy utility is n't even close to the standard Windows copy utility . Unfortunately , ECM8 installs it 's own utility in place of the Windows utility so the user does n't even have the option to stay with the Windows version.This product was obviously rushed to market without proper testing and it performs as bad or worse than a 1st Beta version.Sonic Solutions should offer a full refund to any user who is not satisfied with this amateurishly written program , recall it from the market and not release it again until they get it right .
 Before purchasing this product ; I contacted Roxio/Sonic and inquired as to the graphic cards this product would support . I was erroneously told that it would support my particular card without any problem . Well , when I tried to capture video/audio ; it DIDNOT work whatsoever . In fact ; it could n't even recognize any video signal at all . Needless to say ; I was very disappointed and returned the product . I have an ATI All In Wonder 1800XL video card which is the top of the line graphic cards for capturing video . I was very sorry to find out that Sonic had tied up with Roxio as Sonic 's `` My Dvd '' is the best and easiest program to use for capture . Roxio products cause several types of compatability problems .
 I 'm sorry , but when someone writes this : `` However , I posted a message on their forums and one of their tech support dev guys called me out of the blue . The issue ended up being related to my PC-Cillin AV and he was able to get things working after in depth troubleshooting . Wow , wish all companies had support like Roxio !!! I never asked for this kind of help and they took it to the max . I highly recommend their products.Thanks Patrick ! `` They just have to be working for Roxio . The support forums are full of complaints about this terrible software -LRB- I reinstalled mine over a dozen times , and it still does n't work -RRB- and their terrible support -LRB- I never got a response from their support either online or on the phone , the responses they did give others online to my problem were simply convoluted and useless -RRB- . I was shocked at how bad it was , I felt like I 'd gone back to the late 80 's when it was normal to stand on your head to get something to work . Well I stood on my head again for Roxio in 2006 and I 've got a $ 80 set of coasters for my money and trouble.P.S . Roxio scrub critical messages off of their support forums , as Google 's cache will prove . Software reviewers are as to blame as the manufacturer because they review dozens of features in software that simply does n't work for a large proportion of users . Features those users will therefore never get . Roxio should grow up , and if they ever fix a version of this software -LRB- any version , from what I read -RRB- I think they will be startled by how many copies they sell .
 Have this version of EMC 8 on another computer ... worked great . However , when got a new high level Dell and went to install would not even recognize the key code . Thinking that is was prohibited I purchased a new EMC 8 and this new CD would not recognize that key code . Other non-roxio program key codes were used without difficulty . Went to the Roxio site and discovered numerous people having installation problems particularily with those who had any roxio or sonic programs in that computer , many of these may be hidden . I have tried everything known to man to get this CD to even recognize its key ... no go , even with the roxio support ; clean install did not work . Now any pre-loaded roxio/sonic products have been removed ! My advise ... stay away from ALL roxio/sonic products at ALL costs until they completely fix this install problem . I have spent too much time on this issue ... go elsewhere !! Hopefully I can return this pain of a software .
 Here is the typical run a-round that I have been getting from Roxio 's Tech Support . I had opened a Ticket for a problem with the software not being compatible with Yamaha Soundboard with a signed driver from MS in Dec 05 , they keep closing it for no reason . Here is an offical response for my ticket # `` 114056 Last Updated
 I have used the earlier versions of Sonic MyDVD and Roxio media creator separately and have always been happy with the products . I purchased EMC8 two months ago and initially very excited about the product . I burned a couple CDs and DVDs with no problems . Next I decided to try creating a DVD video slideshow . EMC8 is a bunch of different programs packaged together that does not function together very well . They have wizards to help you create a project but there is no way to access all the cool features touted on the box using the wizards.There support is horrible . When adding a video to MyDVD my PC would reboot with no error messages . It took me two weeks to get a log-in to support because their online system was having difficulties . Three calls later to Toronto and I finally got a log-in . The first line support provided is an online `` ask roxann '' program to try to answer easy questions totally worthless unless you do not know how open you put a CD in your PC . Once you have gone through roxann and no help you can enter a online web ticket . Well it has been two weeks and no response or reply to my ticket . The next option for support is paid support for $ 35 and incident.The only glimmer of hope is their online discussion groups with other Roxio users . After posting my problem , several helpful -LRB- non-Roxio employees -RRB- posted similar problems as the one I have . Several people troubleshot spent quite a bit of time isolating the issue and how to work around it . My problem is that their upgrade 8.05 and my video card are not compatible . I uninstalled the product and loaded it without the patch and used MSconfig to remove some of the EMC8 Startup files . I finally got my project finished but what a pain.This seems like a beta product and not fully baked . Thanks to all the discussion forum guys who provided me all the answers . Do n't take my work for it go to the forums
 I 've used Roxio 's CD burning programs for many years -LRB- as many people have -RRB- and found them solid performers . But Media Creator 8 is a very poor program . As I noted in my review title , installation was the worst of any program I 've experienced - and I 've installed a lot of programs . Many of the problems seemed to be related to required connection to the Roxio.com website which performed poorly if at all . -LRB- I have high-speed DSL which was working great ; www.roxio.com was a disaster . -RRB- Navigating the Roxio site directly , I attempted to post a message on the forum , hoping to received some response and solutions to the problems . But the site did n't let me register , so I could n't post to the forum.Eventually - hours later - the Roxio registration site responded when I yet again attempted to run Easy Media Creator , so I could at last open the program and try to create a DVD for my grandaughter 's school . I added the video file , modified the title , then pressed the button to create the DVD . The result
 Back when I had the Dell Dimension 4550 the situations happened in the short-term ... The only program that worked fine in version 8 was Creator Classic , which has rarely had problems for me in the past -LRB- sometimes crashed Windows 98 SE with version 5 , but that was acceptable back in the day of FAT32 -RRB- . Do n't update this program because the update caused Windows XP Professional with SP2 to run very slowly as if it were malware , but possibly the patch had a bug serious enough that plagues programs like Nero 7 and later . -LRB- Nero 7 when it first released caused a BSoD after uninstallation , and glad that I tried that via a trial download . -RRB- I use Roxio Toast 8 , 9 , and 10 without trouble -LRB- at least as far as the basics of backing up data -RRB- . DVD Builder program in this version 8 was horrible as well - audio out of sync with slide shows , and most annoying of all , very difficult to edit text in the menus with the finicky solid bars that were hard to move . It was very slow and unstable , crashing often . Same problem with version 7 , and to avoid corruption , it somehow helps not installing content from the other disc , so when you need the content , insert the disc . I think this might be a Windows indexing issue that causes the corruption , but I have not done thorough research.Note that I last used the program when it first came out and have not used it since . Many reviews here on Amazon are negative on Roxio Creator and Nero as far as newer versions . I agree , Nero 6 was as good as Roxio 7 -LRB- the PC version -RRB- , and I 'd say that how things have been going with these products , it 's looking unlikely any future version would be as smooth sailing.Hope this helps . Keep in mind that Roxio and Ulead products containing the DivX codec may conflict with Nero -LRB- I see that Nero and Roxio are as strong competitors as they have compatibility problems , go figure -RRB- , and cause video thumbnail errors , freezing Windows Explorer . Has happened twice , and hope it does n't happen , unless you know which codec is causing the problem under Windows Device Manager.I use a Mac now with Parallels Desktop , and wo n't even try burning . Besides , Roxio Toast refuses to burn data from a virtual drive.Not recommended - and do n't try Roxio 8 on Vista , and do n't feel comfortable with Vista . Looks as others have had the ` certificate error ' and ` installation rollback ' problem as I did . Hopefully Windows 7 will bring better support .
 For anyone who has used Windows for more than 6 months this product can be very frustrating . Counter intuitive to the extreme ; does not follow normal windows conventions for opening , saving or editing files . Makes simple tasks like creating slideshows a complete pain . Worst is trying to view them when you 're finished . As stupid as it sounds , there are no simple commands to actually view a completeded slideshow and Help does not have a topic for `` view slideshow '' . When you ask their automated help character you get responses like , `` Register my product '' and `` create slideshow '' . I finally opened the 5mb file I created in a crappy res video . I give up !
 What can I say that has n't already been said ? Unstable , resource hog and nearly unusable . Burned 3 DVD+R DL coasters before I got a working copy . I felt like I had been violated by Roxio with the money I spent on this garbage .
 I was disappointed with Roxio 8.0 . Having used versions 6.0 and 7.0 in the past , I was hoping that version 8.0 would be invigorated with some fresh ideas after having been acquired by Sonic . While I had found Roxio to be serviceable in the past , there were a few idiosyncrasies that I had long found annoying and had hoped that they would be eliminated in this new version . Instead , Sonic has married many of the nuisances that caused me to first choose Roxio over RecordNow with the ones already present in Roxio , to produce a product that I loath using . In fact , I removed it from my computer.This is not to say that the product does n't work , or that it 's not feature laden , just that it does n't suit my personal preference . It 's the sort of thing that , for me , tips the scales in favor Nero Ultra Edition . Many users will probably be pleased with their purchase of Roxio 8.0 , but if you 're on the fence and looking to decide between Roxio and Nero , my recommendation is to go with Nero .
 This product is great for editing video and making music disks but when it comes time to save what you 've dun the program all of a sudden stops working and you get a pop-up saying that the program is not responding and we have to close . then when you go to see if your work saved , its not there , i have edited a number of videos and i have spent hours on them and then the program closes and my work is gone , there are much better products out there , windows movie maker 2.1 is a much better program than roxio .
 I have agonized over this software . The DVD I created with slideshow assistant skips over most of my 219 slides , and the company has been totally unresponsive to my online requests for help . Deinstalling and reinstalling the software did n't help . Nor can I access the Roxie Home file that is shown on the menu . This software also hangs up my computer -- this is the only program that does this to my machine . I also tried to join their discussion group on this topic , and their web site wo n't let me in ! Do not buy this software !!! If I could rate it `` no star , '' I would .
 I am a coach and have a large number of short sports movies/clips of my athletes . After reading reviews in trade magazines I decided to purchase this product . I already had a level of experience with an earlier Roxio version . I have a computer with a large hard drive , very fast processor with a large amount of RAM . The capabilities of this software seemed phenomenal . I thought it was a good match.However attempting to create a DVD project with this software is an exercise in frustration . The program ties up and moves at a snail 's pace . It does not allow for multiple movie clips to be added although it is supposed to have that capability . In attempting to burn DVD 's sometimes it works , most times it does not , although it tells you that it has accomplished the task . It is a very time consuming process . It is difficult to get through to technical support and they really do n't want to help you unless you pay . I spoke with a technician who went through my computer and agreed that I had a good machine and that this product should work . He finally suggested that a $ 100 Video Card MAY help . And I was left in the same position as before.I would not recommend this for anyone .
 I have this program and it will not respond , it frequently stops part way through a burn with an error message , and Roxio has n't been communicative on solving the problem . I frequently have to throw away two to three CD-R or DVD+R discs to get one copy . I ca n't recommend another software since I simply use the Windows Media that came with my computer now .
 I wont get into detail since all the other reviews already have covered the problems . This software is extremely buggy . It crashed on me twice , when you try to install the second disc it keeps telling you to restart before you can even if you have already restarted ... Pretty much one of the worst programs I have wasted money on .
 This software has major problems - any time I opened any Roxio function , even if I closed/ended it before shutting down , my system would hang on shutdown and I 'd have to manually power off . Drag-to-disk would hang and/or cause Windows Explorer to hang and I 'd have to manually power off . I wasted at least 20 DVDs trying to use Backup My PC - got corrupted data messages during creation , then once I got the backup to work by deselecting all useful options , I got corrupted data messages when attempting the restore . Take a look at http://forums.support.roxio.com/ if you want to see some of the major problems people have with many of the components of this suite . After the 3rd install and uninstall and having to manually edit my registry to get rid of everything , I 'm not going to try again .
 Used previous versions . No problems . With ver . 8 trying to create DVD 's , nothing but problems . Imported video files one by one . Titles show up in menu box but not in preview window , just blank black text boxes , Tried changing color , still no text . Tried burning the project . Looked just like the preview . No text for video titles or menu title . Just black text boxes . Tried eval version of Nero . Worked fine . Tried update of roxio 8 . Still no text editing . Tried for 3 1/2 weeks to get answer from tech support . No answers from either their online help or email response . Garbage program , garbage company .
 Who knows , like the user who had PC-Cillin , so did I. Perhaps if I was willing to wait and leave my PC inoperable until the wonderful Roxio customer service contacted me , I too could have Roxio operating on my PC . What a bad experience . This software caused my excellent PC to bomb as soon as I installed it . I never even tried any of the functions prior to returning it primarily because the software caused my CD/DVD drives to malfunction . Trying to escape playing a CD caused `` MY COMPUTER '' to freeze . Removing Roxio restored my system to normal . If Roxio has known software/hardware incompatibilities , those should be posted right in the forefront of their help section . Come to think of it ... I had Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum . It too had an application `` Take Two '' that destabilized my old PC so bad that I had to f-disc reformat and reinstall Windows . Last of Roxio for me ! Seriously ... Good Luck all of you .
 I 've been a long-time user of Roxio ever since v4 , but as time has gone on , the product seems to have gotten worse . I have v8 and it does okay burning CDs and single DVDs , but count on a lot of coasters if you try to burn DL DVDs . The editing engine is terrible , like something from years ago . Roxio Classic no longer burns DVDs and the menus are rather confusing . You can do much better with Nero or CloneDVD .
 Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 8 is a great value , but be prepared to work for those saved dollars . Numerous programming glitches turn what would have been a simple , somewhat user-friendly DVD creator into a frustrating , time-consuming ordeal . I used it to create a few slideshows . My biggest frustration came when I 'd add music , and all of my `` zoom & pan '' settings would disappear . Then , when I 'd add `` zoom & pan '' settings , my timing settins would change . Ridiculous . Roxio would do well to FULLY test their software before rushing it to the shelves . I would have given it only one star , had it not been for the good price .
 do n't get this software unless you dont mind paying to beta test roxio 's pile of crap . customer service was horrible , the tech support website was down half the time , and the workarounds they suggest only got half of the suite to work properly . go back to 7.5 until they get 8 running properly .
 I was sorry I opened the box . I just tried to edit a Sony DVD video and 8.0 was a joke . For the Menue Styles it only gives you three choices . You can click on a more choices button and it bumps you online to Roxio where you can buy more Menue Styles . Roxio 7.0 had many video Menue Styles to choose from . You think they would add more not less with the 8.0 upgrade . I wanted to delete a scene in the video and it was impossible to find the right menue to do that . I have a new Dell Demension with 1 gig of memory and fastest hard drive and processor available and 8.0 still hung up and seemed sluggish for video editing . If you have Roxio 7.0 stay with that or I am going to try a Sony video editing product . I just ate $ 80 .
 This program keeps locking up . It did it during the first installation and then radomly when I try to use it . Tech support is just about non-existent . It looks like it has some nice features if you can keep it running long enough .
 I bought this online as a download . It is a waste of money . The user interface is frustrating and not all that intuitive , the slideshow does not let you choose less than 2 seconds . I hate their background menu picture default ... why ca n't they let me choose no background picture at all . And wose of all , when I try to burn a VCD or DVD , it encodes to about 90 some percent , then stops and does nothing else .
 I 'm using the Roxio EMC 8.0 mostly for video editing and DVD burning . DV imports and CD copies were fast but the real problem was with photo slide show and video compilation during the video editing . I experienced numerous system hangs -LRB- more than 10 times a day -RRB- during the slide show creation . Content pool window was too small and I had difficulty placing a photo exactly where I wanted . Text editing tool is very basic and was not stable . I encountered a couple of system hangs during the text editing.I 'll go back to Sony Movie Studio because it is very stable and easy to use . Roxio EMC 8.0 provides a lot of features , but for video and slide show creation , Sony Movie Studio works much better for me .
 I had a program in 2002 that worked better for photo editing ... . none of this program is user friendly , though I did like the slideshow feature ... . I am returning this ... . gon na ' give Adobe a shot .
 I originally liked having all of their tools in one package , however , I have had undesirable internal conflicts with my notebook computer -LRB- new in January 2006 -RRB- and the DVD drive . I could not tolerate all of the issues with this software , so I have uninstalled it from my computer . Had I known the issues , I would have saved my money and not made the purchase .
 First regret , no zero star rating.Second regret , I have been a user of Toast and iMovie on Mac , and bought a current XP machine . Thought that Roxio product for XP would be as good as for Mac , I regret that thought.Some thoughts on the product .1 -RRB- On the opening screen they show ads for other products ! I find this offensive -LRB- no not even their products , other company 's products -RRB- 2 -RRB- Get lots of blank error windows , no information .3 -RRB- Unreliable , impossible to get it to work consistently . get blank windows . Ca n't put slide show on dvd without the computer crashing . Can create submenus on DVD 's but ca n't view them .4 -RRB- Slow as a dog , and then I find out the screen did n't update .5 -RRB- Try to find customer service on their site , I dare you . I read a review about a good experience with forums , I want to email or talk to a person . Emails to Roxio/Sonic fall into a black hole.Good luck.Dan
 We purchased this product because it says it works with Windows XP Porfessional x64 . Ha ! Ha ! What a joke . Roxio is probably laughing all the way to the bank . It will not work . I also loaded it on my laptop which has Windows XP and it did not work on that either . I contacted support . They sent a patch which helped some of the problems but not all . I contacted them again and have not gotten a response , that was about two weeks ago . I was not able to locate a phone number for tech support so I contacted customer service to try and get my money back . They said it was not their problem to go back to the store . The store said it sounded like a compatibility issue and they would not do anything . So we are stuck with a useless piece of junk program . I would strongly recommend that you pass up this program . Ulead and Adobe will let you test their software . We are in the process of looking for a different program .
 This software is so heavy , it takes over a gig to install . It takes a very long time to install . I 've never been able to get it to work . Everytime I open a tivo file to burn to dvd , it freezes my computer . It also did something weird to my wireless network , so I can not use wireless anymore unless I uninstall and restore my computer .
 Running a top of the line Dell XPS . Loaded Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0 and got infamous `` Blue Screen of Death '' . Removed software and computer operation was normal . Same results on subsequent attempts to load software . Tried to use ROXIO web-site for help with absolutely no success . Disscussion group tried hard to help , but suggestions were not helpful . There seems to be no way to contact ROXIO live assistance . Automated tech assistance -LRB- Roxanne -RRB- is useless . I do not plan to try instalation again . Just not worth the trouble . Would donate software to good cause , but would feel guilty about giving an innocent receiver such a troublesome software product . Probably will just throw the $ 80 software away .
 If you are using Windows XP SP2 with Windows Media Center , after your install it will cause an upfixable error . If you call Roxio support they will tell you to download the 114meg patch which will not install or pay another $ 10 for the CD . Had to do a rollback on my system to get Windows Media Center to work again . Returned product and would not recommend it to anyone until all the bugs are worked out and compatable with Windows Media Center .
 I bought Roxio EMC 8 after using Roxio 6 . I recently purchased a new Dell and of course the `` free '' media software that came with it was all `` lite edition '' , trail ware none of which has full functionality , or requires the purchase of plug-ins . So with my experience with Roxio 6 I assumed 8 would be a good tool to create and organize my MP3s . I was wrong . Roxio EMC 8 has less MP3 functionality than Roxio 6 . Furthermore , there customer support is very difficult to navigate . I want an 800 number or an email address . The Roxio site forces customers to register and be at the mercy of a bulletin board forum for any and all truly technical support.In all fairness I did not use the other functions of EMC 8 . As I said I bought it for its MP3 functionality , not so much the other stuff .
 I have never in all the years Amazon has been around felt compelled to write a review of a product until now . I implore anyone who will listen DO NOT BUY this s/w . I was a s/w project manager for 20 + years for a large s/w product and thought I 'd seen it all , until now . This s/w is an embarassment to s/w development . It is not user friendly , crashes continually , and has a 99 slide limit on its slideshow that makes it basically unusable . I mean who really wants to see their text on the slides after they just type them in ? I love pretending that the text is on the slide . Or my favorite - type in all of the text save it , decide to edit it again and oops , where is the text ? Oh my , you mean you want the s/w to remember your text ? The discussion groups basically say do n't use the slideshow feature for creating slideshows , use VideoWave instead . Yeah , still trying to find that simple pulldown that says `` VideoWave . '' It is buried deep in the bowels , of this slow moving s/w . I realize that this is the `` older '' version , but there is no way that I 'd spend one penny on an upgrade . If they felt comfortable with releasing this crappy s/w then who knows what they released this time . Run do n't walk away from any ROXIO product . Should have known , since the first time I used a Roxio product many years ago it only caused my machine to give me the blue screen of death . Time for this company to get the blue screen of death .
 This has got to be the flakiest software I 've ever attempted to use . It has several applications . The only one that worked is the classic cd creator , an old Adaptec program . The rest all fail . My system has a fresh XP SP2 install , and plenty of horsepower . Nero works great . I was able to find a way to burn Tivo shows with Nero as well .
 I bought EMC8 because of its support for the Tivo file format . Like other reviewers , I found that the program ran VERY SLUGGISHLY and sucked up nearly all of the resources on a dual Pentium 4 Xeon workstation with oodles of memory . I was n't able get further than adding a Tivo file and creating a menu before the program would crash.Contacting tech support via email several times elicited no response . I managed reach a tech support rep without being charged $ 35 by going through customer service ; the advice I received did nothing to resolve the issue.Don ' t waste your time or money on this worthless software.I 'm still searching for a fast , reliable way to archive Tivo files to DVD .
 I was never able to get Roxio 8 to work on my PC at all . I have been using Roxio for a long time now and generally I 've always thought they offered a good product . When I purchased Easy Creator 8 , it installed OK but as soom as I put in a black disk it would lock up my whole PC . Task manger listed the drag-to-disk program as being hung up . It turns out that this program ca n't be shut down by the Windows XP task manager -LRB- 1st program I 've run across like that -RRB- , so my only option was to remove power from the PC.I tried checking for updates from Roxio and they listed that there was a patch that would take this product up to 8.05 , so I downloaded that patch . When I tried to install the patch it said that version 8 was n't installed on my PC . Thinking something was wrong , I uninstalled this product and reinstalled it , when I tried the update , it still said my product was n't installed . Tried this again and still the same results . Checked to see if a blank disk was still locking up my system and it was.I tried Roxio 's support site -LRB- to use this you have to create a user ID and password -RRB- . They offer Phone support , but charge you $ 35.00 per incident , because I ca n't understand why I have to pay Roxio so that they can troubleshoot their bugs , I never pay for a service like this . Looked for a email option , and none was listed , instead they feature a online support tool name Roxanne . When I listed that Drag-to-Disc locked up my operating system it runs me through a wizard that walks you through troubleshooting steps , this took me through 3 steps and then returned me back to the first step again.I then tried to google on this problem , and there are lots of people with the same problem , all complaining about Roxio . Seems like this freeze up can be caused by a lot of reasons , and none were able to help me . I 'm removing this software and going to try and find a different product to work with . I think Roxio needs to make this product a bit better , before releasing this to the public , but I guess as long as they can charge their customers for supporting their poor products , they probably is n't a lot of motivation for making a stable product .
 This program added some information to hundreds of jpg files on my hard drive and changed the file modification dates without my knowledge . I usually refer to programs like this as viruses . I ended up reloading a 250 MB website because the web editor thought I had replaced all of my photos . Roxio customer service non-responsive after two days . Ended up doing a system restore to eliminate all traces of this horrible program . Does n't deserve even 1 star for all of the grief it has given me.Update - 9 days later and still no response from Customer Service .
 I 'm very disappointed with this software . I tried to make a DVD on my home computer using MyDVD and the software actually rebooted my machine while I was adding video from a file on the hard disk . I tried it again and it rebooted my machine again ! So I moved the software to my laptop from work and , although it did n't reboot the laptop , it would n't actually produce the DVD either . Basically , this is an unreliable piece of junk . I wish I had n't wasted my money . I 'm going to download the 30-day Nero Ultra Edition 7 trial and hope it works better .
 I have been a user of the Easy Media series of products from its early days as an Adaptec product . Prior to V8 , I was very happy with it . V8 is a huge leap backwards , however . It is slow , more difficult to use and very unreliable . Roxio service used to be good , now it seems non-existent . The only reason to get this is if you need to burn TiVo programs , but Roxio now has problems doing that . The message boards for both Roxio and TiVo have long lists of complaints.I would go with Nero unless you need the TiVo functionality
 I purchased version 8 and apparently was unlucky enough to get a defective CD . I left a request with Tech Support in which I fully described my problem and which contained `` screen shots '' of the error messages . The request remained unanswered for weeks after which I just gave up and returned the product.This may be a great product . I never got a chance to find out . Let my experience serve as a warning ... if you have a problem , you might as well throw the program away . There is NO help available .
 Roxio came out with a dog and will not admit it . This program distroyed one of my DVD drives , and trashed my computer . Being a masochist , I tried one more time , even trying their patches for 8 . Finally , I had to flush the system of 8 then set the computer back a week and start over . After re-installing 7.0 and then 7.5 , I was finally able to use my computer and DVD drives again . Several of us are very mad at a couple of professional magazines for giving such glowing reviews of this program . Now , it is not a question of getting our money back , we want justice . We want Roxio to re-issue a corrected up-dated working copy of 8 to everyone that legally purchased their product . If not , somewhere , somehow , someone will come crashing down on them with one of those class action law suites .
 This program is garbage , as stated in the previous two reviews . It may work great for photographs , but I bought it to burn DVD 's and it 's a complete waste of money!Here 's my story . I have an old laptop with MyDVD4 .0 on it with which I created a compilation DVD for my parents for Christmas . Everything worked okay until I went to burn the DVD and found that the laptop was much too slow . So , I take the finished movie to my office and use my Work Station computer to burn the DVD , but it 's using MyDVD 6.0 AND IT FIND ERRORS WITH ITS OWN FILES AND WO N'T BURN !!! So Okay , I 've lost a week now so I 'll get the latest and greatest version 8.0 , right ? WRONG ! ITS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE ! Not only that , but as soon as I preview my movie -LRB- yes , I rebuilt the entire 2 hour DVD with version 8.0 -RRB- THE MENU BLACKS OUT AND I CA N'T EDIT THE FILM AGAIN ... EVER !!! Supposedly , you can add music to your DVD menus . This works in all the previous version of MyDVD I have , but I could not get it to work with this version . I tried linking mp3 and wav files to the menus as background music and got nothing but error messages in so doing.NOT only does it do the above , but it requires that you uninstall DLA . That sounds simple enough , supposedly its incompatible . BUT , what they are n't telling you is that DLA IS HOW WINDOWS BURNS CDS AND DVD 's through drag-and-drop !!! This software hijacks all other ways of burning data onto a CD or DVD , then does n't work properly ! Not only all of this , but it also hogs a ton of system resources . I had to uninstall it on my work station just so I could get work done - it quite noticeably bogs down the whole system ! NOW I CA N'T EVEN BURN A CD!Another thing to note
 Everything about this new version smacks of a product that was released before it was ready -- WAY before , if you ask me . Admittedly , I do n't use many of its features , but the ones I need simply do n't work . Two examples
 I bought Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0 , and beleive me there is nothing easy about it . It crashed my computer and after I tried all the solutions to make it work , the program would not respond at all . I was lucky that I have Symantecs GO BACK program , I was able to get my drive and my old Roxio 5 back . I thought it was time for me to upgrade to Roxio 8 since it seemed I was getting behind . Little that I know that it was goin to take me all night long trying to UNINSTALL Roxio 8 and fix everything it messed up . Let me tell you , STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORTHLESS SOFTWARE . ROXIO SHOULD BE TARRED AND FEATHER FOR CREATING SUCH A PROBLEM TO CONSUMERS . If you have enemies and want to take care of them , tell them to buy Roxio 8.0 , that will really fix them .
 I bought Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 because I have owned most Roxio media creator versions going back to version 2 or 3 and found them to be very useful and reliable . Unfortunately , using this version my machine hangs about every third time I try to edit a video . Also the installation added a driver for my CD + / - RW drive which essentially made it invisible to Windows XP . I resolved the problem by buying a competitive product which worked fine on my system -LRB- after I removed the offensding driver -RRB- .
 I am a computer professional and have been heavily involved in computers for over 25 years . My experience trying to install this software is probably the worst I 've ever experienced.First , installing the software corrupted my Windows XP registry . I had to have Windows recover to earlier system settings just to get my machine back . I tried this multiple times -- each time the Roxio install corruped the registry and made my machine completely unusuable until I recovered it.So I tried to contact Roxio support . They require you to create an account to send email to support . So I try to sign up for an account . Well their account signup is broken too . You CA N'T get an account . So I tried calling them . They say they have phone support , but they will charge me $ 35 . So their POS software destroyed my machine , yet I have to pay them $ 35 to fix it?EDIT
 I have 1.5 gigs of ram on a less-than-year-old HP computer and all this progam does is crash . What a waste of 99.00 . I should have heeded the warning of all of those 1-star ratings this junk got .
 I upgreded to Roxio 8.0 in hope that it would be a more stable product than their 7.5 version . This one is even worse . After spending hours on a DVD project , Roxio would no longer open the file . Hours and my $ 69 lost . To get my system working again , I had to resort to using Windows System Restore . To make matters worse , the `` Suite '' product has several features missing -- they want you to buy the version with the useless Dazzle adapter if you want a full featured product . However , more features = more opportunities to crash your project or worse yet your system . This product is not ready for distribution !
 I just want to warn people . This product , while a big improvement over v7 , should tell you a few things before you have spent your money . Now a subsidiary of Sonic , the software is not functional until you accept a new policy which sets new standards for invasion of privacy . The lengthy agreement preceding registration warns that information will be gathered from your computer and may be shared with law enforcement and as a result members of the armed forces are warned against registration if they mind sharing what they do with or store on their PC . Most of the program wo n't fuction unless you register it . And it does n't even work with my burner which is a Sony . I am law abiding , but do n't like knowing that every time I use the internet it may share what is on my system or about my life for others to review . Make sure you are comfortable with the fine print !
 I come to Amazon a lot to look at the reviews for new products that I 'm buying . I have come to know how to distinguish between those who are really writing a review and those who only want to hear their own voice . Through my experience with this product I can tell you that every negative review for it is absolutely from those that know what they are talking about.I have been simply trying to make a slide show DVD for three days now and have had no success . The farthest I 've made it is to a 30 % burn before the software froze up . This stuff is useless . I ca n't even imagine what it would be like if I were actually trying to burn video.I know that when you want to buy a product and you find one that looks great in writing you want to think that the negative reviews are just people that are too picky or do n't know what they are doing in the first place but believe me , you will regret the purchase of this if you spent more than a fiver for it . This was the final step for a very long Christmas project for me and I 've been through 5 DVD 's already just trying to burn a video . At this time I do n't think that I have the time to get everything done for the gift . I can honestly say that Roxio has ruined Christmas for me this year.Bottom line , I am a fool . I read the negative reviews and wanted to believe that things would be different for me . Now I need to spend another eighty bucks or so on Nero -LRB- which seems to be the recomended software by those who know what they are doing -RRB- to finish my dad 's gift.Don ' t buy this product , you will certainly regret it and be out a good chunk of cash at the same time .
 EMC8 has some great features . But does it really matter when the software is bulky , hangs , or messes up your Windows XP ? Sure this software works for some people , but read through all these reveiews . Many people are complaining . No one should be complaining about the software not working . Software should work that cost as much as this does . I think we all know software that works perfectly for everyone , and other programs that you know is bulky and was n't made properly . Well this software is bulky and was n't made properly.As for everyone complaining about the poor customer service ... . yes it is true . Their website also hangs when you try to log-in . Their online help is n't helpful and is very generic . You will not be able to get ahold of a real person and it will probably take you weeks to get a response by email . This is unacceptable . I installed it on one computer and I had a newer Sony DVD writer in it and instead of burning at 16x it burned at 1x since it did n't know the new drive . Their updates do n't really work and are old.The pity of it all is that this software , if it were made better , would be pretty awesome . The features are great . But everyone reading this I am sure has spent many days trying to figure out why something on their computer was n't working or why it was crashing etc. ... . well this software will probably be the root of your future headaches . Skip this one until the perfect it . But somehow I doubt they will do this since they have poor customer service .
 I have had this software for over a month and it is absolutely horrible!First the compute I 'm using is brand new and exceeds every system recommendation for the software .1 - Crashes EVERYTIME you render video . EVERYTIME ! I have NEVER rendered anything on the first 2 attempts .2 - Audio Sync is nonexistant ! ANYTHING you injest , the audio and video are NEVER in sync .3 - Burn/Render quality is ALWAYS LOW ! No matter what the settings are when you burn or render the quality is lowered . Most video ends up looking like something taken with a cell phone , that is NOT an exaggeration .4 - Features ? It 's loaded with features ... good features . But what good are they if they never work on the completed project.I bought this software because of past , very good , exper . w / Roxio . This software will keep me from ever buying anything of their 's again.You will waste you $ 80 !
 The new version does not stand out as well as the old Roxio , 6.0 or 7.0 . - Roxio 8.0 does not burn as fast as promised . - The system requirement are too high , and it takes up to much ram to use Roxio 8.0 . For the average PC it is useless . It is not as user friendly as the previous -LRB- 2 -RRB- version . I would like to return it . The labels are not as good as the previous one !!! - I do hope the next version will be an inprovement over this one.Viola B Sith673 Alta View CourtWorthington , OH 43085
 I purchased EMC8 , Jan ' 06 , installed and registered this product . Update is offered , 114 MB update at that , I ca n't download this on my slow dial-up takes over 21 hours . Web Customer support ticket response , not helpful . Toll Free support number refers you back to self help or option of PAID help.Shortly after registering , I now receive constant emails from Roxio/Sonic asking me to upgrade to EMC-8 . This company is oblivious to customer needs . Today , they announced another bigger better EMC8 Deluxe Suite . This product was not tested in house , but sent out to retailer . I believe they are field testing on customers.This was and is a total waste of money and time .
 I purchased Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0 to archive TIVO content . This product does not work as expected on my PC ; it often freezes up and I have to reboot . The Roxio product has been available for several months yet they have NO online updates to this product.I have been using Nero 6.6 for the past year with no problems . I like the Nero product but it does not support TIVO content .
 I used earlier versions , and found them less problematic . This version 8 was a problem from the very beginning . It has compatibility problems with microsoft explorer . It is very touchy , and if you make a mistake , it is hard to correct . There are very few fail safes . The documentation just misses the boat , and appears to be old and not up to date . I tried customer service , and even paid for the support . I was disappointed with the service . This program does a lot , perhaps too much . If they focused the software , perhaps they would do a better job .
 I purchased this product in July . I have been unable to write successfuly to double layer disks . I have one ticket that has been open for SEVEN weeks . I get very generalized answers to very specific questions . The latest suggested solution was to download the lastest PX Engine , but the link provided by Roxio was only for versions 7 and LOWER . I have version 8 ; no link for version 8 PX Engine is available . It has been 27 days since my last update to the ticket without a response from Roxio . Totally worthless online support . There is no free phone support . Each call costs you half the price of the product . Do n't waste your time or money on this product .
 I was wary of ordering this software based on the sheer number of negative reviews I read on many internet sites , but thought I 'd give it a try anyway . First off , the backup portion of the suite could not schedule a job even after repeated attempts . I had to go into the scheduled jobs applet under the windows control panel and manually enter the job . I could then `` see '' the scheduled backup job , but it would not run ! I never got that `` feature '' to work . I even disabled my firewall -LRB- Zone Alarm Pro 6.1 -RRB- just to make sure it was not interferring , but the same problem persisted . The second , more serious issue , was the software would not work with my newly purchased HP DVD740i DVD lightscribe burner . It would not recognize any lightscribe discs I inserted into the drive . It would recognize a regular blank CD or DVD , but not a lightscribe disc -LRB- the reason I purchased this suite was to utilize the lightscribe labeling feature -RRB- . The last straw was that the software would load and run extremely slow . My PC exceeded all the basic requirements of the software , but it was so slow it was painfull to use . Overall , I am disappointed and am returning this software for a refund . Incidently , the Nero software bundled with the HP DVD burner is excellent -LRB- OEM version 6.6 , everything works great so far -RRB- . I 've run successful data backups , created beautiful lightscribe labeled CDs , and made a DVD all on the first try . I should have waited and saved myself the time , money and agony . Thankfully I can return this junk . Thanks Amazon !
 This program is totally a waste of money ! All Roxio has done is copy other programs and tried to present them as theirs !! This program does not work as claimed by Roxio ! I had to remove it from my PC to get it to function again!Also by buying this product from Amazon I know I would never be able to return it ! I suggest that you try another program of this type for burning CD/DVD 's but NOT Roxio and NOT from Amazon !!
 I have had good experience with Roxio in the past and this product has the potential to be good , if and when they update it . Features that previous versions have are missing here . Oh to be sure , they are on the menu , but they are grayed out and inaccessable . For instance , if you want `` Play All '' on a menu , do n't buy this product . Or wait and see if they add that feature . Go to the support boards and see the number of people who liked earlier products and have regretted buying this new one . I am prepared to return mine for refund .
 Please , for the love of everything holy do not buy this software . NEVER , in all of my life have I used a more buggy , uncooperative , slow , randomly crashing piece of software . Yes , I updated all the drivers . Yes , I attempted , fruitlessly to update the software . Yes , I uninstalled and reinstalled everything I possibly could . I had such high hopes for this software . The only thing out of all the features and sub-programs that I could get to work was the MyDVD program . It crashes constantly but I used it -LRB- because I was desperate -RRB- to create a Christmas present DVD for my family members . After endless hours of frustratingly trying to create the DVD , I go to burn it and plug it in and the video is distorted and pixelated . I try again . Tweak the settings . Nothing . Same thing . Argh ! Worthless !!!
 Do n't take these 4 and 5 star reviews seriously . And do n't take my word for it either.These positive reviews are obviously written by Roxio company hacks . If you want real opinions , check out the discussion boards on Roxio 's own website . See the frustration at a product that was not ready for prime-time . This product was not even ready for beta testing in my opinion.I bought the product to burn my Tivo recordings . It simply does not work.On their Discussion groups page you will see many postings from people who now are wishing and hoping that Roxio posts some update that fixes their problem -LRB- s -RRB- . If that does n't tell you something about how bad the product is , nothing would.Just click on the Easy Media Creator 8 link on this page
 Roxio has had a pretty good name up to now , but if you are a Version 7.5 user , save your money - EMC-8 is NOT an upgrade unless you like paying Roxio 's $ 35 support charge to debug their software.I 've wasted over 30 hours this month working through bugs like : - CD/DVD burn wo n't recognize your DVD/CD RW drive because Roxio 's own `` drag-to disc '' program has it locked up . Instead of 5 min to copy a CD , it was multiple hours figuring out why the CD/DVD burner drive is visible to every other application on the machine except Roxio Classic . - The VideoWave Video editor ca n't do even basic image processing on your video . So adjusting brightness , contrast , hue , saturation etc. is not supported . After realizing this , I did not waste more time with it - I used other non-linear editors to create clips to stich together with the DVD Authoring in EMC-8 . - The help files contain features that do n't exist in the software . Each page has a disclaimer saying `` your version might not do this . '' Who has time to sort out whether or not you 've got what version ? -LRB- BTW , they do n't -LRB- yet -RRB- even sell a version that does everything in the help files -RRB- - Roxio tech support ALWAYS takes you to `` Roxanne '' - one of those lame computer Q&A ; troubleshooters that does little to solve any real problems . Good only for R.T.F.M. type questions . - Try to burn and get an `` Encoding Error 80004005 '' -- this is so prevalent that Roxio has posted a hotfix in their support site . So remember to run the hotfix every time you run Roxio after a reboot . - Roxio 's discussion boards are full of requests for how to build menus that emulate a commercial DVD so one can `` play-the-whole-movie '' or go select chapters . There is a workaround to get it done , but it is not documented in Help or the User Guide . - Roxio 's discussion boards are full of users who experience problems with encoding a DVD -- part way through the process it just STOPS . If you do n't kill it , it keeps writing entries to the burn log `` GEV_VOBGRAPH_NO_SAMPLES_RECEIVED
 This product may have some good features but Video Wave is definitely not one of them . This video editing and DVD production software , which is of prime importance to me , is so badly messed up over the previous Version 7.5 that I feel I just threw away $ 100.00 . It literally crashes at every turn . This in itself is enough to toss it but it gets worse . The music tone/equalizer editing feature is gone . You can not drag or copy/paste from the photo/video file pane into the production - you must `` open '' the desired photo/video file -LRB- s -RRB- and then you are given several options where to place them - not included in these options is the choice to place them at the end of the items already in the `` storyline '' or `` timeline '' which is the most likely place one would want to place them - unbelievable . Gone also in Version 8 is the option to adjust the frame duration in the `` pan & zoom editor '' . This is a serious flaw as it is impossible to corridinate the time duration -LRB- s -RRB- with the pan & zoom effects . It requires guessing at the amount of desired time the effects will take or moving back and forth between the pan & zoom editor and the photo editor to constantly make the duration adjustment - frustrating in the extreme . The `` pan & zoom '' editor itself is much more awkward and less precise than in Version 7.5 . No longer is there a choice of text scrolling speed - why ?? I also see undesirable changes in some of the `` capturing '' & `` burning '' features . Example
 I 'm a long time users of previous versions , but find v8 to be riddled with bus . In the slideshow function -LRB- the primary reason I use the software -RRB- , the Auto Motion feature simply does not work . And Roxio 's support is simply the WORST .
 BUYER BEWARE !!!! Just because Roxio came out with a new version of their software does n't mean it 's either better , or even as good as the older version.I bought this to replace version 6 and am I sorry . It constantly crashed in Xp , and when it worked for more than a minute , the results were so poor , they were unacceptable -LRB- tried creating slideshows and they were so soft it was embarrasing -RRB- . Finally , when I uninstalled the program , it completely trashed my OS and I was ultimatly forced to RE-INSTALL THE OPERATING SYSTEM.When you see this many negative reviews for a product , LISTEN ! Thanks to Amazon for taking this pos back - it 's the last Roxio/Sonic product I 'll ever buy .
 This thing is HORRIBLE !! Just HORRIBLE !! I had to buy two books here just to figure out how to use it . Even then it does not do what it promises to do . You get two books on it and then you still have to go to the forums at Roxio.com and read through all the posts to figure out why you ca n't make it do what it is supposed to.I felt so mistreated by this thing I wrote a review of it at ripoffreport.com . You can read my complaints about this thing in their entirety there . Or you can go to the forums and read the laments by other owners of this software . They wish they had never given up their rights to previous versions of this software .
 I take exception to the reviewer that says `` skip the reviews by regular users and just use Professional reviews '' . I am a PC tech , had problems with earlier versions so I thought version 8 would solve them . It did solve one , but my computer became unstable and began taking 5 minutes to shutdown . I finally discovered ROXWATCH.EXE was the culprit in `` SERVICES '' . I stopped it from running and at least my PC acts normally again in shutting down .
 Roxio 7 was not the greatest product , but you could accomplish most media related amateur projects . Roxio 8 must have been coded by the two Taiwanese teenagers who wrote the Symbian operating system for my Nokia phone -LRB- they are still laughing -RRB- . Today I get a `` super offer '' on an incredible discount for the all new Roxio 9 Suite -LRB- only 70 bucks -RRB- ! I will not be the guinea pig this time . I 'll wait for another poor soul 's tearful review . Constant thanks to Hollywood and the RIAA , my DRM guardians .
 Verion 9 of this software should be avoided at all costs . It locks up machines on a regular basis -LRB- even during launch -RRB- and has no capabilities to justify the cost . This software does n't even provide a way to define the media library -LRB- stuff you want to manage -RRB- . It just grabs everything -LRB- do I need to manage icons and images from other applications ?? -RRB- . I an very disatisfied and would recommend that you look to Ulead or Nero for better solutions .
 Again I got burnt by Roxio , 5.0 now 8 is worse . I have Roxio screenimages I cant erase . Super slow and after all that waiting itcrapped out on me , I used Nero 6.6 took 4 minutes better interface.I will never accept 5 stars reviews when there are more then 21/2 stars present . Lesson learned .
 Buy it if you want to get the same for your money.Some software programmers are ripping people off by writing junk.This is one of them ...
 I got Roxio easy cd creator LE on by new Dell desktop and it never would recognize my dvd rw drive . I bought Easy Media Creator 8.0 believing it would solve the problem . It did - 8.0 recognized my drive but kept locking up when I tried to use some of it 's features . I was never able to get to a live Roxio person for help . The Dell/Roxio help person essentilly gave up and suggested I try Nero 7 as a trial for 30 days , so I downloaded Nero 7 and it seems to be problem free , so I purchased the retail version . I think Roxio and it 's installation setup is not up to release status . They should fix the problems before they sell it to the unsuspecting public ! This may be an OK program feature-wise but technical support needs to be improved .
 I bought this software and a brand new desktop computer with a dual core processor , 1gb ram etc. figuring a new system would easily be able to handle the processing requirments for doing simple videos . All I wanted to do was tape old vcrs and other family videos and turn them into dvds so we have more copies etc. . The software is very difficult to us , conflicted with my antivirus software , has terrible directions , nil support , and the performance is so slow that it is almost unusable . I went out and bought Adobe Premier Elements 2 which works much better although it needs digital content so the vcr 's had to be imported by roxio first . Amazing that it is this difficult to simply take videos that are 7-16 years old and convert them into dvd 's . this software is a joke for dvd creation and they should be ashamed to market it as such .
 I think this is my first review of a product on Amazon after shopping here for over many years . I had the previous Roxio version 6 that came with my excellent Plextor DVD burner -LRB- from Amazon -RRB- and it was fine for basic tasks . I could make DVDs , CDs , VCDs , slideshows with music tracks , etc. . I decided to upgrade to the latest version 8 of Roxio after falling for the mail in rebate they were offering . Roxio was great and sent me the rebate check but unfortunately this hobbled bits of alpha bloatware they vomitted to the unsuspecting masses have left me in disgust . I should have done my homework and gone for Nero or anything else but this junkware . All of the video components , consistently crash even after I shut off all other background or foreground applications . So far I was able to burn two genuine DVDs with EMC8 all the rest result in the program freezing over in stupidity . MyDVD8 does n't support adding multiple files nor drag and drop . The program even has the gall to pop up a dialog saying ` Test Module1 ' is not responding . Talk about beta testing . Going to the Roxio support to wait for an update/fix is no help either . The retail betaware version is the latest one . I 'm running WindowsXP with 1G on a Pentium 4 , and while no screamer it gets the job done with my free version 6 that came with my burner . If you only burn audio or data then save your money and use the software that came with your burner . EMC8 is neither easy nor creative . Caveat Emptor .
 This is one of the worst programs i have ever bought . I had used Roxio version 6 and like it a lot . Because of this i paid 99.00 dollars to get the latest version.I tried to use it mainly to create dvd 's of my personal vacations . I have had all kinds of problems . Problems encoding video , crashes , errors , . Sometimes i think everything is working thru the extremeley , extremely slow process of making a project . When it actually finishes , with what you think are no errors , it does not play.I have spent hours trying to read thru all the problems others have had and doing all kinds of things to correct the problems to no avail.This program is a piece of worthless crap .
 I have bought Roxio EMC 8 from Amazon . I -LRB- try -RRB- use it to create DVD disk from digital high 8 tapes ; also use its drag disk feature.The software has the overall impression that it was made with Dilbert 's pointy hair boss in charge . It is loaded with features , video / audio editing and burning , label making etc , but unfortunatelly a lot of these modules are buggy . A few wrong keystroke and the system locks up , sometimes completely , requiring a hard boot . It also is so slow , perhaps because it was written in Java , that it gives you the impression that you are not getting a response from your own computer but from another galaxy.There is few better competing products . If you bent on buying this product , do yourself a favor and buy it from Roxio 's web site , becasue from there you get a 30 day money back guarantee - and there is a good chance you will want that guarantee .
 The title says it all . Do not buy this product . I long for the days of ECDC 5 and pre-Windows XP -LRB- the 2 were incompatible so ECDC 5 would never work , and Roxio did not seem to care at all except to release progressive poorer versions -RRB- . Easy CD Creator 5 was excellent , had good labeling software , etc.This new version is , in a word , horrible . And the so-called Roxio online support is a laugh .
 After writing a review of EMC8 , I discovered that there is now an update available , 8.05 , which , to quote Roxio , ` helps resolve various issues found in EMC ' , . By ` issues ' they probably mean ` serious problems ' . However , the website is still offering EMC8 , not 8.05 , so you might still get the non-updated version if you order now . If so , like the other long-suffering users you can download the update , except that it is 114.25 MB , which will take about 8-10 hours on dialup . The other problem here is that if the line goes down you have to start all over again ! Roxio sure know how to infuriate ! Needless to say , I have n't managed , so in a sensible world , I 'd email Roxio and say ` Hey , you 're admitting that your software is riddled with `` issues '' , how do I get a decent version of it without having to spend all day or all night praying my line does n't go down ? ' Here we come up against another sad feature of EMC
 I have been through versions of Nero and several of Roxio . I liked the ideas behind some of the MyDVD 8 components , so I bought this version.I failed to learn from past experiences.This cumbersome program takes forever to do each task on an Intel 3 Ghz machine.Then , when you are done with a project , you get `` Unable to Save '' or `` Encoding Error '' or other nonsense . You have to guess whether the program will actually prepare the final disc or image.Unreliable junk coding . Avoid Roxio ... forever !
 I am finished with ANY Roxio product . I 've spent 100 hours and $ 150.00 on technical support and the product is still not responding . Thinking of buying this product ? Check out their website first . Their technical support is a joke . I called two days ago only to be told `` we 're sorry , we are experiencing technical difficulties at this time , please call back later . '' I 've tried loading photos and renaming them and this has become a nightmare ! I would n't wish this program on my worst enemy . It brings the word `` frustration '' to a whole new level . I 've had numerous computer specialists baffled !!! NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR SOFTWARE HAS SO MANY BUGS IN IT !!!!! The only reason I gave it one star is because of I had given it no stars , ya 'll might think I had missed the rating part of it . It gets a big fat F ! Hope this helps you because I truly would n't want anyone else to experience what I 've been through this past week ! Oh go ahead and buy it if you want to load your photo library in 6 times -LRB- yes 6 ! -RRB- . Or you want to spend hours on a photo slideshow and have jumpy parts in it . All kinds of problems ! It would be poetic justice to know that one person avoided their product from reading this review .
 I could only recommend this product and company to my worst enemies and then I would still feel guilty . Their idea of technical support is either $ 35 a phone call or a website that does not appear to work in any way shape or form . I feel sorry for anyone going to purchase this product and plan on returning my one unfortunate copy and my earliest possible moment .
 If I could give this product a 0 I would.This is absolutely the worst software I have ever used . Ca n't even open a video file to burn to a DVD . Tried to reinstall many times . The support tells me to update my video card drivers which I did . Still does not work . DO NOT BUY THIS AT THIS TIME .
 Buyer beware ! Not only was this program far from actually working , the customer service when requesting assistance was atrocious . I 've been a loyal Roxio user , but this is is , by far , the worst program I have ever installed . Besides freezing up my computer during every project I attempted , it would lock out my CD/DVD Drives . I would create a slideshow only to be unable to write it to a disc . A total waste of time and money !
 I bought Roxio Creator 6 in 2003 and use it primarily for audio . In v6 I absolutely love the feature called Audio Central . I recently upgraded to version 8 but ended up hating it because what used to be Audio Central is now divided between several different components -- it is n't as centralized as it used to be . After three days of aggravation , I removed v8 and restored v6 . Based solely on the audio features , I recommend users stick with their old version of Roxio or try another product .
 I burned DVD under the MYDVD function but when I play the disk in a dvd player I can not navigate the chapter with my TV remote . It is not a good product . It freeze up from time to time and the software wo n't tell you why . Technical help from the software web site is not free ! Menu of the software is very basic . In summary it is not as user friendly as Nero !
 I do n't know why , but I ended up purchasing both Nero 7 and Creator 8.0 At first it was because Nero 7 had so many problems out the door . I normally prefer Nero , as I have Nero 5 , but after all the trouble , I forked out more money for Roxio , even though I had problems with it in the past . At first I was surprised , with all the new feature . Though to be honest , most of the new features were already in Nero 6 , but I never had Nero 6 . : - -RRB- But then when it came to actually using the Roxio software , I started having flashbacks to Creator 4 and 5 that were just nightmares . And which Roxio never properly fixed , and when they did fix it they charged me for it . That 's why I went to Nero 5 to begin with . After trying to get Roxio support to help me resolve the issue , which they were never able to do and kept saying the problem was with my computer , I gave up . Well , to be honest Nero came out with an update to Nero 7 so I thought I would give them another try . And I 'm glad I did , as they did resolve almost all the issues they were having , though they still have few to resolve . But this brings back my faith in Nero.Now lets see how long Roxio takes to resolve their issues.John
 This is exactly why I support personal bootleggingIf you like it , buy it.If it 's trash , trash it ... no money lost!But this is only cool if you do buy it , if you wind up using it .
 I am experienced user of Videowave 7 . The level 8 version is full of small problems that make the software unusable . After several attempt to make it work right I went back to version 7 . Roxio has a reputation for putting out programs with problems . I bought previous versions and had to send them back because they either did n't work right or they tied up my system . Version 7 worked pretty good and I thought version 8 might introduce new features . With version 8 Videowave however has numerous functional problems.What compounds the problem is that their support is not there . I wrote their support and they did not even answer . If you call there is a $ 30 charge even when you first purchase the product.It is a shame because the software has a lot of great features , if it worked . It does n't . People that have had good luck with it are using the simplest features . Those features are available in Windows or for a lot less money .
 Installed ver 8 on a new Dell XPS400 . It ran very slowly but I did create a music cd from a download . The video editing did not run right from the beginning and downloading an update from Roxio did not help . When I run the software it starts ok but then stops responding . The computer then takes 5 minutes to shut down on a restart . Left a service request on the Roxio website 2 days ago ... still waiting for response . This product looks good on paper but my advice is to wait until they get the bugs worked out .
 I installed this program and ca n't even figure out how to cut a scene out of my video file . I do n't even know how to mark chapters using this kluge . The online help desk apparently does n't know how to do this either . If you want something other than to just burn cd 's , look elsewhere . Do you have any suggestions for a program that will allow me to edit video ??
 I loaded this software on a fairly new computer and had nothing but problems . Software constantly froze and forced me to restart computer . Support was non-existant . Very disappointed .
 This product is n't even worth reviewing except to say it is
 1 . The Capture does not work , ever . Sometimes it completes , but the mpg has only a fraction of the DVD . And they crippled it anyway by no longer capturing from dvd files on a hard disk .2 . If there is an easy way to edit out commercials from a video file , I ca n't find it .3 . As far as I can tell , EMC ALWAYS re-encodes the video . So you either lose data from your original MPG , or waste space converting to a higher bit rate . Why ca n't it copy the MPG as is , it is really the same format as the DVD files anyway ? TMPGEnc DVD Author does exactly that , it works great.The only thing I use EMC for is creating data discs , and it is not worth the price for that .
 MANY ISSUES WITH THIS SOFTWARE !!! 1 -RRB- Pegged cpu with RoxWatch.exe and RoxMediaDB . Found some links on roxio support where they state these `` spyware '' apps are installed without asking you and constantly scan your computer for new media . When it finds it , the media date/time stamps are actually modifed by the apps .2 -RRB- Slideshow Assistant -- BUGGY !! a -RRB- `` FIT TO AUDIO '' would n't become enabled until I went from `` BACK '' to `` NEXT '' and randomly clicking around the screen.b -RRB- `` Transistions '' do n't work . Half of my photos would n't even have a transition . One slide would have one , the next would n't have anything . Made my slideshows look very bad.c -RRB- Completely and utterly unconfigurable . You have about 5 transition styles you can use that they decided was perfect for you . The style is applied to your entire slideshow , so you ca n't have varying transitions in your slideshows .3 -RRB- MyDVD flickered like crazy when trying to use it . Crashed several times.I used this for about 15 minutes before demanding my money back from Roxio .
 I 've been through a few of these media solutions mostly for the use of video editing / dvd authoring . After spending hours with this slow cumbersome video editor i pass off the project to the authoring software only to find that none of the discs will play in any of my dvd players . I finished off the project and saved it to the hard disc to burn with Nero 7 to find out that some of the files necessary to play the DVD are missing . Recoding the project was futile so I ended up saving the MPEG streams that I worked so hard to edit so I could author and burn with Nero 7 . Seriously , you 're better off using Windows Movie Maker than this garbage . That 's not even to mention the lack of support and way this software messed up my video codecs . I wo n't buy another `` Roxio '' product again .
 I am unable to get any tech support at all from Roxio . When I attempt to log in , I get login errors , and the system to re-send the password to my e-mail address does not work . The site just keeps giving general error messages . Be warned !!! - If you can not log in , you can not get ANY support or help from these crooks . I knew their support was awful before , but I thought things might be better . They are obviously more interested in security than customer service , and now that they have my money they do n't care if I get into their site or not . 1 star because it wo n't give a 0 !!! Buy ANYTHING BUT THIS CRAP !!!!
 My main purpose to buy the software was to perform some fairly simple DVD authoring using My DVD . I have a well specced PC and am above average with my PC skills -LRB- I have used Adobe Premier Pro for example -RRB- . My experience has been very very poor . First , simply trying to add chapters has been a slow chore because it takes ages to jump through the video . I have seen this run faster using this software on a dual processor machine but it should be able to run well on my machine . It doesnt and it has slowed me down to a painful degree . Second , it simply crashes when trying to perform certain tasks . There are no upgrades available so I assume Roxio is OK with this . Third , its just damn stupid in the way it works . There is no easy way , that I can find , to simply add a button to go to the next or previous menus -LRB- the option to `` Add New Linked Button '' which is an unintuative way to say `` a button that takes you somewhere else on the DVD '' is permanently grayed out . Why ? Who knows ? Probably the same Roxio programmers who do n't want to fix the crashes!Forth , it defaults to a crappy soundtrack for a DVD menu . To change it you have to pick another soundtrack but what if you do n't want a soundtrack ?? As far as I can see - tough , you have to have one.There are a raft of other very unintuative features . A drop down at the top of the screen next to a speaker icon says ` default ' on it . How would you change the default ? Who knows!Its just really poorly designed and ill thought out . What I am trying to do really isnt difficult . The programmers for this software should be ashamed of themselves . They would n't accept a car which had a radio they couldnt switch off , which could n't move faster than 20MPH and which broke down all the time so why should you buy software which they write which works just as poorly ???? I hear Adobe Premier Elements is much better . Having used Adobe Premier Pro I would suggest you give it a try.I 've given up and will get an Apple instead !!
 After I installed 8.0 I had to reinstall 7.0 to get my previous Video Wave projects to work correctly . First , 8.0 would not display any text added on the overlay line . When I double-clicked the overlay , I could not edit the text , which was invisible . Also , the `` pan and scan '' that replaced the `` motion pictures '' edit was a huge disappointment . Even in advanced mode , Roxio seems to have simplified the process so that it actually does less than it did before
 I bought this mess as an upgrade to the free MyDVD that came with my computer . Big mistake . First of all the MyDVD that comes with the program is not the prevous version of MyDVD made by Sonic . They only share the same name . I was prevously able to capture video and put it directly on DVDs with one step . All a really needed was the upgrade to compress the video to make two hours fit . The program can not switch the input on my Hauppauge video card even though it is Windows MCE certified . The old MyDVD had not problem with this . The program also will not allow direct to DVD with MPEG2 capture cards . This is a downgrade from what I could do before . If you want to call someone and get help it will cost you $ 35 . You can join a discussion group of other people with problems however .
 This purchase has been a mayor disappointment especially in the area of burning DVDs . Burning data DVD 's has been an ordeal ! Often buring at below 4x on 16X media . Yes my drives are set to DMA not Pio Mode . Yes I have already installed the latest Plextor Bios and updates to EMC8 . Yes I have contacted Plextor and tried to contact Roxio for tech support.I have been unable to get through the process of sending a message to Roxio for help . I have tried this process several times and still no tech support . Yes I have registered the software with Roxio.The very slow burning happens regardless of the media used . These same discs often burn fine on Nero 6 at the rated speed . There seems to be random slow burns with the Plextor drive even with Nero but not as slow as with Roxio 8 . Nero 6 burns consistently at the rated speed on my Ben Q DW1655 so the Plextor has been a disappointment as well , The video capture module does n't even have a pause button and seems to have less features than the one in Nero 6 .

 I bought this program specifically to burn DVD slideshows for my mother-in-law . I have tried all DVD creation products in the `` suite '' . The preview button does not show a preview . Then after encoding for DVD , VCD or SVCD - a time consuming process - I get an immediate burn error . I refuse to spend $ 35.00 for telephone tech support and the online support is non-existent . The rest of the program works fine , but I have switched to Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 for anything to do with photo editing or slideshows . Much better results .
 I bought this software only to create DVDs of my family 's home movies . Their software claims -LRB- from the product description above -RRB- `` Creator 8.0 gives you full creative control over the DVDs menu options , including buttons , menus , backgrounds , audio and text . `` After a successful install , I downloaded the latest updates . Then I went to work in creating a customized DVD menu system for my home movies ... But very little customization was allowed . Most of the menu option settings are greyed out . And check this out
 I owned Roxio Creator 5 for CDs and it was a great piece of software , but Roxio Media Creator 8 is the worst piece of software I have ever purchased . I purchased this software for the creation of DVDs and DVD authoring . Besides blue screening my new Dell Computer , continuously crashing or locking up my system using the DVD features , I have found the Roxio 's support site is worthless . I have open issues in which I have not received a response for over 2 months . Finally after spending hours completing a DVD project , I found that the software failed to record part of the audio with the video , the audio was out of sync . I have had nothing but problems from day one and am try to figure out how I can get my money back . I would not recommend this software to anyone . Right now I am testing the new PowerDirector 5 . The trial version is easy to use and so far , knock on wood , no system crashes or problems . If you are looking for DVD software look elsewhere , DO N'T BUY ROXIO MEDIA CREATOR 8 !
 I have just removed Roxio 8 from my system after 2 days of vain attempts to burn a simple CD usable on both Windows and Mac OS -- a task Windows Explorer used to accomplish without problems . After clicking all the boxes and radio buttons the instructions say one should click to make the disc functional in any drive , I have still wasted several CDs , all of which my Mac has spit out without being able to even see them as CDs . What 's worse , while Roxio is on my system , it wo n't even let me use the Windows Explorer option.Somewhere in the complex mass of unecessary bells & whistles that came with this package there must be a simple `` Burn a CD for Mac '' option , but darned if I can find it . This software looks like it was designed by engineers , for engineers . That 's not a compliment.When I tried to remove the program through the ususal Control Panel options , Roxio simply froze the machine , attempting to reinstall itself intead . I had to resort to the same solution as others on this page -- System Restore.I wish , wish , wish I 'd visited this page before buying this pain-in-the-neck program . -LRB- And no thanks to the Office Depot clerk who talked me into buying it , too . -RRB-
 Before you purchase this product , realize that there is NO technical support unless you pay for it ... . even if you have just purchased the program . In using the Capture feature , used to produce a DVD , the audio and video are out of sync with nothing in the manual on how to resolve the problem . Everything is not covered in tbe manual . You must either use the Help button on the program or either get help from others who have gone through the same problem that you are having and hopefully has the problem solved . There is a Discussion Board online , if you can get registered . If you are an AOL user , forget about registering with that email address becuase you will not get the email you need to activate your account to then be able to email customer support . You almost have to be a genius to use this program because it appears that a genius wrote the manual . I 'm talking about elementary instructions that take you no where and explain nothing.Example
 I 've never written a flaming review of a product before , but I 've had it with this one . Do not buy this software until they work the bugs out , or else buy someone else 's software that has been debugged . I 've been trying to use this software for a couple weeks now , and find frustration at every turn . I am running version 8.05 , which is supposed to be much more stable than the 8.00 version . However , this still looks like it is not quite up to Beta testing quality yet.The basic feature set is good , and screen layouts are reasonably good . I 've only tried the DVD copy , My DVD , and label creator functions so far , am afraid to take on anything more . I had been using a lite version of media creator 6 -LRB- ? -RRB- before this , and found it very useable even if it had a couple bugs in it . While adding more features , this version has lost some capabilities of the old software -LRB- such as no more . VOB file support -RRB- , and is so buggy I 'm going crazy . Actions do not reliably occur when you click on buttons , when errors occur you often get no explanation why.The label maker has a bad habit of making text invisible & puts the picture index off the page . The `` smart '' objects behave strangely , creating duplicate objects , or showing objects from both Data disk and DVD layouts at once.The DVD copy function occasionally works , provided the source disk is absolutely scratch free . The disk copy mode gives you some hints what went wrong , but you must seek out the error message . The disk compilation mode does not support error messages , claiming the action is complete even if everything went wrong . If anything does go wrong , the program leaves behind abandoned files , even though the program has not crashed . These can be gigabyte-sized files , so the wasted space is a big deal . The DVD directory display does not always update if you put in a different disk . Videos do not reliably play in the preview window . Like a few other copy programs , you get little indication or control over the amount of compression that occurs if the source wo n't fit on the target . While the software can now copy DVDs made on a set-top recorder -LRB- a big plus for me -RRB- , the included Sonic player can not play them . I had to use an older Roxio DVDMAX player to watch them.I 'm running a 5 year old Dell computer , so my luck may be worse than for those with a new computer . However , reading the discussion group messages shows that other users have had the same problems I 've had and more .
 After a basic installation , I went to Audio and was able to create an audio CD . I then consulted the Help menu to make a label and was directed to Tools/Label/Disc menu . Clicking on this brings up a submenu . At this point , the program became nonfunctional since there is nothing to click to proceed and the directions are to click `` Next '' which does n't exist . After an hour in their Live Chat with `` Chris '' , I was able to get to the Label Creator menu via Home/Applications/Label Creator but again the program stalled before I could print a label . It is frustrating that a simple procedure such as making a CD label should be so convoluted.I also attempted to download update 8.05 without success . I have two outstanding tickets -LRB- 316965 and 316966 -RRB- logged two weeks ago on their `` Help '' site . I doubt that I will receive a response from either . I am currently looking for a video-editing program and I can assure you that it will NOT be a Roxio product .
 The instruction manual for this product is about the poorest written I 've come across in years . I had to buy two other manuals in order to figure out how to do the simplest task . I am currently most interested in generating slide shows . For this purpose , Adobe Photoshop Elements version 4.0 is vastly superior . I was able to begin creating slide shows in minutes .
 N. Solari said it best and beat me to the punch with the line `` I purchased it and found it to be the worst performing software I have ever had the misfortune to purchase . `` I have a brand new Dell Box XP-MCE . It came delivered with My DVD LE as part of Sonic Digital Media LE and it worked great in terms of ease of use . However , since much of the features were restricted , like button positioning when creating menus , I decided on a whim to upgrade the license to the next level . In doing so from the MyDVD LE menu I was presented with a web page outlining 3 suites of Roxio products . I picked this one since it had all the features shown in the product comparison as active . I uninstall the Sonic suite . Upon install of Easy Media Creator 8 , I discover a slew of greyed out options . Apparently there 's another level of features you can buy . Surprise , surprise . On top of that simple things like menu styles are separate purchase as well . Talk about nickle an ' diming a guy!Oh , then I try to use the product -- and I use the term `` product '' rather loosely here -- and crash . gdiplus : status error -13 . Trying to set up another movie and hitting preview boom `` Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library '' runtime error in mydvd.exe , then at some other point I had to kill process related to `` VideoWave 8 '' as MyDVD had locked up . Mind you now , everything was working fine with the version delivered with the Computer . I ended up uninstalling ALL my codecs and installing CCCP . That pack of codecs seemed to solve the crashes . However , I still ca n't produce viable movies . I have made at least three coasters so far . No sound version , Out of sync sound version , and horrible video version . On top of all that , I spent a good hour trying to figure out how to disable or shut off all the bundled intrusive services which you 're forced to use . The worst of which is `` Media Manager '' I WANT MY MONEY BACK!I 'm going to look into competing products and buy 2 copies . I believe that 's gon na be Nero . Side note
 This bloated software , if you want to call it software , is the absolute worst mess that I have had the experience of wasting my money on . No matter what you are trying to do it manages to mess the project up and waste your time , and assets -LRB- in the form of CD 's or DVD 's , and will no doubt wear your patience thin -LRB- as well as your wallet or purse -RRB- . I have used previous versions of Roxio and after installing and attempting to use it I experienced major crashes and have even had to re-write my hard drive to correct the problems . What made me think anything would change . I have no clue . I am experienced at producing video DVD 's and audio CD 's and use many other programs to edit my audio and video . I am also an experienced computer and software user of many years and have never experienced problems that I could not correct until now . My advice is to not even consider purchasing Roxio Easy Media Creator , if you do and have read this review you will end up asking yourself , why ? There is good software available for CD-DVD creation but Roxio is a name to avoid !
 This is a real ripoff . The SONIC people apparently purchased ROXIO and now they have this software that is a muted version of 7.5 in my opinion . The thing that bugs me the most is that they have removed all but 3 of the DVD Movie formats , and those three are not as good as the many choices in 7.5 . I 'm not surprised that SONIC bought ROXIO because SONIC is awful , but now they are widdling away at ROXIO . They want you to pay even more money -LRB- $ 30.00 -RRB- for 5 more lousy DVD menu options . That makes this a serious rip off .
 Do n't believe the `` reviews '' that give this product 5-Stars . How could so many people rate this product as `` horrible '' and then magically reviews appear right afterwards that are 5-Star !? I was enticed into buying with a discount from Sonic , but even at $ 59.00 it 's not worth it . The program when it did work at first ran incredibly slow . Talk about overhead . It adds many processes to your start up chewing up memory and hard drive space while it tries to index your hard drive . It took hours for the dedicated image search program to find all my images . Then try to create a simple slideshow ; it brought up a blank screen . Oh , and do n't forget the undocumented `` feature '' of Windows Media Player not playing MPG 's anymore after installing EMC8 . Thanks , Roxio ! After getting frustrated with this badly-written program , I rebooted my computer and was greatful to Roxio for providing me the time-filling exercise of having to re-install my Windows O/S since my computer now did n't boot anymore . -LRB- I had system restore turned off -RRB- . Oh , and of course the UNINSTALL did n't work correctly , so now I ca n't uninstall nor can I re-install to try it again . Technical Support is a complete joke.Don ' t waste your time or money with this program . Do n't believe ANY review that says otherwise . Demand your money back .
 The program installed fine , but in order to use it , you have to ` activate ' it online -LRB- as you do with , for example , Microsoft Office and Windows -RRB- . This is the first time activation has been required for Streets & Trips.The activation process refused to function on my laptop . And despite the program 's assurance that `` you can use it for up to 60 days without activation , '' the program in fact would not run at all without activation.I placed two calls to Microsoft Support about the issue . The first technician worked with me to reboot , uninstall , reinstall , etc. , with no luck . The second technician acknowledged that there is a known issue with activation on some PC 's . He suggested I could either wait for a patch -LRB- but he could not predict when one would be forthcoming -RRB- , or I could get a refund.It 's a shame , because I 've liked previous versions of S&T ; and was really looking forward to trying out the GPS features . I have n't decided whether to request a refund yet . If I keep the program and a patch is released , I will update this review accordingly .
 It is pretty amazing that you can turn your PC into a competent GPS . You can also cut and paste addresses into it.It does not work as well as the Garmin dashboard units . If I want to find the nearest Peet 's Coffee ; S&T ; ca n't do it . It can show me dozens of `` restaurants - other '' in my area -LRB- oddly excluding what I 'm looking for -RRB- . If I search for Peet 's it finds only 6 of the many dozens of Peets stores.It has a category for grocery stores and for shopping centers , but not for hardware or office supply stores.I had S&T ; 2006 and the GPS broke . I bought the 2008 thinking they 'd have improved it . I ca n't see any improvement ; it looks exactly the same and has the same odd little deficiencies.My father-in-law has a great little Garmin unit . I was a fool and tried to save money getting S&T ; .
 For anyone that does not have S&T ; with GPS it is a GREAT program . I travel to multiple clients each day and the program does a great job of mapping out the trip for me . Dropping all the client addresses into the program could n't be easier.I have used S&T ; 2006 for over a year and thought it was time to pick up the latest version . For those of you thinking of upgrading to 2008 , I have found that there is not much to see here . Other than a new perspective map view , and the auto-calculate new route , the program operates and functions the same as 2006 . Maybe it has more `` points of interest '' than 2006 , but I really do n't care ; I 'm on the road to see clients , not to find a coffee shop . If you are using 2006 , or 2007 , stay with what you have .
 I bought this program to get the latest maps and updated places like hotels . It is my 4th upgrade over the years , starting back in 2003 . As far as I can tell , this version has NO IMPROVEMENTS AT ALL over my 2006 version , is more difficult to install and it tried to attach a Microsoft `` live search '' toolbar and default home page to my system . I live in western Pennsylvania and the new Mon-Valley expressway -LRB- PA-576 -RRB- and several other new tollroads open since July of 2006 do not show up on the map ! What is the purpose of buying the new version if there are no real improvements ? On the plus side , the new GPS unit design may be a little easier to deal with , but if you already have T&S ; with GPS , do n't waste your money on this version .
 I am a directionaly challenged Realtor , so I thought this product might help . Pros
 too bad you ca n't update the maps . that , and the availability of google maps makes this just not worth anything
 I bought a copy of 2008 Streets & Trips with receiver . A couple months later the program crashed and would n't reboot . After several uninstall/reinstall attempts I began to search the web for a solution and found that many people have this same problem . The only solution was to call Microsoft support and have them fix it . When I called today , they told me the product was no longer supported as of October 2010 and they could n't help me . My feeling is Microsoft should n't stop support on a product if it has a fatal flaw with one of it 's own operating systems , unless they are going to pull it off the shelves.Love the features + GPS when it 's worked . I suggest buying 2009 .
 this was my second version of Streets & Trips - loved the first one ! not happy with this version at all . would n't allow me to update it , no contact for technical issues , and then , when I tried to load it on a new computer with Windows 7 , it would n't work at all . Microsoft 's lovely website for compatibility issues says it does work with 7 , but it sure does n't with mine .
 Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008 with GPSThe product is not satisfactory-we wanted to find our son 's church so could have a July 4 supper there with him and his wife . Address entered , not found . Went to Google maps and it was immediately shown . That is a shame , since I was such an enthusiast for my earlier version of the same software .
 I own MS Streets & Trips 2004 , 2006 and 2008 with GPS . As far as I can tell , and I have looked closely , there is no difference between the 2006 and 2008 versions . I have found , however , a number of streets on the 2004 version which were dropped from the 2006 and 2008 versions . The GPS unit works just fine with the 2004 version . Thank you again , Microsoft .
 This is no better than the 2007 Version , just adds activation scheme . I like one on my desktop and laptop , you ca n't do that with this version .
 this is not worth the money . The timing is off . It starts telling you your off route when you are not ...
 Had a problem with this product . The software is fine , the problem is with the hardware.Make sure you get the latest diver for Pharos GPS device , the old one does not work well.I had to Microsoft tech support help me get the stuff fixed.Also , the 2008 version is not very up to date and because you are buying the 2008 version in 2010 you will not get any software updates.Overall , buy the 2010 not the 2008 .
 The information support on Microsoft 's webstie is severely lacking . Updating the software does not seem to be possible ... even when brand-new . And since we had a new tollway extension in ' 07 , it would have been nice to have that ON the '08 S&T -- or ; at least updatable.I 've only tried the GPS once -LRB- when in Ft. Lauderdale -RRB- , and it did n't work . Would try it again , but I got a Navagon for Fathers ' Day ... so I do n't need it.I like the concept of trip optimization . However , it still needs some work .
 I had great hopes for this product , however I could n't get it to load on my XP OS Laptop . I am not computer illiterate however I did n't want to invest the time in a product with no visible support mechanism , so back it went .
 When in the city , it will be a little to slow to provide anticipation for turns ... Slow to redirect you to the correct address ... sometimes it gets disconnected for no good reason ... in the countryside it works well .
 great shipping.But , GPS is not good ... the voice instruction was confused , and direction by GPS was too late many times . my old navi on my car -LRB- 2004 -RRB- is much better .
 RV Park and campground POI 's are shown incorrectly to the SE -LRB- as much as 30 miles -RRB- from where they should be . Also many Canadian campgrounds are missing all together . The sites that I tested show up correctly on the older 2006 version .
 the map section is old need to update the map.need to list what date the map was printed.The new printed maps are up to date .
 I purchased this item but could not even load it . I had no idea that it was for Win95 ... I have Win 7 . Why do these people even sell these . People need to look real hard before buying software that is ancient . It may have worked when new though , so I can not rate it on how it should work .
 Thought it would be an encylopedia on America , but turned out to be a cipher .
 Let me start by mentioning that it is 10 years old . I started playing with Linux just few months ago . Someone told me that `` red hat '' is the most important Linux to learn because it is most used by businesses . Well , this ancient piece of junk would n't even install on my two years old laptop and , as I learnt it later , has nothing in common with current version of `` Red Hat '' . I was really furious , why this outdated trash that is not compatible with today 's hardware is still offered ? It is no longer supported , not even longer documented!I browsed forums and some kind person enlightened me . Do n't buy this . It will not work . Get any of modern Linuxes -LRB- Fedora , Ubuntu , Debian etc -RRB- instead ! Look on other reviews they all are from 2002 ! I ca n't remember whom I dated that year !
 RH 8 has everything going for it but one thing - it crashes often and hard . VERY unstable , the least little error leads to a crash . The performance degrades with time and crashes come more and more frequent . I have installed three times , each ending with total system loss -LRB- the file system becomes a total mess beyond repair -RRB- and a need for a fresh install . I have been using it about six months . Worse than old Windows OS !!! I want to like RH 8 , but sorry to say it is going into the trash.Intel P4 1.6 G , 256 RAM , software RAID 1 Duplex 20G ATA100 Maxtor drives
 This new version of Red Hat Linux is somewhat more user friendlythan earlier versions -- the desktop is attractive -- but there areproblems . You still have to enter your root password to simplylog onto the internet and then , once you do , the status tabdisappears somewhere on the panel . There really is no easy wayto change the configuration either . Also , there 's no `` Red HatConfiguration Panel '' either to check mount points , or changevarious configurations . I 'd love to like Red Hat , but MandrakeLinux offers the most user friendly version by far .
 I have been a loyal Red Hat fan since 7.1 . I upgraded to 7.2 and then 7.3 and was very impressed by the improvement that I saw . I recently installed 8.0 on my computer and am a bit ticked off . 8.0 is a huge leap backward . For those who say that the installation is a miracle from God , it 's not , it 's the same . There are several things lacking in 8.0 that were there in 7.3
 . . then skip RedHat . It is the no. 1 in terms of market share only because it was one of the early ones in the commercialized Linux market . I would tend to agree with some of the negative reviews on this website , and my major gripes are
 I 'll keep this short and simple . I recently purchased boxed Red Hat Linux 8.0 . I backed up my important data to CDs , and started a `` clean '' installation . After a few questions-and-answers , the installation was complete -LRB- it took about 40 minutes -RRB- . When the computer booted into Red Hat , I logged on and started playing around with things . I found the `` X Windows '' GUI to be terribly slow -LRB- slower than Windows XP , surprisingly -RRB- . Hardcore Linux users claim Linux is fast , but I now realize they mean the command-line , and not the GUI . Also , several hardware were not detected , including my genuine Sound Blaster sound card , relatively standard ATI video card , and other things . Hardware detection is not my primary concern , since it is possible to browse the Internet for Linux-ported drivers . The only real thing that bothered me was its speed and performance . My computer specs are
 The ad stated Redhat Linux 8.0 ` used ` When I recieved the shipment I found4 CD 's in the package from LinuxWorks.com `` Just like Redhat 8.0 '' . List price $ ... and $ ... shipping . Had I wanted to orderLinuxWerks , thats what I would have done.I have also had problems with the copy I recievedDisk 1 does n't check or install properly .
 I was really hopeful about this program . I have a Dell Inspiron 8100 Laptop which was already running Windows XP Pro , so I had to make a partition . This I did with Partition Magic 7.0 -LRB- a good program -RRB- . However , when I tried to install Red Hat it would n't do anything . There was no `` setup '' , no applications on any of the six CDs . Meanwhile , the worthless -LRB- and I mean really , really worthless -RRB- installation guide was of no help-it kept on telling me to use the Red Hat CD . Well , that would be great if it WAS one CD . RedHat has no customer service for 8.0 , so what did they tell me when I went to technical support ? Buy a manual . I was VERY disappointed with the company . Buy SuSe , I have seen it installed and it is a vacation . The OS is probably good , but because Windows XP users ca n't install it , and Red Hat itself does n't help you , I am guessing I will never find out . Get Red Hat 7.3 or SuSe 8.1 , but for your own sake DO NOT get this awful operating system .
 This review is true as the title describes it . I got it because I wanted to try it since I have an old computer that 's breaking down but it fast and 40 GB . It is the worst OS that was ever made . Text is so small in browser . Flash is compatible but Shockwave player is n't . No more internet games , SOB . But I 'm ok , I have a lot of computers . If you are smart , get Windows XP . Windows XP never freezes because it is NTFS not fat or fat32 drive ! Linux = Worst OS of ever ! Do you know that over -LRB- was it 60 or 70 % -RRB- 60 % or 70 % of software and peripherals like printers , scanners , blah blah blah are not compatible with Linux ? You should . Just -LSB- toss -RSB- this program.ON THE OTHER HANDIf you have an office and use office business , this is cheap because it includes spreadsheets , word programs , alternative to microsoft powerpoint , etc. . But Windows is the way to go . Do n't try it , I may be no one but I am pofessional computer technician . Sell this ... if you have it , it is just dumb . When I tried uninstalling it , it would n't let me and when I turned on my computer after using system recovery disk , it displayed GRUB . Stupid huh . Linux also copies windows . And nothing is good at all , spreadsheet zoom is n't like windows compatible word programs that displays the entire document or slide you are making . It displays PART of it . Part = same as nothing at all . Keep your OS of switch to Windows higher than Windows 2000 . The reason I 'm not saying Windows XP anymore is because when there 's another Windows OS , people would think I 'm stupid or crazy . Well that 's the review . Hope it 's helpful ! IT RECEIVES 1 STAR BECAUSE IT 'S -LSB- inexpensive -RSB- AND I CA N'T GIVE IT A 0 -LRB- ZERO -RRB- ...
 The new graphic user interface of this version has been much hyped . If you are looking for a replacement of Windows on your desktop , you will be completely disappointed . Windows version 1.0 was much superior to the Red Hat interface . Windows has evolved over the last 15 years and Red Hat is far far away from making Linux usable.However , if you are a geek and need a Linux distribution , go for it . That doesnt mean that this distribution is without problems . But those who opt for Linux in the first place should know how to solve the problems.For the rest of us - just stick to Windows - life is much better that way , as much as competitors of Microsoft might hate it .
 this should not be offered at all . It is ten years old , it is nothing like linux of today , it is like Windows 3.1 of Linux world . It will not work on modern hardware , it will not run any modern software . Get fedora or centos linux instead .
 Offering this outdated , out of support distro discredits Linux in general . It will not install on new hardware , it has no drivers , it is hopelessly outdated . Get new -LRB- on moment of writing -RRB- Ubuntu 10.10 or Fedora 14 . Avoid this distro as it will not install .
 This software has promise . There will be a new version -LRB- around $ 150 retail coming out -RRB- that fixes the current problems with this version . Many of the displays are fun -LRB- although some are juvenile and others make photos difficult to view -RRB- . The 3-D animation comes at a price ; if you are satisfied with image quality that is about 85 % of what you started with in your photos , you will love this software . Make sure that image degradation is alright with you prior to buying the software . A way around this problem is to choose an animation display that does not move the photos around very much , and also choose one that creates a small image size . In those instances the photo will be sharp . My expectations were that the photos would be displayed at the same size and with the same resolution as existed when previewed with Windows or in a software editor . Unfortunately , with my high-end PC and monitor , the results were not even close to what I was looking for which was a faithful rendition of what appears in non-animated photo display software products . And yes , my Open GL and monitor are set to the correct setting per my numerous e-mails back and forth to their excellent customer support representative.If your expectations are moderate or you are n't concerned with an absolutely sharp image when weighed against the ease of album creation and distribution , this software is for you , especially at this price . Since , as I 've mentioned , my expectations were different , I am disappointed with 3D-album 's performance .
 It is a great product , but be aware . The packages does n't tell you , but the license you agree at installation gives you only rights for personal use . No commercial usage or usage on commercial/company web sites allowed !
 It is nice but not very practical , you can not add or delete pictures , it is not easy to use , it takes a lot of space . PhotoJam 3 does the same and maybe more and it 's more versatile , easier and cheaper !
 I created an album with images from various sources that looked good with Dell Picture & Fax Viewer . I created the album with the highest quality settings and played them through Nvidia GeForce MX420 and MX440 graphic cards on 2 different systems . The image quality was real poor on the MX420 and ok with the MX440 . The most important features to me in the album is the quality of the pictures which were degraded serious . There support people responded promptly and explained the graphics cards needed special settings to get good quality . I tried these settings and got no improvement . The final comment from support is that `` people will tell me the quality I get is good for the money I paid for the product '' . In other words , what to you expect for what you paid . If your concerned about image quality do n't buy this product . It 's too bad , the features are real nice .
 Oh , how I wish there had been a customer review when I was thinking to buy this label maker . I researched as much as I could from Art Explosion 's website , asked a co-worker 's opinion and in the end purchased and hoped for the best . The wizards program is useless for my needs , and I also had trouble with shrinking the font . The clip art is childish and simplistic and the font selection is the same variety that comes with any new computer except less of them.Unless you want to make * cute * labels for jam jars , leave this one alone . I really regret buying this product .

 Ok . So 3-4 years ago I was a happy little nerd with my little neat PC . I had Norton to protect it . It worked well ; you could download it 's updates , do scans , etc. . Nothing fancy , just exactly what I needed . I program that detects viruses & all that @ # ! % instantly , that I can use to scan my PC whenever I want , and that I could update freely.So 3-4 years I get a new PC . With it comes Norton 2005 . What a piece of @ # ! % . I found that this % # @ $ does 1/4 of the job it did before . It invites me to pay 30 dollars or so SEPARATELY and MONTHLY for the other 3 programs that do the remaining 3/4 of the job ; Firewall , antihack , anti-spyware ; this stuff did n't exist 3-4 years ago . Norton did all these functions.What 's worse , it asks me to suscirbe to some @ ! # % and pay a monthly fee in order to be able to download updates and scan my computer . What the @ ! # % ? My computer 's security is being held hostage by this Symantec or whatever you call it -LRB- @ ! $ % is the real name -RRB- . I ca n't belive this ! @ $ # % . I am forced to buy a Mac.I look with fear into the future as one day my computer may ask me to insert a credit card in order to turn on . The computer market is gon na get nasty , mark my words .
 This is a really fun program - if you 're just playing with imaginary floorplans . However , if you 're trying to work on an actual house , forget it ! I 've tried various amateur CAD programs over the last two decades for landscaping and renovation plans . The underlying Punch ! program is decent , but this version is very buggy.Pros - `` trace '' option is nice , if you can get your compy 's video card to work with the program , and if you 've got the patience to do repeated iterations of the zoom feature to match the program grid to your image . - lots of options for sizes , etc. - no wait time for tech support - fairly generic format ; easy to learn for anyone used to CAD programs except when bizarre hiccups occur -LRB- i.e. , see note below about staircase -RRB- Cons - it takes over 1/2 hour to load this program as there are tons of graphics of brand name items ; would have preferred to have downloadable packets for items that are actually needed . - objects do n't move , even though they should be repositionable ; this occurs sporadically and very unpredictably - your entire plan disappears from the file , no clue as to why this happens , but it 's gone and is n't recoverable - third party applications -LRB- PowerTool PlugIns -RRB- are n't all compatible yet - using the 3D feature will often crash the program - no way to preview the print output ; sometimes it prints what you want , sometimes , it does n't - absolutely not for newbies - steep learning curve for the uninitiated and the tutorials do n't explain everything -LRB- like why your staircase , drawn as per directions , looks like an Esher nightmare -RRB- I 'm running this program on a brand new VAIO with maximum memory , graphics card memory , etc. . I ca n't imagine what a horror this would be on an older , slower computer.This program goes back tomorrow . I 'll give it another try in 9-12 months , AFTER they 've debugged .
 Congratulations to the designers of this product . They have officially created the worst program , in every category , that I have EVER used . Not only can you not delete a wall you do n't want , you can not set any relationships while drafting the layout , changing thickness of one selected wall randomly propagates through half of the connected walls , and changing the size of a wall resizes the entire chain of walls connected to it rather than MOVING THEM.This program is designed for the `` computer savvy '' ; those who do not know what Ctrl-X does . If you have any experience with any real CAD , 3D modeling , or solid modeling software , you will tear your hair out trying to get this program to draw an outline of a house with more than four walls . This programs assumes the user is not smart enough to set inside walls as inside , outside walls as outside , all while only HALF of the floor plan has been drawn . News to the developers
 I tried to install this software 6 times . Each attempt resulted in an install hang over random files not found . Finally i got it to partially install by installing in safe mode.Some features work , some do n't . This is the most user hostile install program , i have ever used.I will never buy from this company again .
 Buggy is an understatement . When trying to construct a roof , as soon as you start drawing the roof line the floorplan disappears . Yes , poof goes the roof . Extremely frustrating . The first version of this software was much less buggy . Do n't waste your money on this software . CAD may very well be the way to go . I just found out you can return this product within 90 days ... thanks for that bit of advice from someone else that wrote a review .
 This is without doubt the most unstable platform I 've ever been associated with . The software crashes every other save . They certainly need a lot more development here . But besides the platform , getting familiar with the software and its use is fairly easy . The software provides many different pre-built blocks , but if you 're design calls for something not provided customizing it is a little difficult and very time consuming . I 've not gone to construction from plans with this software and do not know how good/bad the plans can be built on . I am an engineer and a user of AutoCad -LRB- Computer Drafting Software -RRB- . I bought the software to help clients who have difficulty envision what their finished product will look like , and to this point the software does this very well . Because of the software 's problems I would not recommend it to anyone in the building/construction industry .
 Does the above reviewer work for the software company ??? Thank god for the 90 day return policy from Punch ! because I am sending it back ASAP . I purchased this program because it supposedly has a feature where you can load a scan of your floor plan . This did not work at all and I tried various file configurations . Out of desperation to start with SOME sort of design plan , I tried to load one of their floor plans -LRB- they only have 20 plans to select from by the way -- very dissappointing -RRB- , the software would n't load it because `` it could not read image . '' I ca n't believe that the software would n't even load their own designs . Finally , I tried to draw my own plan from scratch and the whole screen started flashing/flipping out before I could get the lot lines drawn . Too bad . I really wanted this software to work -- I 'm going to try Better Homes and Gardens in hope that I may be able to at least get started with my house plan .
 This ranks among the worst software that I have ever used . I have Professional Home Design Suite Platinum version 10 . You set the elevation for each floor , the program changes it to something else . Walls appear in the 3-D renderings and ca n't be erased . The keyboard shortcuts do n't work . You apply shingles to the 3-d elevations , and the program renders the windows with shingles . You try to get tech support answers to the above issues and you ca n't even get past the first tech support screen . Hello ... Is anybody home ?
 Great for people that has been using it for years , not that great for beginners ... it 's hard to learn . Even with there video tutorials ...
 If you have ever used CAD or other drafting products , do n't buy this . You ca n't manually insert wall lengths or dimensions therfore you can not use to to actually build your house . Pretty much a useless product . Other 1 star reviews are pretty much on . Very frustrating .
 If you are a computer expert , enjoy constant crashes and unavailable servers and your child has patience beyond belief then this is the product for you . This product does not work ! We spent a week trying to log on to the server which was down , then when we finally got on and registered the games and activites -LRB- which are no very good at all -RRB- take about 10 minutes to come up before you can play them . If you are hoping that you will be able to let your child play independently with this product , you better think again . You will be the one trying to navigate the instructions and reading the rules . Your child will be able to click every once in a while when you tell them to click on a certain item , but that is about it . DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT !!
 OSX may have new bells and whistles but watch out . A lot of Mac software works poorly or not at all . I am very annoyed that half my programs do n't work . I 'm reinstalling OS 9 .
 UMAX scanners do n't work in 10.2 , Veuscan does n't work , some Epson printers do n't work well -LRB- 1270 -RRB- , Quark is still behind the times in 9 . ? , importing mail addresses is impossible unless you like to write code , HELP index is gone - in ten days I average 1-2 restarts per day and have had to do one clean install . The interface is cute but I have n't been interested in cute since I was 18 . FileMaker 6.0 out of the box changes data so do the upgrade before you start to work . I 've used Macs for 12 years - threw out PCs where I worked but this release needs work along with the community . .
 I 'll be switching to a Wintell machine running ME.OS 10 changed just about every proven aspect of the Macintosh user interface . I ca n't stand the confusion of missing features and hidden access.Tens of thousands of system files reside buried deep in numerous directories . If something goes wrong , clean install is your only option.You 'll need permission from God to do the simplest of maintenance.The OS is incapable of backing itself up . Something goes wrong and you 'll be doing a clean install.Your old applications are worthless . Send another thousand dollar check to Adobe to replace those critical applications . Too bad you were just starting to forget forking over the check last time Apple made you replace all your applications . See a pattern yet ?
 1 . The difference between OS X and OS 9 is greater than anticipated . I 've been using Macs since 1987 and was a bit flummoxed at first . There 's some non user friendly stuff you have to deal with . It 's not like going from OS 7 to OS 8 or OS 8 to OS 9 , where anyone reasonably Mac savvy can get acclimated quickly . OS X is way different , too different , and different in annoying nonMac ways . Yeah , think different , thank you Steve Jobs .2 . Font rendering . Jaguar has smoothed fonts THAT YOU CAN NOT TURN OFF ABOVE 12 PT TYPE . It is absurd that the Mac , supposedly the computer for creative media artists yada yada does not give you the option to turn off font smoothing altogether . Anyone who loves to read clear sharp text will not like this .
 Some features of OS X 10.2 are definitely better , faster on OS X 10.2 than on OS 9.1 , but there are several anomalies when interfacing with a Windows dominated world , more than with OS 9.1 , such as setting up email -LRB- Outlook does n't seem to work with OS X 10.2 -RRB- , scrolling the sddress book , etc.The main problem is that on my iMac DV + -LRB- bought late summer 2000 -RRB- , I ca n't run both Classic and OS X 10.2 - the OS X 10.2 install discs told me I had to do a complete memory wipe of all my Classic documents and applications -LRB- I bought an external hard drive to store these but ca n't start up on it -RRB- . When I called Apple to see about options to run both Classic and OS X , the technician told me that they no longer supported the older iMac 's and that help was $ 49/question !
 I 've been using my IMac with OS X. 1 for 6 months and decided to upgrade to Jaguar ; big mistake , I 've had to switch the machine off 4 times in 6 hours.For a multi tasking machine , the CD/DVD drive still locks all processing whilst running , and if it does n't let go - off the machine has to goes . My firewire drive -LRB- which never let me down before -RRB- has caused the machine to lock up twice . These sort of problems were sorted out on MS machines years ago ; the ` spinning ball of death ' may look better , but it is still annoying , I find this unacceptable from a professional hardware/software . Apart from improvements to ITunes -LRB- about time -RRB- and Address Book -LRB- whatelse could they do -RRB- I ca n't see where my -LSB- $ -RSB- has gone . I love the interface -LRB- and absolutely hate OS9/classic -RRB- but where 's the software ?
 I have a Mac G3 which currently runs in OS 8.6 . When I bought my copy of Jaguar at Fry 's I was told by the salesman that OS 9 was included . What a pack of lies ! OS 9 is NOT included in Jaguar!Now I have to buy OS 9 to run in the `` Classic '' environment because my notation program -LRB- Finale -RRB- still has n't come out in a native OS X version ! The only hope I have been offered is to spend another $ 120 to get Panther so I can order a 9.2 cd -LRB- $ 19.95 -RRB- from Apple under their Fufillment program.I know a number of Midi sequencers have updated to OS X , but anyone who runs legacy apps or equipment on their Mac will be bitterly disappointed ...
 Wow , it 's amazing how many people can see into the future ! I know that many people already have Jagular in some form or another , but one guy gives it 5 stars and admits in his `` review '' that he ca n't wait to get his hands on a copy ! What it amounts to is that the average score of these reviews has little to do with the actual worth of the product itself , and is more like `` average anticipation '' of how much people are looking forward to it.And half of this copy sounds like it was pulled straight from the hype on the websites ! If I hear the phrase ` UNIX underpinnings ' one more time I 'm gon na scream ; -RRB- I was n't going to giving a rating , since I do n't know how good the product is , but apparently I 'm forced to , so I 'll give it 2 stars to counter some of the ballot box stuffing . I will say that 1 -RRB- Jaguar looks awesome -LRB- speed , cool new stuff -RRB- , but 2 -RRB- it looks like I 'm going to have to pay for a bunch of features I did n't ask for and/or ca n't use -LRB- ichat , inkwell , Quartz Extreme -RRB- , just to get the bug fixes that should have been fixed in 10.1
 I ca n't begin to express my disappointment with Mac OS X. I recently upgraded my beige tower to OS X and now need to downgrade to 9.0 to make it work . There are three main problems . First , OS X disables the printer port so you have to buy a new printer in order to print . Second , it disables the floppy drive ; it only allows for CD drives or zip drives . Finally , although my system exceeded the minimum requirements , it is very s-l-o-w . For instance , Netscape takes 30 seconds to open a new message window . I strongly recommend against upgrading to OS X . If you have a new computer , it might work , but for an old one stay with the tried and true . My next computer will use Windows ; I am disgusted with the Mac .
 Apple should not be able to charge 120 dollars for a point release . Thats completely ridiculous , and now you have to pay for their `` guarenteed free '' . mac services . Garbage .
 $ $ $ $ for a bunch of bug fixes , and things that should have been already done , e.g. multithreaded Finder , system optimizations , gcc 3.1 , etc.The rest of the `` features ''
 Wrong price here folks , I 'm not about to buy this upgrade when just around the corner we can probably expect another small upgrade . What else bothers me is Apple 's new . mac program . . it looks like another thing we have to pay for ! I think that I 'll be `` switching '' to Windows XP pretty soon .
 i 've been a loyal mac user for almost 17 years . this one is a major disapointment . there 's almost no control over this os . you just ca n't customize it . it 's slow , a lot of my peripherals still wo n't talk to it . there 's still tons of missing software that make it just plain impractical . it costs a lot to update all the old software , yet there 's no added functionalitiy . as far as i can tell , it does nothing that os 9.2 ca n't do -LRB- and do better -RRB- . it claims to be bullet proof but this not the case it 's allready crashed . this was a waste of money and i highly recomend that those of you who have os 9.x stick with it . maybe i 'll try again with os XII or XIII , if apple is still there . uncle steve made a giant mistake here .
 Do n't be left out with what 99 % of personal computer users enjoy . Stick with the mainstream . Be part of the masses . Windows XP is faster , more stable , and has more options than Mac will ever have . Why should you feel left out ?
 Yes , I 'm a Mac fan , and a MacOSX fan like anybody else - but , so far , I am disappointed with this release .1 - printer drivers that work with MacOSX 10 , 10.1 and 10.15 do n't necessarily work with MacOSX 10.2 , and some printer manufacturers have n't yet figured out how to suport the new OS .2 - Classic mode does n't work for me in 10.2 nearly as well as it did in 10.1 . -LRB- I 've been going back into Classic mode in hopes of being able to print there - but I ca n't keep it running well enough to do so . -RRB- 3 - the mail improvements are minimal . Address book ca n't import from other programs , like Entourage , anyway .4 - Help files are incomplete . For example , there 's no entry in the Mail program 's help index/search for `` bcc '' . The only thing about version 1.2 that seems worthy of praise is the expansion of Sherlock - but I 'm using Sherlock mostly to search for drivers , or release dates of drivers that might fix the many compatibility problems I 've been encountering . So I 'm simply using my new Mac features to contend with the system itself.I am downgrading my computer back to 10.15 later today , and will stay there until the peripherals community catches up , and the various patches for Classic compatibility and the Print Center are taken care of.This is a minor upgrade in terms of feature improvements , but effectively as time-consuming as a major upgrade .
 Be aware !! The First Accounting 2004 version is not backward compatible with the older version . Whatever information you built in the previous version can not be transferred to 2004 unless you upgrade to premium version , which means you have to pay a lot more for something you do n't need and for just getting the conversion support .
 This product is too complex for a small or home-based business . Try Peachtree First Accounting for something that wo n't take up all your time.Also , beware if you use a high-end version of Windows - they claim `` Product will not operate in a Windows Terminal Server Environment using Windows Terminal Services '' . Well , ignore the `` using '' part of their statement . It wo n't work if terminal services simply _ exists _ on your machine , whether you 're currently using it or not ! I guess they are concerned with piracy , but this is over the top , and I doubt even applicable to this product considering its intended audience and use . It 's not like everyone in a small business is going to be running this software via terminal services to access a single installed PC . The business owner is just going to run it as needed . In any event , this would not be an issue had one of their developers spent 5 minutes extra and put the _ proper _ check in - do n't check for the existence of terminal services , but rather check to see if the user is logged into the console , and if so , let it run , else do n't .
 I got this product -LRB- Accounting 2004 -RRB- to run my small business . I would not recommend this product to anyone.I tried running the included tutorial to learn to navigate around this product , but the tutorial was meaningless to someone who is new to accounting principles - the tutorial is simply a imaginary company with imaginary data . It just shows you in which `` bin '' each of the imaginary data goes , but does n't help you to correlate your information to the imaginary data and then into the `` bins . `` This is particular true for me since the tutorial provides for a typical products based company -LRB- i.e. lots of invoices from vendors and some invoices from your company -RRB- , while my business is a service business - much like the audience for this Peachtree product . I could n't fully service business information on top of their product based company tutorial.The final straw that made me junk this product before fully implementing it is that this product does not -LRB- or at least I can not find -RRB- understand setting up multiple checking accounts and/or setting up a trust account.In my line of work I handle trust money and must account for each client 's trust money in a pooled trust account . I do n't believe this product gives me that ability and upon a call to Peachtree customer service , they would not answer this basic question without requiring me to pay for a service plan . The help file and online help community was likewise unhelpful . Yes , they offer 30 days of free customer service , but my issue cropped up after the 30 days time period.In short I am out a bunch of money for a product that I will uninstall . I do n't even think I can sell it at a substantial discount legally . I would recommend Quickbooks instead of this thing .
 This software could be good if you are an experienced accountant . However I think it is very complex and hard to work with if you want it to be simple and fun to work with . Good luck in your selection .
 DO NOT BUY PEACHTREE if you want to enjoy your experience.I own a small business with 2 peachtree users . Myself and my bookkeeper . My Bookkeeper works remotely , guess what , she can not use 2006 on terminal services even though 2004 worked fine . What 's up with that?They keep sticking their hands into our pockets , charging more for upgrades , support , services , etc. . I am seriously considering a switch to QuickBooks .
 I have used Norton/Symantec software for over ten years . The dependability of Ghost 2002 encouraged me to buy the supposed upgrade `` Ghost 2003 . `` Three times Ghost 2003 rewrote my boot sector and would not let me restore it . When I run Ghost 2003 in pure DOS mode , the software can not see either of my two hard drives . I have spent days restoring my hard drives from scratch because Ghost 2003 create its own partition on my hard drive . Typing `` ghreboot '' does not return the computer back to Windows . At least the three times , I ran Ghost but had to restore my hard disk from scratch because Ghost 2003 left my hard disk in overwritten and unrecoverable -LRB- ironic -RRB- because this program just does not work.In researching the issues on the Internet , it would seem that the Symantec help desk , others customer comments , and tutorials simply confirm that my experience is not unique.If I do not receive a version through the `` Live Update '' that works as advertised , I will seek legal advice concerning compensation for the misleading advertisements and the hours of time I needed to spend restoring my hard drive . There should be a law against selling a product that does not work as adversited , especially when the previous version did work.Symantec should be ashamed of itself for releasing this downgrade to Ghost 2002 . Calling it Ghost 2003 makes one believe that this is an upgrade from Ghost 2002 . This in itself has been misleading.Symantec software engineers and CEO should feel embarrassed for releasing this product to comsumers who used to have trust in the Norton name . It is products like this that bring understanding to the issue of technology stock has been losing ground . Without trust , what is there ?
 Installed this on a 2.6 ghz Pentium 4 Gigabyte system with 1.5 gigbyte DDR , two 160 Maxtor harddrives , and a Sony DVD DRU-510A . Took an image direct to the DVD+R and Ghost reports success . Ran the Ghost image integrity check and it fails at 9 % with data corruption . Tried this over with media Memorex DVD+R then Verbatim DVD+R . No luck , same results . Sent in complaint to Symantec . Got canned response saying the DVD drive is not on list of tested drives and to take a image to file and use other software to copy to DVD.Took image to file on my other disk . Ghost reports success so try to do the integrity check which fails with data corruption report again . Maybe some bad memory on my machine , so ran memory test overnight -LRB- 9 hours -RRB- with a stress test . AOK . Checked disk drives using utility from Maxtor . AOK . Gave up on using this product so I used the program Simple Backup supplied with the Sony DVD which worked.Conclusion
 I have bought Symantec 's System Works 2003 , that includes Ghost 2003 . Since I need a semi-professional solution to back-up my servers and I ca n't really rely on Win2000 's backup -LRB- it 's terrible for backing apps -RRB- , I 've got the Symantec product since it was the cheapest semi-professional solution out there.The s/w has a easy to use and understand GUI and it looked quite promising initially.However , my first attemp to back-up a Dell server that has 2 hard drives was unsuccessful : - you can not select both HDD 's -LRB- no big deal -RRB- - the first drive is a 40 GB and is 3/4 full . It took a long time to back it up -LRB- no big deal again -RRB- . Then I went back to verify the image I 've got on my external USB drive . It was fine for the first span -LRB- a total of 4 spans with high compression , since the max file Ghost 2003 can write is 2GB - I guess this is a DOS limitation though -RRB- . Then , Ghost tried to get to its second span , when it hit another snag - it could not recognize its own file ?!? Suffice to say , if you have a large amount of data to back-up , you have to verify the integrity of the image . Do not assume it is OK!OK , I said - maybe there was something wrong with my first try , so I 've tried a second time . Same problem.Before my third attempt I 've read the manual :--RRB- so I can understand how to use command line parameters.I have tried a '' - split = 4600 '' so I can then copy the resulted files on my dvd-r drive -LRB- obviously , I have n't read the full manual - my mistake -RRB- . Ghost started to do its thing , then it reverted back to Windows stating illegal parameter . How much extra work would have been for Symantec to build a parameter check before attempting to use those parameters ?!? Really silly design ... Anyhow , the correct '' - split = 2048 '' worked and I 've got again 4 resulting span files . The integrity check result was OK as well , so I was starting to feel almost OK about this software.Then I went to back-up the second drive . I 've inputted the new file name -LRB- different from the first one , but starting the same `` Dell02 _ * '' -RRB- , but I used the same folder on my external HDD . Bad idea ... The s/w created the first backup span file and then the next one . Of course , since it used the same generic name for the second span file it overwrote the previous back-up . This is a totally stupid design!So , in conclusion
 I have used Norton products for the past few years and most are generally pretty useful -LRB- with the exception of the infamous crashguard , but we can all forgive -RRB- . I have used Ghost 2002 many times to clone hard drives and make backups with no problems . However , I tried to use Ghost 2003 to clone two drives in a RAID-0 configuration to a separate independent hard drive , and somehow it failed and -LSB- ruined -RSB- all of my data . I am now an extremely disatisfied customer and will not be recommending Ghost 2003 to anyone soon .
 I bought Norton Ghost 2003 and installed it on my Dell computer . I then ran the backup facility . The system went to DOS and hung . Nothing would induce it to go back to Windows as it had created a virtual disk partition with software that would not run on my computer . I went on the web and found that it does not run on computers with new hard drives -LRB- SATA -RRB- . I called tech support and they wanted big bucks to fix the problem . There is no help for the problem online .
 I bought ghost to copy an image of my old hard drive and transfer it to my new hard drive on a laptop . I tried to use the peer-to-peer tcp/ip connection to copy the old hard drive image to another machine as a file so I could retrieve it after the new hard drive was installed on my laptop . I spent 3 days fixing problem after problem and researching the tech support knowledgebase until I finally gave up . I found myself manually configuring the nic card driver files and editing the ms-dos system boot files . If your nic card is n't available in the list of only 130 available templates , you need to manually create one . The list included a host of brands I have never heard of , but yet for a well-known brand like Netgear , it contained only 1 nic card template . Of course it was n't one that I was using . In addition , the msdos system files needed to create a ghost network boot disk can only be obtained from a Windows 95 or Windows 98 startup disk . Now , this might not be a problem if you are running W95 or W98 , but I am running WinXP . The tech support documentation claims that ghost will accept msdos files from a disk created in WinXP , but it does n't . I could go on , but I think I have made my point.I am returning this piece of trash software and I want my money back . The time I spent troubleshooting all its problems is worth far more than what I paid for it .
 I bought this program because it was advertised as being able to backup an image to external firewire devices ... . EXCEPT the ever so popular Maxtor drives which I happen to own 2 of . So , since I always want to keep my image stored off of my actual pc , I need -LRB- 16 -RRB- cd 's and spend a lot of time swapping out discs when I want to update my image which takes a couple hours out of my day . It sure would have been nice to know the `` fine print '' BEFORE spending good money .
 I 've owned Ghost , and a number of other Symmantec products . Unfortunately , I have found their support to be AWFUL . If you ca n't find your question in `` Commonly Asked Questions '' on their website , you 're out of luck . If you email a question to their tech support , they simply refer you back to their commonly asked questions -LRB- FAQ 's -RRB- on their website . After becoming thoroughly disguisted with their products , I tried to uninstall them from my computer . That too , is next to impossible as it often requires going into the system registry . If you want to upgrade a Symmantec product , you must completely uninstall and remove any previous version -LRB- s -RRB- . Therefore , you are n't doing an upgrade , rather , you 're deleting all your previous saved data and then installing completely new headaches for yourself . Symmantec products , in my opinion , are really BAD news .
 Although I am hardly a novice PC user , I must say that it never occurred to me that the functioning of an archiving software product would depend so much on hardware.I have a Toshiba internal CD drive with XP , not even a year old , but it turned out that this drive was not on the list of supported CD drives . By the way , the system requirements on the box do not make it plain that this product supports only certain CD drives . YOU MUST CHECK THE SYMANTEC LIST OF SUPPORTED CD DRIVES BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER THIS PRODUCT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU.I have used Norton products for years and have been very satisfied . However , I must say that Ghost 2003 has been a sad exception . I tried 650MB and 700MB good-brand CDs , but got the archiving process to complete a system-image backup and verify on CDs only once out of maybe 10 tries . My latest try got through 7 out of 8 CDs and then bombed out with an error.In reading the reviews of the Acronis and Powerquest archiving software products , I see that they do n't get consistently high reviews either . It appears that either the software works on your hardware , or you 're out of luck as far as archiving is concerned , and you may blow away your disk . Most of the reviews for all these products are 1 or 5 , not many 3s .
 Like alot of developers all i needed was a basic imaging tool , nothing fancy and after reading how everyone swore by 2003 i bought the product . Bad move as symantec NO LONGER SUPPORTS NORTON GHOST 2003 . This product is dead as far as Symantec support is concerned . To quote there web site `` We no longer provide technical support for Norton Ghost 2003 . To continue receiving support , we suggest that you upgrade to the latest version of Norton Ghost , which we offer to previous users at a discounted price . `` You are pretty much on your own or at the nercy of message boards as far as installing or degugging this version and believe me i had quite a bit of debugging to do on this product especially as i run MS XP Pro SP 2 . I therefore agree with a previous reviewer who stated that selling this product is a ripoff ,
 1 star is too much for this product . It is completely incompatible with Windows XP , and technical support is very slow and utterly useless . The program always crashes under XP and has never worked regardless of whether you run it from DOS or Windows . I have contacted technical support through email over 10 times , and they consistently repeat the same suggestions that I had already tried on my own . They do not even bother to keep a record of what they have already tried . I have not bothered to pay the $ 30 to call technical support for more useless suggestions . While I have wasted my money on a product that has never worked , I hope that you will learn from my mistake and buy something else . If you have ideas for a working alternative for backing up an entire hard drive , please post them here .
 I agree - one star is too much.I am running XP on a two computer network with a 250 gig drive connected to the router for backup . That 's three strikes against me in trying to get Ghost to work . It does n't like XP ; it does n't like networks and it does n't know about big backup drives -LRB- but will probably work if you want to make a backup on a dozen cds -RRB- . The engine in this turkey is DOS and seems to have been bought from Iomega some years ago . It is covered up with slick tutorials . In trying to make it run on my little network it demanded a network driver . I do n't have one and I do n't know what my nic requires because Dell sent it all complete and , although hardly a novice , I resent being asked for information at this low system level . In this enlightened age it hardly seems customer friendly.I despaired of getting Ghost to work on my network so I plugged the backup drive directly to the desktop . To perform a backup , Ghost then demanded an entirely clean disk . Exactly what I want to avoid . Perhaps it would be possible to partition the drive and get this turkey to work but I have run out of time and patience.On line support was a guy named Arun in India . Friendly chap , anxious to help , weak grasp of English , and his advice seemed to be canned fragments of wisdom and tips from a library.I use the Norton antivirus program and it works well but is mortally slow in loading.Unless you want to use many CDs for a backup do n't get this program .
 After 3 days of trying , I still do not have a `` backup '' of my computer 's hard drive.The manual is jargon filled and does not adequately explain how to use the product or explain errors . The on-line help -LRB- and the manual -RRB- does not explain error messages . The product itself is a very old DOS based product that is very loosely wrapped to work in Windows . If you do not know what a `` Command Line Switch '' is , then stay away from this product.My first attempt was using the `` intuitive '' windows interface . I got to one dialog that indicated I should install the driver for my USB2 .0 external drive . In the next dialog , it said something like , `` if you have ANY USB1 .1 devices , then you MUST select USB1 .1 '' . USB2 .0 is about 40 times faster than USB1 .1 . There is no explanation that I could find that would help me to use the capabilities of the USB2 .0 connection.I chose USB2 .0 and after the PC rebooted it hung , so I guess I was supposed to use USB1 .1 . I then started over and selected USB1 .1 . After completing the wizard it rebooted and started the backup . It said it would take about 5 hours to back up my 20GB of data/files . It was slowly going along until it got to about 2GB of data backed up . The display showed a strange error message . I looked over the box and started reading the manual that came with the software . It was not until I came to page 64 -LRB- ! -RRB- that there was any mention of size limitations . I needed to go to the `` options '' section and then find the correct option to enforce `` spanned '' image files to back up more than about 3 GB of data.The options are in alphabetical order in the manual , and I needed to visually scan through about 100 different options and their descriptions before finding '' - span '' . Ok , so I finally get the '' - span '' option to go past the first 2GB of data . Ghost worked for about 5 hours and the status in the log file says , `` Success '' . I go into the `` Image viewer '' to display the contents and it says : Not a ghost image fileThat 's it . No other information . There are 8 files on my external drive , each one about 2 GB in size written by Ghost.I go to the `` Image integrity check '' and it says : Not a ghost image fileI then go to the support website which indicated that I should update to the latest version of Ghost . I did that and restarted the backup again . Another 5 wasted hours and again the same error message after a `` successful '' backup : Not a ghost image fileI went to the Norton Ghost website and did a search on the error message `` Not a ghost image file '' . The message could not be found!All I want to do is back up my C
 Stay away from this product ; it does n't work at all and I want my money back.I bought Ghost because I wanted to dump a snapshot of my hard drive to CD-R 's , to recover from disk failure without having to manually reinstall everything . I planned to take a full snapshot using Ghost every couple of months , and backup my user files every couple of days using the Roxio easy cd creator -LRB- which works just fine -RRB- . I installed Ghost , and asked to create a backup of my entire `` C : '' drive to the CD writer . Ghost reboots the PC into DOS mode , and starts writing to CD-R 's , asking for a new CD-R when it fills one . Everything seemed to be going fine , until Ghost crashed while writing the 10th -LRB- and last -RRB- CD-R . I rebooted to Windows -LRB- XP Pro -RRB- and did a `` live update '' , figuring such blatant bugs should have been fixed by now . Then I tried again . Same thing , except this time Ghost crashed while writing the 5th CD . Hey , that 's a 50 % improvement , right?To Symantec 's credit , this turkey does n't work while taking backups , so that I know that I do n't have a backup , instead of pretending to work fine while taking backups and then croaking during the restore -LRB- though I see that another reviewer ran into exactly that problem -RRB- . I want my money back , along with 15 CD-R 's to replace the ones Ghost destroyed . For the monthly or bi-monthly snapshots , I 'll instead buy a new hard drive and do a block by block copy of the old . You should too .
 I have programmed and installed PC software for over 15 years . Most of my experience is using Ghost with Win98 . I spent many , many hours learning how to use this product . IN MY OPINION
 There is no support at all , and the product does n't work . I have not been able to complete one full backup , despite using three different remote hard drives on two different machines . Simply wo n't work . Do n't buy it -- a complete ripoff .
 If you are thinking about buying norton software simply because they are free after rebates , then reconsider it . Although it 's well known Symantec makes reliable softwares , When we talk about their rebates , they are liars . Yes , liars Cthey really deserve this . Based on my personal experience , I even think theirs are worse than the notorious I/O Magic 's -LRB- aka , Hi-Val , Digital research -RRB- . I bought several Norton softwares during last December , and submitted the upgrade rebates right away with required items , Guess what , until today I got only one of them , and it has been almost 6 months . I guess they are testing my memory but unfortunately I kept a good record of every rebate I submitted . That 's what we should do if we are going to buy Symantec softwares with rebates involved , although the best thing I would recommend is to avoid as long as you can .
 I have been using Norton products for many years to keep my Hard drives working . Ghost has failed me . I backed up my Hard Drive 3 times using Ghost and when I had to recover from a corrupt MBR , none of the backups worked .
 It is misleading to call this a backup program . The program does n't `` backup '' files , as is generally understood . It images the disk . Disk copy programs can be had for a lot less .
 My initial impressions of Ghost 2003 were very good when doing simple backups . However , we needed to clone a new Dell PC running Win2K Server . Backing up to a mapped drive failed to work using the supplied Intel PRO 1000 -LRB- this being the exact network card in the Dell -RRB- - NDIS binding failures . Backing up to an IOMega USB 2.0 external drive failed - it would intermittently hang . We repeated with different setting -LRB- USB 1.1 etc -RRB- , but it was decidedly flaky . All in all it failed to do the job we needed , and have had to resort to building the other PCs manually . We wasted a lot of time trying this , and now have the prospect of building everything manually!This is a very , very disappointing product .
 Is very iffy when it comes time to recover your images . Works well most of the time , but is finicky enough to really hurt sometimes . Error messages are very cryptic . I have to use it because we have images made for this version . We are trying to convert to a newer -LRB- Ghost 15 -RRB- version , now .
 Drive image 2003This product and the support suckIf you have a lap top and a usb drive you are out of luck . Or at least the version I bought in January 2005 did not support this configuration . It gave me some kind of error message so I looked on line with little result except that some one with a similar configuration recommended getting a competitors product . So I called support . In voice Jail I was told that I would have to pay $ 30 or something like that to talk to a human . After waiting on the phone listening to muzak for 2 hours -LRB- I am not exaggerating -RRB- I hung up . I emailed the tech support -LRB- which is free -RRB- and some time later got a response that pointed me to a web page -LRB- that I had already read -RRB- but on reexamination said that I could not back up my disk to a USB drive -LRB- tuff luck ! -RRB- . It never mentioned this on the box and the clerk never mentioned it either when I described what I wanted it for . In fairness to the clerk I may not have mentioned weather it was a lap top or not.Unfortunately I can not return this $ 70 peace of ! @ # $ % as I sent in the bar-code for a rebate . I plan to avoid all products from this company in the future if at all possible . Now I am trying to find that web page that recommended a different product.A '
 Only a limited number of DVD + R drives are supported , for example it does not work with my TDK 420N . Symantec Tech Support 's suggested solution
 I bought and installed Ghost 2003 on a computer running Windows 98 and using NTI CD-Maker 2000 . Ghost disables the writing ability of the CD Writer for any purpose , not just for use with Ghost . When I uninstalled Ghost , the CD Writer again worked perfectly . As far as I can tell , Ghost is absolutely useless with the system that I have . It might work on other systems , but I did not buy it for other systems .
 I also bought the Norton to back up to my external Maxtor Harddrive -LRB- which I found out it does n't do -RRB- . Not only was the help menu complex but it required more than just an average knowledge of computers and how to back up data . I bought it for an easy back up and it turned out to be too much for quick back up jobs.I 'm sure it 's a great product for more advanced people . But for those of us who want to push a few buttons and back up our files this is not the product to buy.Just my .02
 The consept is good . The setup is like a board game and is perfict for kids under 7 . The bad paart is if you play single player and the computer is your opponent you are certain to lose . the computer always wins nomatter what . It is only fun if 2 people play together . So , unless you have a person to play the game with , do n't get it .
 Unfortunately this is not a good software .1 . There is no system in presenting information -LRB- lessons not really lessons -RRB- 2 . They could combine all 5 interactive CDs into just one ! Each of them has no more than 140MB and `` Black Belt '' CD has just 25MB ! So , all that `` 8 CD set '' is nothing but an advertising trick ! 3 . There is a Chinese -LRB- pinyin -RRB- - English dictionary but there is no English - Chinese one ! 4 . Could not find any info about how to write Chinese charactersOverall , may be good for those who already know at least 300 characters and currently studying Chinese -LRB- like in college or with a native -RRB- but for independent study - below average .
 Wow , I wish I had read these other reviews before buying Instant Immersion Mandarin Chinese Deluxe . I 'm a beginner trying to learn the language because my girlfriend is Chinese . But when I put the CD in , the autorun takes me to a screen where I can choose from several different lessons . But there is no explanation as to what lesson to do first and when I browse around in the different lessons , I still do n't get any clues about where I start . Surely , as a biginner , I would think they would tell me `` Do this lesson first '' , etc. , but they do n't . I contacted their customer support and their only answer was `` Do whatever one you want to do first '' !! Wow , that may work for someone experienced in Chinese , but for a total beginner like me I have no criteria or hints as to what one to choose first , and when I choose one at random , I 'm lost in the lesson . It 's clear that 's not the one to start with . Help me !! I want to learn Chinese , but clearly this is not the way . Do n't buy this software unless you already know Chinese somewhat -LRB- I 'm basing that on other reveiws I read here -RRB- .
 The editorial review for this CHINESE software above states `` Start your study by mastering Hiragana , Katakana , and basic Kanji ... '' Hiragana , Katakana and Kanji ? Chinese does not use Hiragana or Katakana and the `` Kanji '' are known as `` Hanzi '' , so goodness knows what you are getting with this software ! Steer well clear !
 I 've been trying all week to figure out how to get this program to put my show on a disk - any kind ! It 's been a totally frustrating effort ; following all the cues both in the program and in the forums produced a show that I could only see on my computer that was about a 10th of the size of the recorded show and the graphics looked like I was using a Commodore 64 computer ! I 'm very disappointed with this software ; upgrading from the Pro Platinum will cost $ 159 ; I 'm hoping another program out there will show up that 's more user friendly .
 This product DOES NOT work with the new Windows Vista software . The manufacturer 's support department did not at all respond to my e-mails .
 I wanted to use an inexpensive program for things like wedding albums , my kids pictures and such . Intitially 3D Album was a little difficult to figure out , and seemed counter-intuitive . The most difficult part of 3D Album is working through the constant crashing in the middle of using 3D Album . It seems to crash about every 5 minutes . On the plus side , I contacted the people at 3D Album and they were very helpful and friendly . Its too bad the program is n't the same . I made sure that I have the latest updates , and yet the programs still crashes . I have about 15 years of experience with computers and video editing programs . If 3D Album could do what it advertised to do for the low price , it could be a winner . A person would be wise to wait until the bugs are worked out of this program before spending hard earned money .
 This software is difficut to use , slow -LRB- even on my P4 3.2 GHz HT w / 1GB RAM -RRB- , and does n't do everything that the box and the users guide states . The tech support is poor , and they apparently do not understand proper english .
 Some people really love this program , but I do n't get it . What bugs me the most is that it does n't use the standard windows buttons and layouts . I must be really dumb , but I ca n't figure out how to save my slideshow because there is no save option ! So if you want to create an album and make a few changes and save it as something else -LRB- so you can compare the two -RRB- , as far as I know , you ca n't . After checking the help groups and reading tips , I sort of found out how to do it , but it was so complicated . I had to go into the file I originally saved and make changes there , not in 3D Album itself . How convoluted!But I could put up with that if the albums themselves worked . I tried two different albums , both had the same problems . They would freeze after flipping through a few pages . The album would end , the book would close and yet my pictures were still flipping in mid air . The shortcut created on the desktop would open the album but noting else , it would crash everytime.If you want a really good photo editor and a good slideshow -LRB- it wo n't have 3D backgrounds , maybe if you create them -RRB- try Ulead 's PhotoImpact XL . For the price you get 1000 times more product and it works 100 %
 I purchased Cyber Alert because I have a 12 year old bipolar son who is enrolled in online schooling . He had developed inappropriate viewing habits so we purchased Macafee Family Security Suite . It worked to keep him out of trouble and focused on his school work . The software expired so I looked at re-purchasing it . I came across Cyber Alert which seemed to be an upgrade to Macafee . Macafee did not provide screen grabs or log keystrokes . I purchased Cyber Alert . The trouble started with the download . The software would not accept the registration code . Several e-mails to `` tech support '' and I figured it out on my own . By the way premium tech support means they will e-mail at their convenience and repeat questions like what browser are you using ? , What version of windows are you running ? Did you restart your computer ? There does not seem to be any real time help or a tech who spends more than two seconds e-mailing a two sentence canned response . The software did load after the registration code mash-up but only worked for about five minutes . The software stopped blocking websites and stopped logging websites visited and has not - despite the lame restart and play for ten minutes repeat advice from the Techs - worked again . My son can not be left to work on an open internet so he has been SOL for over a week now . The interface did not impress me . The software does not block websites based on type but on what you enter . Believe me it is next to impossible to figure out all the websites a 12 year old boy might think to type up . I would be fine with blocking them when and if he figures a new one out ... oh wait that part of the software does n't function anymore.Long story short - It does n't work .
 This game is really bad . Do n't listen to these people who say it is good . Because its not . It 's bad . It has bad control , bad graphics , bad gameplay . If you want to have more fun turn off your computer monitor and stare at it . That is more fun . If you want a good dinosaur game get Dino Crisis 3 for X box even though X-box is a bad system . If you want a bad dinosaur game get this one .
 After purchasing this product at the recommendation of a colleague -LRB- who uses the Windows version -RRB- I experienced terrible stability problems using Microsoft Word on my Mac . After fighting with it for two months , and receiving nothing but platitudes from ISI Researchsoft 's technical support , I had to give up . It was simply too time consuming to install the product , restart Word repeatedly to cite a paper , then uninstall it in order to use Word without the restarts.It would appear that I am not the only one with this problem ; search ` Endnote Mac crash ' on Google for hundreds of similar cases .
 I bought this software a few months ago , and loved it . However , circumstances were such I had to buy a new laptop - preloaded with Vista.Laplink 12 does not work with Vista , and the company 's representative was unable to tell me if it will EVER support Vista . I really did n't like their answer . Since Vista is inevitable on nearly all machines , I would n't advise anyone to buy it.Meanwhile I have software I ca n't use , an annual fee I ca n't get a refund for , and I 'm paying $ 19.95 plus tax for a popular web-based version of remote desktop and file sharing software.I think Laplink missed the boat on this one .
 My copy of this program sat unopened on a shelf for a few years before I got around to wanting to use it.Upon opening the shrinked wrapped package , the first problem is that the manual was designed to be just a little bit longer than the box , so the manual has to be bent somewhat to get it into the box . The CD is attached to the front cover of the manual , with the readable side of the CD facing the back side of the manual 's font cover , and with a plastic half-pouch placed over the CD and glued to the front cover around the edges . Probably because of the force fit of the manual in the box , the plastic was torn somewhat . The net is that , after removing the CD from the pouch as carefully as I could , there was very sticky glue on the edges of the CD in several places . Ultimately , IMO the CD ca n't really be placed in a laptop CD reader without significant risk of damaging the CD reader via sticky glue deposits . In addition , the CD was pretty badly scratched , and I 'm quite sure that that was n't by me -LRB- I was * very * careful in removing it -RRB- . This seems to me to be totally thoughtless packaging that shows a complete disregard for the customer 's right to reliably get the product in usable condition . Since the product stayed on my shelf for some time , I 'm sure that the `` warranty '' has expired , so I do n't really expect to get any satisfaction from Laplink at this point.Is it really true that , for a $ 100 product , Laplink ca n't provide the protection of a standard simple CD paper envelope ? Those envelopes work pretty well IMO , and probably would cost Laplink well less than a penny each in the quantities they would buy . The exhibited degree of thoughlessness/carelessness on how this product was packaged is simply not acceptable.I have n't actually tried the product , since I consider the CD mostly a hazard , in it 's delivered condition .
 Do n't buy this if the main thing you want to synch is Outlook - which I did , hoping to help my laptop and desktop communicate about the main program I use .
 This is the most unintuitive , frustrating program I have ever worked with . I had to print out the 100 pg . manual since it does n't come with one and even with the manual it is nearly impossible to use . Nothing is logical or easy with this program . Do n't buy !
 It 's hard to use , do n't have a decent manual , the forms aspect its like a 10 years old child homework , you have to work a lot and spend a lot of time to obtain something not decent , no proffesional , and the brochure that comes inside of the box -LRB- that 's not a manual , its a joke -RRB- says
 I bought this product to help me on a trip to Taiwan . Initially , the product appeared to install OK but when I would select items on my Ipod , they repeated the same terms for all options that I selected . I uninstalled and attempted to reinstall and I began to receive a slew of errors . I am now waiting for responses to 5 e-mails after 3 weeks and have received no help from Mogopop or ILingo . Do n't buy this !
 Even the box lied about this software working for an Ipod Touch , it was listed under possible requirements . Basically , you call Apple -LRB- 40 minutes of your life -RRB- , search google -LRB- 5 minutes -RRB- and there is the initial installation -LRB- 15 minutes of your life -RRB- , so if you make 15 bucks an hour , you just wasted double your money trying to get this to work because time is money , that is 30 dollars of cash and time . Apple changed their software setup to screw everyone who bought this , another reviewer put up japanesepod101.com , that actually works , it might be around 25 dollars , or 25 bucks a month but you have access to a lot and it is n't a scam like ilingo . Panda software 's site , tells you to `` email them '' for the new installer , obviously that is nonsense , they ca n't have the new installer readily available ? Is the new installer a big secret ? Can Iran fire missiles with a sophisticated delivery system if they find the source code of Panda software 's super super ubersecret new installation system that I ALREADY PAID FOR ! I am gon na say no , so they stole from me , mainly because Apple changed its software setup so they are responsible . So , ultimately Panda Software lied because Apple wanted to sell these languages individually is one possible reason for this , another is that Panda software is scared of Apple and ca n't really take them on for their stupid idea of removing the `` disk mode '' on the Ipod . I am gon na go with option 2 . If this Apple 's way of fighting piracy , they just made a great case for buying an external hardrive and never giving them a dime for anything but hardware EVER AGAIN .
 I am not impressed at all . I thought there would be more educational tools in the CD than a book.If you just wants questions in the computer format , this is for you . but if you expect more than that , do n't buy it .
 I upgraded from 2.x to 4.x and I 've found that although 4.x adds some additional features , it is missing a way to batch convert my images . I contacted Olympus on this and they had no clue about anything . I 'm disappointed but what are you gon na do ?
 This s/w came free on a new Dell computer . I 've been transferring footage of a show done at my children 's primary school to DVD . Goal is to produce relatively simple DVDs with about 2 hours of material , so NOT at full DVD quality . Have spent quite a few hours working on about 3 hours of material . Primarily used capture mode and the Story Line Editor ; never used CineMagic or Story Line Builder.It came installed , so I had no problems there . Applied an upgrade from the RVWMC site with no major difficulties.The inital small spash screen remains on the screen long after the software has loaded , and clicking on its `` x '' does nothing . Just one of many annoyances.The capture feature works ok and -LRB- unlike some others -RRB- RVWMC will allow capture of video in DVI format . However , it has what appears to be a poor MPEG encoder judging from results . I wanted to encode at a modest bit rate that will allow me to cram two hours onto a DVD . Experimented with different rates but it looked quite poor at low rates when compared to what Sonic could produce -LRB- see below -RRB- . Trim mode is pretty good - allowing precision of trimming down to the level of a single frame -LRB- half frame ? dunno , I 'm not Dr. Video -RRB- . This is very useful , another advance over others.The story line editor allows me to string clips together . Easy to get lost on a long story line ; the individual pieces are not numbered and it only shows 7 at a time , with -LRB- as far as I can tell -RRB- no way to zoom out to get a feel for it.My major gripe is that RVWMC has pieces of major features but they feel partially completed , not fully tested , not quite ready . For example , it can do a rolling credit with a variable font -- pretty nice if you 're content with a few lines . But the textbox that accepts the text simply stops accepting characters after about 30 lines . Then what ? For example , right-clicking on a piece of the story line shows a properties window , and various text boxes allow you to put the cursor in them -- but you can not change anything . For example , you can put a solid frame in the story line and put plain text on top of it , but you can not edit the text - the Done button can not be clicked.The lack of support is simply exasperating . Roxio points the finger at Dell in my case , but -LRB- as you can imagine -RRB- Dell 's call center in India has nothing to offer . ... Even on my relatively capable machine it feels slow . Switching among tasks takes seconds sometimes , which is longer than it should . What is it doing?By comparison , for simple tasks , Sonic 's MyDVD has fewer options but a better MPEG encoder , and in general works far more smoothly with fewer glitches and crashes . Sonic 's `` good '' mode -LRB- basically VCD bit rate , I think -RRB- still looks acceptable . I finally gave up on RVWMC for this project and used Sonic.Don ' t spend much money on this one , that 's my advice.Full details
 Like some of the other folks here , I have been disappointed in this software . There are a number of reasons for this :1 . There are so many features that seem oversimplified , incomplete , or non-functional . I could never get even basic functions of the storyline editor to work . For example , I wanted to simply get a DVD with different chapters to play continuously , and I could n't do that . When I would play a movie made with the storyline editor on my DVD player , it would constantly quit in the middle of the DVD and return to the menu . I still have no idea how to perform this basic function .2 . Technical support stinks . I have to pay for support after one month ? Who came up with that idea ? Way to show your enthusiasm for your product .3 . But the biggest reason is that there is only one DVD write quality setting . You simply ca n't fit more than 55 minutes worth of movie onto a DVD . Even then , it is discernably lower quality than the HQ setting on a DVD recorder . If you want the quality of satellite or digital cable , you are NOT going to get it with this software . This means that the software is inferior for most applications.After doing some market searching , it appears that the basic features of this program are typical of this price range , so I ca n't say that you will find a product that is a lot better . But that does n't excuse the misleading advertising
 I found out that it does n't create SVCDs . Also , the video editing is quite limiting , not even as good as the free Windows MovieMaker 2 , or Ulead VideoStudio . Finally , the text on the product tour dialog does n't show on my Windows XP machine . So my advice is
 First of all , it does not work . I wanted to burn VCD on my CD-R , it wo n't . Went to find support about why it wo n't , there is n't any support . Went to the customer 's forum and found out the product has been bad , and not supported for 2 years . Save your time , find something that functions . I 'm back in the search for a `` WORKING '' VCD creator .
 This thing eats up resources like you can not imagine . You MUST have at least 512mb of RAM in your system and at least an 833 mhz processor to even think about successfully running this software . The software is buggy -- which is probably why Roxio has an upgrade available on its website . Make sure you download the upgrade before you try to run with this.Having said all that -- once you figure out how to work with it ... it does make some nice movies . But ... you wo n't get any movies without frustration first.One more note
 I was very disappointed with this software after reading other reviews . First it is limited to story line editing only . There is no real movie time line editing in the package . You can do individual segments but not the movie . Very little capabilities in audio tracks plus it often generates errors here using audio tracks over the entire movie instead of just a section of time specified . The worst part-it would not create a DVD unless I upgraded -LRB- separate purchase -RRB- my easy CD creater software -LRB- this came from technical assistance -RRB- . Technical assistance is a joke from website to phone system . The only real saving grace is the ability to strip audio from an individual clip .
 I received this as a Christmas gift so that I could edit video from me digital camcorder . It did n't come packaged and I did n't have directions . I found the product easy to use and it produced a nice result , but the technical part of it was frustrating and the technical support is non-existent . Their attitude is `` It is not our problem and tough luck . `` First of all , the program would not recognize my camcorder with was attached with a USB cable . All the capture icons were grayed out . Then after restarting , it thought the camcorder was a webcam but still would n't capture video . I ended up capturing the video using a simple program and then saving it and loading it into Videomaker , which was a lot of extra time.We then created a very nice video for a presentation and it was easy to use . We were able to burn it onto a CD but the quality was grainy . A few days later , I got a DVD/CD-RW drive . I tried burning the same project onto a DVD , but now it wo n't recognize the DVD-RW drive . So , I now have a video editing program which has all the capture video options grayed out and all the transfer -LRB- disc burning -RRB- options grayed out . It is useless . I tried contacting Roxio for support thinking there must be something I can do to get the program to recognize the camcorder and DVD drive . But the support was non-existent . So , buyer beware !
 It has a nice user interface - too bad it does n't work ! It crashed several times on installation . I called tech support and they gave me a couple of suggestions . Those did n't work either . The technician said he would send me email with more suggestions . So far I have not received the email . Called tech support a second time . A different tech discovered that there is a Microsoft . DLL file that is buggy . He told me where to get a fixed . DLL off the web from Microsoft . This time it did install successfully . Everything went fine until I got to the part where it burns a CD . The program crashed there . I tried is several more times using different CD write speeds from 2X to 12X . They ALL crashed . I suppose it really does n't matter , but this is the slowest writing CD software I have ever seen . -LRB- Does n't matter because it did n't finish anyway . -RRB-
 I used EasyCD and DirectCD before . They seemed pretty good , so I 'll give this a try . What a nightmare ! When I installed on my Sony Vaio running ME , it crashed it twice with the blue screen errors . After a few failed attempts , I had to update the O/S , uninstall/reinstall a couple time to get rid of the problems . OK , blame it on my machine and Microsoft . Now , it runs , but buttons do not work when I click on them . After all this and I ca n't use it . I got frustrated , so I went to Roxio 's website to contact technical support . But they need the TSID # -LRB- Technical Support Identificaiton Number -RRB- , which came with the software . But , their support site does n't recognize it and say it is invalid . ... Think twice before buying this junk .
 Bought the software in 1-9-03 and submitted rebate . Guess what , no rebate check yet . Think twice before you purchase.Tried to install into my PC twice but could n't .
 what can I say ... this product does not work , comes with lousy directions , and customer support makes you PAY to answer your questions . I ca n't believe they released this junk . Please stay as far away as possible , and do n't say I did n't warn you .
 Received this program as part of a Dell package . Software worked adequately for simple music videos . I also made several `` slide shows '' using pictures and audio . Unfortunately after a few weeks the program quit working completely . Uninstalling and reinstalling did not help and customer support is non-existant . Do n't buy .
 Too many limitations and a confusing interface make for a poor choice . Thankfuly , it was a `` freebie '' for me with Roxio Media Creator.I 'm investing $ 50 in Wondershare Movie Story - I tried it our for a 30 day free trial and LOVE it . Absolutely wonderful and gives so many creative options , transitions , etc. . Do n't fool with the -LRB- now -RRB- dinosaur Videowave .
 Although the product page says `` usually ships in 24 hours '' , my order placed 1/9/03 is now scheduled for delivery by 2/28/03 ! So do n't order this product if you 're in a hurry .
 I bought this software with the hopes of editing some software using my Sony DCR-IP5 . Sofware can not capture video . Called the company for support . . but you will be listening to a looped recording for 5 minutes . . . nothing in their website of much value ... and if you must talk to a person . . you have to pay $ 20 . It may be nice software ... but I suggest looking around for comparable products with BETTER SUPPORT .
 I purchased this product with the intent of converting old VHS family movies to DVD . I found this product to be very difficukt to work with even tho I have an excellent computer . Specifically this product runs very slow , caused my home network to crash repeatedly , does not allow you to insert chapters , instead requiring the making of individual movies . It required three DVD disks -LRB- $ $ -RRB- to copy one full VHS tape of 2hrs and 15 min.Avoid this product even if it comes with rebates and discounts .
 When you begin to use this product , you would understand what `` unreliable '' means . Plus , one addition award
 Retrospect appears to function , but was virtually useless to me because it 's interface uses techno-speak jargon that , even after wasted hours with the manual , was not intelligible . I am a very computer literate end user , having run my own office computers since before Windows -LRB- does anyone remember DOS ? -RRB- . I 've used various backup software . The manual was no help , because it just keeps using the same terms as the program -LRB- like `` volume '' and `` sub-volumes '' -RRB- . The programmers assume you are already inside their heads and know their terminology.I got it to back up my drive . Then , when I had a problem , I tried to use the `` restore '' function . This function deleted files and destroyed Windows XP . The drive was not even bootable after Retrospect got through with it 's `` restore '' function . Maybe I did something wrong , but how could I know because the program is speaking Greek -LRB- or more accurately , Geek-speak -RRB- and I speak English . 15 hours of complete OS and all program re-install . On the bright side , at least retrospect still had the data on the other drive to which I had backed up . I made lucky guesses about how to retrieve that data from the proprietary format that retrospect backs up to . -LRB- Again , the manual and interface were grossly unclear to me . -RRB- The final insult to injury was that when I called Dantz support to ask for a technician to translate the program 's language into English for me , I was told I 'd have to pay -LSB- money -RSB- per incident because my problem occurred more than 30 days after purchase.Bottom line
 I 've had this program for as long as I 've had my current desktop . I 've found the interface easy to use and I like that it allows me to take control on what programs access the internet . I also like that it informs me of any dubious attempts to connect to my computer , lets me know where in the world the attempt was made from , and then reports the attempt back to the owner of the IP . HOWEVER , this program has an element called True Vector that wreaks all kinds of havok on Windows systems , causing every kind of system failure imaginable . If you use your computer to play video games or watch DVDs or edit video footage then you do not want this product . You can search for `` true vector '' online and you will see the widespread problem that it is . I do n't know why they have n't attempted to fix it , but it renders the EZArmor program worthless . And the only suggestion I recieved from Tech Support was the usual `` uninstall and reinstall '' after which they sent me an email saying they considered the problem resolved ... even though my computer is still crashing every few minutes .
 I absolutely hated this software . Within minutes of loading it onto my HP computer w / Windows XP , my PC started having issues . For one thing , every now and then since loading it , windows would just start opening at random and it would be impossible to close them all so I 'd have to shut down . Also , this software is very strict . For instance , it 's recommended settings block auction item pictures on Ebay . I tried and tried but could not find a way to lower the setting for just ebay so had to lower all settings and finally , ended up turning the software off . Customer service with this company is a joke . TO receive help over the phone , you have to pay per phone call . You can email for free but they do n't bother to answer the email at all . So basically , if you want to discuss their $ 39.99 software with them , they 're going to charge you $ 50.00 to do it . What a bargain ! Eventually , I uninstalled the software , snapped the CD in half and sent it back to them . They can keep their junk . I uploaded Microsoft 's Beta spyware for FREE and it works much better . Do n't buy this junk !
 If you only have one computer , and you have a problem with eTrust EZ Armor 2005 , it will cost you fifty bucks to get help from them over the phone . And that 's for each occurance ! And you must pay them up front before you can even talk to a real human being . Even though I think the program works pretty well , if you think you might need occasional help , I think it would be better to look for a company that has cheaper phone support . If I could go back to the buying stage again , this is one program I would totally avoid ! -LRB- I just bought a new Dell , but I have had lots of trouble downloading updates for this program . -RRB-
 I purchase this package on 5/10/05 it arrive the next day - free shipping great job Amazon . I installed the program two days later and over the weekend witnessed a fast deterioration in my computers speed , especially on the net . It would hung between pages and not recognize others . I had trouble getting to the CA support page and eventually uninstalled the program , which sped up my computer and got me to their 24/7 support desk . I sent a message on 5/16 and waited for a reply and waited . On 5/22 I received the following - I infer from your mail that your EZ Armor has gone corrupt . Please Uninstall & reinstall it . Which I did removing all trace from my system and the registry . I reinstalled the link they gave me but this failed to install the AV . I sent several comments back but I do n't think the person could understand English . The final straw came when the individual blamed Microsoft windows security for the problem and suggest I call Microsoft - for their -LRB- CA 's -RRB- corrupt software Dah !! and offered no other course of redress . I shall purchase another security suite and tell all whom I know to stay away from this product . This is a waste or money and more import a waste of time .
 I installed this on a brand new Dell computer and when I restarted the computer it would not restart Windows . I spent 30 minutes with Dell support to get my computer back up . I did a system restore and then bought McAfee and it works fine . You get what you pay for .
 this is the worst `` protection '' software i 've ever seen . beware of putting this junk on your computer and then NEVER being able to remove it . there customer service is non-existent . companies like this should be run out of town .
 This software has effectively disabled my computer and made online computing and web site management a nightmare . It is so restrictive it wo n't even allow itself to go to its own Web site to update the anti-virus files . I hate this program and after three months of frustration finally removed it from my computer and am going to get a different program for virus control since this one wo n't do updates . The firewall creates all kinds of program conflicts and bugs.A waste of money .
 I dont hate Garfields Typing Pal . I have had it before and really liked it I just do not have it now . I want to get it to practise my typing .
 I bought this software for my 8 year old son , and he tried it once before declaring it was boring . After trying it myself , I have to agree . The games are dull , the interface it not user-friendly , and errors were counted incorrectly - all of which was frustrating and discouraging.The initial test to rank my typing skills and place me in the appropriate level appeared to be working improperly , because my cursor would n't move . I had 250 errors because I kept typing anyway . It was n't until I did one of the activities in the Practice section that I realized what had happened . When you type incorrectly , it does n't let you move on . The cursor stops moving forward until you correct the error.During an activity in the Dictation section , I discovered the program was counting errors where I had n't made errors . It compared my typing to the correct typing in two windows , and they were identical - but mine was counted wrong on several occasions.I 'm off to find something better . My nephew loves `` Typing Instructor for Kids Platinum '' ...
 I tried installing the program on our Windows XP PC -LRB- less than 1 year old -RRB- . The installation keeps saying that the serial number is invalid . I 've emailed and called DeMarque support and they do n't respond . Though I ca n't give a review of the game since I ca n't get it installed , I 've given this one star for HORRIBLE customer support .
 No serial number . That is awful . And no customer support . Thanks to the other customers who supplied me with a working serial # , but Amazon should not be selling this . The number I used was RTR5MB9NE7TFQRYZ .
 Box came with no paperwork whatsoever . No serial number . The serial number is , of course , the thing you pay for . After all the reviews here that mention this problem , you might think that they 'd fix it . But not yet.Best of luck with your purchase . Caveat emptor .
 It arrived quickly , but it 's missing any paperwork and the serial number so that I can install it . I also ca n't get the manufacturer to respond . That was money down the drain !
 I ordered . . this . . you go to install it . . asks for serial number on the box ... no serial number on t he box ... called 800 number . . given a recording for the serial number . . w.rong serial number ... called back again ... The recording is in French .
 I ca n't review the actual software because in order to install it you must type in the serial number `` from the CD box '' . However there is no such number so it can not be installed .
 No serial number provided . Could ` nt load program . Sent back for an exchange but 2nd one had no serial number either . A big waste of time and shipping fee !
 The disk spins making a loud sound and the software does not load to my harddrive . I am dissapointed in the product . Product code was not available on my disk so I used the posted registation number . It appears to me that there is little interest from the company in their product .
 Very discouraging product to load , NO SERIAL code ... why would a company produce a product that requires a serial code then does not make sure it is packaged with this vital code ??? I am surprised Amazon would sell such a faulty program !!! The code in a previous review did not work on my program , thanks though.Just sign me disgusted with Amazon and Demarque Co. .
 I totally agree with Mr. Goldman . The program came with no serial number or key . In the installation it asks for the serial on the `` CD-Rom box '' . The only identification I found on the box was the barcode on the bottom of the box -LRB- which does not work -RRB- . This is the second copy of the game I bought because I lost the box . I am very disapointed with the producers who released this game without a serial number .
 When the program arrived I immediately attempted using it . Within 3 hours of using the program I was unable to load my video onto my computer with sound . I am almost completely sure I was doing it correctly because I am experienced with similar software and thoroughly read the users manual . To make matters worse my -LRB- computer -RRB- system shut down -LRB- what it said was -RRB- due to new installed hardware.Do not do the same thing I did
 Sure , the editing tools are great and it can make even the simplest MPEG 's look great . But it never works and tech support will put you through the ringer trying to get it to run again . I have uninstalled and reinstalled more time than I care to remember . I have fixed system files I did n't even know existed . Do n't waste your money . I am still trying to get Roxio customer service to answer me about getting money back so I can purchase something decent . We only bought this for the DVD capabilties as we have a newborn baby and I have in three months of having this software not been able to create a single DVD , only a whole bunch of CD 's for friends and family .
 I ca n't explain in polite terms just how much I loathe this product . Like others , I have installed , run clean ups , and reinstalled it numerous times . The customer support is expensive -LRB- $ 35/incident and only good for 30 days from the date you call -RRB- AND the call is INTERNATIONAL -LRB- to Toronto -RRB- , so your pocketbook is hit twice for the ` support ' . The bottom line issue , for me , which is not resolvable is that Roxio products do not ` get along well ' with Adobe products so if you have both in your system you will most likely end up with DVD burning issues in your Roxio AND Adobe software -LRB- I believe that most people whose hobbies include video and still photography have at least one Adobe software product in their system -RRB- . And my non-resolvable issue was only determined as a final note after having ` fixed ' all the many other problems I encountered , with my paid tech support and a hefty international long distance bill -LRB- I really wanted this product to work -RRB- . I had capturing , audio , burning , copying , and crashing issues . My goal was simply to create home DVDs of my new daughter for my friends and family . If this is your goal and you value the little free time that you have during the day , please do n't waste it on this product .
 Some reviewer said `` Easy to use interface , well balanced features , and stability stability stability ... Formerly MGA , now Roxio -LRB- that 's to bad -RRB- . '' What a load - probably from the Roxio company . I have the program and while I have n't had as many problems running it as some of the other people who have reviewed this software , this is anything but stabile . It 's basic and a few of the features would not work no matter what was done . This is for the beginner and depending on what your intended output is , this could be great or it could be a real pain -LRB- i.e. simple mpeg movies - great . DVD or web - a REAL pain -RRB- . Do n't part with your money if you expect too much but I still use this depending on what kind of an output I 'm looking for .
 I would not reccomend any Roxio product even to my worst enemy !! I have had nothing but problems with my videowave product . None of my technical questions are answered on their web site and to get any one on one help , you need to pay for it ! The absolute worst support you can ask for . Save yourself the headache and do n't even think of buying videowave !!!
 I have a lot of experience with computers as a physicist . However , I have not been able to install this package without error massages showing up after having tried different ways for 8 days . My three emails sent to Rixio got only one very slow response , which was not helpful at all . After that , no one there responsed my emails . It seems the support team does not exist any more.I now have the software installed on my PC by ignoring the error massages and tested it . I have used several video editing packages and DVD authorizing packages . The VideoWave is strong on simple video editing but extremely weak on DVD authorizing . There is a bug for the audio mixer for the video editing section . The program freezes when you click the audio mixer button . I am nto sure this is due to the bad installation or not . For DVD authorizing section , a fatal problem is that different mpeg files can not be included as chapters under a title , but only as different titles . This means you can not have the generated DVD play as a continuous movie . The main menu will show up whenever a title was completed . Then you need to manually choose another title to play . In order to avoid this problem . One may go back to the video editing section to have the movie files merged into one file -LRB- takes a lot of time -RRB- . Doing so , you will find it would be very difficult to have your movie with optimized file size to fit in your DVD disc . This problem should not happen if designer of the overall configuration of this package ever generate a single DVD movie himself . Roxio should learn how to make a DVD athorizing section from the Sonic MyDVD package or DVD Complete from Dazzale , though the later does not support DVD+R . Besides , the transcoding procedure of Video WAve is almost 2-3 times slower than that of Sonic MyDVD package , which makes the DVD burning painfully long .
 This product do n't work . I did everything correctly and never could get it to work . No Help from Roxio either . Save your money .
 This is such a mixed bag . The way it captures video from my miniDV camcorder is effortless . The way it allows you to edit footage is pretty straightforward and logical . Then it takes an age to convert the footage back to miniDV format or DVD output . And then the problems start.PLEASE DO NOT buy this software if you want to produce your own home DVDs . Adding film segments and resizing frames and changing fonts takes an age ; adding chapters to break up each movie results in lost chapters on playback ; transcoding from AVI to DVD takes forever.Some of this was supposed to be resolved with Easy Media Creator 7 , but check reviews on that too before wasting your money.As others have said , tech support is non-existent from Roxio , so you will be stuck on your own with something that 's frustrating to use and seemingly full of bugs .
 They brag about having the chroma key or whatever . But there is one problem , you have to have the perfect lighting and all that stuff . Otherwise only a few specles change . It looks so easy on the website but it is not . If you wanted to get it like I did just to make a few small `` productions '' such as and have little to no budget THIS IS NOT FOR YOU . I tried to use it for a school project and it is a total waste of time and money . I tried for an hour to get the right lighting but it never worked . This one is way more confusing then the first one also . This software is not worth the money . Sure some things are good on it , but if you want to use the chroma key and you are not good with lighting such as myself , I really feel this product is not for you
 Who is fooling who . Compare the review dated July 29 , 2003 -LRB- 1 star -RRB- with the short review dated Jan 14 , 2003 -LRB- 5 stars -RRB- . Copy and paste right down to the word `` to '' sic for `` too . ''
 While Premiere 6.5 is easy to use , it is very unstable . I have used Premiere 6 and it was not nearly as unstable as 6.5 . 6.5 is not a good upgrade from Premiere 5 or 6 . I would suggest going directly to Premiere Pro . Invest in Total Training for novices , it 's well worth it . I would n't waste my money on Premiere 6.5 . However , most of Adobe Premiere Products are great and have excellent features , and they interface wonderfully with Canopus .
 I bought the software trying to back up my ipod onto another computer , the stupid software kept saying `` Refreshing Data ... '' when I clicked on `` Detect iPod '' and that 's where it sat . I also had trouble installing it with the Java Runtime Environment initializing and running over the installation . The website sucks , and your guys are right about no support , there is n't even any comments section for other customers to help eachothere out . Maybe Best Buy will have mercy and take it back .
 Please avoid this program . It will not work with the IPOD Nano . There are no instructions and the web site does n't even support this product anymore .
 Bought this to transfer i-pod tunes to new computer . . however it didnt work and the patch did n't work either
 I share most of the same as experienced by other reviewers . Just sits there waiting to detect my I-pod , but never happens . Tried it on 3 diffrent PC.s , with two different I-pods . Amazon should not sell this rubbish !
 Not only could n't I get this program to work , it left an image behind ! Yup , smack in the middle of my desktop screen is a square with Toon Tools for iPod ad . I uninstalled and reinstalled and uninstalled and I ca n't get this damned thing off my computer!Aarrgghh !!
 I was very dissapointed with this product . Once I installed it , I could n't get it to work . Then I read on the box that it is not compatible with the iPod touch or iPhone . This information would have been helpful on the website .
 This does not work for newer versions of I Tunes . The support site is no help at all . Tried all recomended fixes and nothing works . I used this software a couple of years ago and it was great . As soon as I Tunes updated it quit working . I bought new version of Tune Tools and it is a complete waste !!!
 I got this program to use to backup my music and use my Ipod as a hard drive to transfer music on and off of and because of its `` amazing features '' . I installed it and it wold not load because of `` null error '' . I go to the website to download the patch , but it is only for pc and I am on a mac . Great . I finally search the website and find a patch . I download it and it asks for my pin number . Who has ever heard of entering 000 before a pin number and not including the letters in the sequence . So , I download it and open it thinking sucess , but no , I open it up and it opens Tune Tools for iPod
 This product looks good but when you try to run it , it simply wont load due to a java error . As many others also have the same problem , I would not buy this product .
 if you by this product to trade songs from ipod to ipod you have to do it through a computer .
 I got this product about a year ago , and it worked fine ... However , when I updated my version of Itunes , it stopped working ! Now , it will not open . I went to the website -LRB- which is completely useless -RRB- . They had a patch to fix the problem ... but ONLY for PCs !!! I searched the website , and every time it gave instructions on how to do something , it was only listed for PCs . The Ipod is an APPLE product ... so why does the Tune Tools website neglect to provide any information for those who have Macs ?? RIDICULOUS !!! DO NOT purchase this piece of trash !!!! I 'm giving it to my dog for a chew toy .
 Yamipod is better and it is freeeeeeeeeeThisd product is a rip off !!!!!!
 There is bad software , and then there is Terrible Software and then there is unbelievably sloppy Terrible software . This falls under the latter category . I own a Mac so my reviews are based on APPLE platform . I think the code might have been written in a Chinese Labor Factory for Windows and then sloppily copied onto the Mac Platform . I do n't know for sure . I just know for sure that it fails to do anything correct , and it fails erratically . However , one thing is consistent and that is , it does n't do S *** .
 After several hours of thrashing , reinstalling Java runtime environment , searching the Valuesoft website , searching the web , Tune Tools for iPod still will not detect my iPod . Tune Tools returns cryptic errors and hangs my system -LRB- XP , SP2 , latest updates -RRB- . Valuesoft help and support is non-existent .
 No instructions . No technical support . It is worthless !! I do n't understand why ValuSoft is selling this product . Its a huge rip off .
 The installed failed . The application is written in Java which is not a bad thing but it needs to install a companion application called a JRE so it will run . The JRE failed misirably to install and thus the application will not run at all.If you go to the company website -LSB- ... -RSB- you get a nice message saying the domain name has expired and if you are the owner , you can renew it.Needless to say , this application rates a big fat zero in my book .
 I , like other reviewers , spent a lot of time installing and reinstalling this software . It never recognized my ipod . It would not even load if I had my ipod connected . Do n't bother with this application .
 I bought this at Best Buy 2 weeks ago for $ 29 . It looked like the perfect product doing everything I wanted . It did not work , never recognized my IPOD . No customer support . No instructions given . User interface not clear . I do not recommend this product . I am still looking for a good software to back up my Ipod .
 I think it should be more compatible with i tunes , because the conflict between two is difficult to manage . Every time you use several ipods in the sakme ocmputer you have to avoid the itunes because it could erease the new ipod .
 I have NEVER been as dissappointed with a purchase as with this worthless software . Poor instructions and non-existing features .
 this is an example of rotten software ... do n't buy it , it dose n't work I have tried it on 3 different computers and every one it crashes the system ... I hope that this company goes out of business soon . ValueSoft is now a name like broderbund in my book .
 I bought this to back up my iPod before I left the country . It worked a few times until it kept freezing . The patches on their webpage do not solve the problem either.Their website is labyrinthian at best . There are definitely better products out their with more effective customer service -LRB- a contact link is practically buried -RRB- that do n't want to install additional junk on your PC .
 This product was a CD only . I expected to receive a booklet or even a guide on how to use it . I did not find it very helpful . I hope you will be able to understand it and use it more than I did .
 When I buy CD burning software , I do n't expect much . If you want to edit something , you are going to buy editing software , so halfway attempts to add editing functionality are superfluous . The one thing I do expect is that it be able to burn a CD-Rom . This product has no ability to burn a CD-Rom unless YOU CREATE THE CD-ROM INSIDE PYRO !!! This means if you have an old ghost image , forget it . Download a linux iso , forget it . Do you have backups , lying around on your hard drive ? Forget it .
 This software is of no use whatsoever when it comes to playing & listening to CD 's as a simple listening tool . If you want to slap in a CD and burn a duplicate of it , it may be ok . But if want a ` jukebox ' to listen to CD 's etc. , run the other direction . It is so bad I am going to eat the $ 40 cost and throw it in the garbage . I am serious , it is that bad .
 I had the same installation problems . THe program would install and I could open it , but nothing worked . I could n't play any audio file . I just got the same error message that the file could not be opened . Emailing customer support gets very old . I tried to jump through the hoops but could never fix the problem . I 'll likely give it to my sister for Christmas and hope she has better luck with it on her PC
 Shuts down in Windows XP , error report appeared 5 times . Each time I started to ` add ' mp3s to project it froze and pretty much never worked again.GARBAGE !
 I had the same experience as the person who had to go into regedit and tweak stuff to get this puppy to work . And then they wo n't give support over the phone -- only by email ! Originally I was going to buy Roxio , but was successfully sidetracked by the cheaper price of Pyro . Ooops . I 'm going to the computer store where I bought this thing to buy a copy of Roxio or Xing.I 'm giving it one star here because they wo n't let me give it none .
 I am very unsatisfied with this program . I have many mp3 files , some a couple hours in length.This program only reconizes about fifty percent of them . This program is going in the garbage .
 I am running XP ; I bought Pyro 2004 to replace Roxio because I liked the idea of an integrated package . However , there were problems from the start.In `` Record an Audio File '' mode , Pyro unpredictably shut down when I hit stop play on an mp3 , or when I tried to display an mp3 in the lower panel . In some cases it generated an error message.I contacted product support ; this is what they told me to do :1 . You 'll need to uninstall Pyro 2004 or MediaWorks . Remove allshortcuts also .2 . Click the Windows Start button and select Run . At the prompt typeREGEDIT and click OK .3 . Backup your Registry before making edits - you do this by clickingthe Registry menu , Export Registry File .4 . Now delete the following Registry keysHKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Cakewalk MusicSoftware \ `` MediaWorks `` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \ Cakewalk MusicSoftware \ `` MediaWorks `` If you have `` Pyro 2004 '' instead of `` MediaWorks '' delete that folderinstead .5 . To ensure that other programs are not interfering with theoperation of MW or Pyro , do the following . * turn off auto-insert notification for all of your CD drives -LRB- clickStart , Settings , Control Panel , System , Device Manager -RRB- In XP , put a CDin and select `` Take No Action '' and put a check where it says `` AlwaysTake this Action . `` In Win 98/ME/XP , choose Start | Run and type MSCONFIG . Click OK , thenclick on the Startup tab at the upper right of the window that opens.Uncheck all items listed , click OK , then restart your computer . Youcan always recheck those items again at a later time . In Win 2000 , click Ctrl + Alt + Del and manually End Task on the items you do n't needrunning . Restart6 . If you have Adaptec Direct CD , Napster or Roxio 's GoBack , make sureyou uninstall or disable them temporarily . Also temporarily uninstallany other burning software on your machine . Now reinstall Cakewalk.Other mp3 burners do not need this much nursing ; Roxio and Xing work perfectly out of the box.I 'll probably have to go through this procedure , since I wo n't get my money back . If I 'd known then what I know now ...
 I bought this program three days ago , 7/12/2004 . I just bought a brand new computer with XP , and a CDRW Drive , and a DVDRW drive came standard with the computer . PYRO 2004 keeps telling me my computer has no rewritable drives installed , so I go to the cakewalk website to download the new drivers list so it will recognize at least one of my drives , and still no sucess . The only way to get support for this product is through E-Mail . Three days and I 'm still waiting . I will never buy a cakewalk product again . They use to be good with music programs .
 This software is costly if you plan to just rip tracks for MP3 in or out.Cakewalk Pyro . First you will find that the Gearlang DLL file has n't been up dated to run with XP multiuser windows software , which XP has been out on the market for years . The dll file library is not a shared library which means only one user can rip CD 'S that user is the admin . of that computer ; so everyone else will have access to the admin 's personal files while using this program . Be aware of the limits of this software . If you really need the bells and whisles it might be a value to you ? NOTE Gerland DLL . file 95/98/NT -LRB- NO -RRB- 2000 or XP update .
 I bought this program after reading reviews of several products . Maybe it 's the best thing since sliced bread , but I could n't get it installed . I called and e-mailed Cakewalk 's tech support , and after 5 tries I gave up . I have a new machine running Windows XP , and even though the program is supposed to be compatible , it is n't . I 've since heard from several would-be users who have had similar problems . I do n't know what to recommend instead of this program , but unless you 're willing to pay a high price in frustration , get something else .
 Installed , following directions precisely . Tried to rip one track from a CD . Did n't work . Tried 5 times . Went online to obtain driver updates . Tried same CD . Did n't work . Tried a second CD -- 5 more times . Same error message.Was there any quality assurance done on this project by Cakewalk ? I am seriously disappointed . I want my software to work right out of the box . This piece of junk did n't even come with a manual . You open the box and it contains a CD and a piece of paper telling you to visit Cakewalk 's website . Lame , lame , lame . I do n't have time to track down solutions to problems that should have been caught by Cakewalk 's QA dept. Shame on you , Cakewalk .
 I PURCHASED THE X VERSION AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE REBATE . THE REBATE SITE SAYS MY REQUEST IS ` IN PROCESSING ' . IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR MONTHS . I ALSO PURCHASED VERISON IX AND IT WAS BETTER THAN THE X VERSION . BUT CROOKS ARE CROOKS , SO BUYER BEWARE .
 Corel has taken a once great photo program and completely trashed it . Since version 9 when Corel bought out Jasc , this program has gone downhill in usability of the program but mostly in total lack of support from their Customer Support . If you encounter any type of problem at all -LRB- and there are many -RRB- , Corel will offer to help you for a per issue fee . If you correspond with anyone at their online support service you are better off talking to a block of wood . Their standard answer is always `` it 's your PC that is the problem '' . Funny but I never encounter problems or issues with any of my other photo software packages , or any other software for that matter on my new PC . When I told Corel that my upgraded PSP-XI has slowed down considerably after loading several folders of photos there answer was `` well what do you want us to do ? '' If you have an older version of PSP -LRB- 9 or before -RRB- continue to use it as it was a fabulous and robust program prior to being bought out by Corel . They have lost many good customers and will continue to do so as long as they keep putting out this type of garbage software .
 As a long time Paint Shop Pro user I was excited to see that a new version had appeared . However I consistantly get messages that the program is not responding . Save your money and continue to use your older version . That 's what I 'm doing except that I already wasted my money on Verison XI .
 I bought an earlier version , Pro X , last year . Supposedly I was going to get some cash back and I gathered all the info Corel asked for on the offer and mailed it off . The money never came.I hate it when software like this is advertised at a lower price with `` $ 30 cash back '' on the box . In my experience , many companies simply never send that money back . Corel is one of those companies .
 Congrats , Corel . You 've taken a wonderful and useful graphics program and reduced it to a nagging , agonizingly slow , bloated piece of trash . I 've been using it since it was shareware and each version got better and better . That is until Corel entered the picture . I have uninstalled V9 , V10 , and V11 and gone back to V8 . Save your money and try to find an old version .
 I 've been a longtime user of paint shop pro since its shareware days . It was always a favorite and I have paid to upgrade several times . This time I moved from version 9 to version 11 , so it is the first version I 've tried since Corel bought Jasc . Boy , what a piece of garbage this software has become . I 've got a fast computer with 3 GB of RAM and it takes about 1 minute to start up and consistently uses 25-40 % of my CPU even when it is n't doing anything!The current user interface is very hard to get used to . I 've been using this software for years and still ca n't figure out how to use this latest version.To top it off , my rebates were rejected for reasons unknown . It took me resubmitting them with a threat to contact the BBB to get one , and then finally a phone call to get the other one.I now mostly use Adobe Fireworks or the old version of Paint Shop Pro , and I would highly recommend that people NOT buy this product !
 I 've been a loyal Paint Shop Pro user since version 3 . I 've used it on major commercial design projects , right alongside Photoshop on my Mac and Gimp on my Linux box . Sadly , version XI is one of the poorest software builds of any product I have ever seen . It locks up , wo n't start , wo n't close , takes forever to load , and has issues with many fundamental functions such as JPEG formats , loading/saving files , cache management , and thumbnail generation ! Really , it is just unbelievably bad . Worse , when it crashes , although you can kill it from Windows Task Manager , it will immediately crash if you try to launch it again -- you 'll have to reboot your computer to get it to work . Moreover , it is painfully slow , even on my fast Intel Core 2 Duo box with dual-channel memory and SATA drives . My advice to users is to stick with Version 9 .
 I bought a full retail copy of Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI and do n't like it at all - I 've probably spent 5 hrs . now trying to learn to use it with little luck . The tutorial CD wo n't play in my new MS Vista laptop . The manual is of little use . The help with the program is just like the manual - of little use.I 've been using the software that came with an old Sony Mavica camera I bought several years back - it would n't load on my new laptop , so I bought PSP - I am really disappointed in it . It might be capable of doing great things , but I do n't know how you would ever learn to do them !! I 'm going to discard this useless program and buy Photo Shop Elements 5 - I feel Corel cheated me on this program !!
 The organizer functions in Paint Shop Pro XI are less flexible and less configurable than the earlier Photo Album software , and some of these functions appear to be broken . Here are some of the problems that I encountered :1 . I have a folder with photos named `` 1 . jpg '' , `` 2 . jpg '' , ... , `` 10 . jpg '' . Sort by name causes the organizer to display `` 10 . jpg '' before `` 2 . jpg '' . The old Photo Album software displayed numbered photos in the correct order .2 . It is no longer possible to control thumbnail size .3 . It is no longer possible to generate a slide show in which each photo is displayed for a specified number of seconds before automatically advancing to the next photo in the sequence .4 . When I click on the `` Slide Show '' button , only the first photo in the current folder is displayed . The `` Forward One Slide '' button does not work , and one can not advance to the next photo by pressing the space bar or arrow keys .5 . When one is in the Organizer , one ca n't open a file for editing by clicking -LRB- either single or double click -RRB- on the icon.In short , the organizer aspect of Paint Shop Pro XI looks like a step back , and I therefore see no reason to upgrade.Dr .

 I have used PSP for over 10 years now . Vista + PSP is a disaster . It will crash for no reason -LRB- not performing ANY operations -RRB- . At this point , I will probably uninstall and install version 9 -LRB- and turn on XP compatibility -RRB- .
 I 've been a loyal PSP -LRB- paint shop pro -RRB- customer since the 4.x era . I really loved PSP and have used it up to my current version which is 9 , or was , until I upgraded to XI . My opinion in a nutshell is
 I 've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported PaintShopPro and Corel products . I have to say I am very disappointed in the new version , PSPXI.No problems with the download , but the program crashes easily , you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9 , basically is slower in everything you do . I am a photographer , and looked forward to the new photo features , which work , but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it . Just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between.I have searched the net and support wise , the upgrades and patches have not helped . Corel is not solving the problem and maybe they ca n't . This is not a PC problem which they so want us to believe . I have plenty of memory and speed on my PC . It may be something involving how the XI stores it 's cache . Not sure . But the changes are not workable , sadly.I think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that Corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with , or they will find themselves out of the PS market . This is not just me talking , it has happened to alot of loyal fans . Because it could be the better than Photoshop if they fix it . If you really want the program , download the free trial first and or try the X or 9 version , especially if your PC is an older model .
 I upgraded to version XI when I read a review that said it would open Nikon D200 RAW -LRB- . NEF -RRB- files . I hoped that it would open my . NEF files from a Nikon D80 and Kodak Raw -LRB- . KDC -RRB- files from a Kodak P880 Camera . Both the Nikon and the Kodak RAW file formats are in the `` Open '' Dialog , but opening a . NEF file yields an `` unsupported file '' error . Attempting to open a . KDC file yields a `` missing parameter '' error . An email to customer support asking if these formats should or would be supported got me an email response that was totally unrelated to my question.XI takes a long time to load , the browser window changed to something unusable a couple versions ago , and I have not discovered any significant new features.I 've used Paint Shop Pro since it was shareware . My recommendation would be to stick with older versions of Paint Shop Pro ; preferably one from before Corel bought Paint Shop Pro from JASC .
 I bought the software -LRB- Jasc Paint Shop Pro 9 -RRB- before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.A BIG MISTAKE.I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format -LRB- * . CR2 -RRB- . UNFORTUNATELY , not all Canon . CR2 RAW files are the same . So , even though the software says you can edit . CR2 RAW images , it depends on which Canon camera made the image . So far , there have been no update patches or upgrades to make the RAW images from my 30D useable by this package .
 to mess up JASC 's genius.Paint Shop Pro was a great imaging program until screwed with by Corel . I recommend buying the older JASC versions . This one is a brutal unfriendly mess .
 If you 've never owned PaintShop Pro before , you 'll probably find it to be a very capable program with a great price point compared to industry standards like Adobe Photoshop.If you are a former and long-time PSP owner like me -LRB- since version 7 -RRB- , you wo n't find anything compelling about any version after 9 , but you will get a lot of cruft that you 'll probably never use.In addition to not having any compelling reason to upgrade , PaintShop pro has become extremely annoying to use . In addition to all of the other user interface changes mentioned by other reviewers , Corel has installed it 's own spam software which can not be disabled.It is simply not acceptable for any software which is not trialware or freeware to display ads while I am working , and the fact that the ads are from Corel itself does not excuse this horrid decision.Additionally , newer versions attempt to index every photo on your hardrive , ostensibly as a `` background process '' . This indexing can grind your computer to a halt by making the HD too busy to respond in a timely fashion to the your actual desired task . It 's intrusive and unnecessary , and horribly implemented . -LSB- UPDATE -RSB- - I will never again purchase another Corel product . Due to hardware issues and OS upgrades , I 've had to re-install the software on the same machine it was previously on a few times , and it is now telling me that I no longer have a valid license , that I 'm out of product activations . That 's complete crap . I had been a long and loyal customer and have purchased PSP for family members and myself , including upgrades , for many years . When Corel took over the product line went downhill very fast , and it 's simply no longer worth the money or hassle .
 Like other reviewers here , I , too , recommend stopping at version 8 . Above that , I 've encountered glitches that drive me nuts . For example , with ver .9 and up , I often encounter dialogue boxes telling me my system is short of memory and can not perform tasks at hand . The 1st time this happened , I had 3.5 Gbs system memory . On a new computer , I had 4 GB and still encountered the problem . On my latest system , I have 8 GB system memory and I am still being stopped in my tracks for `` lack of system memory '' . There are freezes , too , and , as others noted here , PSP X , XI up are painfully slow to work with . I really hated to say goodbye to PSP but it is no longer what it was when JASC owned the company .
 I must admit I am a novice in respect to digital photography but this program is a little too complicated for me -LRB- more than I can handle at this point -RRB- . The cyber-shot viewer that came with my camera met my needs for photo editing but did not offer a `` delete picture '' option or the capacity to print to a disk . I thought the print to disk option was a part of the Paint Shop package which it does not appear to be .
 I create digital scrapbooking graphics and frequently save items in . png format - which , with this program , ca n't be done properly . It does not retain the transparency . If you save it with the optimizer , you get an ugly background . Without the optimizer , it tricks you into thinking it is alright because it looks transparent to you - however , opening it in any other program -LRB- such as PSE , PSCS , PSP9 , PSPX , etc -RRB- the transparency is replaced by a white background . As of yet , there is no fix for this . It runs extremely slowly and keeps losing track of where my plugins are saved . It 's got potential if some patches to fix these issues are released .
 Anybody who gives this a good review has either just acquired it or has never worked with anything else . There are several features in free software like Picasa2 that are superior to PSP11 , such as the straightening tool . Also , at least when working with Vista , the organizer is very poor . Most maddeningly , while it makes it clear you can delete images from within the organizer -LRB- where they appear as thumbnails -RRB- you can not ! Instead you have to open the image , then delete it . Then go back to the organizer and refresh the set . Imagine bringing home 700 photos from vacation and culling out the worst this way . You ca n't . You have to load the images into a different program like Picasa , cull from there , and then transfer it over to PSP . But that 's okay , because PSP , again with my OS , wo n't recognize images on your card or in your camera ! How bizarre ! Then , when you 're ready to post your photos , you need ANOTHER software package ! Picassa does all three of these things . New much-touted features like `` depth of field '' are basically useless because you have to have the hand of a brain surgeon to draw a neat line around the object you want to highlight.Yet worst of all is the total lack of support . I originally e-mailed two questions and got back nonsensical answers , one urging me to use their phone support -LRB- at $ 25 a pop -RRB- . I have since then sent three more e-mails . I get a notification the will be answered within 24 hours but no answer ever comes . That 's just plain deceitful and possibly a breach of contract . If they say they supply online support they 're obliged to do so.And the complaints about slowness ? I have a fast Core 2 Duo with 4mg on the L2 cache and 2 gigs RAM , yet it can be agonizingly slow . Yet it wo n't even use up all of my RAM . In other words , adding more wo n't do me a bit of good.I do n't know what 's the best sophisticated imaging software out there , but it simply can not be this .
 I too was excited about the new version of Paint Shop Pro . Then I installed it . It takes 2.5-6 minutes to start it with common operations that used to be done in real time taking seconds . Also the new layout of the dialog boxes add unnessicary extra clicks and moved useful functions like quick preview to inconvinient places . This together with it crashing 50 % of the time I run it.Corel now admits that the program is really slow when you have a large image library and say they are working on a solution . If you are wondering what a large image collection is , I 'm running at about 17 000 images , which Picasa handles quite fine.I would recommend trying to find Paint Shop Pro X right now and maybe upgrade to 12 when it comes out , but make sure to download the trial version when 12 comes out , because I agree , each version that Corel has come out with has been worse . Though I would call 10 a side step as they did add some good new features .
 I have been using Paint Shop Pro products for well over ten years . I started with version 3 and have upgraded through every version up to the current version XI . Jasc software , the original manaufacturer sold out to Corel after version 9 . Version 9 was wonderful as every version before it was nearly perfect and sold at a very competative price . At version X , Corel took over from Jasc . I upgraded and was very disapointed in almost every aspect of their new program . Well it 's been almost a year now and once version XI was released I purchased it hoping the problems with version X were corrected . Not only were the original flaws and bugs still in the latest version but major new bugs were there as well . The loading and transitioning through various folders to view and work on images have become extremely slow . While you await the program to load and then transition from one folder to another -LRB- you can wait up to 2 minutes for this to occur every time -RRB- if you click on anything at all , the system can lock up where restarting the program is the only fix . Calling Corel support is useless , they tell you this only happens the first time you start the program and will not happen afterward . THIS IS NOT TRUE . I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program at least three times with no improvement at all . I have a new PC that is used mostly for photography and it fast enough to handle any other program out there including video media and other photo software . My PC is not at fault as Corel likes to say each time I call.Corel , you have lost a long term user of this program and I am quite sure many more will follow suit . You have had almost two years at working with Paint Shop Pro and it is obvious that you ca n't resolve the bugs you have added to this once very fine program . The current version of Paint Shop Pro is absolute GARBAGE ... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product .
 I bought this because I have been using Paint Shop Pro for years . Corel put in a message center , which you are supposed to be able to turn off ... NOT ! For over a week now , I get this pop-up from the message center to buy the new version ... pretty annoying if you want to use the program and have that window in the way constantly ! I called Corel and they gave me a `` tip '' on how to get rid of the messages , well that only worked until I reset my computer . I have been messing around with my registry and everything I could think of . NOTHING worked so far!Looks like I will be asking them for my money back . I do n't need to be paying good money for a program that is pressuring me into buying a new version which I could n't use unless I change my operating system ! They must have been taking lessons from Microsoft ! If you are smart , stay with an older version which still came from Jasc .
 And a resource hog . I 'm sure it could be more stars but considering how long it takes to do ANYTHING & EVERYTHING it 's extremely frustrating to use . After using it awhile you 'll have to reboot your machine just keep using it or it 'll freeze up and crash your system .
 Get used to seeing `` You chose to end the nonresponsive program , Paint Shop Pro XI '' . The `` product '' hangs up , crashes , and displays the ineptitude of its creators for all to see .
 When Jasc introduced paint Shop pro it was a great alternative to using photoshop which had a much higher learning curve . I do a lot of seo work mostly , but have occasion where I need to alter a graphic . The ease of use with paint shop pro by Jasc software allowed me to do that.When Corel bought it and introduced corel paint shop pro , I could tell immediately they were looking for soemthing to compete with adobe photoshop and that they are trying to turn simple paint shop pro into photoshop.They have succeeded in making paint shop pro load as slow as photoshop . They moved everything around . They changed the old simple way of dealing with text in an image to make it more difficult and more like photoshop.They just can not leave well-enough alone . My suggestion is if corel wants to create a program that competes with photoshop , go ahead and do it . Leave paint shop pro alone . There are some of us who do not want a more complicated slower-loading graphics program .
 I 've been a loyal PSP fan since the shareware days . After sticking with version 8.x for years , I thought I 'd take advantage of an attractive upgrade offer from Corel to go to version XI.My machine is n't the greatest , but it 's not the worst either -LRB- 2.5 GHz with 2GB RAM -RRB- and this program was * painful * to try to use . Even after they released the patch , it was practically unusable and brought the entire system to a crawl . The installer changes the file associations for images to point to PSP XI which is normal . However , I would forget this and try to do a quick open of an image file and literally cringe when that splash screen of the girl with the camera appeared knowing it would be several excruciating seconds before I could shut the app down and open the image in something usable . I finally just un-installed the thing and went back to version 8.x . It 's too bad . I really hoped to take advantage of some of the advanced features offered in PSP and Photoshop is priced way out of my league .
 I purchased this program and also got Photoshop Elements . I wanted to evaluate which is the best for my purposes -- mainly adjusting and tweaking my digital camera 's photos . I got up and running right away with Elements , but Paint Shop Pro took a long time to start up , and then I was frustrated trying to understand the program . The booklet that came with it was of course useless . Everything went slowly and I soon became frustrated . Others reviewers apparently liked it but it did nothing for me . I am returning it to Amazon for a refund . I 'll stick with Photoshop Elements .
 I have been a fan of PSP since version 5 . For a fraction of the price it does 99 % of what Photoshop can do , and the user interface is easier and more intuitive . HOWEVER , this new version is a huge step backwards , and it 's a real shame . Whatever enhancements may have been added to the program are irrelevant , as its bugs and _ insanely _ slow performance make it essentially un-usable . Basic operations , like opening the browser view , take forever . I 've tried it out on two different systems , a Pentium 4 with 1G RAM and an Athlon X2-64 with 2G of RAM , and several times I 've seen it completely hang after only a few minutes of use . Stick with PSP 9 or 10 and you will be much happier .
 Norton has been my virus program of choice ... until now.I tried to install 2004 on Windows ME O/S , and it would not install correctly . Error message
 I purchased this `` course '' a couple of years ago when I was beginning to learn Swedish.I am now fluent . This `` course '' is effluent.It consists solely of a CD with 4 short swedish passages in it and little else.A mere 5 minutes on the web would garner more material than is in this CD.I purchased the CD because of the `` reviews '' on amazon.I can only surmise that these reviewers have a vested interest in giving their grossly misleading reviews . -LRB- employees of the producer of this useless course -RRB- I would not even buy this course second hand for 1 euro .
 First off the software that I purchased from a rip-off computer store was not what was promised on the box . On the box it states that the software is compatible with Mac OS X and Windows . I installed the software on my computer which runs OS X 10.2 . I see this crap is running some print shop suite -LRB- not the business card software -RRB- and the business card section is extremely minimal . The grahpics are so elementary and I will be complaining to the manufacturer ASAP . It 's a shame to advertise falsely . I did n't get what I paid for at all . I ended up using some shareware and the cards look beautiful . Overlook this product . This company SUCKS
 I thought at first it was just me but after turning the software over to one of my co-workers who is exceptionally good at software , he even had an extremely difficult time trying to get it to work . And forget about getting someone on their support phone line , it wo n't happen . Save yourself money andforget this software .
 This program is waste of money . Works terrible , is clumsey and has few controls for any creativity . No support from the company . A very poorly written program . I will stay away from IMSI software altogether after this . This was a rip off .
 This is just bad . That says it all . It throws you into a shark tank , with EVERYTHING being in Polish , from beginning to end . The only thing I was able to absorb was the Polish alphabet . Even learning the alphabet took me days . The book is a much better way to go when learning a language . This is too fast paced , spoken too quickly , and absolutely no good for beginners . Only people who know an intermediate amount of Polish will find this good.Pros : Easy to learn alphabet , with practiceCons : Too fast pacedEverything written in Polish from start to endNo Polish/English dictionaryNO GOOD GRAMMAR HELP -LRB- biggest problem -RRB- Speakers talk to fast , making much of the talks sound like jibberish , especially if you are new to the Polish tongueOverall , just plain BAD . Transparent Language 's way to approach language learning just does n't work . The book is a much better method . Just take a class with the book and it will be MUCH easier and less stressful to learn another language . And if you choose to use computer software , DO NOT use Transparent Language products .
 I must agree that one could do a * much * better job of making a cd-rom for learning dutch -LRB- or the other languages -RRB- . There 's no systematic teaching of sentence structure , grammar rules , etc. - it 's very poorly designed as a `` language course '' . Also , the program -LRB- I 'm using the Mac version -RRB- is many years old , and has n't been updated for OS X . The sound and video are low-resolution and grainy.On the other hand , I do find it useful , if only because a cd-rom is a better tool for practicing than a cassette tape . You can easily skip around the texts , click on individual words or whole sentences to hear them , see the -LRB- not always helpful -RRB- translation , etc. - so I would say that in conjunction with a * real * language course -LRB- maybe a good book -RRB- this could be helpful for extra practice . But ideally I would like to find a good-quality cd-rom language course . Anyone know of one ?
 As a CD designed for English speakers who want to learn Dutch , Learn Dutch Now 10.0 failed miserably . The content must not have been reviewed by a native English speaker , because some examples are given only in French or German , and many examples that are given in English are incorrect ! Obvious errors and poorly designed learning structures abound . Of course some useful content is contained , but not content that one can rely upon if your reason for learning Dutch is for more than entertainment . This is my third language and my fiance 's sixth , and neither of us found it useful enough to be worth the money or the time we invested in studying . We now have to invest in another program and spend many more hours studying from the beginning . We 're not pleased at all .
 I found this program to be too confusing for a beginner . Whole paragraphs of Irish written and spoken by a Gaelic speaker are just too overwhelming for a newcomer to the language . I am sorry that I wasted my money on this program .
 This software is a prime example of what a bad written software can be ! After I installed the software , I did not find any good way of trimming away some of the excess fat in order to make a good quality backup -LRB- i.e. lack of program options -RRB- . Fortunately , I found some public domain software - `` InstantCopySettings '' to help with this . The software takes way too long even on a P4 machine to transcode a DVD . The real icing on the cake is that after it automatically adjusted to fit on a 4.7 GB DVD+RW , it complained about not being able to write to the disk . Since it creates the content in its proprietary format , I could n't even use Nero to burn it to the DVD . DVD Shrink Beta 5 did a great job of converting including writing to the same DVD+RW disk - i.e. the disk was not faulty.I also tried to make a DVD using still images . Could n't figure out how to make this work.Saving the worst for last - this software also installs `` Instant Drive '' . This interfered with DVD Shrink making it hang . I can not even uninstall the `` Instant Drive '' completely -LRB- amateur programmers ! -RRB- . I did get the software for free after rebates - but it is collecting dust now ! I would recommend staying away from it .
 My laptop came pre-installed with Instant DVD/CD but my experience is the same as many of your other correspondents ; I have yet to burn a DVD successfully - it appears to go all the way then either slows to a trickle , never quite completing the burning operation , or simply crashes . Their web-site is no help , I 've installed the most up-to-date patches but there 's no improvement and apparently no help . I think I will go back to Nero if I can actually remove this successfully from my PC !
 This review is for Pinnacle Instant CD/DVD version 7.06 . There is a newer version on the market , so I was able to pick this up cheap , thinking that I was getting a bargain . Guess again . I was hoping that I 'd be able to edit video files that I 'd ripped from DVD after changing them from VOB to mpeg . No luck . Whenever I try to import video it crashes . Have n't tried other formats yet . Maybe I 'll have better luck with avi or mpg , but I 'm not holding my breath . In addition , the interface on the video editing software is idiotically simple , yet simultaneously unintuitive , so you get the worst of both worlds.Patches ? The Pinnacle website was no help , having only three links in the support section for version 7x . All of the links were dead , but it did n't matter anyhow because none of them appeared to be related to my problem . Have n't contacted support yet.Oh , and good luck getting this thing off your machine if you do n't want it . Not only does it not come with an uninstall , but it stashes files all over the place , and it screwed up my other burning software so that it would n't work ! If you install this , make sure you use a program that keeps track of the changes made so that you can completely uninstall it -LRB- I think there 's something in Norton utilities that does the job -RRB- . In addition to the craptacular editing program , Instant CD/DVD comes with several other programs , none of which interested me . I have tried the disc burning program -- I had no choice since Instant CD/DVD screwed up my Nero files -- and it worked the first few times , but it soon started crashing , too . I figure it crashed about 20 % of the time . I 've also tried Instant Copy , which is included in the Instant CD/DVD suite , as a stand alone program and found it remarkably underwhelming . It takes for-e-ver , even on a P4 machine . I much prefer DVD Shrink , which is free and decrypts discs , unlike Instant Copy.After spending hours fooling around with Instant CD/DVD I realized that it 's much more than just bad software . It 's a material refutation of the dogma of free-market efficiency . If Pinnacle is still in business , then clearly , clearly , markets do n't work in the manner that economists like to imagine.The most satisfying thing about this software is the feeling you get when you throw it in the trash .
 Read this warning - - - I purchased Pinnacle Studio 11 and Instant DVD came with it . If you want to use Windows XP Drag and Drop , Nero , Roxio or any other burning software , DO NOT INSTALL THIS PRODUCT . As soon as it is installed , this product completely takes over any CD/DVD burner that you have and you will not be able to record with any other software package , including Windows XP and Windows Media Player . It took me several days to find out what happened to XP , The record tab was removed from the CD \ DVD properties window and I could no longer use Drag and Drop , or my Roxio burning software . The only way I could get full use back was to un-installed this product . No software should to this , and if I were the makers of Roxio , Nero , and even Microsoft , I would make sure everyone found out about what this product is doing to disable their products .
 I have used several Pinnacle products in the past and when Instant CD/DVD came out I bought the package right away . Having already had a few DVD 's ruined with scratches , I thought I would back them up . What a mistake as it turns out Instant CD/DVD will not copy any copy protected movies , and practically all are protected . Buy DVD X Copy or try some of the free programs . Do n't waste your money if you are buying to just copy DVD 's . If for other reasons , go ahead , as the package has some nice features .
 Even though this purchase was rather inexpensive it was still throwing money out the window . It would never recognize my burners in the destination sections when I tried to burn a DVD from the HD . The hard drive was the only destination source it would give me . Contacted Pinnacle and after trying several suggestions that didnt work they sent my an e-mail that said they no longer supported this product and said I should upgrade to a different product they had .
 I 've been using computer software for years but this program was very hard to use . I finally just gave up and uninstalled it .
 Shortly after buying the product I had to replace my computer and the product was not used .
 My first child played with the original DOS versions of Busytown and How Thing Work . They are GREAT games to learn and explore with . When we switched to a new computer with Win 98 , the DOS versions had major problems finding and using the sound card properly . Tech Support was unable to help me solve them.We bought Busytown 2000 because the older child still wanted to play it and we had a second child that we wanted to have the game also . We bought it because it was advertised as Win 95/98 compatible , and we figured that , at worst , it would be the same game with Win 9x compatibility added . Big Mistake . The game animation is nowhere near as good as the original . Gameplay is uneven at best , and at least one area we had to reboot the computer to exit . Another area rebooted the computer for us 1 out of 3 times the kids went there.Busytown is a great franchise , particularly if you have a 486 still running DOS to play the older games on . They did n't like Win 3.1 , and they really do n't get along with Win 9x . Busytown 2000 does not apply the quality of the older games to the Win 9x platform . It 's cheap animation matched with poor gameplay . If Amazon let me return software , it would be in the mail tomorrow .
 We ordered this software twice , and each time there was a problem when we tried to enter the gas station section . Amazon was very helpful in dealing with this , however they obviously can not solve the tech defect . Very disappointing , son loves Busytown videos .
 I brought this because I loved richard scary as a child but was totally disappointed with the game . There is no replayabilty with the only variation in the game being in the gas station and the parcel delivery . But the children soon got bored . The best part is playing with the wind . The mouse control is very poor ending up with frustrated children . The only way to get into the gas station was to put the whole game onto the hard drive .
 My three yr old loves Richard Scarry 's Busytown so it was a natural choice for him . However , he was very disapointed to find one of the games -LRB- the garage -RRB- did not work at all and several of the others have programming quirks . If the cursor is n't positioned just right the game does n't work . My advice is to select something else or wait for another imporved version .
 Label Studio Pro does not work on Mac OS X Lion!So disappointing.Lion has killed Power PC application support!Is there another label application to suite Lion ?
 I purchased this DVD expecting alot of good info , what I got was a big ripoff some guy running his gums saying nothing.I purchased 2 D70s cameras and found the instruction book to be the best help.Plzz save your money buying this DVD , get the real deal Read !!!! the instruction info book .
 Being that XP support is going a way , this software seems like it would be a bit of a waste at this point . I picked it up for a newbie . I tested it and it ran flaky . So , it was never used . Based on the cost , a return was n't worth bothering over . Looking back , a waste of money .
 Well if you have no desire in converting your music or lecture to mp3 , then this product is excellent . However if you want to convert your lecture or music into mp3 , here is the problem.You have to register for a password to enable the MP3 encoder.Not a problem on the first load . But if your computer crashes and you decide to buy a new one computer . The activation code will not work on your new computer and they will NOT NOT NOT send you a new activation code.So you are stuck with two option , either by some new software or find an wav to mp3 converter.My thing is this , why do they have this activation code in the first place . It is such a big pain in the butt . If you paid for the product you should n't have to register it to activate something you already paid for.There are other alternatives to audio cleaning.Sound Forge Audio Studio , you do n't have to register to active the mp3 encoder.If that is to expensive , there are free recorders on the internet.I am NOT NOT NOT very pleased about this feature , because I restore my computer back to factory setting once a year . And you can not enable the mp3 encoder once you have activated it once . As Magix will not send you another password . And I am about to upgrade my computer to a brand new computer and guess what , this product will worthless , once I get a new computer . I 'll have to buy a new one .
 Too late.I just read T. V. Goodwin review after I placed an order for MAGIX Audio Clean Lab 10 . I am going to send a complaint to the FTC since it says nothing about the upgrade on the package until one go to export a file as a MP3 format . The upgrade says nothing about not being transferable . It is bad enough to have to buy a program twice , but 3 and 4 times ? That is why I quit buying Norton products .
 Having trouble with ACL ? Then try the freeware Audacity -LRB- audacity.soundforge.net -RRB- It 's fast , has a wealth of features , never crashes , writes MP3 's ... Do I need to say more ?
 This product appears to be the real deal for converting your vinyl and tape collection to CD or DVD . It has a number of features for removing tape hiss and pops and crackles from vinyl recordings via easy to use slider bars in the control window as well as auto track detection which is a nice feature.What they do n't tell you is that the MP3 encoder is only good for 20 uses - 10 of which you 'll burn getting the hang of the software ! Of course they are happy to sell you the add-on MP3 encoder . I 'm an advanced PC user and I ca n't get it to work properly . My vinyl and tape conversions all come out `` tinny '' sounding . My PC is 1.2 ghz with over 700mbytes of RAM and I get frequent `` you are overloading the system '' messages . I 'd guess that you would n't even want to try using it with the minimum config of 450mhz and 64MB of RAM.The real reason for this product seems to be as a come-on for another version of the software as there are plenty of notices about how to upgrade . And , while I suspect they are within the letter of law trumpeting `` MP3 Encoder '' in their product information , the fact that they do n't tell you the encoder is merely a trial version with limited usages makes me suspicious of everything else Magix claims . I 'm frankly quite terked off at the product but of course you ca n't return software for a refund .
 I have never owned a piece of software as buggy as this thing . I am running it on an AMD 64 3500 + system with RAID and SATA drives , XP Pro . This thing does nothing but crash . I got it to record a record , but when I went to the audio cleaning section , it crashed every time I tried to use the Wizard . The interface is not very intuitive and the whole thing is cobbled up with really stupid looking audio equipment faceplates and dials . What a mess . I have yet to make a recording with it . Do n't waste your money on this software . Want to buy my copy ? I certainly ca n't use it .
 I purchased this product after checking the Broderbund website to verify compatibility to Windows XP . Broderbund fails to mention the numerous problems you may encounter if you run this on Windows XP ; and the trial and error installation method needed to get it to run properly . Broderbund 's concept of XP compatibility is not what you will expect .
 Do n't expect your version of Quicken to last long . Unlike almost all other software developers , the folks at Quicken seem to look for ways to make their product out of date so they have to be repurchased . And then they do n't even offer upgrades , you have to buy the whole thing over again . Avoid getting into this system . If you do , plan on renewing it ever couple years at a high cost .
 Truly unbelievable . I was forced to upgrade to 2007 to maintain payroll services . I bought it and can no longer work . My data file exploded in size . For example , I started backing up my file 15 minutes ago and it 's still in `` verifying data '' mode -LRB- backup used to take about 2 minutes tops -RRB- . I ca n't do anything in the books . I 'm paralyzed . I 've tried every `` solution '' I could find in every group and support and blog site on in the internet . DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION UNTIL THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY 'VE DONE TO MAKE THE FILE SIZE EXPLODE AND FIX IT . IF YOU ARE NEW TO BOOKKEEPING , GO ELSEWHERE . If you are like me - an eight-year quickbooks -LRB- l -RRB- user , well , I do n't know . I 'm completely at a loss .
 We ordered the 5-user package for our office , to upgrade from Quickbooks2004 , partly because the Intuit sales material touts its time-keeping ability integrated with the accounting . The installation was long , difficult and complicated . The timekeeping function is unusable . As was the case with 2004 version , you can not use the program until you spend a lot of time -LRB- a LOT of time ! -RRB- learning all the intricacies and non-intuitive user interface . The really aggravating thing is that 2007 introduces a whole new user interface , which means weeks of lowered production while we learn the new program . Just unacceptable . We uninstalled 2007 , re-installed 2004 , and we are sending the 2007 package back to Intuit for a refund .
 The worst upgrade ever . Please stop making me upgrade to newer , slower , more memory intensive applications that bog down my computer and do n't work as well as what they were meant to replace . I would have stuck with qbooks 2005 -LRB- or 2003 -RRB- if they had n't stopped supporting payroll for them .
 I bought this product because I have a client that is working with Quickbooks 2007 and I wanted to be able to take their file home without upgrading them , but I could not get it to upload properly because it was previously owned . I will never buy a previously owned product again
 I do n't have a problem with the software . It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare . Before I start this tirade , I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice . But they do n't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service -LRB- please , read on -RRB- . The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary . -LRB- 1 -RRB- They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription !! -LRB- 2 -RRB- They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS !! I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card . The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice , which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 -LRB- duh !! -RRB- . What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts ! If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal , the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement . Have they every heard of a `` paper trail '' . Well you sure wo n't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product . I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously do n't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles .
 Using this product with Windows XP works fine . But I bought QuickBooks 2007 specifically because it was required for Windows Vista . But it simply crashes all the time . Here are some features that presently cause QuickBooks to crash -LRB- some of them are new bugs to the most recent update -- March 2007 -RRB- : - double-clicking on a report to drill down to data -- > CRASH - resizing a timesheet window -- > CRASH - saving an invoice -- > CRASHThe good news is that my data has n't become corrupted yet . The bad news is that these are crashes that are predictable and always occur -- and yet , I 'm not the one who spends most of his time in the books ; I 'm sure there are other issues that I could get my bookkeeper to list off . On my XP machine , this application works fine . But why did I shell out over $ 300 for a product that does n't do what it 's advertised to do -LRB- have you seen all the advertisements that are partnerships between Intuit and Microsoft for how well the two programs work together ? -RRB- -- that is , it does n't yet work with Vista.My business is in serious danger of losing its financial data because of this buggy product . That scares the heck out of me . Wait before buying this version or try Microsoft Accounting 2007 if you 're new to a financial tool -LRB- ca n't vouch for it ... but why not , right ? -RRB- . I really like QuickBooks ' features , have been using it for 5 years -- but I hate that Intuit has once again failed to deliver.And one more word to the wise -- do n't ever give them your real mailing address -- I get more mail from them than any other advertiser .
 I am using QB Premium 2006 now and just upgraded my PC to Vista.I did not imagine that QB2006 was not compatible with Vista -LRB- my fault not to check -RRB- and no upgrades are available and Intuit is not planning any , recommending to upgrade to 2007 version . $ 300 + annual upgrade seems too expensive!Software is good , but not great and there is no justification for the price , except greed . With so many users , Intuit should be able to provide upgrade compatible with Vista for less ... Looking around for competitive packages - MS Office Accounting looks good -LRB- and MUCH less expensive -RRB- - I 'll check that one out !
 I wish I had more to offer however , when I ran into my first roadblock using the Quickbooks Retail 2007 it asked me to register it . When I called to do that , they told me that the copy I bought was pirated !! Then they aggressively tried to sell me one at full retail . 45 minutes later , 1 supervisor and 1 manager , I was offered a 15 % discount and all of the things that they already give you for free.I am very disappointed so far .
 I recently purchased and installed the Final Cut Studio Upgrade . The difference from Final Cut 4.5 is amazing ! The products in the suite are tremendous ! I used the studio without a hitch for the first couple of weeks . A few days ago , I installed recommended Apple updates , and now all of the sudden , my serial number is invalid !!! I paid good money for a suite I can not use . The Apple website provides no ` real ' support . There are no email addresses , no phone numbers , and nothing in the troubleshooting that addresses my problem ! The only potential support I can find is to purchase Applecare for Video . Why do I need to PURCHASE support when I already paid for the product . The product should work and the support should be included !!!
 I have Quickbooks 2004 and was forced to purchase this new version at full price . If you buy this product , make sure you are ready to buy it again in 2-3 years - and do n't expect a discount . It does a good job as a simple accounting package , but be prepared for a barrage of advertisements in the software trying to get you to buy/upgrade to monthly services such as online time-sheets or payroll table updates .
 If I could give zero stars , I would . I have used Quickbooks since it was created , and it seems each time there is an upgrade , there are more bugs and problems . We upgraded to the Premier 2007 5-user edition recently , and ever since we are unable to use the product in Multi-user mode . At least six calls to 1-800-India have yielded no results ; one of these calls was over four hours long . The only solution they can come up with is for us to switch to Enterprise Solutions , which we do not need because we 're not that big a company -LRB- we are a church for heaven 's sake ! -RRB- . Not to mention the fact that Enterprise Solutions is $ 300 more expensive . And of course the product can not be `` undone '' once you 've upgraded , so you 're stuck . I 'm shopping for Peachtree very soon ...
 I would not hesitate to order any other sermons carried by this seller . I have 5 so far , and plan to buy more . However , I was a bit disappointed by this particular sermon . I think it is okay , however . If you are really searching for answers on this subject , go ahead and order it as you may get more out of it than I did .
 To catch spyware , I primarily use ZoneAlarm to catch applications trying to access the internet . If I find an application I 'm unfamiliar with , I Google for it -LRB- try &#34; application.exe spyware &#34; -RRB- , then find out whether or not to rid it from my system . Sometimes , I 'll run msconfig &#62; Startup to see if the application automatically starts up . This method works well to look for spyware , as well as turn off resource-consuming applications I 'm not using . -LRB- The two primary spyware-removing applications I use are Yahoo anti-spyware , Lavasoft AdAware , and AVG . All are free . -RRB- NIS works much like ZoneAlarm , plus adds optional individual user accounts , and tries to anticipate which pages to block . While this is a good idea , I do n't like how NIS does it . In particular , it kept me from access Google and Yahoo! When it asks to block an application , it only gives the name of the application . For a paid product , I would expect some information about the application -LRB- like what it does and which company created it -RRB- . -LRB- ZoneAlarm also does n't tell you more than the application name , but it 's free . -RRB- Uninstallation was a minor nightmare . Remember the user accounts ? I had to log in as administrative user -- not easy when resource-consuming applications are hanging . For some reason , I had an easier time uninstalling NIS from a Win98Se machine than WinXP . -LRB- The WinXP has less memory available . -RRB-
 I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE WITH IT . ABOUT EVERY MONTH THERE WOULD BE AN ERROR AND I WOULD HAVE TO UNSTALL AND THEN INSTALL . I AM ON A DIALUP INTERNET AND THIS TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO DO THIS . I HAVE CALLED NORTONS IN INDIA AND I COULD N'T GET HIM TO UNDERSTAND ME BESIDES HELP ME . MY UPDATE ON NORTONS WILL NOT UPDATE ALL OF THE UPDATES . NORTON INTERNET SECURITY 2004 STINKS . BESIDE THAT WHEN I BOUGHT IT I APPLIED FOR THE REBATE ON IT THEY GAVE ME THE RUNAROUND THAT I DID N'T DO IT RIGHT . SIGNED VERY DISAPPOINTED .
 I ai n't no computer geek , but I can wrestle with the best of them . This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online . I gave up trying to figure how to get my email sent or listen to streaming programs . Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks . For security buy Zone Alarm . It 's a very friendly program .
 OK , Firstly I would like to thank everyone who posted a review for this product . I found this to be the most helpful site . I just wish I would have read up on the product before I purchased it . My 2003 version of norton expired and I felt vulnerable to attack so I upgraded to the professional version . From the minute I installed it , I could n't connect to the internet . I went through the help wizard and I turned off this device and that level , etc. . . My LAN port and my wireless ports became disabled so I reinstalled the drivers and they seem to be working properly , but still no connection . Yahoo IM somehow found a way out and was connecting , but it could n't retrieve my mail or anything else . I thought that there was something that I was missing and I knew the best place to look was from customers who were having the same problem . I found this site first . After one week of trying everything on my own , I found this review and immediately removed Norton from my computer and Walla ... back on the internet . I 've never had so many problems with software in my life . I would n't have given this product a 1 , but that was the lowest this site would allow me to give . DO N'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID . STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT !!!! IF ITS TOO LATE FOR YOU TOO , REMOVE IT AND YOUR PROBLEMS WILL DISAPPEAR .
 Overpriced and underpowered ... . This software is more annoying then anything else . You practically have to turn off every setting to get your networked printers and network games to work , for example . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 I have been a Norton Internet Security user for years with total satisfaction . Upgrading to the 2004 version has nearly destroyed my Microsoft Outlook - it took hours to get back my previous Emails and more importantly my Address Book . It is still not as it was , but at least I can see everything . My Freecell is totally unusable . Also having problems with Word . The Symantec website has many articles to read to ` fix ' what is broken by uploading the product . Too bad they did n't put as much effort into fixing it . I 'm deleting this version from my computer and moving to something that will work !
 I really liked the firewall . It can be a pain to configure , but I dealt with it . THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc , I could n't get to anything in IE . I have gone to their site many times in the last two months looking for an answer . I 've tried lots of things they suggest . My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point . The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription ! The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it . It 's become tedious doing this . Wish I had n't renewed my subscription . Buy ZONE Alarm . Wish I had .
 Let me start by admitting that I do n't have a top of the line computer -LRB- 1 GHz Duron with 256 MB of RAM -RRB- but it was certainly fast enough for me until I installed Norton Internet Security.I 'll give it two stars because the virus scan works pretty good . I primarily bought the product because I was interested in the Parental Controls -LRB- web site filtering -RRB- . It works but it made me feel like 15 years ago when I was on a 486 with a dial up modem . Looking at Task Manager in XP I saw that the internet filtering application had sucked up 86 MB of RAM and a good percentage of the CPU time . Maybe if you have a 2-3 GHz machine and 512 MB of RAM it would run better.My solution was to disable everything and do a manual virus scan once in a while . For content filering I got the Linksys WRT54GS router and signed up for the Parental Control subscription . So far I am happy with the Linksys router -LRB- my computer is back up to speed and no porn -RRB- . After some time with it I 'll put in a review for it .
 I purchased this product and paid $ 69.99 for it , only to find out that it is the worst piece of software I have ever seen . I installed it , rebooted my computer and a zillion errors about internal programming so I uninstalled and reinstalled the program like it told me to ; same result three times . I had to disable the software so that I could get on the Internet , and when I went to their site I found ZERO help there until I happened to run across an article that somewhat helped . I followed the instructions about running LiveUpdate to fix the bugs in the software -LRB- 15 bugs -RRB- , and still did n't work so I sent the product back and got my money back.If you want nothing but pure trouble and aggravation , then this program is for you .

 I 've been a loyal Norton software user since 1990 and have recommended it to many . No longer . The last few years of `` upgrades '' , while adding dubious benefits , have been progressively harder to install and run . In 2002 & 2003 , well-publicized product key renewal glitches sent customers running to the competition . Now it appears to be a variety of issues , not the least of which in my case is an inability to access email via Outlook or Outlook Express when there are multiple Windows users on a single PC.This appears to be an AntiSpam problem based on other reviews , although 20 + emails exchanged with their free email `` technical support '' have not pointed in that direction . I have gone full-circle with their email support twice now , always coming back to the same solutions I have tried unsuccessfully . After loading the various programs into memory one at a time -LRB- I have both NIS and NSW 2004 installed -RRB- , the one which seems to consistently cause email problems is AntiSpam.One would think that a software company that specializes in utility tools that find and fix PC problems would not release a product that creates as many or more problems than it fixes . While far from an expert , I am more technically capable than the average PC user . I would hate to think of the problems the average or below-average user could experience by loading this product that is supposed to be providing protection . Symantec has apparently decided to sacrifice quality for quantity - in the end they will sacrifice both . Great utilities , when they work , but far , far to much effort is required to make them work properly .
 It 's really a shame that there are no products like this that are n't total hogs , aimed and prices at the consumer market and yet not require 15 Microsoft certifications to operate . I find it quite hillarious that this intrusion and privacy product becomes impossible to uninstall , hacks into your existing software without asking -LRB- ie it will install itself in outlook and give you no means of removing it from same , and outlook will not work if you do manage to kill all of the symantec crap -RRB- , and spams you with an ominous looking red exclamation point when you turn any of it 's crap off.Truthfully , the world is fairly computer literate , is it not trespassing to so blatantly burrow so far into your property as all software does now , while deliberately not telling you and making it impossible to remove ?
 I purchased System works 2003 which included the internet security , and was completely happy . I decided to upgrade because the rebates and price was cheaper than re-newing my subscription . However , even tho 2004 looks like it has more ` features ' , it is a major step backwards . The pop up add blocker works marginally at best . The spam control does not work at all for me , and the privacy blocker is very difficult to work with , especially when using email -LRB- i.e. if there are several personal items , you are promted for each one . Say no once and the entire email is canned -RRB- . I would not recommend this product to ANYONE !
 I previously had Nortons System Works and Norton Firewall.This product is a disaster . It is the worst piece of softwareI 've ever had to deal with . My computer locks up and Ctrl/alt/Delete wo n't even work . I uninstalled it and reinstalled it.It is a true nightmare . There is no online help and going to their site is useless . You have to call and pay . Who needs this ?
 I am on my fourth attempt to install -LRB- really upgrade from 2003 -RRB- the Norton Firewall that was bundled with the Internet Security . It has been a disaster . Everything works if I disable the Firewall , but is n't that a problem ? Their web site has plenty of articles on troubleshooting the product , though none have solved the problem . I am tempted to call for support , but I am not interested in paying Norton more money for a product I have already paid for . I am tempted to follow some of the other reviewer 's lead and pick another product .
 Once you get it to work it is pretty good . In general , now that I have cooled down , I am probably happy . However , I have installed this product on 4 computers and it has crashed all 4 in some fashion . This product cost me over 25 hours to recover my systems damaged from the installation . At a minimum , make a full back up before starting the install . I was even an existing Norton customer with installed Norton software and it still crashed my computers . Norton has a real problem and they wo n't even acknowledge it . I think they are basically a good company and this is basically a good product but it is not ready for primetime . Bottom-line , unless you are a real PC weenie with lots of time on your hands when things go wrong , do n't install this product . Maybe worth revisiting in the future .
 I am not impressed with NIS 2004 and have abandoned it for Zone Alarm despite prior satisfaction with NIS . I ca n't complain since NIS is usually cheap after rebates . However several issues with 2004 have soured me including the fact that after I installed it on an XP system , it blocked ALL access to the Internet . Then after uninstalling and trying again , I had to call Symantec and wait 30 minutes for it to allow me to enter the product registration code -LRB- Symantec is now not allowing multiple installs for your home computers -RRB- and still did n't work . Finally , the free support is lackluster . I decided to spend my money on a new product rather than paid support for this product . Goodbye NIS , maybe I will try you again someday
 2002 was fine , 2003 was great ... why in the hell did I upgrade this product to their hellish 2004 version ??? Various things just do n't work or fail to report their status . Initially I uninstalled my 2003 IS from the control panel . It seemed to work fine . Then I uninstalled NAV with not problem . Then I installed 2004 . I never uninstalled my 2003 Systemworks . My popup blocker did not work . Antispan did not work . I referenced Symantec help which has all these confusing ways to uninstall their products since the control panel uninstall does n't seem to be reliable . So I spent a couple hours reading uninstalling , reinstalling Windows 5.6 scripts bla bla . So I even uninstalled Systemworks . Then reinstalled 2004 NIS . More things seemed to work this time like the popup blocker so I thought I was safe . The antispam started marking email as spam -LRB- I ca n't figure out how to have spam automatically put in the spam folder ?? -RRB- but now my email pop3 connection closes down after 5-10 emails come in so I have to turn the antispam off to get my email . Then after all this I run the Symantec auto problem solver configurer which tells me Liveupdate is an older version so I run the fix for that but am still experiencing problems . I 'm tempted to convert to Mcafee but I hear they have problems too . What 's one to do ? Also my 2003 was great to read the reports on how many viruses were caught , their names etc. . Now when I go to the reports section it is blank . So I 'm not even sure it 's capturing the stuff . I 've hardly ever written reviews but this experience has motivated me to do so .
 I was renewing my anti-virus subscription and decided to upgrade to NIS 2004 . Bad decision.The firewall contains `` automatic '' rules for a large majority of programs , mostly Microsoft products , based upon policies that I do n't understand . I do n't want to `` automatically '' allow connections to products with yet undiscovered security holes . Even ZoneAlarm Basic is better and it costs $ 0 . The spam filter marks all non-English email as spam . I now have to pore over all spam to dig out my wife 's foreign corresponence , a procedure much more painful than manually deleting the spam in the first place . Terrible.I do n't see any advantage to the pop-up blocker beyond what one gets with the free and generally useful google toolbar.The intrusion detection is the worst , simply an anologue of Anti-virus signiture matching applied to the network . The firewall blocks offending source IP addresses for 30 minutes . Lame . If an attacker forges the source address as www.amazon.com does NIS 2004 block that too ? Probably.Get Norton Anti-virus and skip the rest . It 's useless crap .
 In the past I have bought nothing but Norton they have allways done well but this piece of garbage destroyed my computer . After installing and restarting everytime I went logged in it would crash the computer . I tried everything I knew , but finnally got it uninstalled . and to top it off there is no tech support line to help me with problems only via internet ! how can I reach them without a working computer.Don ' t buy this get a freeware antivirus and just buy Norton firewall .
 This is a follow-up to my November review of this virus-injection software . After reading the few people who have had no problems with the program and their comments that all of the people who had problems must either be stupid or have a Radio Shack TRS-80 sitting on their desk , I felt I needed to expound . I have an AMD 1.73 GHz processor , 1.5 GB of ram , and 480 GB of memory spread across 4 hard drives -LRB- one of which is on an IDE controller card -RRB- . I did a format and fresh install of Windows Professional with SP1 prior to installing NIS2004 . Once installed , if I opened up Windows Explorer , it would hang for about 10 minutes -LRB- not an exaggeration -RRB- before it recognized my drives . If I explored a drive it was fine , but as soon as I returned to the list of physical drives it would hang for another 10 minutes . The same thing would happen to any application that integrates Explorer -LRB- such as media playback programs -RRB- . My USB ports became inoperable -LRB- my printer and scanner were n't recognized -RRB- and file sharing over my network became near impossible since to do so requires the use of explorer -LRB- FlashFXP was still functional -RRB- . While I was able to use the internet , IE was slow to load pages . I completely unistalled and reinstalled three times to no avail . I followed the instructions to the letter . It was the trial copy so I was n't out any money -- thank God . I HIGHLY recommend downloading a trial copy before purchasing this . For the few reviewers who had no problems installing and using this product -- count your blessings .
 I regret spending any money on the Norton Internet Security 2004 . Please do n't purchase this product . You will be flushing your money away ! It almost crashed my computer , it was so slow you could take a nap just logging on . I un-installed the software , and my computer works great now . I just dont have any anti-virus Security . I think Norton needs to make a patch or something to fix this problem . I 'm not the only one that has had problems with this product.Anna
 BEWARE . This product may cause corruption under Windows 98 Second Edition . I installed it on a Dell XPSR450 Pentium II , 450 Mhz , running Win98SE and it not only corrupted Windows , but also caused physical hard drive sector damage so bad the drive had to be replaced . I am no novice , been in IT for 26 years and have built and repaired many PCs and Macs . This was an older machine but it worked flawlessly and had the drive wiped with clean installs of all apps and Windows just a couple of months prior . No spyware , viruses , etc. . This machine was in good shape behind a hardware and software firewall with Norton Antivirus updated 3 times a week , and Windows fully updated . Norton Internet Security killed my hard drive!I 've never had problems with Norton products on PCs or Macs prior to this .
 This is the first time I ever felt obligated to submit a review . In over 30 years as an IT professional , this is probably the worst software application that I have ever encountered . Historically , I have had positive experiences with Norton products but they appear to have changed their strategy . In the past two months . I have tried to install NIS 2004 on two different PC 's . One is sitting in a box until I have the time to reformat the hard drive and I am still working on the other to remove NIS . Symantec appears to be following the path of the tobacco industry , illegal drug manufacturers and AOL by making it all but impossible to get them out of your system.The first NIS upgrade I attempted was the result of an upgrade from ME -LRB- another fine piece of application code -RRB- to XP . The version of NIS on the ME machine was not compatible with XP so I was forced to upgrade . Once the machine was up on XP , I immediately noticed several problems including the inability to access the network . When I tried to update the firewall rules , which somehow got lost in the upgrade , I received JAVA script errors from IE using the Norton panels . I was also unable to complete the XP activation routines as well as execute the Windows update process . After contacting MS support , they quickly diagnosed my problem as a common NIS issue and referred me to Symantec . After countless attempts , I finally gave up trying to actually speak to a Norton support person and gathered everything I could off the web . I followed all directions including running a specialized application to supposedly remove NIS completely from the system when coupled with a number of manual Registry updates . None of this resolved the problem and because the PC belonged to my parents and I was at the end of my visit , I bought them a new PC . The other is now sitting here waiting on the hard drive reformat which I assume to be the only true way to remove NIS.The second NIS upgrade -LRB- I know , first time shame on you , second time shame on me -RRB- started last weekend when my current NIS Live Update subscription expired . Like a fool , I opted to use an unopened copy of NIS I had picked up for almost nothing after rebates -LRB- I now realize that any cost would have been more than it 's worth -RRB- rather than pay the renewal . After following their automated upgrade process , NIS 2004 refuses to initialize and gives me a 5004 , 115 error . This according to the Symantec website is because I have either insufficient memory or another firewall running . -LRB- neither is true in my case -RRB- . I have tried everything I found on their site as well as several reasonable sounding suggestions I found on the web to no avail . My next move here is to once again do what it takes to remove NIS from my PC and find a suitable replacement . I should have been forewarned when the company I work for -LRB- hint , an extremely large and very recognizable computer company -RRB- recently moved from Symantec to ZoneAlarms for it 's employee base . I would also recommend that if your considering NIS 2004 , you do some research on the web . I think you will find that my experiences are the norm rather than the exception.Bottom line , if you enjoy a challenge , have a lot of time and consider your data expendable , NIS 2004 is your program . For everyone else , do yourself a favor and find an alternative .
 After installing this program and applying LiveUpdate I was asked to reboot . Now my PC will not boot - it only blue screens .
 This product actually seems to be working now , but only after two tech-savvy people spent 3 hours each trying to get it working . The final solution was fairly simple , but getting there was n't much fun . The Symantec online tech support is next to useless , so be warned if you do n't have the patience to fix installation problems if they arise , which it sounds like they do quite often . That said , it seems to be up and running ... for now ...
 That would be one MINUS star , if possible.I used to think Norton was great , but wondered why the system was so sluggish and problem-prone . I finally realized the problem was Norton/Symantec software -LRB- specifically Internet Security and Systems Works -RRB- that was doing the damage . In order to supposedly keep your computer `` safe '' , it eats memory and detracts from other programs.Since Symantec took over from Norton , the programs have been going down hill fast.Windows XP has a buil-in firewall and you can find a variety of anti-virus software in stores or on the Internet.Save your money !
 This is my personal Experience . Before I start I would also like to say that I am an experienced professional when it comes to computers . I work in a large data center with hundreds of servers -LRB- big computers -RRB- , have an MCSE -LRB- Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer Certificate -RRB- and essentially breathe computers . In other words I know what I 'm talking about.So I bought two copies of this software last night . It brought a 950 Mhz machine with 512 megs of ram running Windows XP to it 's knees . This software doubled the boot time of the computer -LRB- at least -RRB- . Not only that but after the desktop loaded it still grinds away for a few minuets . I was going to get the properties of a large file on my PC and the computer just stopped . Then a sign popped up saying it was scanning the file and I could cancel it . I could n't find a setting that would change the virus scanner from the `` Paranoid '' level to some `` Sane '' level of virus scanning . If that was n't enough this morning I tried to FTP into a server -LRB- command line -RRB- and could not because it was blocking me . I then tried to see why . It was also blocking nsloookup . I could not troubleshoot because it seemed to be blocking just about everything . Since I only had 12 hours to cancel the transaction -LRB- electronically return it -RRB- I did that this morning.I previously had Norton Antivirus 2003 Professional . I think I will go back to that.On the up side it does suppress allot of pop-up ads .
 I spent an entire weekend trying to load the software & then uninstall it . There was a litany of problems ; i was unsuccessful with enabling any of the security features or firewall.Then I was denied access to browse on the internet . Symantec does have great customer service but limited ; only Mon-Fri 8am-6pm . i continued to receive error messages that the problem was linked to Microsoft installation ; after being able to download & run other software I came to the conclusion that the software I purchased was corrupt.Terrible disappointment ... since I 've had great success with other Symantec products . I guess they need to work out the bugs on this one .
 Like many people who have had complaints about this program , I can only conclude that this program , itself , is a virus . In fact , it 's the worst virus that I have ever had infect my system . It crashed my windows explorer , which could no longer detect network drives nor my printer , USB ports were lost , and Internet Explorer became sluggish . The first time I installed I had to do a complete reinstall of my OS . The second and third time I attempted to install , I < only > had to completely uninstall NIS2004 -LRB- thank God -RRB- . This is utterly inexcusable from a company that is supposed to PREVENT problems on a PC . Norton 2004 -- you stink ! I 'll stick with 2003 until I can find a decent replacement ...
 I recently purchased an upgrade to Norton Internet Security . I upgraded from NAS 2002 to 2004 because my subsription ran out , that was 1 month ago . Today , I removed the product . There are too many problems and errors to list . I contacted technical support for assistance and they were of no help along with the web site . I experienced so many pop-up notices that I overran the rules database , which technical support told me was not possbile . Save yourself money and time , buy something else .
 I run Win98 and a Pentium 2 . I replaced the 2001 version -LRB- which ran fine -RRB- . This slows down my system to the point of being unusable . I installed , uninstalled , custom reinstalled with less features with the same result . Installed OK , may run OK on P4 machines . Would n't use with older hardware .
 I bought this product from Amazon , it was a copy of an original and quit working . I called Symantec and they told me it was a fake . I 'm in the process of trying to get a refund or chargeback . Do n't buy from Amazon
 If you have Windows XP , avoid this program at all costs . I ca n't believe I dropped $ 50 for hours upon hours of agony . It will compromise your system beyond all hope . I ended up having to do a full system recovery before my laptop was back to normal . And , do n't even bother w / calling Norton for help . You 'll just end up even angrier . Buy something else , ANYTHING else . Just avoid this product , you 'll thank me later .
 The good
 John W Thompson CEOWorld HeadquartersSymantec Corporation20330 Stevens Creek Blvd.Cupertino , CA 95014Dear Mr. Thompson , I had a perfectly functional computer before I installed Norton Internet Security 2004 for XP . Immediately after the installation of your product Internet Explorer stopped functioning . Removal of your product did not restore functionality . I reinstalled your product , brought another computer home in order to access the Technical Services at Symantec.com and followed the directions regarding fixing the problem your product caused . My computer still does not work.This computer has been nonfunctional for a week . It is strikingly inconvenient to have to bring another machine home in order to access Technical Support . The only apparent option is now to access your fee-based support . Your fee-based support has only limited hours . One wonders why I should have to pay your company to fix a problem caused by your product.I want you to know how frustrated I am with your product , its performance , the inconvenience it has caused me , and the disruption of my productivity . There is absolutely nothing you can do that would convince me to buy your products again . I will spend some time posting similar notes on the internet sharing my frustration .
 I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great ... one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage . I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources -LRB- Cnet , Amazon , message boards -RRB- and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update . In January of 2004 , I renewed my subscription service for NIS 2003 but on Jan 7 , everything changed . There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers . The Symantec site said it did n't affect NIS but I believe it did . I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch . All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer . Booting up my computer took forever !!! Then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone . My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites . After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec . Again , every review written about the Tech Line is true ... after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep. I had to pay $ 29.95 just to go any further . After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program -LRB- which I had already done -RRB- ... They sent me a link to their website to follow instructions on ridding my registry of all Symantec products so I could get a clean re-install . They did n't know what the problem could be . They said to call back if it still did n't work after the complete uninstall . I did it and it was worse the second time around ... unbelievable . I gave up . Basically , I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.After reading reviews of PC-cillin Internet Security by Trend Micro , I decided to give it a try . After downloading the program , I turned around and bought it . This is a great product . My computer immediately boots up , the program does n't go through ridiculous scans and gives me the opportunity to download new updates . The program cost $ 49.95 but if you area previous owner of a Norton Anti Virus or Internet Security product and show proof then they will give you a $ 25 rebate . Needless to say , I mailed my NIS 2003 disk along w/the rebate form to them.In conclusion , Symantec has turned a long time user into a lost customer forever . They got my last dollar . I 've gone to work and told colleagues about PC-cillin Internet Security and to spend their money on this program . Needless to say , Norton not only lost me but three of my co-workers to Trend-Micro . Please , save your money ... do n't go through what I did . Also , read the reviews from other sites also ... I recommend Cnet , Amazon , and others ... Please avoid NIS 2004 !!! You 'll be glad you did !!!!
 I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt . Start up , log off , log on ... everything became very slow . Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible . Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect.It came bundled with Norton Anti-Virus which I found pretty good . However , I ultimately decided to remove the firewall because it was just so crappy . Unfortunately there was no way to leave Norton AntiVirus installed , so in the end I had to throw the whole thing away . I tried to use their techincal support to get things worked out , but that was a whole other nightmare . They really , really do n't want to support people , and they make you jump through all kinds of crazy hoops.I 've owned about 10 home computers , and been using computers since 1989 , and I 've never been more disappointed in any software investment .
 This came PRELOADED on our new , 2.8 Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer . From day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , LONG shutdowns due to `` ccApp.exe '' program running which is a Norton program . Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER to boot . We constantly got `` Windows Virtual Memory Low '' error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes . I do n't have one good thing to say . I agree with the other reviewer that it does n't even deserve 1 star.Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer . It 's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer . The tests were right . It was n't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit !! Norton support is completely pathetic.We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee , but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first . We were leary to say the least , but decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt . We 'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles . The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT !! We 've only had it 2 days , but so far so good . -LRB- WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW -RRB- I hope it 's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package . If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up , I 'm done with Norton products forever . But I do n't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.UPDATE
 I work as a tech support rep for an online Independent Study website . We have found that problems with Norton Internet Security software are so common that one of the first questions we ask users experiencing any problems is if they have Norton Internet Security . Their script blocking can actually comment out an entire page to block harmless scripts . The popup blocking does not allow any easy override command , and even popups that are a direct result of clicking are blocked.Unfortunately , it seems that the only way to stop any `` features '' that you do not like is to disable the entire program . Symantec 's support system is extremely lacking , as I 've spent a total of three hours searching for an acceptable solution and waiting on hold.Please save us tech support people -LRB- and , of course , yourselves -RRB- time . Do not purchase this product .
 I 've been a loyal Norton/Symantec customer since the DOS version of Norton Utilities . I 've purchased every version of Utilities and virus software since . When the definitions for NIS 2003 expired , I bought NIS 2004 from Amazon . Read the installation instructions and followed them . Installation has been a nightmare . I 've spent over 8 hours trying to get it to work properly . -LRB- That 's less time that it took to build the computer and install all the other software that has been running perfectly for 2 years . -RRB- I refuse to pay Symantec $ 29 for telephone tech support for a defective product . When a company produces a flawed product , you would think they would offer free support to get it running . Not Symantec . Their web based tech support is worthless.I 'm considering using XP 's system restore feature to restore the system to a point before I installed this mess.Those who have gotten this product to work were just lucky.There are plenty of other options out there . Save yourself the grief and avoid Symantec.Given the unusually large number of dissatisfied customers , it is clear that something is wrong with this product , and Symantec prefers to keep taking people 's money rather than offering a solution .
 To keep this review short
 This Company needs major improvements in the software development for users . I have now spent 5 hours trying to upgrade from NIS 2003 to NIS 2004 and it is full of errors . I ca n't use my computer until this is fixed.Their support is worthless . This is the 2nd time I tried to get help from their support team and it has been a waste of time.Think twice about upgrading with them unless you are a computer expert or have one to help you when you have problems .
 Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer . Had to uninstall it . Maybe it 's me , but this is n't my program .
 This software wo n't allow my computer to access the internet . No email gets through . All web pages are inaccessible . When the problem first occurred , I disabled the software to go to Symantec 's website and followed Symantec 's automated online instructions to configure it . This fixed the problem for the rest of that day , but then the problem recurred the next time I rebooted . Symantec 's human tech support is $ 30 per incident ! Why should I throw bad money after good ? I 'm writing this off as a $ 40 mistake . You 're better off with a $ 40 router and/or some freeware security software . Norton Anti-Virus may be pretty good , but the rest of this Internet Security package sucks .
 I had been a McAfee fan up until 2000 when their suite became buggy . So I switched to Norton . Everything was great ... until NIS 2004 . I have tried to install the software multiple times - unsuccessful . The Symantec website is not the most user-friendly guide for help , plus they want $ 30 for technical support.I would avoid this program . It is near impossible to install and even worse to get all the embedded registry entries out .
 I installed the software , tinkered with the settings , and lo and behold , several configurations have been changed . I called Norton , and after waiting 15 minutes to speak to someone , they ask me for a credit card number . I told them that I just opened the package ; they tell me to look at the manual and `` sorry '' . This is the third PC of which I have installed various Norton products over several years , and had nothing but problems . I have McAfee Pro on one machine with no probs . I am finished with Norton .
 This is the worst software on the market ! I could n't even get through the installation without problems . My computer exceeded all of the system requirements . I made sure of that before I bought the product . I ended up having to reformat my computer ! I 'm not about to try and install this software again ! Since I opened the box , the store I bought it from -LRB- not Amazon -RRB- will not take it back . $ 60 down the drain ! Live and learn ...
 If I could have rated this program minus something , I would have . The only reason I put one star , is that I was unable to rate it less . I have spent the last 2 days hasseling with this program . It put my computer in safe mode , which took 1-1/2 days to figure out how to fix . I tried everything . I am not an expert , but certainly no novice and this is a royal pain . Error message upon error message ... you fix one thing , think you have it knocked , and boom , another error message . I finally got it installed , but can not enable the virus potection , among other problems . So , what good is it ... duh ! It is the absolute worse program that I have ever had to misfortune to try to install . This is a nightmare . I only hope that I can get it off my computer . Please , for your sake , pay attention to the reviews . You wo n't know the pain you avoided , but take my word , you will be less stressed and not have the huge headache that I am now experiencing .
 I have been using Norton/Symantec System Works , Firewall , Anti-Virus for years . I 'm now totally finished with them . I 've tried to renew my subscription to Norton Firewall and the software for renewal does n't work at all . Links lead to blank screens and there is no real way to talk to the company . Oh , there are phone numbers alright . They will link you to a bunch of Indians in New Delhi who do n't know English , and worse , who do n't know Symantec products . They say that have done something like update an address or renewed a subscription and it is n't done . Talking to them is such a chore , and in the end they do n't understand . You 'll get far better comprehension from your 2-year-old . I told the New Delhi based Symantec reps that I live on Leesburg Pike . I spelled it out slowly and did the whole Lima , Echo , Echo , thing for each letter and confirmed it all when I was done . What they wrote was that I live on `` lecsdurg tike . '' No wonder my credit card did n't work when they tried to use `` lecsdurg tike '' as my billing address . It is just impossible to deal with these jalaybi wallas -LRB- sweet sellers -RRB- . You see , I lived in India for two years and loved it . Great country with some wonderful people . However , the people Symantec/Norton has hired as customer service reps are far below the intelligence level of all hotel bell-hops in the better hotels in India . So , after years of using Norton/Symantec products , I 'll never use them again . I wrote the company and said that it would be better to tell customers there is no user support , than to frustrate their customers with software that does n't work and customer service reps who ca n't understand and ca n't talk and who do n't do what they say they will do and when they do , they get it all wrong , anyway . I 'd rather wait on the phone for an hour or only be able to call during regular business hours and be able to talk to an American who knows the software and can understand English , than to talk to those goofs who failed the New Delhi Sheraton Hotel bell-hop exam , so were left with no choice but to sell jalaybis -LRB- sweets -RRB- on the streets or work for Norton . -LRB- The bright ones chose to sell the jalaybis . -RRB- I have never written a product review in my life . I 've been using Amazon.com for years -LRB- great company with great service -RRB- , but I am so angry with Symantec/Norton that I felt I had to tell my fellow-Americans what a crock Norton/Symantec has become . Do n't buy it . If you own it , throw it out . It 's no good any more .
 My computer is VERY slow after installing . It crashes Outlook Express . Ca n't install products individually .
 After trying to install this new version , I gave up after numerous retries -LRB- uninstalled , rebooted , reinstalled , rebooted , etc. etc. -RRB- . This is the WORSE software I 've come across in years and I have been using Norton 's products for awhile now . I 've trashed the software -LRB- lost over $ 60 -RRB- and kept Norton Internet Security 2003 . As far as features the 2004 version has , I ca n't even comment on them since the software repeatedly failed to startup on each reboot . You got ta wonder if the software developers in Symantec rushed this one out without any thorough testing!Computer I tried to install on : Dell Pentium III with 640 MB Ram and 500 MHz CPU with Windows XP
 I already knew something was wrong , because much of the Spam I 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products . For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.But I have been using Norton Antivirus for several years , and McAfee 's online ratings are n't much better , so -- I purchased this product online . There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted -LRB- Norton Internet Security Professional -RRB- and also the standard -LRB- non-Pro -RRB- version I did n't want . The website also had added automatically , without asking me , the `` download warranty '' that lets you download again for up to one year -LRB- $ 6.99 -RRB- for both products . I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I did n't want and went to the next page , where I expected to see only what I wanted , and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final . But no , I was charged for all four products , including the two that are n't products at all.The run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL , and apparently the download warranties CA N'T be refunded . I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds , but all this run-around is another bad sign . Is Norton in some kind of melt-down , that they have to treat customers this way ? If so , what about all that support they 're promising , if they go down?Next issue
 i hate this . i wanted to play an internet game that was not even funny and it blocked it for comody . i hope the place that made this burns down . I HATE THIS IT MAKES THE INTERNET BORING . if i could give it -10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 STARS . its also embarissing . TAKE THAT NORTON -LRB- ... -RRB-
 I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004 . Now in October ,2004 , the firewall said I could n't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full . Im at full capacity !!!! I called Symantic and they said they do n't know why but I should get Tech 's Support at $ 35/hr to help !! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up ! I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP . So , DO N'T buy this or upgrade .
 I actually give this product 0 stars . I 'm a computter guy , and from the moment that I installed Norton Internet Security Pro 2004 on my computer , it started having problems left and right . I took it off my computer , and was left with a mess on my computer to clean up . Now I am off investigating a new software for internet security.My thinking is that Norton has made the mistake of using it 's name to sell their products now , and not a decent product . SO DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!
 Norton Internet Security 2004 crashed my computer then would not allow me to access it again due to a Windows Protection Error . I was stuck without a computer until I could use someone else 's because you can only access help via the Symantec website unless you want to pay $ 30 per phone call for assistance . Several days later I received a response and it was rude and did not help in the least .
 I installed this software two days ago . Since then , I can not get into my computer . When I called Norton for help , they want me to pay them an additional $ 30 . They are an unethical company with a terrible product . They wasted hours of my time and my money . Do n't buy unless you 're a masochist !
 Save your money . I purchased the Internet Security 2004 professional version and had nothing but problems right from the start . The first two times I tried to install it , the installation wouldnt complete . I had just purchased a brand new computer and I knew that since this was the first program I was attempting to install , it shouldnt be a problem.I tried calling Symantec but they wouldnt help unless I paid $ 30 . They offer an automated problem detection system on their site which wouldnt work at all to diagnose my installation problems . I had to reformat my drive and reinstall everything before I could try it again . After reformatting my hard drive and reinstalling everything from scratch , I finally got the product to fully install . Even then the product would not work properly . Antivirus would not load on startup and I was unable to change the AutoProtect to enabled . Programs would randomly startup when I booted and my system would never shut down properly.As an experiment I went and purchased ZoneLabs ZoneAlarm Pro4 . I reformatted my hard drive AGAIN , reinstalled windows and drivers , and then installed Zone Alarm along with ONLY Norton Antivirus . Since then I have had no problems . I would recommend ZoneAlarm over norton anyday !
 I am a faithful Norton user , and am happy with Internet Security 2003 , but on upgrading to 2004 -LRB- extended download version -RRB- my entire Norton program ceased functioning , promting me to uninstall and re install the program . Still trying to figure out what is the best thing to do next .
 My Norton Internet Security 2003 with a one year subscription for program live up dates has recently expired . I was considering the purchase of their latest version . Then , about one month before the live update subscription expired , I was and still am , harrassed with nag screens to renew my subscription.After several attempts to contact their technical support I was able to leave a message . I asked them to please tell me how to remove the NAG SCREENS , and their reply was YOU CA N'T !! This answer plus the negative reviews that I 've read , have prompted me to not purchase their products and write this review.This review is written to warn you to be aware of their NAG SCREEN PRACTICE to either renew your subcription or remove the program completely from your computer . I ca n't believe that Symantec could be so inconsiderate , but thats the case !
 Having happily used Norton Internet Security 2003 for 1 year I needed to subscribe for 1 more year to get the virus definitions or upgrade to 2004 . I decided to upgrade to 2004 Pro but now regret this decision . On my 500MHz machine running XP I continously get a Virtual Memory error and the machine is almost unuseable . On my 1.6 GHz Centrino Laptop it 's worked fine for 1 week but today XP returned a ` Serious Fatal Error ' for the firt time in 5 months since buying it . I 've wasted 3 days trying to get this product working with my older machine and have now admitted defeat . I 've also lost confidence in the installation on my newer machine . My recommendation is to stay with the 2003 version until Symantec stabilise this product and the reviews start to get better . Symantec appear to have let themselves down badly with this product !!!!
 I actually give it zero stars.I thankfully took heed and read the other reviews of this program , and I opted for the `` try it before you buy it '' download . I would have been irate if I had spent the money on this software , it is the biggest piece of crap I have ever used.I am computer savy and yet I could n't even figure out the installation problems that kept cropping up . And as others have mentioned Symantec 's `` golden wrench '' for everything is to `` uninstall the software then reinstall '' . I did this twice and still have same issues . So I contacted customer service and ... this was just rich ... they said they `` ca n't help me because I have a try it before you buy it version !! Way to sell your product guys ... not to mention you showed me what unacceptable customer service you have.Want to know MY final solution ?? I purchased McAfee software instead !!! Do n't waste your time and money on this worthless software .
 I downloaded this product from their website . Despite doing everything their website said , several times , it would not load . When I called for tech support , they would not provide it unless I paid them . I returned it for a refund , which I hope shows up on my Credit Card soon . I am going to try Mcafee Internet Security , which did not get great ratings either.My big mistake , I should have renewed NIS 2003 instead of trying the upgrade . NIS 2003 was a great product .
 I installed and then reinstalled this trash and have decided to use my previous version of Internet Security . Here are a few reasons why : > There were instances where the Antivirus portion of the software displayed an error indicating that it could not scan the email for viruses . > The Volume Control icon that was in my tray no longer appears . > The Internet Secuity icon will not display in the tray even though the option to make it display is enabled . > My computer takes forever to boot up . > The online help is a joke , just ask a question and you often get an answer that has nothing to do with what you asked . > I refuse to pay for support for a first time installation , Symantec should at least give us some free help for installation.I am sure that this is just the tip of the iceberg , so heaven help you if you buy this trash .
 There are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows . The program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks.The anti virus scanner is good , and never really lets me down until it finds a virus , then it becomes frustrating , I read that other people 's internet went down after using the virus scan , well , so did mine , so be careful . The anti spam is ok , although it does block pretty much everything . The privacy control is adequate , but the firewall is useless . Its not useless that it does n't work , it over works.After I installed it , the internet became very slow and originally stopped . The security is immense , which is good in some respects but it blocks every f *** ing website I went on.I tried McAfee but found that the security was also over the top . It slowed the internet , it stopped any loading from websites , no matter what . So , I 'm stuck , I do n't know what to get , but one thing I am sure about is that this is good but massively frustrating , everything becomes a struggle , amazon.com suddenly becomes a bad cookie .
 I implemented it 3 months ago , and last month it started slowing down until it started blocking access to MS Internet Explorer , so I followed the Troubleshooting instructions in their User 's Guide , and it still does n't work.I want my money back , especially since their tech support is totally unresponsive .
 We have been using Internet Security 2003 . Up until the 2003 upgrade we have never had any problems with Norton AV . I ca n't say that anymore . I upgraded to 2004 a few weeks ago and upon booting Windows is complaining about missing Symantec DLLs . Tried sending a note to Support . It has been 3 weeks and no response . There is no support for the product unless you are willing to spend for support more than what the product costs . I am not.I went back to Internet Security 2003 and plan to stay at that level.My suggestion is that you stay with the older versions of Norton and just subscribe to the virus updates.Henry
 After reading the review of the Norton support agent , I felt that I needed to expand my review . I work in an operations lab for a Fortune 500 Co. . We spend millions of $ for NAV . In addition , I have installed Symantec products on every server in my lab over the last 3 years . Hence , I felt comfortable purchasing a Symantec product . NIS 2004 is a flawed software . Some isp 's help consumers by blocking communication on various unused or unusual ports . NIS uses an unusual port for activation . My personal computer runs an ad/spyware scanner & a registry cleaner on a weekly basis . Until recently , I 've used older versions of NAV to keep my machine free of viruses . I run Ethereal network protocol analyzer every month , because checking the activity of various network protocols floats my boat . With all my experience , I was unable to activate my product . What chance does a normal user have of using this product ? Cost is immaterial . Buy something from Amazon that works .
 I purchased this product a couple of days ago and lucky me I did not open the box yet . Browsing Symantec website I realized that they added product activation to their 2004 software like Norton Antivirus , System Works , and Internet Security . I 'm a legitimate System Works and Internet Security user . Every year in September I upgrade to the new version . This would have been the fourth upgrade since I already own Norton Internet Security and System Works for 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 . This new activation scheme is outrageous !!! I did not use any pirated software and I do n't intend to start now but I change my hardware a lot and reinstall applications and I find that by requiring product activation Symantec hits me as a legitimate user since the product allows only 5 activations . In 4 months I will be unable to use it if I reinstall the OS 5 times , and here I am , a legitimate user and a loyal customer who paid Symantec for 4 years unable to use software I paid for . I find it outrageous and unacceptable . This is not what I deserve as a loyal customer ! There must be better ways to stop piracy.That said , this Norton Internet Security 2004 goes back to the store and this is the last time I buy Symantec Products . I will use my older software for a time and then find some other application suite from some other software vendor , that does not reduce me a legitimate customer to the level of a software thief . Stay away from these activation schemes if you want to be able to control what you own ! They do not protect us , they protect ONLY their revenue . I 'm very disappointed in Symantec and they can bet I 'm no longer a Symantec user and customer . Like the guy before me said
 Both my wife and I purchased this software near the end of 2004 . At first , many of the `` features '' were just an annoyance , and I assumed that I would gain experience with them and move on . That never happened.While online one day , Internet Security mysteriously disabled itself . I immediately got off the internet , but was unable to reactivate the program . After trying everything I could think of , including unistalling and reinstalling the program , I contacted Symantec . They advised , via email , me to do all the things I had already done -LRB- by the way , their online automated help is abysmal -RRB- . This had the predicted result of not solving the problem . A clean boot and registry edit later , the program was still not functioning . At this time , my Outlook had ceased functioning until I removed the program , and several other programs on my machine returned errors stating that they had encountered problems and `` needed to close '' . Prior to Internet Security crashing on me , I had never seen this error before . I found it distressing that the program designed to prevent any kind of Internet attack was also giving me this error.I did some searching online and found a couple articles that said that Internet Security had been found to have a bug that allowed hackers to disable it over the web . Symantec assured me that this was not true . In the end , I completely removed the program and that solved most of my woes , however I am still recieving the same strange `` this program has encountered a problem and needs to close '' error with Adobe Distiller , and occasionally with other programs , however , only the Adobe Distiller seems to be completely fatally affected.My wife has had problems with her Internet Security , and has also found that disabling it is the way to go . Fortunately , her 's did not die completely as mine did.Bottom line is , from my viewpoint , beware of this program . I never had any problems with earlier NAV versions , and I will be returning to them , although I was rather soured on Symantec as a whole for having produced such a faulty program .
 I was unable to activate the 2004 version of NIS at home . If your broadband ISP -LRB- in my case , comcast -RRB- uses any type of firewall -LRB- ie . for packet filtering and/or port monitoring -RRB- , please save yourself at least a weeks worth of troubleshooting . Currently , the only way I can activate this product is by phone . My last three computers have not had modems and my cell phone acts as my only phone connection . In addition , Symantec only provides `` award-winning support '' if you pay $ 30 a pop for live support . This is a documented problem . http://service.symantec.com/pcfix
 I was very pleased with this product for more than a year . Shortly after renewing my subscription , it began constantly prompting me to update my virus definitions . Every time I did so , it would tell me everythings up to date . This went on for two months until I finally used Symantec 's automated online diagnostic which told me there 's a problem and I must reinstall . Technical support for Symantec starts at about $ 40 without any guarantees . Without my original disc I opted to buy a whole new copy for $ 70 and hopefully save the time and frustration . After uninstalling and reinstalling , I noticed that my subscription still read the same old date ! Instead of getting one year from the fresh install , it was showing just ten months left . I then tried the LiveUpdate anyways since there 's sure to be updates right away , but again it said everything 's OK . Everything NOT OK . I was up till 4 in the morning and I 'm still at square one . I 'm calling my credit card company to charge back both subscriptions as soon as I hit submit for this post .
 If you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , do n't . There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive . If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version . It included popup and ad blockers , referrer blockers , firewall , intrusion detection , and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.If you do n't need popup/referrer/ad blockers or use other software to take care of these needs , consider taking a look at pc-cillin and trying out their 30 trial version first to see if that might be a better solution for your needs . It includes antivirus and firewall software and you can try it for 30 days.I personally have been using the 2003 version without any major problems for months now . I do n't plan to upgrade .
 This review is based on my personal experience and represents my opinion . Others may have different opinions.This software is horrible - it has become the biggest virus on my PC . I have used Norton anti-virus , norton firewall , norton internet security 2003 all with great success.I truly regret the day that I upgraded to Norton Internet Security 2004 . The online technical support staff -LRB- India -RRB- writes very poor english and in my experience , when they are unable to figure out how to solve a problem , they just stop communicating . I have written to customer support -LRB- not tech support -RRB- and have not received a response from them.I am flooded with alerts from this software caused by modules provided by Symantec , I can no longer upload pictures to ebay , my Outlook express is now very quirky and often fails to find the server . NIS sometimes crashes when it is trying to download it 's own updates.I was trying to think of something good to say , but all I can come up with is the fact that I hope to be able to get a refund.I only hope that I can purge this pestilence from my PC .
 I never take the trouble to write online reviews , but after trying this software I feel compelled to . I 've been a long time user of symantec software ; last year I bought NIS 2003 which gave a -LRB- probably false -RRB- sense of security after several attacks to my server . And now I made the mistake of paying money for the upgrade . Ang guess what
 After months of frustration with NIS 2004 and Symantec 's pitiful tech . support , I finally threw in the towel . Went with PC-cillin Internet Security 2005 and am happy that I did so . The PC-cillin UI is n't as refined as NIS 's but - you know ! - the product works , the Anti-spam component integrates nicely with Outlook , and etc. . . No compatibility issues and my machine is running noticably quicker.With any luck , I 'll never have to be concerned with the quality of TrendMicro 's tech . support . In any event , it could n't possibly be worse than Symantec 's . Here 's Symantec 's version of how to fix the Visual C++ Runtime Error for the AntiSpam plugin , so well documented in other customer reviews and on the Web :1 -RRB- Rename MSOUPLUG.DLL to MSOUPLUG.OLD . Trouble is , that 's not a fix ; it simply prevents the error message by disabling the very plug-in you were trying to fix .2 -RRB- Do a LiveUpdate for NIS 2005 . Trouble is , I was running NIS 2004.3 -RRB- Remove and reinstall NIS 2004 . A painful procedure that , in the end , does n't work -LRB- and they know it -RRB- .4 -RRB- Upgrade to NIS 2005 . -LRB- Yeah ! Right ! -RRB- Um ... NIS 2004 a bad product . Very bad . Read the reviews here before you buy ; we ca n't ALL be lying ...
 I bought Norton Internet Security 2004 , Professional Edition , a few months ago and installed on my new HP Pavilion -LRB- Win XP -RRB- . I used it for a few months till my computer crashed -LRB- I believe it was related to using NIS Productivity function , although I am not very sure . -RRB- Since then , it has been a total nightmare ! I followed every recommendations on their support site to uninstall and reinstall . None of them worked . It has been more than one month and 20 + wasted hours , it is still not working . I read a piece of review on Consumer Report the other day . It turned out that Norton knew this kind of problem at least 2 years ago . But they never fixed it.I regret I bought this junk before I read any reviews on Amazon.My advise to any one thinking of buying this product is
 Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.How did I write this ? I 'm on my Linux partition.I would classify myself as a very experienced computer user and this program has managed to lock my Windows partition off the net . It wo n't let me uninstall it and it wo n't let me unlock network access . In short , this wonderful piece of software has totally wrecked any network use for me on the Windows side of things.How ? During install it asked if I wanted to set up parental controls or accounts . I said no because I 'm a responsible adult and there are n't kids in the house . You would think that would be a logical thing to do and they even give you this option . DO N'T DO IT.What it did was decide to use the `` default '' account that BLOCKS ALL internet access . Since there are no other accounts , I ca n't `` log in '' and unblock net access . All their help says to do is `` log in '' - but that menu is not available as there is only the default account.This is the worst piece of junk software I have ever seen . Software that makes it easy - and actually encourages - a user to trash their system from Norton used to be unbelievable.Believe it . This piece of junk sucks and is probably a viable vehicle for a class-action lawsuit against Symantic.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .
 While it has a rather effective firewall , and comes with Norton Antivirus -LRB- which I 'm actually rather fond of -RRB- , the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system . I 'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 -LRB- which I bought at the end of this past August -RRB- , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact , I 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely.The Antivirus is good , but `` Internet Security '' just is n't worth it .
 Norton Internet Security 2001 worked great for us , so we had high hopes for NIS 2004 . Were we ever wrong.The software would appear to install fine , but then NIS would not run , and simply trying to run it caused system resources to plummet so fast that sometimes we could n't even shut down the computer from the start menu because the shutdown process did n't have enough memory to run -LRB- we had to turn off the power to shut it down -RRB- . Norton 's tech support had no internal communications -- successive techs would instruct us to do the same things , apparently not even reading our case records . Two even told us to try things we 'd just said did n't work.The only plus to the experience was that we had no trouble getting our money back -LRB- we ordered direct from Symantec , though , not through Amazon -RRB- . We installed McAfee Internet Security Suite instead -LRB- which has many problems of its own , but at least it runs and does n't crash the computer -RRB- .
 I really wish there was an option for zero stars , because this program does n't deserve a star at all . I had so many problems with it , it 's not even funny . First off , when I bought the program , I was living on campus -LRB- conflicting firewalls allowed me to do NOTHING -RRB- . Second off , when I went to uninstall the program -LRB- very disatisfied with the fact that I was no longer able to use my computer for online buying and bank access -RRB- , it did n't fully uninstall -LRB- I used the wizard -RRB- . Come to find out ... You 're supposed to disable the product COMPLETELY before uninstalling . Even though I did n't have ANY of the firewall settings active at the time , I STILL wound up with a permanant firewall . I could n't re-install the software to fix my mistake , because I would get the error message of `` this program was not properly uninstalled . `` Needless to say , I had to MANUALLY delete everything NORTON and SYMANTEC out of my computer , and I am finally able to go about my business on my own computer , no longer a prisoner banned from somewhat secure websites . Do n't buy this program .
 As a major producer of utility software , Norton and now Symantec , has produced a pretty good product . Norton Internet Security -LRB- NIS -RRB- 2004 delivers the basics in a clean , neat package . The user interface is useful for the essential tasks of virus protection , spam blocking , intrusion detection , etc.Beyond that , problems arise . The help topics are cryptic and disorganized . The links are confusing . No overall organization is obvious . It is very difficult for a user to teach themselves how to use advanced features of NIS ' 04 . Finding help on the website is even worse . The problems , noted above , are all there too , and more . If you do not manage to stumble onto a narrowly-focused topic that suits your needs - forget about it . The index is terrible . I have put keywords in to the internal search engine , gotten no hits , and much later , after great aggravation , found an appropriate topic , with the keywords featured prominently throughout the -LRB- slightly helpful -RRB- article.But wait , it gets worse . Simply put , support is horrible . `` Free '' help for this fairly expensive software is almost impossible to get . If you manage to get through the maze on the Symantec site , and send an e-mail to Symantec , you will wait much longer than the 5 business days promised . You will probably get a response telling you to start over with some other department . It generally takes 2 or 3 cycles to get them to actually read a specific question . They usually send some barely-related generic response , eventually . It appears that Symantec will punish any user who tries to avoid the $ 30/call support service.If you want to pay this kind of money for the basics , fine . If you try to get the features you have paid for , welcome to Hell . I admit , I think good service should be free with software . This can be argued , but Symantec clearly does not agree .
 I have always loved Symantecs products , until now . I do n`t understand how anyone could have jacked up software as bad as they have done NIS 2004 ! It installed great on my computer , ran great at 1st . The 1st problem was the horrible slowdown . I noticed when I checked in my running programs through control alt delete , that `` winmgmt '' was running . Most people know that when that is running your computer lags bad . I would end task it , it would come back . I would end task it again ... . IT WOULD COME BACK ! I think that was one of the biggest reasons for my computer to lag so bad with NIS 2004 . After having the software on my computer for about a day it really started messing with my computer . My computer would not shutdown without me manually doing it myself through the power button , or if I was mad enough , by unplugging my computer ! Ofcourse I uninstalled NIS 2004 and it actually uninstalled great . I reinstalled NIS 2002 . Everything is great except now for the 1st time since using the 2002 my anti virus quit working . I ` ll just blame NIS 2004 for it . Thanks for a load of crap Symantec .
 I will keep this brief for the impulse shoppers . I installed it , and its liveupdate continued to get errors . It was a hassle to uninstall . It drastically affected my programs and games -LRB- so much lag and choppiness -RRB- . It 's a system hog . If it was free , I would not use it . Imagine that . NOrton , I emphasize the NO in NOrton . Also , I have two friends that had to format their hard drives after installing this garbage . I had one friend who physically corrupted his hard drive because he would have to hit the power switch when Norton locked his system up .
 I 've been using Norton Utilities since the 80 's when it was the only provider of decent disk utilities on the Mac . Since then I 've been using Norton products on my PC 's for years.But this NIS2004 is a big WASTE OF TIME , DO N't BUY OR YOUR LIFE WILL BE HELL.I just spent many DAYS trying to get this thing to work on a modern Sony Viao Pentium 4 laptop , and there is just no way to coax working behavior from it . After days of reading the online support , that 's a waste of time as well
 After wasting a whole Saturday trying to undo what this crap did to a computer and getting nowhere decent and finally just giving up , I was horrified to learn a cousin of mine had purchased said product as well and was having all kinds of troubles too and this was after he paid 200 to BEST BUY to fix it . What the heck kind of product is put out to make computers not even function ? This kind of sleaze needs to be taken to court . And they charge 20 bucks for a customer service call after they wreck your computer . Give me a break ! Do n't buy this GARBAGE ! BOYCOTT THESE FOOLS !
 Boy , I wish I had read these reviews before I downloaded this piece of -- from Symantech . If it was a nightmare for many of these very tech-savvy users , just imagine what it was for just an average PC user like me ... YIKES !!!!! I had a 5-yr old laptop -LRB- Win 98 SE , 1-gig , 50 % available -RRB- with zero problems . My bundled 1998 Norton AV long expired , but I never , ever download anything or open non-JPG or Word attachments , and I run ZoneAlarm and Mailwasher to isolate email , and I have a network router firewall as well . It was n't broke , but I `` fixed '' things y by upgrading to NIS 2004 & it 's taken the last 24 hrs and a lot of luck to dump most of it so I can use Outlook and access the Internet . I reinstalled multiple times -LRB- mostly it just locked up in the middle -RRB- , Windows got stuck , it blue-screened constantly , Outlook would n't run , could n't find the Internet ... I thought I was going to need pro help , but just by luck I got in long enough to disable much of the NIS and the problems disappeared.Several reviewers claim that this software is fine and problems are due to hidden trash in machines over a year old . Maybe , but if NIS is fit only for new machines or post-98 Windows , then this trashy software should n't be sold to unsuspecting suckers as a panacea for all platforms , especially with no tech support.Mine 's going straight back and I 'm going to check out the McAfee reviews next . Norton 's on my shlist from now on .
 It is hard to believe that anybody could outdo Microsoft 's Windows Millenium operating system for buggy software but Symantec has risen to the challenge and done just that . After two months of frustation with this product , I am just about ready to incinerate this product . My family will no doubt support me on that decision.Some of my problems include :1 . MSN Messenger under our childrens ' accounts wo n't work unless I give them adult status under parental control despite the fact that they are checked off for the proper priveleges under program categories .2 . Parental control does not work properly . Settings disappear in what seems to be a random fashion .3 . Microsoft Outlook does not load properly all the time when the application is starting .4 . Auto Protect turns in self off from time to time on the five accounts we have on our computer . Get an Email error prompt at the same time . Just what you need , your firewall and antivirus software turning itself off in an unpredicatable fashion .5 . Ad popup/blocking turns itself off occasionally .6 . Live Update fails to update at times . When this happens , I get a prompt about my subscription expiring which is incorrect .7 . Intermittent messages about system errors being encountered or NAV has been tampered with -LRB- which coincides with all my protection being turned off -RRB- . Message instructs you to uninstall and reinstall the program . Have done so 6 times so far .8 . Computer has slowed down noticeably .9 . Symantec website support system is virtually useless . I wo n't be paying the $ 30 per call for technical support as it seems clear that they do not have a good handle on the disaster that this product represents.The fact that a product like this has been brought to market with so many problems does not leave a very good taste in my mouth and I would say that my problems look minor in comparison to what some of the other reviewers have had to say.Very , very disappointed .
 I have been a user of Norton Internet Security for several years now and the product seems to be getting worse with each year passing . I , like everyone else , could n't resist the $ 30 discount for previous Norton product users so I kept upgrading and this year , I paid the price.Let me start off by warning all of you who have a Dell Dimension 4100 or 8100 system with a Win 2000 Pro OS . It is very very likely that you will encounter a message -LRB- the deadly blue screen -RRB- `` stop :0 x00000008e ... < register dumps > '' and your computer will reboot which will be followed by the message and then reboot , etc. etc. . . you will not be able to boot your computer . This happened to me and only after hours of scouring through Symantec 's online support site was I able to find a solution . And guess what their solution was ?? Nothing . It states that Symantec is aware of this problem and they will let us know when the problem is solved -LRB- http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nip.nsf/429934053165308488256d8e0076a -RRB- . How about that ? Why is Symantec still selling this defective product knowing that the product does not function for everyone ? And of course there is the world famous Symantec customer support . I should have known to stay away from a company where they actually charge you to talk to support people.For those of you who did run into this problem , there is hope . The thing to do is to boot up in `` safe mode '' by hitting F8 button during the very beginning of the boot up -LRB- during the black screen before it turns blue and you see the Windows icon -RRB- . Choose the first option , which is safe mode which will get you into the desktop . You will not be able to remove the program by going into Control Panel and Add/Remove Program . However , via Windows Explorer , go to your C : / Program File/Norton Internet Security folder and delete everything you can -LRB- some items you can not delete because of `` codeshare violation '' -RRB- . then log out and reboot normally . At least this way , you will be able to get back onto your computer and will avoid having to format your hard drive.Good customer support is an elementary marketing principle that a college freshman knows . For chrissakes , I have been waiting for 3 days for an e-mail response to my inquiry . Please avoid this product , both on merit and principle . I ca n't advise you of a better product . That will be the first thing I research after I finish this message . Actually , I take that back ... the first thing I will do is place this product where it belongs . . in the trash .
 I should have given up on symantec two years ago , when I tried to buy another year of update subscription to my old NAV , and their site just could n't handle the complexity of it . Finally got someone at phone help , and she suggested I should send in a check by snailmail . Anyway , I was stupid enough to buy this package six months ago from their online store , as a download for Windows 98 SE . After the fact , found I had to pay extra if the first download did n't work , plus I never got the promised $ 20 rebate . Typical . As others have said , it drags booting to a crawl . Even worse , half the time it wo n't completely load , so you ca n't even access it to turn it off , and you ca n't reboot because it 's running somewhere in the background , useless and locking up the screen . So you have to cut main power , then turn computer back on to contemplate Microsoft 's thoughts on improperly turning off the computer while it slowly scans for disc errors . Then repeat . Plus , if it does load , and the icons show ok status , sometimes the email scanning is not on . Oh , and the Help pages ? Derisory , and fulfillment of Norton 's apparently total allegiance to Dilbertian values
 THIS IS THE ALL TIME WORST PROGRAM I HAVE EVER PUT ONTO MY COMPUTER !! NOTHING WORKS RIGHT ANYMORE IF IT WORKS AT ALL ! I WISH I SAW THESE REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE PROGRAM . THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 1 STAR IS BECAUSE THEY DO N'T OFFER 0 STARS ! DO NOT DO IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!
 This program is a memory hog and very difficult to uninstall!I does slow the computer down and you still have to spend endless hours dowloading and installing all the patches and critical up dates from Microsoft.I dumped it and went back to grisoft 's Free AVG and have not had a worm or virus since . I catches them as they try to enter , not afterwards .
 I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products , and have used them both for years . So I expected the same level of quality and ease of use with their Internet Security program . I am an advanced computer user , so I can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work ! After installing , the system froze trying to restart -LRB- this is a new computer with Windows XP Home -RRB- . After finally restarting , the `` automatic updates '' ran . When all was said and done , I could n't even use Microsoft Outlook . Seems the `` program scan '' feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook ! It did find Outlook Express , but that 's not what I use . Before I managed to manually add the program file , I contacted Symantec support . Like most of their solutions -LRB- which first blame other applications for errors -RRB- , the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT . It was a Symantec error . After a recent update , I can no longer open more then 1 browser window . I 've searched the program and their online tech support -LRB- worthless -RRB- and have found no solutions . Again , I tried online email support . They gave me a ridiculous set of steps which included emailing them screen prints as PDF files!I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode . Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program . Maybe it 's time to explore McAfee products again ...
 I bought the 2005 version for my wife and we 've had nothing but problems . Most recently used PC Move when we got a new PC and I did n't think to get rid of this . Now I ca n't get it off the new machine and it 's causing a problem exiting Word . -LRB- Documented on Microsoft 's site -RRB- . This is absolute junk .
 I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program . I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop -LRB- which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk ! -RRB- I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed -LRB- mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor -RRB- , and then I could n't get the damn thing off my computer completely!I decided to give it one last chance ... so I formatted my hard drive , reinstalled Windows XP -LRB- which also required a day & night download/install of SP2 on dial-up -RRB- and put NIS2004 back onto the computer . It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch -LRB- GRRRRRR ! -RRB- Blessedly , my DSL was installed just about this time and I set up a wireless network with my desktop . So when I reformatted for the third time , downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try -LRB- it also listed Norton and McAffee -RRB- . I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again . I ca n't recommend their programs enough.And I ca n't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON !!
 . My PC servicing dealers have long recommended Symantec 's Norton Internet Security as `` the best '' , and as to stopping viruses and overt `` attacks '' , I think they 're right . Two years ago , frustrated with NIS -LRB- it appeared to be planting a web bug -RRB- , I switched to McAfee -- then promptly got wacked with a worm , which required returning to NIS and Symantec 's web based services in order to remove it.But NIS has two serious problems :1 -RRB- For both NIS-2003 and NIS-2004 , their anti-spam overtures to my Eudora e-mail program -LRB- version # 6 + -RRB- can NOT be shut off . NIS-2004 hounds me each time I launch Eudora . Both Eudora and Symantec admit to the problem , but they do n't fix it .2 -RRB- -- And this is deadly serious . NIS does not stop `` spyware '' ! At one point I had 19 items on my computer that NIS had let through . To judge by what my copy of `` Ad-aware '' keeps removing , that includes `` key loggers '' that watch your key strokes as you enter such things as bank acount numbers and passwords . These `` key loggers '' then report back and your information might result in theft -- or even identity theft . *** I do NOT understand why a product called `` Internet Security '' needs to be supplemented by other products to remove spyware ! *** I have no way to determine if these supplemental products I buy interfere with NIS -- or vice-versa . It should all be in one package.I agree with others that Symantec 's technical support appears to be a profit center for them -- which is absolutely loathsome .
 In using PCs for 22 years , before NIS2004 I have never not been able to install a software package . Well , congratulations Symantec , I have met my match and am humbled.Like many others who left comments , after 10 hours I gave up and went back to my NIS2003 .
 Norton have introduced a technically faulty Product Activation system into this product . According to their help files , they know this does n't work on some laptops & they do n't know why . So until they fix the mistake they introduced in a feature which is only for their financial benefit , we customers have to just use the Internet unprotected . I bought this product 3 weeks ago , and have wasted hours trying to find a solution.I plan to demand a refund.REPEAT
 Do NOT buy this product . It hosed up my brand-new , out-of-the-box , no-other-software-installed , system big time ... would n't let me install or un-install it or any other program ; trashed my internet access ; and would n't run itself properly . I tried -LRB- several times -RRB- the 8 or 9 different possible manual solutions offered on the Symantec web site to fix or remove the software -LRB- an indicator of how bad this software is -RRB- ... to no avail . After a complete re-format and re-install of XP Pro and AFTER HAVING TO PAY VIA THE 900 Symantec `` SUPPORT '' NUMBER -LRB- they wo n't help for free -RRB- I am finally rid of this piece of crap . The online tech -LRB- at the per-minute charge -RRB- admitted that they have lots of disgruntled customers and unresolved problems.DO NOT BUY this program -LRB- or Norton Anti-Virus which caused similar problems -RRB- ... go with McAfee or another vendor instead ...
 I have a PIII-850MHz machine running Win/ME . This program drastically slowed my machine down , to the point that I uninstalled it . If you need a firewall , use ZoneAlarm . It 's free .
 Without repeating all the problems reported by other reviewers -LRB- I have experienced most of them and more -RRB- suffice it to say that amazon should take this off of their shelf and refuse to sell it . It is utter and complete garbage - I have never seen any software that behaves so poorly or is so poorly supported . Symantec / Norton should be ashamed of this product and should send a refund to all users of it .
 This is the first review I write and I 'm motivated by how furious this product has made me . I consider myself pretty computer saavy but I have had nothing but problems with Norton Internet Security . I have been unable to access the Internet -LRB- the firewall sucks ! -RRB- and my computer runs slower than ever . I have spent hours trying to access technical support and then hours with the tech support agent trying to solve this . After three hours today -LRB- again ! -RRB- they finally made me download a program that will supposedly fix this . I just do n't have the time to deal with this garbage and honestly , I give this product zero stars . When my subscription runs out I will purchase Mcgafee - my Mom swears it 's better . You 're warned.VERY DISPLEASED CUSTOMER IN U.S.
 I am fed up with uninstalling and reinstalling this product evry time there 's a problem . Before I buy the next edition -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , I 'm going to have to get some assurance that it has a LOT fewer glitches and is more stable .
 I have had good luck with previous purchases of Antivirus but unfortunately this package is one to stay away from if you use Eudora or do not wish to use Norton 's AntiSpam . Norton even admits that it has `` problems '' with Eudora but still advertises it 's compatibility . The worst part is you can not select the software package to install/uninstall . I either have to deal with AntiSpam screwing up my system so I can keep the firewall and antivirus or remove them all . I tried to get my money back 4-month 's ago because of this and still have n't been credited . I doubt I will ever be credited for downloading this unbelievably bad software and trying to get help is impossible.I will no longer purchase a Symantec software again .
 1 . Nullify Eudora 's effective junk filter feature , even when Norton 's AntiSpam is disabled ; 2 . Poor integration with earlier Norton installation with separate control consoles . Some items on the earlier one stop working ; 3 . Fire the ones who are responsible for the intrusive activation feature that makes uninstallation impossible .
 I have been a loyal Symantec customer for over 9 years . I decided to upgrade my computer to NAV 2004 and my father &#8217; s pc to NIS 2004 . It took me several hours to do the upgrade to my computer because the NAV install had conflicts with my Gateway &#8217; s Help Spot software . I spent at least 12 hours over 2 weeks trying to get NIS to install on my father &#8217; s pc and finally gave up and installed a copy of NIS 2003 . Symantec has written so much anti-pirating code into their install that it made it impossible for me to install a legal copy of the software ! There is no longer a free support number to call for help , instead you have to submit a request and wait days -LRB- I &#8217; m not kidding , days -RRB- to get a response . I tried searching their online knowledge base for help and found article after article detailing how to un-install their software and little on how to resolve the problems on installing it . I can &#8217; t believe a company as good as Symantec would release a product so prone to cause users problems and then not provide better customer support . I &#8217; m a professional developer and if I had these kinds of problems installing I can only imagine how frustrated casual users must feel faced with this error prone install / anti-piracy program . I use to recommend Symantec products to all my friends and customers , not anymore . Symantec , fix your software and bring back good customer support !!!
 Greetings All , I noticed a lot of you said you were n't techs after expressing a rather negative opinion regarding this product . I am a tech , so here 's my negative opinion ... . For many years I have recommended the high end symantec products , nortons corp has never failed me in any of the companies I look after . I recently had a small business request a price for NIS , I of course recommended Symantec antivirus corp , since they already had a hardware firewall . The customer bought NIS from another IT company . After the customer spent several days trying to get it to install on any of their computers , They called me . I have now wasted a day getting all but one machine working , the install gets most the way through before reporting it failed . not for any reason of course , just that it failed . After countless un-installs/re-installs/manual removals and combinations of each , im giving rnav -LRB- removes nortons -RRB- one last try before formatting the box to get rid of any trace of this crud . Then will start over intalling.Overall , I will still recommend symantec av corp , but thats about it .
 I wish I had checked here before buying , it would have saved a lot of aggravation.Had 90 day Norton AntiVirus trial on new laptop and stupidly bought Norton Internet Security at the end of the 90 days via download.Took 5 hours to get the thing installed and `` working '' ; unfortunately , at that point it would n't let me on the internet.After another 2 hours , I gave up and turned everything in NIS off , except for the AntiVirus in order to connect with the internet.I 've got McAfee on a desktop -- works fine , always has.Intend to un-install Monday and if need be have credit card company charge back what I paid for this crap.Norton and/or Symantec -- never , ever again will I put a penny into one of their products .
 NIS 2004 has a very buggy install.I had Norton Firewall 2003 and NAV 2003 on 2 machines , both running XP Home . I was very happy with the 2003 products.The NIS install on the first machine , while constantly interrupted and restarted , eventually worked . It is up and -LRB- I hope -RRB- running - at least NIS says it 's running.I bought a second copy of NIS for the second machine . The install on the second machine played out every problem listed here . Man , what a lousy install - you 'd think Symantec would have cobbled together a patch product by now . I went back to Personal Firewall 2003 with updates -LRB- $ 15 -RRB- , and bought McAfee antivirus . So far , that combo is working fine.I would not buy NIS 2004 . Stick with upgrading the Symantec 2003 products - but even then you have to be careful which live updates you choose to install . 4 stars for working once -LRB- with bugs -RRB- , no stars for the second install - average 2 stars .
 NIS 2004 can be a nice program * at times * , when it 's working and you figure out how to deal with its quirks . But the stories about the bloated code , installation and unistallation problems -LRB- I 've spent what seems like weeks installing and reinstalling for various reasons -RRB- , instability , tech support indifference -LRB- and cost -RRB- , etc. are all so very true.I could write a book about my experiences with those kinds of NIS travails . No program has ever caused me more problems . But let me talk about something I have n't seen mentioned
 What more can I add to these illuminating reviews , except to emphasize that what you read in them is REALLY true . This programme is horrible , and unless you crave headaches and a lot of trouble , NEVER buy this !!! I only wish I had read these reviews before I so trustingly bought my copy ...
 AVOID THIS PRODUCT.It does not work . Once you install it , only a clean reinstall from format will have your computer working again.I installed it on a P4 3GHz , and it continually crashed and failed.I am a technical professional , and have used many , many software packages . This one is terrible , and will cause you more headaches than it will save.DO NOT PURCHASE !
 I give it one star . . since there are n't fewer to give!I have used Norton Anti-Virus and other products for years . When it was time to `` re-up '' on my anti-virus updates , I thought that I would give this a try . . and help manage the SPAM at the same time.I have a Pentium 3 600 MHz machine with Windows 2000 and I use Outlook Express for my email . Now that Norton Internet Security is loaded , Outlook Express is dead-beast slow ! -LRB- Internet Explorer web-browsing is not so bad . . I could give 'em a half-a star for that . -RRB- Like other reviewers , it 's likely that I will uninstall this product and look for a less intensive SPAM-Blocker . -LRB- I use a Linksys router , so I 'm not very concerned with the firewall features here . -RRB- `` PRODUCT ACTIVATION '' . . Hey Symantec , give me a break !!! Been There , Done That ! This is still just a bad idea.Lack of support for Windows 95 . . OK , Leave your customers in the dust . . Great business model ??? More annoying `` Product Rebates '' . . Why not just reduce the price ? Cut the crap ! Is this the best way to insure a `` loyal '' customer ? HEY - GIVE ME A PRODUCT THAT WORKS !!!
 Norton has a name in the market but I think it 's only the name . It 's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus . The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start . Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software . `` Live updates '' does not help much either . The antivirus program was able to detect spyware on my laptop but was unable to remove it . It said , `` Get updates to remove '' . I got many updates but it failed to remove . A freeware program from download.com was able to remove spyware easily !! I would ask you NOT to buy this software . All that is remaining is the NAME .
 This product is very poorly designed and shows that Symantec should stick to virus protection software . I have found it to be more intrusive to the user than to hackers . I had to disable the AntiSpam portion of the software completely because it came up with far too many false positives . Every single message I received that did not come from someone in my address book or from someone whose previous emails I had explicitly marked as `` not junk mail '' was flagged by NIS as spam . I spent more time sifting through the `` Norton AntiSpam '' folder than I did reading my email . Outlook 2003 has built-in spam filtering that seems to work well , so there 's no need to put up with the headaches that NIS causes.The other `` features '' are just as bad . The privacy function in NIS does not seem to work at all . Credit card numbers that I had specified as private information were not flagged when I later used them online . The ad blocking and browser privacy functions tend to break so many websites that it 's just not worth the hassle for the supposed security . Besides , Google 's free popup blocker negates the need to purchase software to do the same thing . The firewall is decent , but ZoneAlarm 's free firewall would probably work just as well . You would be best served to avoid this product and just get Norton AntiVirus . Most of the other functions that NIS purports to serve should be left to freeware or shareware .
 I am now compleatly bald from trying to use this product , if you have the 2003 version KEEP IT . Thease tech support people are brain dead . This new version is so parinoid about unlicenced copys floating around that even if you pay for it it still treats you like you stole it .
 Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time . Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.I found I was better off with ZoneAlarm Pro as my firewall and Norton Antivirus 2004 as my first line of defense against intruders , viruses and Trojans . Supplement it with Ad-aware and Pest Patrol , be religious about scanning your system on a regular basis and you should be free of any problems.And if you let your kid 's surf the web on your PC , run the firewall and antivirus with the highest protection setting available .
 Norton Internet Security 2004 is an UN-USEABLE product . Internet activities that took 3 seconds prior to NIT '04 now take upwards of 60 to 90 seconds.I would n't have believed that a product could slow my internet usage so much . I tried to use it for a few days but had to un-install . And ; worst of all ; there is NO number or contact addresss to ask for help . You buy this incredibly poor product and you are stuck with it.How do I get my money back?SAH
 All they ever do is mess up my pc . If you ever try uninstalling it , watch out ! . Want tech support ? Be will to pay some cash for it . As far as Antivirus Im sticking with Kaspersky , and Firewall OutPost Pro . They are both better products and dont use the product activation junk .
 Do not buy NIS 2004 . I recently built a new computer , so I decided to put the latest and greatest internet protection on it . Even with a brand new installation of Windows XP I could not get NIS 2004 to install properly . After 5 days of working on this problem I still ca n't get the anti-virus autoprotect to run . I 've completely erased my hard drive reinstalled everything including NIS 2004 , all according to Symantec `` experts '' still I get the error message `` Norton AntiVirus has encountered an internal program error '' -LRB- 4002,517 -RRB- or -LRB- 4002,519 -RRB- . This is insane . I will demand a refund on this product !!! I repeat `` Do Not Buy '' .
 In late Oct. . I wrote a review of this product based on my intitial impressions from around 2 weeks of use . I gave the product 3 stars after a number of hassles that seemed to be ending . Well , this weekend I uninstalled this piece of crap for the 4th and last time . And like virutally everything else about the product , even the uninstall did n't work correctly and I am still suffering from Norton 's mess that they loaded onto my computer . Here 's the lowdown on a worthless software program that will stay in memory as the single most destructive thing I have ever had around.It hogs memory . I went out and bought another 128mb which Norton instantly grabbed . 374mb and you would have thought I had an orignal antique computer from the 50s . Both the boot and shut down times lasted so long I could take a bathroom break and still get back before anything had finished . While the computer was on I continually heard my hard drives doing something almost nonstop.The program often misdownloads during startup . You are suppose to see icons for the virus and firewall in your bottom tray . No icons means you ca n't open the program . It is runing in the background but will not open a window regardless of what you do . The only solution is to completely shut down and then restart your computer . Do this 2 or 3 times a day and things get tiring real fast . Norton 's excellent online help site mentions that changing the order in which it is loaded may solve this problem . Part way into a major rewrite of my set up , and I 'm not a computer geek , convinced me that I did n't buy a program to learn how to write software.The program often refuses to let you on the Internet . This is what did it for me in the end . I got so sick of being unable to connect . It would take a complete uninstall , and I mean complete , to solve the problem . Just using your start/settings/control panel/uninstall was not enough . You had to also do a start/find/norton & symantec and delete every darn thing before whatever mess they created was finally removed . The last and final time I did this Norton must have realized I was dumping them forever because the Uninstall refused to start . :-RRB- Haha . I kid you not . 4 , count them , 4 complete shutdowns and startups on the computer were needed before the Uninstall would finally begin to work . And then I had to manually delete anything I could find with their name on it . I have a sneaking hunch there is still stuff on the hard drive but several hidden files I tried to change are somehow producted by Windows so I decided to leave them as they are.I am running a free version of ZoneAlarm at the moment and shopping for a new virus program . I had Norton AntiVirus before and was happy with it but I 'm frankly scared to install anything with their name on it after what happened . I do n't like buggy software and I hate stuff that digs into your system and hides itself everywhere and then refuses to leave .
 I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out . While it did n't have all the features I would have liked , it was better than anything else I could find at the time.Unfortunately , Symantec has since chosen to follow McAfee 's lead in selling unbundled programs -LRB- It 's better to sell 10 programs at $ 30 each than one integrated suite at $ 100 -RRB- , with conflicts between the programs , lots of bugs , no customer service , and a $ 30/year per program charge for updates.The only way we can show our dissatisfaction with this sort of foolishness is to vote with our feet . So I 'm offering the following alternative , hoping that other reviewers will suggest others.Trend Micro has just come out with `` PC-cillin Internet Security 2004 , '' an upgrade of `` PC-cillin 2003 '' -LRB- a top-rated anti-virus program -- see Amazon user reviews -RRB- , which offers a personal firewall providing protection from network viruses , spam email , inappropriate web content , and Spyware programs.If you do decide to move away from Symantec , you should be aware that the normal uninstall process will not remove all Symantec files from your computer -LRB- this has been a serious problem with Symantec from the beginning -RRB- . In the case of Norton Anti-Virus and Norton Internet Security , the remaining files are likely to conflict with replacement software -LRB- they definitely do conflict with Trend Micro 's products -RRB- . To remove them , go to Symantec 's website and download a file named `` RnisUPG.exe '' . Run it , and it will remove the offending files .
 Okay , how can I say this nicely ? This product is absolutely not ready for release . It is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user . I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud.I just bought a new computer so I figured I would install the new Norton with the new system . Bad idea . My new computer which clocks at twice the rate of my old system is SLOWER than my old system when using Norton 2004 . Also , I despise software activation . Microsoft already treats us like criminals , but we have little choice there . With Norton we can fight back because we have many alternatives.Bottom line ? Save your money . Look for copys of Norton 2003 or simply buy an alternative . This product signals the decline of Symantec and the Norton line .
 I actually cant believe I 'm writing this . I have been a loyal symantec customer for easily 10 years . If this review stops one person from buying Norton Internet Security 2004 then I 'll feel better about this.If you have IS 2003 I strongly suggest keeping it and subscibing for updates . Stay away from IS 2004 . I downloaded it hoping for a more secure firewall and security package . I always upgrade . What I got was a program full of bugs and crashes and what 's worse - no support.I have 2 PCs that I loaded it on so it can not be said that it 's my other software . One PC is for media and the other for simple tasks . I never had issues with IS 2003 on either system . Since downloading IS 2004 I 've had to reinstall it no less than 5 times ! The program disables itself when it encounters a problem even when I 'm not home . I 've come home to find myself having been without firewall protection for hours . The error message that the program provides directs me to their knowledge base site . Each time this has happened the end solution is to reinstall . What 's worse is the first two times I realized the issue was that IS 2003 left traces of itself behind . So basically Norton 's own program is the problem . The knowledge base directs you through a complicated uninstall process involving the registry . This is okay for me but what about the average user ? Why do they have to go through this when all they are looking for is a sense of security.I 've experienced problems with using LiveUpdate for updates because of the same issue . The knowledge base instructs the user to reinstall the program or go through the process of making sure IS 2003 has completely vacated the building as if it was a competitor.Needless to say - emails to Symantec 's support have gone either unanswered -LRB- I 'm sure they are busy -RRB- or replied to with links to the same old knowledge base articles.I honestly never thought I 'd be writing a scathing review of a product I 've been loyal to , and recommended , for years but I feel it 's necessary . Please stay with IS 2003 if you are considering the upgrade . Your peace of mind will thank you for it .
 John W Thompson CEOWorld HeadquartersSymantec Corporation20330 Stevens Creek Blvd.Cupertino , CA 95014Dear Mr. Thompson , I have wasted over 200 pounds sterling of my time trying to install the Norton 2004 upgrade and other potential customers should know this . Whilst Norton Antivirus does work , Norton Internet Security most definitely does not.Potential buyers are warned that even on a 3-month-old machine with a recent version of Windows XP , they are likely to have similar problems to mine even if , like me , they are pretty competent - albeit not ` tecchie ' - ` users ' . Installation scans freeze , perpetual error messages appear about failed driver initialization . Hours are spent following Norton 's instructions to uninstall and reinstall , and the Symantec web site ` help ' pages are a veritable nest of do-loops taking the user round and round in circles to no avail whatsoever.After following all instructions and still finding that the default for NIS is ` off ' , that on launching it Intrusion Detection wo n't work and simply lobs out more error messages , the user will find that Symantec 's site will suggest that he or she pays it a hefty fee to use its helpline . This beggars belief , when you consider that most computer manufacturers and respectable software houses will give free telephone help for the first year.I recommend to Amazon 's customers that they do not buy this product now or in the future , unless Symantec is prepared to announce free telephone help for stymied would-be users . Customers
 I 've had the last 3 versions of NIS . All in all it has n't been a bad product . However , Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.I 'm currently running a Pentium 4 @ 3.5 GHZ -LRB- C stepping with hyperthreading -RRB- , 1GB of RAM , SATA RAID Array with Western Digital Raptors on XP Professional . Needless to say , I have plenty of system resources to run this application . Forgot to mention I 've worked in the PC Hardware and Software industries as a Product/Marketing Manager and also am a MCSE -LRB- MS Certified Systems Engineer -RRB- and CCNA -LRB- Cisco Certified Network Associate -RRB- . I 've been dealing with hardware and software for a long time both professionally and at home.Downsides I have come across :1 -RRB- This application is a major resource hog . My system slowed to a point where I began to question the state of the hardware . I uninstalled NIS 2004 and installed NIS 2003 , worked like a champ .2 -RRB- Some websites suddenly became inaccessible . Symantec could n't tell me why . I reinstalled NIS 2003 , they came up without a hitch .3 -RRB- I 've been asking for Trillian support for 2 years . Despite the fact that the messenger client has an installed base of nearly 10 million users and is a valid entity , Symantec seems to deem it not worth their consideration . Bottom line , Symantec is unresponsive to customer requests . I 'd have better luck asking for a feature from Microsoft .4 -RRB- After spending 2 weeks exchanging email with Symantec Support , I was unable to turn on autoprotect @ bootup . No one could explain why , I tried all the solutions . I 'm betting it was a compatibility issue with my RAID array since the function is integrated into Intel 's Southbridge chipset .5 -RRB- Norton does n't like to have features turned off which could be the reason why I 've had so many issues . I only want to use it for privacy , cookie management , ad blocking and anitvirus . Anyone who has experience with systems security knows that it is n't a good idea to rely on products from just one vendor . I have the computer behind a Linksys router -LRB- NAT firewall is much better than the NIS software firewall hands down -RRB- , use ZoneAlarm for application control and NIS for the features I mentioned above .6 -RRB- Ad blocking is partially functional . Symantec has touted it as a feature for the last 3 years and I have yet to see a decent implementation . Also , during setup and configuration , if you turn on ad blocking and go into the options , you 'll find that NIS does not turn off ads from specific adservers . Kickbacks anyone ? You have to manually go in and block them -LRB- under options -RRB- .7 -RRB- As my other esteemed reviewers have said , the activation scheme is unacceptable . I will not buy separate versions for the 2 desktops and 2 laptops I have . I like to stay on the cutting edge of computer hardware and change out components frequenty , so only being able to activate the product 5 times is completely unacceptable . This was another deciding factor involved in my decision to return the software . Not to mention , the process to obtain a refund pretty much sealed the coffin on me every buying another Symantec product for quite some time.I would recommend you wait another month or two and hope the bugs get worked out , buy NIS 2003 or try to find another solution on the market .
 I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions . I wish I 'd done some research first ... My father installed it on his desktop -LRB- a Dell running WinME -RRB- without any problems . When the system asked him to reboot , he said he 'd do it later because it was late , and simply shut down the computer . The next morning he discovered the worst.When he tried to boot up the computer , it started booting up normally , but when it got to his desktop , that 's all he got - a blank desktop . No icons , no start menu , nothing . In fact , CTRL-ALT-DEL shows that nothing is running . Weird huh ? Even weirder is that when he tried to go into ` Safe Mode ' , the exact same thing happens . I 'm not sure what NIS 2004 did to his computer , but nothing short of reinstalling his entire system would get it to boot up.Now comes the fun part - Symantec Technical Support and Customer Service . They do n't exist . The only free tech support they have is email based , and run by people in India , who apparently do n't speak English . I sent them email after email telling them that the system would n't boot up , and every time the sent back replies telling me to go to the ` Start Menu ' and go here and there and do this and that . The just did n't get the fact that I could n't load Windows.So , I thought I 'd give them a call to complain about the terrible tech support . I looked up their number on the internet and called . I got routed around the country to different phone systems , and then sat on hold for over two hours before I finally got frustrated enough to hang up and write the Better Business Bureau . Needless to say , I wo n't be installing this product on my own computer , and unless Symantec makes some major changes to the base program , wo n't be buying any more of their products.If you 're a computer guru , you might be able to get it to work , in which case this is a good program . The problem is , I 'm a computer guru , and I could n't make it work ...
 I tried to install this product and the installation program froze . I think it may have been because I already had Norton Antivirus installed , but it should have been able to handle that , after all they wrote both products . Then I tried to uninstall and reinstall . The installation would not work . So that was one evening blown . But now I could n't browse the Internet anymore . So the next night I called their support number -LRB- which appeared to have a per minute charge -RRB- - wait to you hear the great message I got - `` If you have installed Norton Internet Security and are having trouble accessing the Internet please go to our website . '' Huh ! So this weekend I spent 6 hours using 2 computers - one to access their website , the other for my install and I had to download Microsoft utilities , backup my registry , edit my registry - just as well I 'm a computer profesional , and finally it is installed . Based on all the documents on their website they know about all these problems , how could they release such a flawed installer instead of fixing it!Either do n't buy this or read all the instructions very carefully before you try to install it . Good Luck .
 I bought and installed this before reading these reviews ... OMFG , DO NOT BUY THIS ! This is the most god-awful program ever . It installed just fine , until I tried to use it . . I cant even get to the options screen on it , live update does not work , re-installed it a couple times , still doesnt work . Now , it wo n't un-install , so I will have to do it manually . This is the biggest pile of * CRAP * I have ever seen . Norton also charges 30 $ if you want tech support , btw . I did n't do that , but now have to wait 8 weeks to get a refund . I will never buy from norton ever again . Nor should you . Go mcafree or panda .
 Before installing anything on your computer , you need to do a bit of research before spending the money . This is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.Unlike the other reviewers , I had no problem installing Norton Internet Security . The trouble came when I used it . A few days after installing , a hijacker got in through the security , and I lost all ability to use my browser . According to the reports , some viruses were quarantined , which causes my other virus check to keep telling about it . As others noted , tech help is really non-existent unless you want to pay for it , and help does not come cheap.If you use a dial-up Internet service , this program will bring your movement to a crawl . The program appears to check everything , which means that just loading a basic page -LRB- like this site -RRB- takes too long to be practical.Do your research before buying this program .
 I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember . Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.That said , the latest release -LRB- Norton Internet Security 2004 -RRB- is the WORST SOFTWARE I HAVE EVER USED . Worse , Symantec basically FORCED me to convert from NIS 2002 -LRB- which I was delighted with -RRB- to NIS 2004 in early January -LRB- See the review by Roperwin dated 1-24-04 for details . What happened to him happened to me -RRB- . Rather than repeating what has already been said , I 'll just recommend that you keep reading the reviews here and on CNET.com and BELIEVE THEM.It will take me days to get my computer back to normal after uninstalling NIS 2004 . This is one of the worst software experiences I have ever had in 24 years of personal computer use .
 It 's been a long time since I 've intentionally installed as malicious a piece of software as Norton Internet Security 2004 . Frankly , I 'm a little disappointed that the Antivirus component did n't intercept and quarentine itself before it trashed my OS . When it actually runs , this software at best consumes all available resources and slows your system to a crawl . I 'm running a clean install of Windows XP pro SP1a on a machine with 1 gig of RAM and a 3.2 gHz P4 . When the software loads it still takes 3 minutes to log in ! After this it frequently locks up the OS and interferes with other software . I have installed , uninstalled , reinstalled , booted to safe mode , manually cleaned out my registry , hard drive and reinstalled ... all to no avail . I 've tried every lame suggestion from Symantec 's support and only run into more trouble . I 've even tried forcing the start up order , borrowing from earlier version fixes , but no luck there either . I nearly had to format and reinstall windows just to get my system working again.Don ' t make my mistake , I bought this software based on their past reputation and did n't read the reviews until it was too late . Norton took my money and at least 2 days of my life , and I have nothing to show for it but a bruised and battered operating system and that sickening feeling you get when you 've been betrayed by someone you once trusted .
 It should be ZERO stars , but that is not an option!In the interest of getting you to read this review I will keep it short . First of all , I concur with the remarks of the following reviewers
 After installing Norton Internet Security 2004 on XP Home , I noticed each day the access to web pages was getting slower and slower . After about a week it was unusable . I uninstalled and reinstalled and it seemed OK again until another week went by . I also noticed a bug in Norton Anti-Spam when you have multiple accounts on XP . Each time you attempt to use Outlook after another account has accessed it , you will get a C++ runtime error which terminates Outlook ... a second try will work and all goes well until another account tries to use Outlook . I have been a loyal Norton product user for many years ... but I have uninstalled it and am looking elsewhere .
 I have used and loved Norton Anti-Virus for years . I started using Internet Security in 2002 and 2003 and was very pleased with the product . Well the upgrade to 2004 did not go well . I ended up removing the old and new and reinstalled from scratch . I still had configuration problems and after five hours of tracking down possibilites I gave up for a few days ! The User 's Guide was not much help and it did n't match the on-line help . There are mismatches between the screen titles , options , labels and anything else you want to compare ! It was n't until 2 days later that I decided to try and fix things , such as intermittent access to the internet and lock ups durring live update . Once I went to symantic support and downloaded all of their patches ... took about an hour to download reboot download reboot download ... things finally started working ! If you do n't have high speed internet this is not for you ! I can not recommend this product in it 's present state !
 As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products , I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product -LRB- and hence the one star rating -RRB- . Here 's why :1 . The firewall is so selective that it blocks ME -LRB- the user -RRB- from simply accessing the internet . Changing the general rules , modifying the program control , and even decreasing the level of the firewall to `` Low '' do not allow Internet Explorer to display web sites . I have deleted ALL the rules and still can not access the internet . So , the number one reason I bought the software in the first place is turned off .2 . So what is the next logical step in trouble shooting ? To call tech support , right ? That will cost money ... and a considerable amount in my opinion -LRB- about half the price of the product -RRB- . Any guidance you might expect from their web page is non-existent .3 . The features that I have running now have slowed my system noticeably . And I am not sure what the trade-off is . I have ad blocking and spam control turned on but have not noticed a difference because I still receive both on a regular basis.If I had it to do over again , I would not purchase this product . And I urge you to look elsewhere as well .
 I have had Norton Internet Security installed -- and RUNNING -- since the day I bought this computer . Despite what I thought was good security -LRB- and the program gave every indication that it was running -RRB- , Norton allowed all sorts of adware and a Trojan to enter my computer . These files corrupted everything having to do with the internet -- and a few programs that did n't . Norton 's removal of these files failed each of the 7 times I tried . Neither could most of these files be removed or deleted manually , and the ones I thought I had deleted reinstalled themselves each time.I tried removing and reinstalling Norton -- as Norton told me to do -- and spent an entire day trying to get it reinstalled -- to no avail . I even repurchased the program and was unable to install that . -LRB- I think the very contamination that Norton was meant to protect me from corrupted Norton and prevented the reinstallation . -RRB- They offer internet support , but if you ca n't get into the internet -- because of contamination Norton allowed , what good is their service ??? They have no phone support that I could find -LRB- and I REALLY DO N'T think I should have to pay to fix a problem they are responsible for ! -RRB- . I was able to install McAfee in 10 minutes . It removed all of the offending files in less than 1/2 hour . -LRB- It still took me the better part of another day to get the programs in my computer running again . The system is still running slowly , and I 'm sure that I 'll have to reformat the hard drive in the near future , but I just do n't have the day and a half that that will take at the moment . -RRB- I 'll be using McAfee from now on -- on all of my computers .
 I bought this product after reading the Editor 's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon -LRB- as usual -RRB- . The program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program -- I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control . My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good . The installation , set-up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well . HOWEVER , I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC . It feels like I 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though I 'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year . I tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service ... and saw no improvement . There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site . I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor . I purchased this even though I saw some disparaging reviews at the Amazon site , trusting PC Magazine to get it right . However , I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT .
 After installing this software on a brand new CPU , we began seeing this runtime error every time MS Outlook was started . Researching the Internet revealed that this has been an issue since early 2003 , regardless of how `` clean '' or fast ones computer is . The primary association with the error has been Norton Anti-Spam or Internet Security and MS Outlook 2000 , 2002 , or 2003 . We should all accept by now that computers are complex , and software is often released prematurely , with multiple service releases to fix bugs as they are discovered . I do have a problem however , with the attitude of the Norton Support Technician , or those in support at any other software company . Why should we consumers have to wait two years for obvious conflicts to be resolved ? We spent good money on this product , and although it works OK with our faster computer , we 're annoyed by the conflict with Outlook and expect to see a patch that will fix it .
 I just about lost it this morning with this software . While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with `` alerts '' every twenty seconds -LRB- literally -RRB- , warning me my antivirus protection was off . But it would n't let me turn the AV protection back on and it would n't stop with the alerts.I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago , and it would n't let me do that either . I tried it again this morning and it said I did n't have the required `` permissions '' and lacked proper administrator status . On my own home computer.Of course , if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $ 30 per incident . Meanwhile , the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds . Finally I ran msconfig and went into the `` services '' tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec `` service , '' then ran uninstall again . This time , it started the uninstallation process , then I left for work . I think it will work . I hope it will work.I simply hate Symantec . I swear , if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , I would have .
 It took me a day to install this product . If you do choose to use this product be sure to uninstall all other norton virus and internet security products even tho the instructions say that norton 2003 is uninstalled automatically -- it isi n't !! My computer now crashes frequently since I began using this product . My advice is to stay clear of this product until they get it fixed . One other point -- do n't count on getting any technical help form Symantec -- they do n't even have decent free help installing the product let alone using it .
 After purchases of Norton software back to DOS days , this will probably be my last . I have never had previous problems with Symnatec/Norton and the activation feature they implemented appears to be the issue . In an effort to protect the product , they have made it unusable to the customer . Did n't Turbotax learn this same lesson after trying the same thing a couple of years ago ? I have spent hours installing , uninstalling , following their online support error codes , etc. all to no avail . Finally had to use phone activation which requires you giving them about 20 alphanumerics and they give you back same . Mine then crashed and after transfer to support with a ticket the phone wait lasted in excess of 15 minutes and then was told I had to wait at least 15 minutes more . So still no active antivirus software and am now worse off than before even tried to activate !
 My Norton -LRB- 2003 -RRB- version was expiring so I bought Norton Internet Security 2004 . Upon installation I get the message
 I installed the Internet Security Suite a week ago and have had nothing but problems ever since . After many lost hours and reinstalled programs I 've had to disable the email filtering -LRB- it freezes everytime its on and does n't import my entire address book -RRB- . And I 'm only having to perform a hard reboot about once a day verses 10 + . The only reason I have n't done an uninstall is that I 'm hoping Norton will continue ` learning ' until it is n't a total pain in the -LRB- * & -LRB- % . Plus , I 'd be out all my shipping if I returned it . Plus , I 'd have to drive to the post office ... I absolutely hate this product but I like their virus software . I think it 's much better than McAfree .
 I INSTALLED THIS PRODUCT AND LOST MY DSL INTERNET CONNECTION FOR OVER FIVE HOURS WHILE A FRIEND OF MINE HELPED GET IT BACK . NORTON IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH DSL BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO DOWNLOAD TO TRY TO PREVENT IT , BUT THEIR DOWNLOAD DOES NOT WORK . THEIR VIRUS PRODUCT IS FINE , BUT THIS PRODUCT IS A MENACE .
 I 've ordered the NIS 2004 , since I was quite happy with the 2003 version that just expired . So I 've tried to install it over the weekend . The installation went perfect , I 've registered and got the production activated and did the required reboot to complete the installation . The system came back up fine , but NIS 2004 asked to the activated -LRB- which I did already before rebooting -RRB- - so I 've followed the instructions , only to receive a message stating that I 've exceeded my activation number and was asked to call Symantec support activation 800 line . Which I did , and was greeded by a message stating that they 're closed on weekends . The software did n't work without the activation and disabled itself , thus leaving me w/o antivirus/spam/firewall protection.It is a pitty that Symantec is not learning form Intuit that their customers should not be treated like thievs , and they come up with those arcane activations that they ca n't even support properly.Needless to say I 've uninstalled the software , went to a CompUSA and bought a copy of PC-cillin .
 One star is a review requirement , not my rating - 500 nuisance points is more appropiate.I agree with the Reviewer
 This is the worse software I have ever purchased . The support from Norton is even worse . I purchased the cd rom and downloaded . Then it crashed my computer . I attempted to contact Norton for sveral hours and never received a response I threw my copy in the trash!Angry in La. .
 Absolutely AWFUL software . Do n't buy it . It conflicts with DHCP addressing on networks , wreaks havoc with networking -LRB- esp . wireless -RRB- software on Windows , and requires an endless amount of tweaking to get Outlook to work correctly . There is also no real support for the software from Symantec , and if you call your ISP to complain that your email does n't work , they 'll say , `` Oh , you 're using Internet Seurity , sorry we have many problems with that and do n't support it ... '' About the only decent thing that comes with it is a neat Viusal Tracker for WHOISing would be attackers . But , from what I hear , there is n't a whole lot a hacker has to do to get past this useless piece of software . So a would-be hacker is probably already a has-done hacker ...
 Memory hog ; forces Outlook Express to restart , reconnect - NO support from Web site ; I bitterly regret installing it on my computer ; previous version was fine and I had no complaints . This is a nut cluster .
 This software is horrible . Heed the other reviewers ' advice and do n't buy this thing . I installed it four times and got several error messages every time . I just spent THREE hours with Dell reinstalling and reformatting my hard drive . It 's not worth it ! Do n't bother , NAV 2003 works just fine !
 I have loved norton products for years , and did not blink and eye at buying the latest version of NIS - and so began the week of HELL . I have to agree with all the other negative comments reviewing this product , this product is a NIGHTMARE and was definitely prematurely released . I am an IT professional , and at this point I have spent over 18 hours troublshooting the product , installing , removing , reinstalling -LRB- 9 times now -RRB- , online support , emailing support , paying for tech support -LRB- who incidently did nothing more than have me uninstall , clean out the registry entries , and reinstall -RRB- even to the point of reformatting the harddrive - TWICE . This product was not ready for release . Stick with NIS2003 , its stable , 2004 is not .
 What a horrid mess . Did the people at Norton ever try to installthis ! Or see how it runs ... I think not !!!!! It locks up the computer , screws up explorer , deletes drivers , the list goes on . How can a company dump a defective productlike this on the market ? The only good thing about this product is the 60 day refund offered on the Norton website . Anyonewho has purchased NIS04 should get damages for pain and suffering too . Yuck ... Minus stars .
 I had the best intentions when I bought this , I really did . I followed the instructions to the letter . But it caused more headaches than I could imagine . Stay away from this product ! I do n't know what 's happened to Norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage . Apparently , they ca n't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site . The customer support is pathetic .
 Please listen to others -- this software is horrible . It ran all right for me for 2 months then started getting buggy . The severe problems began when I tried to uninstall it -- you can not get this off your system . Norton 's website has lengthy instructions involving several approaches to uninstalling including editing the registry -- what crap . Do n't waste your money . Go to Norton 's website and do a search using `` uninstall and reinstall '' . If you use this junk you will regret it . I had to offload all data and do full reformat and reinstallation of Windows XP to clean up my system . Wasted 2 days screwing around .
 On Windows XP , after a couple of months , got a notice that the antivirus portion nmeeded to be reinstalled . Reinstall failed numerous times . After much digging on Symantec 's support web site , found out that ALL Symantec products needed to be totally uninstalled first -LRB- including deleting registry keys -RRB- , before reinstalling . OK - this is involved but doable , I 'm mildly annoyed . 7 hours later , after following the confusing instructions , it FAILED again . And oh by the way - THEY WANT $ 30 FOR PHONE SUPPORT . Like they 'll get another PENNY of my money after this experience . Never another Symantec product for me .
 I have used a variety of Norton products on a 450 mhz Dell since 1999 without a problem , but NIS 2004 rendered my computer unusable . This program grabbed all system resources and would cause a system resource error within 10 minutes of startup each and every time . I followed their generally useless ` support ' advice ; uninstalled/reinstalled many times and did everything I could to free up system resources all to no avail . Finally I left NIS 2004 uninstalled . My computer instantly began to function normally EXCEPT that i can not go back and put NIS 2002 back on . NIS 2002 did work fine -LRB- it was the anti-spam that lured me to 2004 -RRB- , but absolutely will not work on a machine polluted by NIS 2004 . I 've tried cleaning the registry , but no luck . Anyway , on to try PC-illin . Symantec has lost another customer forever .
 I installed NIS 2004 on both my desktop and laptop . It has turned out to be a huge mistake . First , I put it on my new Dell laptop . After couple of weeks , I could n't log into NIS any more . I am the only one using that laptop as admin . But NIS keeps saying I am not . Now , the same error happens on my Dell pc . I am very upset . Now , it 's like I ca n't remove NIS and ca n't login . Plus , NIS makes my computers very slow . Overall , it 's not worthy of using NIS , even it would come as free . Maybe I would reconsider to use it if Norton pays me $ 50 a hour to use that junk .
 I also reviewed Norton System Works 2004/Professional . This product has virtually all the same installation problems.For purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems.Something happened with this release for Norton System Works -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and for `` Internet Security 2004 '' . This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite . It has saved my system on more than one occasion , and makes disc clean up a snap . The antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated . I think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the market.Well , no more . This version of Internet Security 2004 , is beyond hope . They are a royal pain to install , and do n't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.The biggest problem is the installation . Also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security . I 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and I 've yet to get either product working properly.Why they brought this to market is beyond me . First , it serious , serious installation problems . Back in May 2004 , when I first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run . Since then , I have had one problem after another.To say that it is `` buggy '' would be the world 's most profound understatement . Almost from the beginning , LiveUpdate would not function . First , it failed whenever connecting to get updates . When I finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month . The next problem was that it did n't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions . Without this important feature , both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless . Without updated virus definiations , your PC is also at serious risk!Once installed , however , some of the functions do work OK -LRB- Disk Doctor , One Button Checkup , and WinDoctor -RRB- . These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and I found the menu to be much more navigable . But this does n't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this . Warning ! The Windows `` remove program '' feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does Norton 's own removal program . A lot of `` fragments '' were left in the Registry , and it the Norton system folders . Their website had a download that helped remove those , although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the `` Programs '' directory . If you have an older version of `` Internet Security '' installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install . You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY . -LRB- Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website . -RRB- Even this , however , did not solve my problems . As of October , 2004 , these products are NOT working and I 'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues . Once again it wo n't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.The best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . It does n't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars.Personally , I may never buy Symantect products again . And that 's a shame . They use to be so useful and neceesary . No longer . Avoid this product at all costs .
 Using Internet Security is worse than getting a virus in the first place . I have had to remove it from 4 machines because it slowed down the Cox Cable Internet so much that I could n't get my email , or get to websites reliably . I turned it off , but real cure was to completely uninstall the piece of junk.It is a sad day when the software that is supposed to protect your system is worse than the disease itself .
 Summary
 I 've discovered two new threats ... W32.SymantecNIS2004Pro.Worm and W32.SymantecNSW2004Pro.WormSymptoms are not being able to connect to the internet , login to your personal firewall , run your anti-virus program , or scan your emails from viruses.Removal of both of these is extremely difficult . There are a few removal tools out there -LRB- all of which do n't work completely -RRB- and conflicting advice from the Symantec Knowledge Base and live Technical Support . You will be required to alter registry files yourself and search for hidden files so you can manually delete them . Symptoms can develop right after installation of Symantec programs , or even a few days from then -LRB- it varies ... how interesting -RRB- . Please be aware that even after uninstalling all Symantec products using Add/Remove Programs -LRB- which by the way , probably wo n't work , it varies ... how interesting -RRB- there will still be 24-73 Symantec files still residing on your computer -LRB- it varies ... how interesting -RRB- . These files may still interfere with your normal computer use , such as using the Help & Support features of your OS or computer manufacturer . The last few remaining files are extremely difficult to remove as you can not delete them yourself even after doing a Selective System Startup , loading only Microsoft System Services.The best protection against this threat is ... once you finally get all Symantec products removed from your computer to never install one of their products again . Be careful , distribution of this threat is very high and can you believe people actually pay for the threat ? For even further protection ... visit http://www.mcafee.com
 I previously had Norton Antivirus and Norton Personal Firewall 2002 on my Dell Dimension 8200 . When the subscription for NAV expired I thought I would be smart and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 for just a few dollars more . I downloaded the software form the Symantec site and began to install.Immediately there were problems with LiveUpdate . I was able to resolve that problem and thought I had a stable installation . However after a couple of reboots , NIS says it had encountered a serious error and that I should reinstall NIS . This happened four times before I discovered a fix mentioned on a blog . I had searched the Symantec site in vain , but with the description of the fix from the blog , I then found the fix on Symantec 's site . It did resolve that issue . But there was more.Part of the NIS 2004 package is an antispam tool bar plug-in for Outlook -LRB- my email program -RRB- . At least every other time I start Outlook , Outlook encounters an error , and I have to abort and restart . I have found no solution for this problem . I thought if I turned the antispam feature off and unloaded the toolbar , I would at least have functional email . Not so . There appears to be no way to disable the tool bar short of a complete uninstall.Finally , there is the issue of computer resources . I have seen each program added to MS XP slow things down , but when I added Norton Internet Security 2004 , it was like dropping anchor . Startup , shutdown and most application starts have been severly impacted.My recomendation ? Almost anything should be better than Norton Internet Security 2004 . Save your money .
 Read the `` falling star '' article from another user . Everything he said happened to me too . I threw money away when I bought this thing that does not work correctly . I do not know how such a company can put such a product on the market . Moreover , none of their help tips work . They simply need to build a clean update and send it to their customers . If not , bye , bye Norton when renewal time comes ... Also , there is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AVAILABLE on the phone . Good luck ...
 I purchased this product from the Symantic Store over the Internet . When it would not download properly , I found there was no way to contact the company except through unhelpful e-mails . They do not have an `` 800 '' number , they do not provide a mailing address . They never acknowledged my cancellation and failed to remove the charge from my credit card even though I ordered the upgraded 2004 CD version when the 2003 download would not work . I will never purchase anything from this company again . Quite frankly , I would give them a minus 5 if that were possible on your rating system . Next time , I 'm buying McAfee .
 I used Norton Internet Security for several years now , however this year the upgrade was a disaster . It took me two weeks to get the update -LRB- even their online shop is a complete mess , you select English Europe and end up on the US site where they tell you after filling out all info includign creditcard -RRB- that you are not entitled to upgrade the very product you bought on the US site 1 year before . -LRB- I assume some homeland protection feature ? -RRB- . Now after getting it it completely slows down my system , surfing is like 14.4 k modem . I will go after them for a refund.I wonder what mad people did develop such a piece of ...
 I spent over two weeks trying to get this software to work and every error including the ` blue screen of death ' was a known problem by Symantec . Their solution was uninstall , reinstall over and over . Each time new errors and again all known by Symantec.This product is not ready for release and unless you want to Beta test for Symantec , do n't go near it.No stars for this product .
 I recently renewed my Norton program and upgraded . Since that time I have had nothing but PROBLEMS . My Sympatico E Mail will not work properly . Sympatico tells me its because of my firewall . Anytime I click on a underlined title / Add nothing happens . All I can read in my daily TSN report is the headlines , no particulars of the story . I try and contact you and I get nowhere . Today I hung up my phone after 2o minutes of hanging on the phone . This is terriable service . Either fix my problem or refund my money
 I bought and installed Norton Internet Security 2004 version 7.0.3.8 on a PC with Windows 98 Operating System . It took hours to download , install , reboot , activate , register , update , perform pre-install scans , perform recommended scans of the whole drive , and other steps I probably forgot . It downloads a huge number of files . I frequently had to reboot the machine during the installation process . It took maybe 4 or 5 hours to install the software . And that was using broadband access . At the end of the installation , I had lots of questions , and could not seem to get it working right.Then I tried to access support on their web site . Badly designed . Impossible to find stuff . Then I looked for email support . No such thing as far as I could find . Then I looked for telephone support . Called the number , went throught a long series of menus , at the end of which was silence . No one ever answered.After a google search , I found this Amazon review space . It has way more help on the product than you will ever find from Symantec/Norton . The most important piece of advice is DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.I will add just one minor example to the many already here . When you install the parental controls feature , they tell you they recommend a default setting of a child 's account so that when the machine boots up , the child account will be the initial one . What they do not tell you is that you will then not be able to access the Internet . Get it ? To protect children from the Internet , Norton wo n't let them on the Internet , at all . Not any sites . None . No access.Now if you want to learn more , you would need to get on the Internet to get to the Norton website . The trick is you simply disable the parental controls . Then you can get to the NOrton website . But to do that you must have already set up a supervisor account . There is a way to log off the child , log on as supervisor , and then disable the software , and then get on the Internet . But it is not easy to figure out.The software is badly designed , not supported , and will cost you a lot if you install it in terms of lost time , frustration , the cost of tech support to get rid of it , and damage to your system .
 I usually never write any reviews but this time I had to do it ! NIS 2004 is the biggest piece of crap that I ever used and I am very disapointed at Norton . I have been using their products for many years and was quite happy with that . However after spending my money on 2004 I decided that I wo n't buy any of their products again . What happened to the quality stuff that they used come out with?NIS 2004 simply does n't work . I have quite a powerful laptop and this software takes away too many resources , crashes very often and is very intrusive.Another thing that anoyed me is that it refuses to work with Gaim 0.76 even if I say that I allow the software to connect to the net in all ports.I wanted to get rid of the firewall and keep using the antivirus but even that is not possible . It tries to force me to use the whole package . I am going back to NIS 2003 while I do n't find a good substitute.This is complete crap and I completly chaged the image I had of this company .
 NIS2004 requires product activation . This will prevent you from installing this software on multiple computers . I think the NIS2003 product is just as good -LRB- maybe even better -RRB- and does not require the hassle of product activation.I would recommend that anyone thinking of NIS2004 to buy NIS2003 instead .
 You 'd think after Intuit gigantic flop with product activation that other software companies like Symantec would have learned something . I guess not . After using Norton Antivirus year after year -LRB- upgrading versions at least 3 times -RRB- I will have to look for another anti-virus vendor now .
 you must either work for or are affiliated with Norton / Symantic in some way because this program is the worst bunch of garbage with the worst support system . If Norton goes under someday , its their own fault ... piss off too many of us and you will all be facing the unemployment line . Symantic has become way to cocky and are ready for a fall ... this program proves that . STAY AWAY !!!!!!!!
 This is my personal Experience . Before I start I would also like to say that I am an experienced professional when it comes to computers . I work in a large data center with hundreds of servers -LRB- big computers -RRB- , have an MCSE -LRB- Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer Certificate -RRB- and essentially breathe computers . In other words I know what I 'm talking about.So I bought two copies of this software last night . It brought a 950 Mhz machine with 512 megs of ram running Windows XP to it 's knees . This software doubled the boot time of the computer -LRB- at least -RRB- . Not only that but after the desktop loaded it still grinds away for a few minuets . I was going to get the properties of a large file on my PC and the computer just stopped . Then a sign popped up saying it was scanning the file and I could cancel it . I could n't find a setting that would change the virus scanner from the `` Paranoid '' level to some `` Sane '' level of virus scanning . If that was n't enough this morning I tried to FTP into a server -LRB- command line -RRB- and could not because it was blocking me . I then tried to see why . It was also blocking nsloookup . I could not troubleshoot because it seemed to be blocking just about everything . Since I only had 12 hours to cancel the transaction -LRB- electronically return it -RRB- I did that this morning.I previously had Norton Antivirus 2003 Professional . I think I will go back to that.On the up side it does suppress allot of pop-up ads .
 Okay , I think we can all agree that installation of a Windows-based software should be , more or less , dummy proof . Well ... I 've spent about 10 hours try to get this ... program ? to install on my system . I 've tried their online `` free '' help and have done * everything * they suggest to get it to work , and well , it just does n't . My copy is getting sent back first thing Monday morning . If I could give it -5 stars , I would .
 I use to have Norton Internet Security 2002 and 2003 and loved them both . They would help block unwanted ads and Trojan horses that other people were trying to break in . Yes , they have broken in before because a new directory was created on my hard drive and it was all in spanish -LRB- that was before I bought either -RRB- . I bought 2004 hoping it would be better . It was n't that easy to install , menus where not very helpful , baffling to set up and it make the computer run real slow . On top of all that , it made I.E. even slower . My kids love talking with instant messenger , but it wo n't allow them with the firewall up , so I have to disable that portion just so they can use the internet.Don ' t get this program since you have to disable a few portions of it just to work right .
 I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them . I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out . After 4 attempted installs , I have finally given up . I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK , I had to use it 3 of the 4 times . During install , NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so . The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over -LRB- up to 1 hr , I then shut it down and used GOBACK -RRB- . The 1 time it did install , it did not work and had errors , I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself . I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer . NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year . Being a past Norton customer , I consider this to be a slap to my face . Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer . Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff .
 I have been sitting here for hours trying to install . Thank god for the other reviews or I ignorantly might have installed the thing from Symantec which would mess with my registry . The dang disc is going back !!!!
 I upgraded from Norton Anti-Virus 2003 to Norton Internet Security -LRB- N.I.S -RRB- 2004 online in August 2004 . Using this software is tantamount to cutting off the head to cure the cold . The N.I.S works so well that every single programme is filtered to the extent the computer 's processor is unable to actually run the software at all . My laptop is not slow neither -LRB- Dell Inspiron 1.7 Centrino -RRB- . It was unable to handle DVDs running through PowerDVD without freezing during DVD playback.Now to the most frustrating part ; getting a refund . I used the email non-technical issue response page - promising to provide a response within 5-7 days -LRB- five times -RRB- , in an attempt to get advice on whether all computers were slowed down - waited a week no response.I phoned Symantec -LRB- London -RRB- on a number of occassions , was put on hold for 20-25 minutes , then gave up . I did eventually speak to a woman , whom I believe was from Ireland . I came to the conclusion she would have been of more use picking potatoes for Symantec .2 months post purchasing the software I am still waiting for a response ! My only advice is use the firewall and security update available free from Windows Update -LRB- Service Pack 2 -RRB- . Coupled with the basic anti-virus from Norton this is sufficient . If you are still not content try McAfee 's own version which PC WORLD in the UK have recently put before Symantec 's attempt of Internet Security .
 Give me the virus anytime !! Is n't there a grade below 1 ? I bought a new machine with a trial versions of Norton virus and firewall . I then bought the NIS 2004 . When I loaded the new software , the machine would not reboot into windows and kept getting a `` NTLDR file missing '' message . Calls to customer service and tech support gave me the response that basically translates to `` tough '' and `` too bad '' . In other words , they offered not help or consideration that their software caused . Now I have to reinstall all my software and all my data is lost . Lesson learned is to back-up before any new software installation and not use a Symantec product again . Although they do speak english , their customer service is terrible !!
 The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with . When I purchase software , I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!I have to conclude that Norton 's software has some very serious KNOWN problems , and yet they charge $ 30 for support to fix THEIR PROBLEMS . Every representative I spoke with spouted the same garbage - `` the software used to cost $ 30 more , but hardly anyone needed support , so only those who need it pay . '' I do n't know who those people think they are kidding . Their competitors offer commensurate software at the same price -- they ca n't sell the software for $ 30 more in the present market.Those competitors also offer free support on their software . This makes them motivated to produce software that is n't buggy , since they LOSE money when they have support issues . Given the fact that Symantec MAKES money when their software is buggy , and given the fact that their software is a nightmare of glitches and bugs , I would have to conclude that they have no incentive to improve the quality of their product ; quite the contrary.After downloading and reinstalling the firewall 5 times over the last weekend , and after listening to this nonsense explanation for the lack of support that Symantec has coached its employees to spout , I came to the conclusion that they are NOT an honest company . I purchased and downloaded McAfee 's internet suite , because I knew that I could call their support line if I had a problem . Not that I needed to -- it was a dream to install and configure.I will never purchase another product from Symantec again .
 I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon . About a month ago , it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update . Even though I had 6 + months left on the McAfee subscription , I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 -LRB- NIS -RRB- . I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here . I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off . It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer -LRB- Pent4 , 256 RAM -RRB- . I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program . Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program ? I 'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus . -LRB- ... -RRB- In the meantime , I had another Windows problem , so I reloaded Windows . I have grown tired of the NIS slowness , so I reinstalled McAfee 7 to see if Windows was the original culprit . McAfee is working fine now , so I will not reinstall or buy NIS again .
 John W Thompson CEOWorld HeadquartersSymantec Corporation20330 Stevens Creek Blvd.Cupertino , CA 95014Dear Mr. Thompson , I had a perfectly functional computer before I installed Norton Internet Security 2004 for XP . Immediately after the installation of your product Internet Explorer stopped functioning . Removal of your product did not restore functionality . I reinstalled your product , brought another computer home in order to access the Technical Services at Symantec.com and followed the directions regarding fixing the problem your product caused . My computer still does not work.This computer has been nonfunctional for a week . It is strikingly inconvenient to have to bring another machine home in order to access Technical Support . The only apparent option is now to access your fee-based support . Your fee-based support has only limited hours . One wonders why I should have to pay your company to fix a problem caused by your product.I want you to know how frustrated I am with your product , its performance , the inconvenience it has caused me , and the disruption of my productivity . There is absolutely nothing you can do that would convince me to buy your products again . I will spend some time posting similar notes on the internet sharing my frustration.Sincerely , Chan R Beals
 I downloaded this set from Norton , and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download . I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues . I lost all my personal info . Their site offers no live help at all . I tried to call Norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service -LRB- tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC -RRB- or they have a $ 30 tech-support number . Who wants to pay $ 30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $ 95 ? -LRB- I also bought the back-up CD -RRB- . I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice . They said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $ 15 to `` handle '' and ship a CD ? -- and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails . This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support . After 10 years , I now downloaded McCaffee 's product after calling their support ... they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful . No problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers . I see many other reviews that say the same ... stay away from Norton , they do n't deserve you , or anyone !
 If I could give this zero stars , I would . Biggest piece of garbage firewall ever . The updates are a joke , and cause you to be unable to connect to the internet . Trust me , use McAfee , trust me .
 I installed NIS 2004 on the 19th of April and immediately experienced a drastic slow down in boot up speed and program access and I am using XP Home Edition on a 2.66 ghz Intel chip with 512mb of memory.On the 27th of April NIS stopped working in that I could not access it from the icon on the taskbar and after rebooting a few times the antivirus icon disabelled itself and no matter what I tried I could not get it to enable.My computer became very sluggish as whenever I clicked on the icon the computer stopped responding and I had to reboot . I eventually tried to change the settings and an error number came which I do not remember but which sent me to the Symantec site which in turn advised me to do a live update to solve the problem -LRB- did not work -RRB- or to deinstall the program and then reinstall.I deinstalled and my computer started to work just fine so I have not reinstalled and may not do so I am using instead a 2002 version of PC-cillin . Symantec should refund all users of NIS 2004 for this incomplete and inferior product or provide a fix and apologise for the problems it has caused to computers.I used previous versions of Norton and I had no problems .
 First of all , I 've been a `` Norton '' user since the days of Norton Commander - a batch file executor that pre-dates Windows . Over the years , I have been a dedicated user of Norton Utilities , then their anti-virus software with the advent of the internet . With the recent addition of a broadband connection , I felt the need to add a firewall so I chose the Norton Internet Suite . From the minute I loaded it there was nothing but problems . First of all , the program is such a resource hog that my Window XP based high end computer crawled along as if it had a severe shortage of RAM . The firewall was so persnickety that it refused even the most innocent of incoming data . After a week with the manual , at least ten hours customizing the settings , and numerous conversations in user groups , I gave up . Uninstalled everything to do with Norton and tried McAfee 's Internet Security Suite . Only tried it because my bank uses McAfee vs. Norton due to multi user configuration problems with Norton 's antivirus software on Windows 2000 based machines . Read the problems other reviewers had with McAfee , but I had to have some protection ! Granted McAfee 's software is not perfect , but I found that it used less system resources , was easier to tweak , and the firewall was n't obnoxious once you got past the initial flurry of warnings . These were easily dismissed once you taught the firewall which of your programs you wanted to have unrestricted access to the internet . Now , several months later , it continues to operate seamlessly . Never Norton again .
 Email in Outlook Express flat out stopped working after install . I have uninstalled and returning product after hours of lost time . Ca n't believe we put up with this type of service in this day and age . If you buy this product , hope that you have 0 issues . Online help is worthless and to talk to tech support is $ 29.95 a pop !!! That 's 1/3 to 1/2 the price of the product . Symantec does not even give one chance free.Never again . Thank goodness for 60-day return policy .
 Bought a `` boxed '' copy of NIS 2004 and installed it on an XP Pro machine without a hitch . Product has not given me any problems in the 4 months that it has been installed.Now , Symantec is another story . If you think you 're getting a rebate -- forget it . I have submitted two separate `` proof of previous purchase '' articles , including the CD-R from my old version . After 3 months my status on their system is `` No Reward Will Be Issued , Missing Proof of Previous Purchase '' . There is , of course , no way to contact them to clear this up . Sadly , they are living down to their notorious customer service reputation .
 I agree with the other reviewers about the negative impact on your processor when you install this program . It really slows down your browsing and when I uninstalled it , Explorer would n't function correctly - it became impossible to open a new window . I have used Norton for years , but this time they have let down their loyal user base with a poor product .
 What was once the best product of its kind has turned into true bloatware that slows down your PC and causes assorted other problems . On top of that , it has very restrictive activation requirements and Symmantec support is non-existance beyond the carefully censored stuff on their website . My copy went back.Do yourself a favor , boycott Symantec until they figure out they 're headed in the wrong direction .
 If only I had checked the amazon reviews before purchasing this . Yes it completely dogs your system making everything run slower . When it detects an intrusion an annoying pop-up appears . I 've set everything according to the manual and laughable online help but the pop-ups wo n't go away . A call to customer support costs $ 30 . I 'll be uninstalling this and all my Norton software and spending the 30 $ on a program that actually works .
 This was the worst piece of software I have ever purchased . It locked up my PC during installation , was a nightmare to try to run , and has been impossible to remove -LRB- and I work with computers for a living ! -RRB- - Symantec 's instructions were useless and their customer support is non-existent . Until it is removed completely , it ca n't be reinstalled and it ca n't be removed . . so it 's in a virtual loop . Do n't make the same expensive and frustrating mistake that I made . . avoid this product !!
 I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.I suspect I will demand my money back , which I have not done with any other software product in the last three years !
 Excuse me , but what is that smell ? Oh yeah , it is NIS 2004 , the foul stench of a failure . I bought this crap , TRIED to install it ... a disaster in it 's own right . . can you say REFORMAT.Needless to say this garbage ware is sitting on top of my garbage can ... right where it belongs , I will take the 70 dollar loss , and NEVER buy another Norton product again , If you are sure you must have NIS 2004 , I 'd advise getting it from KaZaA , even then , if it does n't work , you are not out 70 bucks . If it is cracked properly it will work like a charm :--RRB- DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP SOFTWARE , NORTON IS THE VIRUS , THE `` HACKERS '' YOU ALL FEAR ARE NOT THE ENEMY , THESE SOFTWARE COMPANYS ARE ... `` HACKERS '' READ YOUR FILES , BIG BUSINESS STEALS YOUR MONEY ... PICK YOUR POISON !!
 I am a long time user of symantec products and have bought several copies of Norton Internet security in the past.Upon reading that the plague of activation has reached this product I stopped the process of buying this new 2004 version for home and office.Thankfully there are still software companies who care for computer owners who like to update their hardware often and who would be penalized by the activation plan.As for the real software pirates they have no problem with it as they can easily bypass it . It is the honest folk who get punished .
 It 's good to see that Symantec is looking out for us all by not letting any website in that might be pro-gun . This includes the NRA . But if you want to read all about the anti-gun websites you can browse to your hearts content . Since when does anyone want to buy security software that tries to force its political views down our throats . No thanks Symantec . I wo n't be buying anything you make , ever again !
 I read how the buyers of this product watched their computers turn into processing sloths , bought a copy and watched my 2.4 Gig XP Pro processor slow down below the level of my 750 Meg 2000Pro laptop ! At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!So now , when we type , half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input , sometime by 10 characters!Symantec should give us all a refund and apology ! I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you.BEWARE !!!!
 I had been using Symantec Anti-virus for years and when it came time to renew they offered the opportunity to `` upgrade '' to Internet Security I bought based on how pleased with the base anti-virus program . What a disappointment ! It crashed my Windows 2000 system like it was a demolition derby ! The recommended fix , changing the IRPStackSize , did nothing to stop the crashes . I ended up disabling it and I wo n't renew again .
 I have installed NIS 2004 on 2 computers as an upgrade of NIS 2003 . Both installations failed and on one it somehow was set up without `` administrator '' privileges and can not be accessed to turn the Internet Security on !! And it will not allow me to uninstall without the `` adminstrator '' so I will have to reformat before I can reconnect to Internet.Both installations suffered `` corrupted update lists '' therefore would not update properly , but on the second computer I was able to uninstall and go back to NIS 2003 which always seemed to be a very good program.I have spent many hours trying to sort this out but am simply not prepared to give Symantec $ 30 to fix THEIR problem !!
 This has to be the worst software I 've ever used . My Outlook is all messed up . I regret ever having upgraded . Ugh .
 -- This is worst user interface I ever used . -- When full system virus check is complete -LRB- after very long scan -RRB- it lists ` at risk ' file and you must make decision to delete or skip . And you ca n't go back to change your mind . And once you delete the file , it gives you option to ` Exclude ' or ` Skip ' . I do n't know what helps at this point . This software is useless and confusing . Most of time , it failed to delete adwares and there 's no further instruction to delete such files . ---------- I do not recommend this software at all ----------------
 I know it 's important to have Net security so I was looking to buy some . I figured I 'd stick with Norton for 2004 , but after reading Amazon 's Wonderful reviews I think I 'll pass on Norton this year . I 'm sure scores and scores of people ar n't lying and they all came up with the same problems using Norton 2004 Antivirus.It 's scary to think you 'd have THAT many problems with an expensive and trusted brand.Because of Norton 's formerly good quality I figured I 'd stick with it again ; it worked last time.But , I figured I 'd check with Amazon because of their reviews , which no other web site has , and is a really great feature.So , thanks Amazon and the good reviewers for warning people.I 'm sorry Norton let everyone down this time , but I 'm glad the word 's out about it.I wo n't be buying NIS 2004 this year .
 This is the worst program ever made . 2003 version was so much better ... DO N'T BUY IT !!!!!
 NIS did not work from day one . It was virtually impossible to reach a live person in software support . Symantec 's voice - mail jail kept referring me to their web sight that offered `` A FREE FIX '' to a software package that never worked . The instructions on the website were very confusing . After printing all repair instructions and doing the laid out procedures the software still did not work . After many hours on hold I finally reached a live person in software support who told me he would not begin to listen to my problems until I had given him my credit card number and agreed to a $ 39.95 service charge . This person did not care that the package I was sold never worked.He did offer me an alternative he would transfer me to customer service that would refund my purchases price . He then transferred me back to voice - mail jail where I waited for almost an hour before I gave up hope of ever speaking to a live person . Being the eternal optimist I called back the next day to customer service hopping to get my money back . But again my patience wore out after over an hour and fifteen minuets without reaching a live person.My personal recommendation is not to buy this product .
 This is the worse piece of software I have ever installed on my computer . Do n't waste your money or time .
 Norton Antivirus is an excellent software . It deletes viruses and worms at hight reliability if Liveupdate is on . But Norton Internet Security may severely disturb the usage of the web
 I agree with everything that the other 1-star people are saying . I wish there was a NO star rating . WAAAAAY too many compatibility issues , and when I tried to go to online help , it gave me a million popups asking me if it should permit symantec to access the internet ? Sh-DUH it should!PLEASE DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.IT IS BAD.VERY , VERY , BAD .
 NIS is a package of several Norton products . Unfortunately , it does not give you the option of unstalling -LRB- or uninstalling -RRB- them individually . If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine . You can `` disable '' some of the individual components , but do n't be fooled -- they 're still there and running . Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam , it is still there . Every time I start Eudora , a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly . I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers . Just to try to shut it up , I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation . This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2 . But those 2 come up every time . And this despite the fact that I 'm not even using AntiSpam.Next , the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product
 Check not only this site , but other ` User Review ' sites regarding this product - 80 % or more EXTREMELY NEGATIVE . Even if the reviews were more positive , do NOT buy ANY Symantec Product UNLESS YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A NEED FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE - THERE IS NONE ! I have just spent 4 hours AFTER HAVING PAID for my firewall SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL trying to get my renewal activated . After going through 15 menus on-line to try and email customer service , I was given a form . I entered the info . When I finally got an email response , it had nothing to do with my question , then told me if it did n't help , I would have to REPEAT THE ENTIRE ON-LINE Process ! I then called their `` Customer Service '' line - PUT ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES ! Finally had to redo renewal by phone without answer to question . This is typical of ANY NORTON PRODUCT CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD !
 Have been a Symantec customer for over a decade . Currently a programmer/network admin during the day , Symantec victim by night . I wish I had read the reviews here before I decided to upgrade my new XP Pro OS & computer with Norton 2004 . After installing , XP I loaded the firewall and NAV - you want to be protected when downloading updates right ?? But most XP updates would n't install . Other software would either not install or I would have to run the reconfig olympics to get it to install . Norton 's software would also continually report errors and want to be removed and reinstalled - and since it either would n't un-install or install , XP had to be reloaded . I have n't seen an error or problem in these reviews that I did n't encounter.After two weeks & 5 XP reloads , following the last install of XP , loaded all other software first - NO PROBLEMS AT ALL . I may have to write Gates & Co. an apology . Who thought anyone would beat Microsoft for # $ * @ ! software ? After two days of blissful unprotectedness , I decided to install the firewall and antivirus again . Why , why , why ??? Have lost ability to install new software or updates , even with all symantec service unloaded - clean boot . Tray icons no longer work.Like another reviewer stated - the best thing about this product is the 60-day refund period . Link towww.symantec.com/custserv/returns.htmlSupport at Symantec - forget it ... Completely remove and re-install over and over - have n't been desperate enough to pay any extra for support - fool me once ... The truly ironic part of this is that the people I 'm paying for protection are doing what any one in a cast of thousands I 'm supposed to be protected from would gladly do for free - trash my system.Good-bye , Norton ... Hello reload # 7 .
 I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result ... junk software . Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly ? But if I installed either one of these Norton products , neither works after installation ? It can not be the computer or the owner , since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems . I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful . I am glad that I do not work for Norton .
 I had been a loyal customer of Symantec for years and have faithfully upgraded my Norton SystemWorks and Norton Internet Security every year . No longer . NIS 2004 simply does not work and despite this obviously flawed software , Symantec has set it loose on its loyal customers . I had upgraded my NIS 2003 to 2004 on a new computer I had built -LRB- XP Pro -RRB- and could not enable auto-protect . This software redirected me to the Symantec web site with a convoluted `` work-around '' that entailed clicking through to several cross-referenced web pages and downloading addition program to `` fix '' the problem . Even after painstakingly following their directions and uninstalling and reinstalling twice -LRB- including editing my registry -RRB- , the auto-protect function did not work . Also , it took forever for my new Outlook 2003 program to send/receive e-mails . Symantec 's web site says this is a known issue with XP and provides a link to a Microsoft web page to download a patch ... the page it references provides an update patch for Win 2000 OS ??? When I pointed this out in an e-mail to Symantec tech support -LRB- calls to them are $ 30 bucks a pop -RRB- they told me to contact Microsoft ... so basically there is NO FIX for XP users !!! Lastly , the new Outlook 2003 already has filters for junk e-mail etc. and does a pretty good job ... the Norton Antispam program , however , caused my Outlook 2003 to crash and there is n't a way to uninstall it unless you completely uninstall NIS 2004 !! I am so disappointed with Symantec I returned NIS 2004 AND SystemWorks 2004 to receive my refund . I got Zone Alarm Pro and McAffee instead ... both work great . If you want to roll the dice , go ahead and try to install this junk , but why risk spending hours trying to get it to work with minimal tech support and likely incompatibility with XP and Outlook 2003 ?
 I installed Norton Internet Security on a computer that is just one year old with XP . I use a dial up connection . I mention this because I have had all kinds of issues with my computer since installing it and that is what I am hearing from computer techs as well as others who are very knowlegeable . NIS does n't work well with dial ups . I ca n't get into the details page , I have everything installed that the techs at Symantec have suggested . I had to have both this computer and my laptop reformatted after installing NIS 2004 -LRB- yes two different cds -RRB- , and they work fine until NIS is installed . I find their tech support inept at best and will not be purchasing anything else from Symantec . I am sending in paperwork for a refund ! They have an anti spam folder installed on my Outlook Express and I have a friend who is in my address book , and OKED to receive mail from , and daily it gets dumped in that folder even though I have clicked `` not spam '' . I am unable to get to the display function when I am notifed of an attack , even though I enter the address in the networking , I continue to get notices from the same addresses all ready entered of attacks . I know this because when I type in an address , I am told the address is already listed . I was told to send screen shots of any `` bad '' pages which I have done but as yet I have n't gotten any responses . I have other issues but think you get the point .
 I have used Norton AV and Norton System Works for years . You can read the horror stories in these reviews about the `` New and Improved '' Norton 2004 AV , Norton NIS 2004 , and Systemworks Pro 2004 with their required product activation schemes . Last year I decided against Norton 2004 products once I found out about the problematic activation features . The fact is that the Norton 2004 products are not up to par this year and if you want to play doctor for hours with your PC then by all means go for it . For the rest of us here are some alternative solutions for internet security that I have found work very well on mostly Windows XP based systems . They are in order from the very best solutions to good solutions :1 -RRB- Norton Systemworks 2003 or Norton AV 2003 coupled with Zone Alarm Pro 4.x . - Install Zone Alarm Pro -LRB- ZAP 4 . x -RRB- as a novice user or get someone to help you if you are new to using software firewalls . Make sure you enable complete and full access to all the Norton programs of which about three or four exist in the ZAP settings so the Norton AV Live-Update works automatically . If you are now using Norton AV 2003 just pay for another year or two of subscription service . Broadband users can also use a hardware NAT based firewall router along with these programs to enhance security even more .2 -RRB- McAfee AV 2004 or -LRB- McAfee AV 2004 & McAfee Spamkiller 2004 -RRB- coupled with ZAP 4.x for firewall.-Same basic setup as solution # 1 . McAfee AV seems to use less resources than Norton 2003 does and hence your computer seems much faster . Just as with Norton , open up the Zone Alarm Pro firewall for the McAfee programs that need to access the internet for automatic updates . If you buy the McAfee suite do not use the `` Privacy Service Program '' since it is known to cause problems for some people . You could try the McAfee Firewall instead of Zone Alarm Pro 4 but I believe ZAP is a better program , but do n't use two software firewalls at the same time .3 -RRB- Norton AV 2003 or McAfee 2004 AV along with Windows XP Internet Connection Firewall -LRB- ICF -RRB- enabled AND if you use broadband DSL or Cable modem a good hardware based NAT firewall/router like the Linksys brand.-This solution with the Hardware NAT -LRB- network address translation -RRB- firewall router works well if you have a broadband internet connection . You can run a security firewall program like grc.com 's web based `` Shields Up '' port scanner and you will find that Windows XP ICF provides decent protection against inbound hacker attacks .

 This software out and out sucks . I installed it , I could see it on the desktop , I could see it on the hard drive , I could see it in the task bar . I could not open it . I could doubleclick all day long and nothing would happen.I went on to the Symantec web site , got caught in that circle , and it was useless . Found out the NIS 2004 was not supported , unless it was the `` pro '' version . This from the Symantec website itself . Shame , shame , shame on Symantec for putting out such a poor product.It took 5 minutes to download and install Trendmicro Pc-cillin . Worked perfectly the very first time . Guess where my money is going now . Should have taken the $ 70.00 I spent on NIS 2004 and gone to the casino , I could 've gotten a better return.Of course I probably could have had Symantec tech support fix it ... for a fee ... FOR A FEE !!!!!!!
 I 've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years . Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations . Even for computer super-heros it 's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.Bad : Buggy program
 Buy this software at risk to your security.This software was not ready for release ; it is buggy and incompatible with lots of applications . The new Anti-Spam appears very troublesome.I have had to uninstall NIS after a day of trying to get it to work.A search of their support knowledge base for NIS 2004 shows over 400 issues publicly listed . Lord knows what is really going on . Little gems like : It will not work with Outlook Express 5 , even though it says it will and does not check for this at installation.It will not work with Office 2003 . Migration issues from 2002How to uninstall 2004 -LRB- listed numerous times -RRB- How to locate the installation log for debuging -LRB- listed numerous times -RRB- Requires at least 16bit color at 800 x 600Incompatible with Nvidia softwareSince the release of this was a month after NAV 2004 , my guess is that someone panicked and threw a new product on the public in order to make the 4th quarter . Since their telephone support costs $ 29 per incident for a product that retails around $ 60 and is only available M-F , this is a new way to make money and lose customers .
 This was awful . The first time after I loaded it , I could not enable it -- it kept saying I did not have necessary privileges to enable it or to change the settings.After reloading it and spending about 8 hours on it , I finally had it installed and apparently working . Then I tried using the internet . I can not get a single site without dis-enabling the software . It is either so slow it keeps timing out , or else it just does not want to let it through.But the worst part is they do not support their own product -- to call is $ 30 , so I did not call . The on-line support is not very helpful . Is n't giving adequate support part of the cost of buying a new computer product?Best to get something else . I am thinking of scrapping the whole thing , counting it as a loss , and getting something else .
 I recently upgraded from NIS 2002 to NIS 2004 instead of extending my yearly Virus definition download contract.This was not a wise decision - the new version has a lotof unresolved problems :1 . AntiSPAM does not work with all mail programs -LRB- EUDORA in my case -RRB- . Each time I start Eudora , I have to go through two annoying popups . -LRB- No fix available according to Symantec support -RRB- 2 . I had to disable ` Privacy Control ' , because I had to explicetdly permit each e-mail address in the list to be send , until the whole message timed out .3 . Finally , I can not download the latest anti-virus definition files any more -LRB- LU1821 -RRB- . The fix suggested in the on-line support data base does not work . -LRB- re-install liveupdate -RRB- The on-line ` knowledge ' database tends to lead you around in circles and can be a waste of time . There should be an easier way to contact an actual person you can describe your problem to.I really do love the previous version of NIS , and wish I could back out of the new one easily.DO NOT BUY !!

 Loaded this suite on a newly built PC
 I am using Outlook 2003 -LRB- not Outlook express -RRB- , and have 5 separate accounts set up within Windows for each of my family.NAS came as part of NIS2004 . The Antispam bit is causing me a real headache , so be aware before you buy , here is the issue : When logging off one Windows account , logging onto another Windows account , and then opening Outlook 2003 I get the following error : Dialog Heading
 I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased a five user license ! I am a very experienced PC user who supports a number of PCs and has been active in the software industry for more than 25 years.My PC is running Windows XP Pro and Outlook 2002 . After installing Norton Antispam the boot time for my PC went from 55 seconds to 4 minutes and 35 seconds!Furthermore I could not import my address book as Norton Antispam could not recognise the Outlook 2002 address book . -LRB- By the way it is not corrupted as the Symantec website implies . -RRB- I was also amazed that it made no attempt to learn from the rules I had already built into Outlook for filtering spam.Fortunately I had made a System Restore Point before installing it so that I could uninstall it and go back to where I started.I wonder whether Symantec will refund my five user license?In summary DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT !
 Stay away from Norton Antispam . It looks and acts good to start but it degrades to the point that you will have to remove it from your system to keep the computer working.I purchased and installed two IDs of Antispam , one for a win98se and one for a win2k . Each has become very glitchy since installation several weeks ago . Especially on the win98se . From the outset there were slow operations , reboots and dumb things like the game freecell not being able to work.Today I had to remove it from both and will seek but probably not get a refund from Symantec on both CDs.The win98se copy of Outlook simply refused to function today . It would lock up the entire machine . ONLY when Antispam was removed from the system did Outlook function normally and the other slowed functions work normally.The win2k computer developed different symptoms yesterday and today . It developed `` Slow right click '' to the point that windows explorer barely functioned . Immediately after removing Norton Antispam the slow right click went away . As did other symptoms like slow boot . That was after I had spent hours trying to reconfigure administrative functions in win2k to find out what the problem was.It is possible that the automatic live update that Symantec offers introduced an update that made both computers become unusable on nearly the same day . Do you think I could find help on their website or on the telephone ? Nothing ! NO help at all.I am done with a desktop spam filter for Outlook on either win98se or win2k . And I am especially done with Symantec and their poorly written software in the form of Norton Antispam.Chris Samuels
 I installed NAS with windows XP and it would not work.After several e-mails and phone calls to their support desk in India they had me delete all my Norton programs -LRB- pc anywhere and Norton Antivirus -RRB- and run some patches and delete files and delete items in regedit.Now I get a 3 different errors when I start my computer , I ca n't do microsoft windows updates and Antivirus and antispam do not work . The support is very slow to respond and do n't seem to know what they are doing.I will probably have to reformat my machine and start again
 Worked fine initially . Then it deteriorated . Took forever to enter a posting into Norton Antispam -LRB- to designate it as spam -RRB- . Then inexplicably my e-mail on Outlook Express 6 got very buggy . Finally , I started getting duplicates , triplicates and quadruplicates of the same spam with minor variations , endlessly ; and Norton Antispam began preceding the sender information in every incoming e-mail , including my professional listserv e-mails , with '' -LSB- Norton Antispam -RSB- '' -LRB- as shown here , in brackets -RRB- . This resulted in my needing to delete the '' -LSB- Norton Antispam '' -RSB- when I replied to an e-mail posting . At one point I noticed that my listserv postings -LRB- professional group communications -RRB- had very sharply diminished in number . Ultimately , I found that Norton Antispam had -- apparently for my convenience -- segregated these into the Norton Antispam folder . There I found some 2,000 e-mails , all with '' -LSB- Norton Antispam '' -RSB- preceding the senders ' addresses . Many of these were my professional listserv messages ; others were the usual obnoxious scams and spams for which one purchases antispam software ; however , when I tried to click on the button that tells Norton Antispam that `` this is spam , '' I found it to be greyed out , and NONE OF THE MESSAGES COULD NOW BE DESIGNATED AS SPAM , apparently because they now had been funneled to me THROUGH Norton Antispam , like a gift . -LRB- I was , however , given the option to click on the button to indicate that `` this is NOT spam . '' -RRB- The wrestling with bugs in my system went on for hours and days , beginning with my internet service provider , going to Microsoft -LRB- where , for a fee , they helped somewhat -RRB- , and continuing with Norton . Norton 's customer support was execrable . On the final day of my efforts to get help , at one point I was on the phone for more than an hour , on hold . Support staff seemed befuddled , clueless , and ready to repeat what another support person had done that was useless , despite my protests . I was prepared to pay the nearly $ 30 they asked for their `` help , '' but balked when the last technician was ready to charge me an additional nearly $ 70 because , supposedly , a virus had gotten into my e-mail . I was n't convinced ; very recently Norton Antivirus had scanned my computer and found no viruses . I had to ask to speak to a supervisor because she refused to take `` no '' for an answer to this billing . Norton 's other products have so far worked well for me , incidentally.Finally , I disabled the Norton Antispam and deleted all messages with the '' -LSB- Norton Antispam -RSB- '' imprimatur . This has apparently solved problems for now , and I just `` block sender '' on the spam .
 To borrow the title of an Orson Welles directed movie `` It 's All True '' everything that has been said concerning the problems with this product - the sad part of course is that Symantec knows this product is severely flawed and virtually worthless on many if not most machines . Virtually worthless because when it works it is extraordinarily effective . The rub is that is gets tiresome resetting this software every 24-48 hours . Additionally , the Norton Suite `` Norton Internet Security '' is an easy match and perhaps exceeds the AntiSpam junkware . After two weeks of back and forth with Symantec I uninstalled Norton Internet Security and reinstalled Norton AntiVirus and Firewall 2003 . Both of these products are incredible rip-offs .
 Norton AntiSPAM is slow and crashes . I am using Outlook Express and the experience might be different for Outlook . But here is what I have found.With Norton AntiSPAM installed , my Outlook Express is slow at doing everything . Deleting an email takes four seconds when it used to be immediate . Switching folders also takes about 4 seconds . This greatly slows down everything that I do with email . Even the -LSB- Delete -RSB- key has become slow , although the -LSB- Backspace -RSB- key has not.The `` This is SPAM '' feature takes about 10 seconds to execute . It is so slow that sometimes it deletes the wrong message because a new email arrives in the middle of execution . Also , I crashes periodically . Symantec acknowledges that it crashes , but does not have a solution.By the way , I have a 2.2 GHz Pentium machine with 1GB RAM . So I do n't think my computer is the problem.As for the SPAM filtering , it works fairly well . I have very little SPAM get through . I have had no false Positives -LRB- i.e. good mail getting labeled as SPAM -RRB- . However , I do n't think it is worth the aggravation that the software causes.I can not believe that the same company that make the very fine AntiVirus makes the lousy AntiSPAM.I hope they get this under control because we need AntiSPAM solutions that work.Meanwhile , they have my $ 40 and are enjoying a nice mean at a restaurant rather that staying a work late to fix the problems.ThanksJohn C. Briggs
 Do not buy this product . While it advertizes compatibility with Eudora , it is not . It will not recognize Eudora 5.1 address files and subfiles as an `` Address Book , '' even though these are integral functions of Eudora , and suggests in the Symantec `` Knowldge Base '' -LSB- sic -RSB- that one reconfigure -LRB- hundreds ? -RRB- of email addresses so that Eudora will work with Norton AntiSpam . The `` Knowledge Base '' suggests that the email files are `` corrupted . '' This is not what I call `` compatible . `` Further , when spam addresses are added to the `` blocked '' list , the program does not block them . Pretty nifty , eh?Also , the `` buttons '' for `` This is Spam '' and `` This is not Spam '' that appear in the Eurdora toolbar referring to Norton AntiSpam remain gray , that is , unselectable.I would n't even sell this in the `` used software '' market ; I know I would be selling a `` lemon '' to someone else . It 's unfortunate that I spent money on it . Please do n't make the same mistake .
 I am running Widows XP Pro on a 2.6 Ghz Intel based machine . When you try to designate e-mail spam or not spam , it crashes Outlook express 6 . I have to reboot to get outlook express to run again . I visited the help web site and the problem was listed . The reply was that the problem was being worked on . That was a month ago , still no upgrade.I do n't know if they did any beta testing at all . To me the triaging of mail into spam and non spam is is a primary function of the program . If it were n't for this enormous flaw I would approve of it .
 This has been a known issue almost since the product launched and Symantec is aware of it ... although they seem to deny that it 's their problem.If you use multiple profiles in Outlook , Outlook will crash at startup with a Runtime Error message ; only disabling/removing AntiSpam will allow you to open Outlook.See here -LRB- http://www.nocrash.com/ncbbs/msgs/3478.shtml -RRB- for additional comments from other users .
 I had 3 cans of spam in my pantry . I installed this software in my dresser & the cans are still there . Enough said .
 As noted in many other reviews , there is a bug in Norton AntiSpam that is displayed every time it is launched for each user 's profile . Symantec has claimed in the past this is a Microsoft issue but that 's not the case . Search the net for `` AntiSpam + runtime error '' and you 'll see for yourself . Also Norton AntiSpam changes the subject and body of many messages to simply blanks spaces so I have to manually delete the e-mails anyway , so what 's the point ? I 'm ready to go back to SpamKiller , this is too buggy for me and I 've used it 6 months .
 It does not work with Netscape . Period . It does not stop SPAM . Use your money to light a cigar instead .
 What a worthless piece of trash . We experienced time outs down loading email 50 percent of the time running this program . The only way around it is to wait for the time out then turn Antispam off , get you email , turn Antispam back on pick the messages that are Spam , tell Norton , on and on and on-what a joke !! Want to fix it ? Good luck , you will not get any help from Norton . Why in the world would they sell something like this is beyond me . We tossed 40 bucks right out the door with this one . Uninstalled and back to the hand removal method , The most irritating part is we have since found out Norton is fully aware of this problem `` bug '' that allows stammers to lock up the system with a null character . If they know this , why not fix it !!
 I had extremely bad luck with this product . After installation Outlook 2000 could not connect to the server . When I disabled AntiSpam it worked fine . I traded several emails with the support team , but there was very little help or useful insight into what was going on . I have a pretty basic system . Brand new Dell computer and I am using Outlook 2000 and Windows XP . I do have a router between the computer and the cable modem and although I suspected an issue there -LRB- and pointed the support personnel to that -RRB- there was never any suggestions on how that could be the problem .
 I encountered frustrating difficulty with this product . It installed great and functioned fine -- until the next reboot . Then , Norton Antispam prevented me from getting to my mail servers . -LRB- This occurred on 2 computers , one with Windows XP Pro , the other Windows 98SE . -RRB- I checked out the Symantec knowledge base on its web site -- there was barely anything on Norton Antispam . I refused to spend the required $ 30 on phone support for a product that I consider deficient . It 's not worth a single star , as far as I am concerned .
 3 hours ago I installed this rubbish and I still ca n't access my Outlook mail . There is very little support apart from searching through tomes of databases and `` have you searched our FAQ 's '' line of help . I could have deleted all the spam I have received in my life in the time I have spent trying to get this program to work . Having bought the software there is no way to get my money back , so this is tantamount to highway robbery . No wonder there are so many serial hackers around . This program IS spam !! Crap , packaged in a nice box .
 It seems to have installed fine and it appears in Outlook . I am goig on day 5 having the software and I am not sure it has deleted a single thing . I have the filter setting on high.The worst thing about this is you cant contact Symantec at all . Well you could pay $ 30 to have them tell you whats wrong with their $ 30 software they sold you . No email support , nothing in the knowledge base , no discussion boards , just pay another $ 30 or you get nothing . Horrible support .
 It takes far too long for the program to block an email that you just received . It is not that accurate . I would not use it if if was free .
 There is a huge bug in this software and it will not work with Outlook . The Anti-Spam toolbar causes Outlook to shut down and an error message pops up . This happens every time you start Outlook for the first time of the day with a new user . The folks at Symantec have known about the bug for well over a year but refuse to fix it . They blame Outlook , but they are the ones who designed this software to -LRB- not -RRB- work with Outlook . This company obviously does not care about its customers and their problems . Next time I will buy McAfee or something and stay far away from this company .
 There is a known problem with NIS2004 and Outlook . Basically , they do n't work properly together and you 'll get a really irritating error message that closed Outlook down , you can then open it again when you try a second time . This means that EVERY time you want to use outlook , you have to open it twice as the first time says there 's a runtime error.Symantec are aware of this and have been for months , but you 'll see from various forums that they 've done nothing about it . They must be happy to just make a fortune from their very expensive support line -LRB- the only way of contacting them ! -RRB- . You wont be able to get a refund from them either , even though their product is not fit for purpose . You 'll need to contact your local Trading Standards department and commence Civil proceedings before they 'll pay you back.My advice - DO N'T BUY IT !
 As most of the other reviewers have already said , this might be a great product if it worked.I purchased and installed this product for a client based on the strength of Norton 's name and my positive experiences using other Norton products . But using it with Outlook Express produced the same blocked-up email problems that so many other people have noted . I started getting calls from my client daily asking why he was n't getting his email . The webhost claimed -LRB- correctly -RRB- that it was n't anything on their end . Disabling Norton Anti-Spam was the only fix.Symantec support was responsive but not helpful . They told me how to change the time-out on the affected email accounts , but this did n't help ... just took that much longer to get the Outlook Express errors . Support avoided all questions about how to return the product and get a refund , and seemed to indicate that the problem was on our end . Considering that I 'm a web designer and have almost two dozen email accounts , I do n't think I 'm an email novice.Even if Norton Anti-Spam did work correctly , it seems to hog memory , slowing the whole machine to a crawl . I really ca n't fathom why a simple email filter has to be so resource-intensive . After this experience , I 'm not convinced that any third-party spam-blocking solution is the answer . Spam-blocking SHOULD be an integral component of your email client , not some afterthought tacked on . I might recommend checking out email clients with built-in spam blocking tools , like Eudora -LRB- spam-blocking version costs -RRB- or Mozilla Thunderbird -LRB- free -RRB- , though I have yet to experiment with these programs myself yet .
 Symantec will not even admit that this is a bug but since I installed antispam 2004 , it crashes outlook on a consistent basis . Not sure which is more annoying - that this happens or that Symantec know that it 's there for the last 6 months & have n't even mentioned it on their support site .
 Do n't even think about this product if you use Microsoft Outlook !!!! Continued crashing of my machine because of this product clashing with Outlook has cost me well over the purchase price . Once Symantec addresses the problem , I would become a loyal customer again , but this product should have not been brought to market without proper testing . And as with Microsoft products , I do n't think the end-user should be the tester .
 I use some other Norton products , and have been relatively happy with them . However , the Antispam product is the very worst software I have ever encountered . It seemed to work for about 1 hour , then it crashed Outlook . Fortunately , Outlook has something built in to disable bad add in software , which is just what it did with Norton Antispam . Unfortunately , in the process of disabling Norton Antispam , Outlook also disabled parts Norton AntiVirus - what a mess . Do not expect any help from Norton either . They asked be for $ 70 to fix there two products . I passed . I had to uninstall both Outlook and Norton AntiVirus then reinstall to make it work again . Buyer Beware of this product .
 As many reviewers before I am experiencing this bug in NAS that renders the product completely unusable . On average one in 50 spam mails makes NAS choke , i.e. the e-mail download grinds down to a halt , and the only workaround is to wait for on average 15 minutes until NAS has `` digested '' that particular problem mail , or alternatively exit Outlook , log off , log on again , disable NAS , start Outlook again , download mail -LRB- then with NAS disabled no problems occur -RRB- , and clean spam by hand on behalf of NAS . The bug occurs not only when using Outlook or OE , but also when simply logging by telnet to the POP server . When following there the screen output created by NAS -LRB- NAS seems to add information to the header of the e-mail , and that can be seen in the DOS box when NAS operates -RRB- , for those specific problem mails it is obvious that suddenly NAS slows down almost to a standstill.I had asked Symantec tech support about this issue back in April 2004 when I had installed NAS for the first time , they could not help me then , and by today the bug is still not fixed -LRB- which is a shame - what do they have their automatic live update for if they are not using it for distributing patches for their faulty software . -RRB- Therefore I strongly recommend to everyone : Do not buy this product !!! There is a fair chance -LRB- as can be seen by the numerous comments of users with similar problems -RRB- that NAS may not be working as expected on your machine .
 When I read and bought this item , I thought it was suppost to prevent pop-up from Ads and Block pop-up , but it really did not happen . It still has pop-up ads coming up and not block spam web site . This things does not work at all .
 I am a sophisticated user with 20 years of PC experience and a very clean and well maintained PC . When I encountered an error with Norton AntiSpam 2004 and Outlook XP I was quite rigorous about verifying the problem . I uninstalled and re-installed the software . I tried various configurations . In all , I spent more than six hours trying to resolve the error ; I came to the determination that the error was a bug in Norton AntiSpam.I documented my findings in meticulous detail and submitted the report to Symantec . I can honestly say that I have never encountered more pathetic technical support than Symantec . I submitted three separate reports , and each reply was a canned response with cut-and-paste solutions -LRB- literally , I could see the ' > ' characters showing that they were simply forwarding me solutions from other cases -RRB- that had nothing to do with the error I was reporting . Not only were they not helping to track down the bug , they were not even reading my reports -LRB- in one reply , they said this was a known problem with Outlook Express ... when I had clearly communicated that the problem was with Outlook XP -RRB- . Furthermore , there is no mechanism for escalating the problem report . And phone support is $ 30 a pop.I ordered Norton AntiSpam 2004 before the earlier reviews , all of which report bugs and troubles , were posted on Amazon . Hopefully my review and the others will save you the troubles of this buggy product , and save you from the awful Symantec tech support .
 I needed a spam solution.I had Outlook rules that helped a lot , but I was sick of the spam . That 's why I got AntiSpam 2004 . But AntiSpam 2004 is not a spam solution , at least not a good one.It must be meant for people who get like 1 or 2 spam emails a week - and who do n't mind manually deleting them , to boot.The more spam I get the slower and the slower and the slower and the slower and the slower it runs . Adding emails to the spam list is painfully slow and I had to turn back on my Outlook rules because it missed so much spam.I would guess that AntiSpam 2004 catches 70 % of the spam I get.It does not crash my machine , as some others have accounted , but it regularly is running at nearly 90 % utilization making other programs run slowly , too . The more spam I get the slower and slower it seems to get.I am afraid of what it will be like given another month - I have only been running it one month.I was very disappointed , and when I wrote their tech support - no answer , unless I was interested in paying for the support . That 's the problem with large companys who hide their contact info . I figured I had already paid too much.Just in case you were wondering if my machine is junk , I am running on a 2Ghz w/1GB RAM . So , no excuse - shame on you Norton.One final problem , and what motivated me to write their tech support -LRB- again , to no avail -RRB- is that the proxy that AntiSpam 2004 seems to employ makes Microsoft Front Page and Microsoft InterDev and Microsoft Visual Studio.NET no longer authenticate successfully . I have to disable AntiSpam -LRB- and reboot -RRB- before I can use either of those tools.Problems problems problems , and the outlook is bleak.Two words for you Symantec
 Works great if you can get it to run more that 1 week . After about a week the tool bar disappears from Outlook 2002 , and the install program does not allow you to reinstall for repair , you have to uninstall - reboot - then reinstall again . Serves me right for buying a rev 1.0 of a program . I have reloaded this program about 5 times . Nothing about this problem on Symantec 's site , and I am not going to pay 30 bucks phone support on a program I already paid 40 bucks for .
 Installed NAS , no problems , then rebooted . Invoked Eudora 5.1 . Got the message `` NAS has detected that COM automation is turned off , would you like to enable COM automation ? '' I click yes , then close Eudora as directed and reinvoke - same problem . When I look in Eudora 's configurations , COM automation IS turned on.Went to Symmatec 's web site and did a search for the problem . There is an entry in their automated system about this and they basically say its a known problem with no solution at this time . They claim the problem occurs when you do not use the default folder for storing your mail files - I use the default.Bottom line - Symmantec acknowledges a problem with Eudora that has not solution . I do have a pretty yellow box sitting on my desk - AntiSpam my eye !! It 's completely useless .
 I installed this product on a new PC running XP and Outlook Express 6.0 . The product works great except for the ` This is spam ' and ` This is not spam ` functions . When ever I use them , Express crashes with no error and I have to reboot the machine to get it back up . The -LRB- I use this term very loosely -RRB- support web site acknowledges the problem but says it only happens occasionally . On my system , it happens every time . They have no solution for the problem . I also do not think I should have to pay for support that will cost me as much as the software did itself . I think the testing department blew it on this one . Oh well , that is what I get for buying version 1.0 . I would suggest that others wait for version 1.1 or 2.0 , especially if they are using Outlook Express .
 I installed the software , and after the first reboot -LRB- like another person here -RRB- I started to have errors where it would no longer download my email from the POP3 server . If I disable the AntiSpam software and reboot , it works again ! ALSO , it broke my Norton AntiVirus software , which still does n't work ! Norton not working with Norton - go figure ! Do not buy this , at least wait for another version so they can figure out their issues !
 I ca n't even believe Symantec would ship this in the condition it is in . Further , if it is so important to them to have some kind of antispam software in their suite , I ca n't believe they have n't put lots of resources into fixing it via their live update feature.Summary of the problems : It does n't work ... It 's not catching spam.When you select a spam e-mail that it missed and tell it `` this is spam '' to train it , it is horribly slow ... It just took an hour to process the 300 spams I received over the weekend . . This is on a 2.2 GHz machine , and task manager shows that CPU is the bottleneck ... 100 % CPU utilization for about an hour.It is not correctly integrated with Outlook . Whenever it processes a message , it triggers Outlook to think it is a virus accessing your address list . The best you can do is to tell Outlook to let it have access for 10 minutes at a time . In other words , if you get more than about 30 spam messages , you actually have to wait around and do a three step process every 10 minutes to get it to keep processing!NOTE
 -LRB- ... -RRB- After installing it I found that when I started Eudora I got a message saying
 Norton AntiSpam will correctly indentify Spam as -LRB- Norton AntiSpam -RRB- in your Inbox . It will not block Spam even after repeated messages from the same sender.Norton AntiSpam Tech Support will give a canned answer that is already in the users manual . They will ignore any questions not covered in the Users Manual.Norton AntiSpam is JUNKWARE .
 Every since I installed antispam 2004 , it crashes outlook on a consistent basis . Symantec has not even posted this on there website and there Support help is pathetic . The software is annoying it the worst ways . First , Outlook 2002 crashes every time you login to the profile and Symantec knows that it 's there for well over 8 months and has yet to neither acknowledge it nor fix it .
 How far the mighty have fallen.The Norton name used to be a gold standard -- you could buy and run such software with confidence . But it has been losing its luster since Symantec took over and with Norton Anti-Spam , it has hit a new low.I bought NAS based upon the high reviews it received in PC Magazine -- and because it came free in a rebated upgrade for Norton Anti-Virus -LRB- which , fortunately , is still worthy of the Norton name -RRB- . NAS NEVER worked properly with my routine Eudora 6.x setup . I installed , uninstalled , reinstalled . The NAS folder never appeared . The NAS toolbar was only half-functional ; tooltips were missing as were labels for the icons in the Tools menu . NAS could n't find my Address Book to import.Symantec 's tech support was useless . The advice
 I wrote this review a few weeks ago with the frustration of no support . Google groups finally highlighted the problem ! I recently updated to ZoneAlarm 5 -LRB- a free firewall software -RRB- . The group info noted that if you go back to ZA version 4.x , then AntiSPam will start working again . Sure enough - uninstalling 5.x and re-installing 4.x fixed the problem . So , ignore my previous review -LRB- except for the lack of effective support -RRB- . ============================================= I 've been using this product for the last several months , training it to recognize spam as I go along . Then a couple of weeks ago it stopped working altogether . All spam is getting through -LRB- about 50 a day -RRB- and pop-up ads are popping up again . There 's nothing in the company 's knowledge base to explain what happened . They 'll allow you to contact them via email only after you go through the knowledge based question & answer support . Unfortunately , it does n't seem to understand my question and asks for more information . I guess phrases like ` does n't work anymore ' , ` stopped working ' , etc. is n't in their vocabulary , but it wo n't get past the ` need more information ' request to give me any contact emails . I 'm very frustrated , even though originally I loved this product . Just before it stopped working , I recommended it to family members with PCs , but told them hold up for now . I tried reinstalling it , but that did n't have any effect . I 'm really frustrated and do n't know what to do ! So , get more info on this product before buying it .
 I am using a Dell laptop with Outlook 2002 . Norton Anti-spam does not work . It locks up your E-mail as stated in the many other reviews here . Exactly the same problem others described , turn on Norton anti-spam and your computer basically locks up not only having a problem getting your E-mail but my computer started going so slow . Tried to call tech support but they want a credit card number immediately saying they are going to charge for tech support . Then I tried to uninstall this piece of crap program and it would not uninstall . I finally had to restore my computer to a date previous to installing norton anti-spam . please do not waste your $ 37.00 Keith
 I tried downloading AntiSpam trial version to see how I like it , I noticed within days that when I download my email it has slowed the process down considerable . I use netscape and when I download my email daily -LRB- about 60-70 -RRB- it seems to bog down . I hope they decide to remedy this challenge . I think I 'll pass for now !
 I bought Norton Antispam without a moments hesitation based on a review in PC World magazine . That was a big mistake . IT integrates with Outlook very well and creates an Antispam folder that it automatically sends the spam to.Problem is you have to sort through it VERY carefully EVERYTIME you get mail . It sends all my good emails there too . Despite the fact the in the aformentioned folder you can press a new button titled , `` THIS IS NOT SPAM '' , which sends it back to the in box.I try and try and press that button over and over again on emails from the same address and still ... everytime they go straight in to the antispam folder . I even set it to LOW LEVEL DETECTION -LRB- one of only three choices . -RRB- Still no luck.I was happy with Mail Washer Pro and will now go back to it .
 Well , I downloaded the trial version of this program before buying to make sure it works well . Boy , was I glad I did!My first problem was that the LiveUpdate would not download the updates properly . Perhaps this was just a one-day bug with Symantec 's servers , but I 've always used Norton Anti-Virus and the LiveUpdate worked perfectly with that.The other major problem is with Eudora -LRB- I use Eudora 6 as my mail program -RRB- . Although it integrates itself into the program well , every time I load Eudora it asks me to activate ` COM activation ' and restart Eudora . When I click `` YES '' I want to activate COM activation -LRB- and I try to restart -RRB- I get the same message over and over ... Despite this problem , the SPAM filtering works . But where is the option to turn off notification in Eudora when I receive Spam ? I do n't want to be notified of new mail every time Spam comes in . Also , there does not appear to be a way to filter Spam into the Trash or any other mailbox than `` Norton Antispam 2004 '' . Overall , although it works , this program is far too buggy for use at the present time . It 's not recommended .
 I purchased this product to help with my unbelievable spam problem . I was trying some other spam software , but really wanted to have it integrated into outlook express version 6 . For years I have used Symantec products , believed they were of highest quality . Unfortunately , this particular one is not the case.After I installed this , It found some of my incoming spam . When you try to tell it `` this is spam '' OE will crash , requiring a complete reboot -LRB- Win2k even -RRB- . I have installed all the updates , and after reading these reviews , I am not alone.I now just forward all of my mail to my trash and pick it from there . Maybe I will look at other competing products , but wo n't blindly purchase protection products from Symantec any more.Sorry ...
 If I could give this software less than one star I would.If you dont beleave me read the 66 + messages tell you this software sucks too . If you really need spam control.I recomend just changing your mail client to thunderbird . http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/it's free , it 's fast , It works , has a great spam filter built in.If you really want to throw away $ 40 . heck just set it on fire.or better ye just send it to me . I have to find a way to get back the cash I spent on this pile of trash .
 First , let me say that the anti-spam features work . After the install , my spam dropped from over 200 message per day to nearly zero , with NAS 2004 accurately zapping the spam messages . My inbox suddenly became manageable again.Now for the bad news . My PC , a Toshiba laptop with Windows XP Home , had been rock solid for eighteen months . Rarely any type of crash or problem . In the 24 hours since I installed NAS 2004 , I have had a `` blue screen of death '' crash/reboot , numerous errors with the print spooler , and a couple of `` A serious error has occurred '' messages from various applications . Felt like I was back to using Windows 98 . So , with regret , I have uninstalled NAS 2004 . Maybe they 'll get this cleaned up in NAS 2005 .
 This has to be the most disappointing Norton product I 've bought . Norton Antivirus etc are great - but this product has been a disaster , and I 've had to turn it off to make email usable.Echoing another review on this site , Antispam was good for about a week . Then things started going wrong . Email download became very slow - emails apparently were queueing up to the spam analysis process , and nothing was appearing in the Inbox or the Spam folder . Breaking out of this appears to have meant lose emails.A couple of weeks later , Outlook started spewing `` Not enough memory to display this -LSB- message/reminder/window / whatever -RSB- '' errors . I could n't even list the email in my Inbox , let alone open them . My RAM is fine - and amazingly enough , as soon as I disabled antispam , the error went . I also spent some time with the wonderful `` Outlook crashes when you click the ` This is Spam ' button '' bug . Quality - although allegedly now fixed.I 've had enough of this product . I 'm an experienced Windows user with an MCSE , and my system runs well - with the exception of Antispam . I wo n't be looking out for Antispam2005 , I can tell you . Based on my experience , my advice is `` Stay well clear '' . -LSB- For reference
 DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THEY FIX IT . I use Outlook Express 6.0 and get hundreds of spam e-mails a day . For the first couple of months Norton 's Antispam product worked great . Today , it gets hung up processing messages . As others have described , you have to turn it off in order to complete downloading your mail . This makes the product virtually useless and there is NOTHING on Symantec 's support site about the problem . The Mozilla open source Thunderbird e-mail client spam filter is just as good , free , and appears to work better .
 I run Windows 2000 Pro with Outlook 2000 . Antispam 2004 does not work right when running with multiple Outlook profiles . Symantec does n't seem to be addressing the issue either . Lot 's of folks have raised the issue with them .
 Outlook 2002 stops connecting to the mail servers about 20 - 30 minutes after program start when using Antospam 2004 . Only solution is a re-boot . Norton 's support is useless .
 Faithful follower of Symantec until now but the error Bullock refers to below afflicts me and many others . Symantec wake up and acknowledge you have a problem !!!!
 This package has got to be THE worse software package I have ever wasted my hard won money on . First , it gets blown away by updates and service packs to IE and Outlook Express . Second , itlocks up on one of my email accounts every time . And now , it just does not filter at all . Flaky , Support is non-existent . You can email them and they say they might get back in 5 days or so . Great . You stole my money , never again !
 As an IT professional I 'm very familiar with Symantec 's consumer and small-office products , and while they 're not perfect , they 're generally solid enough to recommend to a customer . Not this one , by my experience . Installed on 4 PCs running Windows XP and Office XP , and had different problems on each . First , it 's very poor at finding your Outlook address book -LRB- to populate the trusted sender list -RRB- , if you have anything other than the most default configuration -LRB- forget about it working with multiple contact folders , etc -RRB- . Second , sometimes the Outlook plug-in -LRB- toolbar etc -RRB- wo n't appear until after multiple reboots , Outlook launches , and cursing . Third , sometimes the Outlook plug-in appears , but you simply ca n't run AntiSpam , and no error message is given . Fourth , if you do get an error message , you probably wo n't find it in Symantec 's -LRB- usually well-populated -RRB- knowledgebase , apparently because this product is so new -LRB- and obviously poorly tested before release -RRB- that very little relavent information has been placed there . Finally , when uninstalling , it blew up Symantec AntiVirus , which I resolved by finding articles reporting the same symptoms when removing other Symantec products . Do n't be surprised if your installation does n't go smoothly !
 I have been a Norton customer for years and expected AntiSpam to help solve the spam problem . Did n't work as promised . The program refused to allow safe passage of email when instructed and deleted important messages at random . Its installation also corrupted some of Norton 's own files , requiring a re-installation of the entire Systemworks package . When I contacted Symantec the tech admitted that they have problems with Windows 98 . They refunded the purchase price , but it was a bad experience .
 I have to agree with the majority of the reviews so far . I bought Pro to install on two Win XP computers . On one , it runs mostly fine -LRB- though Windows Explorer crawls occasionally , and there are problems scanning some long downloads -RRB- . But on the other , I ca n't get LiveUpdate to work at all -LRB- even after using ` Intelligent ' Updater -RRB- , despite following every single piece of advice on the technical support web site - and I suspect that paying for phone support would be similarly futile.This feels like a piece of software which has n't been tested to a useful level - get a fix out asap , Symantec , or you 'll continue to deserve to lose customers ! AV software needs to be rock solid , and this is far from it .
 I gave this four stars but now I 'm downgrading it to one star -LRB- or no star if that had been available -RRB- , because it made my system -LRB- WinXP Home on P4-2 .4 Ghz and 512MB of RAM -RRB- very slow , and the `` live update '' auto-updating feature did not work for months . This is a terrible program . Everything negative people said about Norton/Symantec products , which I used to like , turned out to be true in the case . Stay away , please .
 Have been a satisfied user of Norton Systemworks , Antivirus , Cleansweep etc for many years - this program has completely undermined my confidence in this company.The product activation did not come up with a valid number so I never got around to activating the program.Too many problems - will carefully check product reviews before buying Norton stuff in the future and probably just get an alternative.Norton should offer a full refund , or a free upgrade to an antivirus program that actually works , to anyone who bought this program .
 What a disappointment ! I was * very * happy with Norton Antivirus 2003 - it worked really smoothly and transparently . My subscription was ending so I thought I 'd upgrade to 2004 . BIG mistake . It completely gummed up my otherwise zippy system . Everything slowed to a crawl , from start up down even to ordinary text editing . I have no idea what it was doing , but I 'd type something and the cursor was in some sort of time warp , about three centuries behind . Navigation through a document was even worse
 My McAfee license just ran out , so I figured I 'd give Norton Antivirus a try . What a mistake . I thought something was wrong with my computer for a couple of days until I decided to try uninstalling Norton . It made my web access unbelievably slow , I 'm talking molasses-like .
 BUGGY ! Installation took more than an hour following the suggested full system san before and after . `` Post Installation Wizzard '' hangs everytime you reboot . Followed every suggestion on the help session , including uninstall and re-install in safe mode . Did not help.I have got far enough so it will now start EXCEPT `` auto-protect '' . Where is the point if the s/w does n't protect your PC automatically ? Am I suppode to allow my PC to be infected and manually scan and clean it everytime before I shut it down?Other than the on-line help -LRB- which did not solve problem -RRB- , help does not exist unless you are willing to pay per incident or per minute . Good thing I bought it with a rebate . I guess I would stick with it and wait for another product that will offer a competitive product rebate ...
 I recently upgraded to Norton 2004 Professional . It is so slow I am considering uninstalling the program . My Norton 2003 was great and did not slow down my computer at all . Unfortunately 2004 is DOG . My advice is to buy an old 2003 Norton . Of the 3 computers I own , it runs alright on one , a new dell . My 6 month old dell and my 1 year old laptop ca n't seem to run the progam very well . My laptop used to boot in 30-40 seconds and now takes 3-5 minutes . I find it hard to believe they put out such poor product .
 Do not upgrade to a new version of Norton AV if you have time left on your existing subscription ! Your subscription does not carry over to the new version ! Please talk this up , as I 've heard tons of people getting burned by this !
 Last year 2003 and this year 2004 , installation has NOT gone well . Last year I spent about 4 hours with uninstalls and with notices that I had a virus when I did n't . They never tell you you must uninstall the former versions before new products or you can have a mess on your hands . If you want support it 's by email unless you want to pay more than you spent on the product for live support.This is a letter I wrote to Norton today . `` I 've been using Norton for 10 years and the last two years have been terrible experiences in installation hell . I simply am sick of it and I have uninstalled Norton for good and have bought PC cillin and it was a breeze to install . No one wants to spend 4-5 hours on installs and uninstalls with safe boots and printing out endless pages of information from the Knowledge base which do n't solve one 's problem . I 'm pretty experienced in using a computer and Norton just is n't worth all that time . I know how to clean boot and move around the computer . I am so relieved to have the program off my computer now.This note you sent as part of my `` fix '' made me FURIOUS
 This is the most frustrating software I have ever used . I have been happy with Symantec products until now . Never had so much frustration loading a product . After following directions & deleting other programs , I finally gave up & loaded my Norton System Works from 2003 . Was getting very concerned that I would not be protected as I waited until an update was due and the software kept giving me an error message , and would not load .
 I have been using Symantec products for the 7 years that I 've had PC 's at home . Until recently I was running Antivirus 2003 Professional without a problem . Additionally , I downloaded Norton Antispam 2004 in April from the Symantec online store and was also running that software without incident . I found both Antivirus and Antispam to be solid software that functioned consistently.When my Antivirus 2003 Professional subscription expired a couple of weeks ago , I decided to upgrade to Antivirus 2004 Professional , rather than simply purchasing another subscription for a year to Antivirus 2003 Professional , as the upgraded software had a couple of new features in which I was interested.BIG MISTAKE ! I have never been able to completely install and run Antivirus 2004 Professional and , in addition to that , Antispam 2004 was corrupted in the process and no longer functions properly . I have spent nearly 10 hours -LRB- including time on 2 extended phone calls with Symantec tech . support -RRB- , gone through pages and pages of online documentation , and attempted everything that was recommended to me , including editing the system registry . All of this has been to absolutely no avail and tech . support still can not pinpoint the incompatability issue.Antivirus 2004 Professional will still not install , Antivirus 2003 Professional -LRB- originally on the system -RRB- had to be completely removed and deleted -LRB- and , since it was downloaded last year from the Symantec Store , is now gone forever -RRB- and Antispam 2004 simply will no longer work . -LRB- At one point in a conversation with a tech . support representative , he actually had the audacity to suggest that I install a log file which will monitor my keystokes and then upload the file to Symantec so that their analysts can try to determine the cause of the problem . -RRB- To add to the gall of all of this -LRB- which includes many hours of my time on what should have been a 10-minute installation and now having a system with neither Antispam nor Antivirus running on it -RRB- , I am now fighting with Symantec 's online store to refund the money I paid on April 21 , 2004 for Antispam because it is beyond their 60-day return policy -LRB- despite the fact that it was their own product - Antivirus 2004 Professional - that corrupted Antispam and made it unuseable -RRB- . Needeless to say , Symantec has lost a former customer of 7 years and tomorrow morning I 'll be out shopping for McAfee products.Symantec should not be selling software products with so many known compatability issues , a fact of which I was unaware until after I attempted installation.Stay aware from this product at all costs ! I would go so far as to say stay away from ALL Symantec products , given the inability of their tech . support respresentatives to resolve issues , as well as their customer service representative 's inability to satisfy customers who have issues that are a direct result of their own software 's failures .
 I 've always been using NortonAV , 'till now that is ! After installing my computer slowed down in such a waythat with every move i make i have to wait for about 30 seconds.Even opening my start menu ... It scans every single byte that goes into memory !! What is this for stupidity ? If i want my data on my harddisk scanned i 'll do it myself.Just scan my incoming data !!! They obviously are not thinking at Norton , or they are thinking too much.Why scan old files which are scanned before and did n't change afterwords ... Because every year they need to make new software in order toget more money out of your pocket and then it should do something new . like scanning data over and over again evenif the program already knows that the files are not infected ...
 If all you use your computer for is checking for viruses etc - its great ! If you 're being creative , maybe designing websites using Cold Fusion , - Forget IT !!!!! Slow is an understatement .
 I cant believe the amount of trouble and headaches i have been getting trying to use this product after the 15 day trial period . WHy is there a trial period for a product you have purchased . Neither amazon nor norton has been helpful in resolving the product code issue . They pawn the problem off on the other . I have been trying to return it but have ben unable . DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT !!!!!
 I bought NAV 2004 Pro a few days ago , and it has not been anything but a hassle . It does n't install properly on my Dell system , and Norton 's tech support is at a lost to why it wo n't work . NO HELP AT ALL . Buy something else and avoid the hassle .
 I upgraded from Norton 2003 , which was one of the most reliable antivirus tools I 've used . The 2004 version promised to catch spyware and adware in addition to viruses . To cut the long story short , I uninstalled this software and went back to the 2003 version . This is a perfect example of how some companies can take a great product and make a horrid mess out of it . The key problems
 I purchased this item and downloaded directly from Norton 's not-so-easy-to-use web site . Previously I had used Norton 2003 which worked OK provided you did not turn on their background scanning options -LRB- unless you like your quad P-5-Million to run like a 386 -RRB- Download went smooth . Shortly after the original download , the install started . Make sure that you 've disabled or closed every application and non-neccesary process on your system before you start . Make sure you read their included readme file as well to ensure that you do n't have any conflicting software installed . At first you 'll be asked to do a complete system scan to ensure there are no viruses that will interfere with installation . An hour or so later , the scan should be complete and you 'll be ready to install . Installation is relatively painless . Some files are copied , you 'll be asked to set up the software to your liking , and then you 'll be prompted for a reboot . Here is where it gets a little tricky.Reboot process seems to go along fine . Eventually you end up at the Windows XP user login screen . Click your name , and wait . Wait . Wait . Wait some more . Icons start appearing , slowly , one at a time , and then . . poof . . nothing . Complete lockup . So now you reboot and try again to see if it 's just a glitch . Nope , same thing happens . . this time it did n't get quite as far . Try it again , and you 'll see similar problems . Go on , keep trying . Eventually , you 'll get logged in , and about half an hour later , a blue screen crash complaining about some random driver will appear . Hmm.Finally , I managed to uninstall the software and bring the computer back to it 's original state with a little help from a technician.Two weeks later I decided I 'd try again just to see if it was a fluke . This time , installation went perfectly , well ... right up until the reboot , and then nothing . . well , nothing except for my background picture , followed by a total lock up . Safe mode did the same thing . Luckily WinXP has a boot to previous know good configuration option which worked well , and allowed me to login to immediately uninstall this useless software.Buyer beware . If you 're using this on a business machine , be prepared for a fair amount of downtime and lost productivity . Otherwise , just prepare for some serious frustration and a nasty headache . This is the last time I will ever purchase Norton Antivirus .
 Sadly , Norton Anti-Virus has finally become a poor product just like the rest of the Symantec line . For me , this used to be the only Antivirus to use , but after slowing down my computer to a crawl , even after deselecting the other components that Symantec has incorporated in this version . I do n't know what Symantec is thinking about but keeping loyal customers is n't one of their priorities so it seems .
 This program is a total joke . Minor problems include Live Update not updating , slowing down your e-mail download into Outlook Express , creating strange pop-up windows -LRB- such as `` your AOL Messenger has quit unexpectedly '' -RRB- , and generally making you more worried about viruses after you install it.Major problem is it really slows down your Internet speed and makes you frustrated . I had tons of problems getting streaming video from yahoo after I installed this program . Videos would stutter at first and eventually stop completely . Uninstalling the program resolved the problem immediately . Some websites also did not work while this bugware was running.A very negative user experience . I 'll never buy anything from Symantec again , no mater what rebates they pretend to offer .
 Similar to other reviews I went to upgrade my NAV to the latest 2004 version and it has just turned into a completely frustrating experience . I have 2 systems running XP Pro that I installed it on . One one system it seemed to install without too much of a problem . On my own -LRB- main -RRB- system the product will not activate or run no matter what I try . Live Update will not connect and I have gone through every single tutorial for hours with no success . They lead you in circles . I have even uninstalled and reinstalled it a 1/2 dozen times trying various options . Even uninstalling other programs that might be interfering with it ! Ontop of it , you have to pay another $ 30.00 to talk to them . I 'd be careful with this . I feel like I have totally wasted my money and now have to spend more just to get my system protected . I 'm warning you now that you could wind up completely frustrated with this . This software has some serious bugs to work out . Stay clear till they get thier `` act '' together . Thanks Symantec for your overpriced flawed software !
 NAV 2004 would slow my web browsing down at some sites , like Ebay , but not have a problem with simple sites . I finally found the problem listed at the NAV site . They say they do n't know what causes it , have no fix , but if you disable the scanning of Javascript -LRB- . js -RRB- the problem goes away . What garbage this program has become . They no longer test it before releasing it . Peter Norton should demand his name be removed from this POS .
 This is the 14 day trial!it does not come with a product key , you can download the 14 day trial for free from Symantec.I sent Amazon an email thinking for sure this was a mistake and they sent me a link to the Symantis website where i can buy the product key for another $ 69.00 This is a Scam !!!!!!!!!!!! Get away from Amazon.com Now !!!!!!
 I purchased and installed this software , but could not activate it . It asks for an activation key which Amazon says it does not provide . Symantec says it should install and activate , but it did n't work for me . Symantec recommends a telephone call to tech support , but the voicemail says they are too busy to take my call . The result is I paid $ 70 for 15-day Trialware . If Microsoft , Symantec , and others are going to require activation of software we purchase , they should at least make it an easy process . If you are considering buying NAV 2004 Pro , I recommend trying the CD-ROM version . I am awaiting my copy to arrive to see if the intallation is successful .
 Install script just says `` failed '' with no details . No help from their web site . Will try to return product . -LRB- Professional system analyst , not a newbie -RRB- .
 Do n't waste your money on this . NAV and NPF have always been quite slow , but at least up to 2003 they were tolerable . The 2004 version is slooooooow . For several minutes after I log in it does not let me launch ANY applications until it finishes launching its zilions of services . When I try to launch anyting it comes up with the message `` Application is waiting for a virus scan '' . I plan to take advantage of Symatec 's money back guarantee and return this DOG to the . Ugh ! Guess I will have to try MacAfee + ZoneAlarm this year .
 I have never seen such junk for Symantec such as this . I bought NAV2004 PRO . Activation is a joke for one . Two the software will slow you pc down to a crawl . How could they release such buggy slow bloated software . I really would not recommened this to anyone . I sent back the software and bought Mcafee . It rocks .
 I have a Dell Latitude C600 , not an old machine and wished to upgrade my Antivirus software . Because Norton seemed to be a reputable brand and because we use their antivirus program at work I decided to order this . BIG MISTAKE !!! After spending hours attempting to install , uninstall , reinstall , and self-serving myself to their `` solutions '' on their website . I had to give up . -LRB- And I 'm not a luddite at computers . I have set up a home wireless network , upgraded computers to Windows XP -LSB- I wo n't even get into that whole mess here ! -RSB- , and would rate myself as a relatively sophisticated computer user . -RRB- They charge $ 30 just to speak to someone and they only have live phone customer support during work hours on weekdays . Did n't it occur to Symantec that perhaps I 'm busy earning my living during those hours but might have questions about my HOME COMPUTER ??? I wasted time , energy and an entire weekend on this product . AVOID THE HASSLE AND TROUBLE . Take my word for it . Unless you want the frustration of going around and around with their website `` solutions '' -LRB- which they are n't -RRB- , you will end up vulnerable to viruses , spending hours with a defective installation process , and at the end of the entire ordeal needing again to decide on what alternative to purchase.NEVER WILL I PURCHASE FROM NORTON AGAIN . I have read the reviews of this and other NORTON products , spoken to friends and coworkers , and now have heard and experienced enough . And now - finally - I 've learned my lesson.I 'm returning this to Amazon.com ASAP .
 I have been using NAV for 5 years , and for the past 2 years I have had serious problems using it on my Windows 98 OS . Its `` real-time '' file protection feature thrashes the hard drive , and its e-mail protection feature has caused serious problems with MS Outlook . I have had to disable these `` features '' , and the virus protection has been a pain to use and maintain.It 's clear that NAV is catering to corporate environments at the expense of the home users ' market . This year , I am going with Zone Alarm for virus protection . Their firewall product is excellent , so I am hoping that their virus protection will play nice with Windows 98 . Wish me luck !
 NAV 2004 is fully stuffed with spyware ! Do n't waste money and time !
 This is one of the worst Anti Virus programs i 've ever seen in my entire life ! The thing didnt find a virus at all , untill its own exe files was infected ! How stupid is that ? No , if you wish to get some real anti-virus program , then i would highly recomment the Trend PC-Cillin wish hasent dissapointed me , my family or my friends at all . It finds everthing ! This Norton on the other hand , is a joke ...
 I 've been using Norton Antivirus for several years . It 's been pretty solid , maybe a bit slow . I thought an upgrade to the latest version would be routine . How wrong I was ! The product activation has a bug on Windows XP Professional that makes it `` forget '' that it 's been activated . And after you activate a few times , it locks out your product key leaving your computer completely unprotected . The Symantec knowledge base acknowledges the problem but cheerfully tells you they do n't know how to fix it . Testing ? What testing ? I think it 's time to get my money back and buy a product that actually works .
 I 've used Norton Antivirus for several years and loved it . But this year they decided to add product activation . I hit the bug a lot of people have hit where if you have windows xp and your system is a certain way , it will keep reactivating everytime you reboot until it finally disables itself . Symantec has no solution to this at this time -LRB- several weeks after they discovered it -RRB- . I finally ended up getting a refund -LRB- after going through about 10 phone numbers -RRB- .
 This is the second Symantec product I 've purchased over the last few years . After hours on the phone with Symantec `` support '' and more hours surfing their `` award winning '' support site -LRB- who gave them this award and what were they smoking ?! -RRB- , I vowed never again to own a Symantec product . -LRB- ... -RRB- AntiVirus may be a fabulous virus detection , prevention , and elimination product once you get it installed and functioning correctly , but doing so takes an absurd amount of effort . There is a conflict with a standard Windows XP update , so you ca n't even install without removing that update , installing AV , then reinstalling the update . Once installation was complete , I could n't activate it for no apparent reason -LRB- `` Not a valid A8Key '' -RRB- . Turns out AV could n't get to the Symantec servers , even though I could surf anywhere else I wanted to . No solution for opening ports or anything , you just have to call for phone support -LRB- limited hours , M-F only -RRB- . After 30 + minutes on hold , I had to read the product key -LRB- 24 alpha-numeric chars -RRB- then write down the activation key -LRB- 34 alpha-numeric chars -RRB- . Now it 's supposedly activated , but it 's causing issues with MS Outlook , LiveUpdate wo n't work , the icon disappears from the system tray , and I ca n't launch/configure the program once the icon is gone . Solution ? Uninstall and reinstall Symantec Norton AntiVirus.Avoid this product like the plague .
 First let me say I own a consulting company and am a Cisco Certified Network Professional and a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer.Second let me say in the last 2 days Norton AntiVirus has destroyed two windows installations on two seperate systems . The first system was a Windows XP system and the second system was a windows 98 system.The installation performed flawlessly , however after reboot XP was unable to find necessary system files . The system was viress free and stable before the install.The 98 system functionaled normally until a liveupdate updated the core package of norton antivirus , it then also refused to boot.The problems that people are having with this product are not from them messing up the install , they are with a legimiate and dangerous problem with the product.I have sent Symantantec a letter but they are already aware of the problem , do not dismiss this problem lightly or you may find yourself reformatting your computer.A software program should never contaminate or destroy an os , with this in mind I am not able to recommend this product to anyone .
 Installed Norton Antivirus 2004 Pro on 5 workstations and activated them successfully . 3 of the workstations kept bringing up a warning about configuration not being completed by administrator when a user logged in . 2 workstations did n't have this warning , but web surfing on those workstations became painfully slow . Norton on all workstations was setup exactly the same way.There is no free tech support for installation . Symantec puts out a buggy program and expects the user to pay just to talk to them . So you 'll pay $ 40 to buy the software and $ 25 to talk to them and maybe get your problem resolved . Anyway , 2004 pro is terrible in my opinion . Besides that Symantec wants to charge for installation tech support.If you need antivirus for your home computers use AVG from grisoft.com . I use this on all 3 of my home computers and have never had a software conflict with any program including games .
 Purchased this product as it represented a good value given you can install it on two computers.First tried to install on a Windows 2000 machine but could n't get the program to download the new virus definitions and other updates.Installed it on a XP Pro machine and everything went well . A few weeks later a message pops up saying the trial period is over and I need to activate the program . Huh ? I already did that.Anyway , I enter the product key and can not get it to activate . Call support and they give me a new product key . Try that and ca n't get it activated . Call again and they do a over the phone activation with me . Get a message saying the activation was successful , hang up the phone with the rep and start the program -- I get the same trial period expired message . Program is still disabled.Call again , this time do a automated phone activation but still no luck . Still looking for a solution ... Read a lot of negative comments on Norton products . Should have heeded those reviews . I 'm running AVG , the free version , for now .
 When NAV 2004 first came out I gave it four stars , but I now rescind that positive review completely . The program has been a total resource hog in the last two months and , to my great dismay last week , it actually missed catching a virus ! The culprit was the `` auto update '' thing which had n't worked for a long time ! This is the worst piece of software I 've come across . I downloaded a free version of Panda Anti-Virus last week and it was able to catch and clean the virus without a hitch.NAV sucks and I 'll never buy another product from Symantec again .
 I purchased this software package upon the advice of a friend , who said it is easy to use and trouble free . I will never buy another Symantec product . I recommend McAffe because it works.Let the games begin : I spent three days -LRB- about 12 hours -RRB- trying to get the Norton package to update the virus definitions , which are very critical for keeping the software virus library current . During my long journey , I worked with Symantec 's free troubleshooting website and went through every item which may allow me to use the liveupdate , touted to be simple by Symantec . Through it all , I completely removed the software and any evidence that Norton/Symantec exists on my computer , at the websites advice , then did a reinstall - Nope . I downloaded the `` intelligent '' update from the website - an oxymoron which I could not open . After many other attempts with removes and reloads , I called technical assistance.These tech assistance guys are bozo 's ! They referred me to the same web pages and procedures which I spend hours noodling through . After I told them none of it works they said they had a few other things I could try , but they would not tell me what they are unless I give them $ 29.95 for their fee based assistance . My gosh , this is brand new software!I immediately called customer assistance to get my money back . They have said they will send me an e-mail instructing me to destroy the software , and send them certain items from the packaging to verify my purchase so they can refund me . I have yet to see the e-mail but I will give them another business day.After all of this , as a farewell $ # % @ , I had to remove the Symantec product from my computer . This time everything locked up and I could no longer see my control panel icons . This forced me to reinstall and then remove the Norton anti-virus once again.Now I have dowloaded a $ 2.95 / month MCAffee service from AOL . It worked the first time without trouble . Thanks Symantec ! I bet you are filing Chapter # 11 soon . Investors and users beware .
 Do n't wast your There is nothing you cant learn from just useing quick books
 The Norton program is , as stated above , horrible . It trashed my hard drive . Their tech support is awful . Whatever you do , stay away .
 If you read most of the customer reviews about Norton Antivirus 2004 you will find out that a majority of formerly dedicated Norton users agree that Norton Antivirus 2004 and most of the Norton 2004 products are flawed . I have also used Norton Antivirus products for years and I would have to agree with them . Here are just a few reasons why I recommend that you Just Do n't Do `` The Norton Dance '' anymore : - Needless hassle of newly required product activation scheme.-Buggy and bloated software resulting in system slow down , startup problems , crashes and BSDs.-Non existent free technical support for customers.-Expensive compared to other antivirus software solutions.-Cost for renewing annually for each system is expensive.-Very difficult to uninstall their software as Norton programs infect your system files and registry like a weed.I read alot of reviews and the 2004 releases have been a nightmare for former Norton customers . If you are using pre-2004 Norton products such as Norton AV 2003 or Systemworks 2003 you could consider paying for another year or more of updates if you want to hold out a while longer . Maybe Symantec will get its act together by 2005 or 2006 . But considering that they already took their customers down this faulty trail in 2004 I have serious doubts that next year 's products will be any different.Here are some alternatives that seem to work well for Windows XP based systems if you do n't already have Norton AV on your system or you have completely and properly removed Norton AV , Systemworks , Internet Security , etc. from your machine.-McAfee AV 2004 . I use it with the McAfee Spamkiller and Zone Alarm Pro 4 programs it works great and uses far less of your computer 's resources than Norton 2003 or 2004 AV -LRB- If you buy the bundled McAfee 2004 Security Suite do n't install the buggy McAfee `` Privacy Service '' program and instead do a custom installation without it . -RRB- - PC-Cillin Internet Security 2004 is an antivirus , firewall , antispam product all in one . I just purchased the retail boxed version this Trend-Micro product online for about forty five US dollars and I can not wait to try in out on one of my machines . I have heard nothing but praise and positive reviews about it from people who use it.-Kaspersky Antivirus . There is a new version 5.0 AV product out that is suppose to be very easy to use . Kaspersky is a highly regarded Russian/European based antivirus company and they are more well known in Europe but are making inroads quickly to the U.S. due to their highly acclaimed security software products . They reportedly have a history of highest virus detection rates when compared to the other top antivirus software in the world such as McAfee , Norton , etc. . Go to their web site for more product information . - AVG Antivirus from Grisoft . I hear it works well and they have a free version that is very popular . It can be downloaded from the Grisoft web site . I have n't tried it myself but if I did n't want to spend any money at all on AV software I would probably use it.-Remember that there are many more good antivirus solutions that you can also try out that supposedly work very well -LRB- Panda AV , E-Trust AV , etc. -RRB- . FINALLY
 I spent all day trying to get an actual human on the phone after going through the huge maze of options on their automated telephone line . It took literally hours of being on hold trying again and again to get the right combination of options on their list . If you ever need customer support from these people plane to take a day off of work to sit on the phone being frustrated and aggravated and wishing you never bought their junk . They obviously do n't care one bit about their customers , once they have your money their attitude is an obvious `` screw you '' ! Stay way from this poorly run company , stay FAR away !
 I purchased this product as part of a sales promotion along with TaxCut , thinking I was getting a good deal . Was I ever wrong ! Within a day of putting this product on my computer , my computer crashed and had to be reformatted . The problem was it fought with previous versions of anti-virus programs -LRB- even though I thought I had completely removed these programs from my computer , remnants of them remained . -RRB- According to tech people I know in a major corporation , this happens often . In our department , in the last week , 4 other people also experienced this problem . Do n't buy this product !
 I have a 2.4 Ghz , 512ram computer with Windows XP . Once I installed Norton , everything on my computer was extremely sluggish . Once I uninstalled it , everything was normal again . I had kept it installed for some time though and AutoProtect was effective at detecting and blocking viruses or potential viruses from entering the computer . That 's the only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of one . I used LiveUpdate routinely and still , many viruses Norton could not delete or fix . Stay away from this program .
 The best antivirus program out there is available for free -LRB- AVG -RRB- . Nortons slowed my system down and mangled it to the point where I could no longer surf the net .
 I installed the trial version . After noticing that it severely impacted performance , I tried to remove it . The program does not appear in the Control Panel / Add Remove Programs list , so it can not be uninstalled using the normal facility . I sent an email to Symantec support , but so far I have not received a reply . I would hate to have to clean this thing out manually.Skip this program . There are definite problems here .
 I recently upgraded from the 2003 version for my XP system . I have never had signficant problems with Norton Antivirus until this version . Now every few days , the program gets an `` internal error '' which permanantly turns of the protection . The only advice on the web site is to uninstall and reinstall the program . See for yourself . Search the Symantec web site for `` internal error '' ; there are many types . I also agree with all posts that say this is a drain on your system -LRB- much slower startup , disk runs continuously , Internet Explorer starts slower , etc. -RRB- Save yourself a headache and do not buy this product .
 The makers of this crippled software should be hurt ... hurt bad . Even on the best system the computer is brought to a crawl . Want a fast startup and shutdown ? Not with norton . It can not even fix viruses ! It is however good at droning that my computer has 2 dangerous files that should be quarantined -LSB- but which for some reason are n't quarantined ... -RSB- . But that is not the worst ; it seems that norton is now learning from windows xp in using an activation key ... Your software is not even worth an activation key ! I have 4 computers in the house , all of which were subjected to the torture of Norton . Soon after installing it I had to reformat one ; and when I was finished installing Norton and it was in the process of activating it ... What 's this ? I ca n't use it more than 4-5 times ? without having to make a call to their nonresponsive center ? And the number one annoyance
 Like others , I have been frustrated by the problems that Norton Antivirus 2004 creates on my system -LRB- dual P4 1.7 Ghz CPUs , 1 GB RDRAM , so speed should n't be a problem -RRB- . It conflicts with several other programs , causes the system to hang , requiring a reboot , and is generally a pain . I ` vbe tried turning off some of the new scans it does for adware , etc. , but that does n't fully fix the problems . NAV 2003 worked great . It 's bad enough having to activate the product . I wish I had stayed with NAV2003 and bought another year of virus definition updates , as I may end up uninstalling this piece of junk .
 Time was you always upgraded your Norton Anti-Virus each year . It was a bit of a ritual but I 'm here to tell you that times have changed . I used the latest Norton Anti-Virus 2004 for a month and returned it to the good and very cooperative folks at Office Depot . Then , for some odd reason , Symantec sent me an e-mail and asked me to beta test their next generation program , Norton Anti-Virus 2005 . I did so and have no erased all traces of each of them off of my PC.Here 's the thing - it 's not that Norton does n't provide excellent protection - it does , no doubt about it , however at what cost ? I 'll tell you the cost - it 's your system resources . The 2004 version would routinely bring my fairly current system to its virtual knees . Now , this is because the program is trying to do the right thing . It now scans within compressed files AS they are being downloaded instead of waiting until they 've nestled into the confines of your file system . Great idea but lousy execution.Oh - virtually everything I writing about 2004 is true of 2005 . The differences are minor and I 'll briefly detail the new bits in 2005 at the end.A good example of very silly coding is how the program handled a large number of JPEG files , after they have been viewed . Using ACDSee to view a large group of pictures was fine ; until I closed the program ... only then did Norton proceed to freeze the entire system as it laboriously scanned each and every picture . If you open a folder with say 1,000 photos in it , you best be prepared to go get a cup of tea or coffee and learn macram&eacute; from a local community center as you wait for the machine to complete its AFTER THE FACT scan.Oh my - the horror . the horror.Anyway , the program does a top notch job of protecting your system from bad nastiness but you see , that 's the thing ... you can use other programs ... one that is free ... that does as good a job . I am now using Avast -LRB- available at www.avast.com -RRB- and it uses virtually no system resources , updates itself every day and scans all compressed files , e-mail as well as messaging programs , such as Yahoo Instant Messenger , MSN Messenger and AOL AIM . -LRB- It will also handle Trillian if you use that to combine all of these IM programs into one neat package . -RRB- Best of all , Avast is free to non-commercial users.What 's new in 2005 ? Well , it adds some Anti-Spyware capabilities and also bugs you to use your firewall ... or rather the Norton Firewall product . There is n't a lot different in the 2005 iteration but it is just as slow and resource hogging.And another warning . I had Norton SystemWorks 2003 on my machine when I upgraded to 2004 and then to 2005 . Well , 2004 and 2005 forced me to uninstall SystemWorks . That was n't a deal killer as I had recently found a MUCH better disk defragger ; PerfectDisk and the Norton Utilities were frankly a bit long in the tooth for WinXP . The problem was the SystemWorks did not completely uninstall . When I finally decided to rid myself of all things Norton , I found that it was almost impossible to pry bits and services out of my machine . Luckily I know my way around the registry and was able to root it all out manually but for the average user what this would mean is that even if you uninstalled the silly program or programs , it leaves certain services still running ... and consequently using system resources . You can see this if you peruse Windows XP System Services viewer in the System Administrator section.So that 's it . Norton is bloated as a poor dead pooch on a Texas highway in August , and trust me that 's not a pretty sight . And here 's a bonus observation ... McAfee is worse ! I tried McAfee due to a rebate that corrupted my normally innocent self but found that McAfee and Microsoft Outlook do n't play well together . This is especially true if you have to e-mail a large file . I had to send several large PDF 's and a couple of AutoCAD drawings and McAfee froze my system and would n't ever let them go . Even worse , I had to reboot to unfreeze the system and the files were deleted . Bad McAfee ... and I 've heard this from several folks I correspond with . It might not affect a large number of you but once again ... why pay for bloated , poorly coded monstrosities when you can use a really sharp program like Avast?Good luck friends .
 Let me join the chorus . After years of being a satisfied Symantec customer I am thoroughly disgusted by this `` upgrade '' . It will not install on a brand new HP running XP Home . The help is useless and confusing , the most likely result is trashing other applications that previously ran . After several remove and install attempts I am left without any antivirus protection since the pre-installed NAV that ran before the `` upgrade '' no longer runs . This product should be pulled off the shelves until it is safe to use .
 You can summarize the newest Norton 2004 products with these words
 This is my 3rd Symantec product that I have purchased . The other two I was very happy with . This one would n't install on my computer . The software asked me to reinstall it twice . My computer locked up completely . The online help is only good if you can use your computer . My fourth time of deleting the software I wrote to Symantec and they are going to try to respond in four to five business days . Considering Norton 's has always been good in the pass , at this point I would try a different product .
 The antivirus protection this product offers seems to be merely adequate . It is a resource hog and will slow you down big time unless you have a fast system with broadband.This firm did not honor their advertised re-bait for my upgrade . I sent them everything requested , and they sent me back a card saying I forgot the UPC . This is false . I am meticulous about these re-baits . Furthermore , I was ignored by their customer service . Amazon censored an earlier review of mine . Just make sure you photocopy everything . I think they count on rejecting a percent of the claims to pad their profits . I for one will look to TrendMicro or McAfee next time around . Very disappointing experience .
 I purchased the online upgrade of NAV 2004 . It asked me to delete the prior version . I did and now I have nothing . I can not download the new version . I have nothing to show for my $ 30.00 . Customer support is another $ 30.00 . I am sorry that I wasted my time and money on Norton Anti Virus 2004
 This software messed up my HP . I had to pay Norton to uninstall the software . I will not re-install this , nor will I purchase any Norton Products any time soon . I was very disappointed with this company that used to provide quality support !
 What 's worse , getting a virus or using Auto-Protect ? After a fresh installation of a Windows XP upgrade , and a faster processor , my PC was running great for many weeks . I then decided it was the way I liked it and installed Norton AntiVirus 2004 to finish off the installation.All of a sudden my broadband connected PC that normally loaded web pages quickly was excruciatingly slow . Hitting the drudgreport.com pages usually took about 3 seconds to complete , but had changed to over 2 minutes to complete loading of all elements on the page!It behaved this way until I disable the `` Auto-Protect '' feature . Leaving that feature on was as bad of an effect of any virus I could imagine getting caught with.Of course Symantec 's web site is of not assistance . Earlier today my searching would not turn up any information about slow performance -LRB- except to shift the blame elsewhere -RRB- . I found an Internet article that referred to a post that Symantec had on their site , but it was a broken link . Further attempts to use Symantec 's support web site gives me messages indicating the support functions are not operational.Also : * No time setting for automatic scans . I guess NAV is better able than me to decide when to run . * Non-administrator users on my PC get nagged to check for updates , and are then promptly told they do n't have access permissions to update . Gag!I thought NAV was the premier anti-virus product on the market : - -RRB- After Rebates , I got this practically for free , but I am contemplating whether or not it was worth it.How can they release this stuff ??
 I was never able to install this product . I had previously installed the trial version of this same product . Eventhough I uninstalled the trial version before attempting to install the non-trial version , after I installed the non-trial version , I kept getting the message that the trial period had expired . It seemed that I was still running the trial version eventhough I had removed it . Since it was a download version , I never received the activation code because it was supposed to be integrated in the program files . Therefore , I was never able to activate the product.Symantec support is not adequate at all . Though I found information on how to completely uninstall the product in www.symantec.com , after following the instructions and reinstalling the product , the trial version came up AGAIN . I wrote to symantec and after two weeks got a reply which directed me to the page I had already found.I finally gave up and decided to return the product .
 After numberous lockups , I finally decided to uninstall this work in progress . My only problem now is after re-installing my 2002 version I no longer have e-mail protection . One step forwards , 2 -LRB- 3 ? -RRB- steps back . SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO N'T UPGRADE !
 I purchased Norton AntiVirus 2004 and attempted to install the program on my PC and I got error message after error message . I finally got to the `` knowledge base '' and was informed that the reason it would not work on my system was because I have a Cyrix processor and there was no solution to the problem . Now I have to send it back and wait 8 weeks for a refund simply because it does n't like my processor , what kind of crap is that?I had NAV 2001 and loved it , but they stopped having the subscriptions for it . I 've had enough of Symantec all together , I am never buying another product from them again .
 New in 2004 for NAV
 Do not even try to use this product . I had many problems trying to get it to work . I followed all recomendations on their website . It still did not work correctly so instead of calling a 900 number and paying per minute to have them fix their problems I called my credit card company to reverse the recent charge to buy the software.If a company wants to automate their processes so much that they no longer give one the option to talk to a human being without paying for it , they better $ % ^ & $ # ^ well sell products that work well.DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE AND DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS !
 I still have n't been able to load the software . I meet all the hardware requirements , but the setup program will not launch at all . Not even an error message . Just the splash screen that lets you browse , etc. . Click on install , and nothing.Best of all , there is no way to get answers from symantec without paying more @ # $ % & * money ! Unless you are lucky enough to find your problem in their `` knowledge base . `` You might be able to figure it out on your own if you are computer literate enough , but I am not that fortunate .
 This is the biggest lie in antivirus software . This program itself is a virus . Stay away from this piece of junk . Norton will only take your money , ruin your system , and laugh all the way to the bank .
 I guess this software beats nothing , but not by much . I 've mistakenly buy this product for years now and have had my share of problems with it . this years problem is that it has this new product activation that we windows xp users have come to know and love . This is n't a feature or an option and it is n't protecting you the buyer . but it is one more little pain in the A$ $ that only symantec could dish up and get away with.You can also forget any help from symantec should your product find a virus or should you find the product stops working and it does at times . it 's going to cost you 39 dollars a problem to get to talk to a real person . I just had to do a clean install of windows xp to get my virus program back and running again because symantec did n't send out a clear update at times to its products . This happens a lot or so it seems . I just notice it more because I have more then one computer.If you can do a little research and take a little time you can do a lot better then this . your owe your computer this and the internet , but go ahead buy it if you think it 's going to help just let me say I warned you .
 OWNED THE PRODUCT FOR 10 YEARS . THERE ARE MULTIPLE PRICES FOR RENEWAL YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO GET THE LOWEST PRICE . THERE IS NO NO NO NO CUSTOMER SERVICE -- UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT BY THE MINUET AND PROGRAM WILL SLOW YOUR SYSTEM DOWN CONSIDERABLY -- GET READY FOR TONS OF JUNK MAIL.BUT THE ANTI VIRUS WORKS HHHMMMMMM OR IS IT MICROSOFT UPDATES ?
 This is one time that the big brand name purchase is a major mistake ! After purchasing this product on line and downloading it , I thought I would have protection with the updates , only to find out that when I changed my ISP , Norton Antivirus live updates no longer worked . After 11 e-mails most of which suggested the same failed proceedures , I have given up and will Purchase McAfee . I have McAfee on 4 units at work and they work fine . One of the benifits of spending money on software is the support that goes with it , obviousy Norton misses this point . This is one product that should be avoided .
 It will make your overall computer speed look like a snail . You will have to endure an endless booting timespan . There are so many issues and known problems in their library it 's not even funny . And you come to think there was a time in which this software was considered actually good . Trust me , there are way better antivirus solutions in the world , too bad they do n't have the same fame . Stay away from it , I beg you .
 My 2002 version of this program recently told me my subscription for virus definition updates needed to be renewed . So after paying online for the renewal -LRB- which has worked twice before -RRB- , I was given a key number that does n't work . I tried to find tech support for this issue online but it turns out Symantec does n't support the 2002 version -LRB- er , except for charging me for an unusable subscription renewal -RRB- . And trying to get through to their billing section produces `` all circuits are busy '' message . So I guess I 'll have to try disputing my credit card charge to see if I can get my renewal fee back from Symantec .
 I bought Nortons 2004 and it says that i have to enter the activation code but when i type it in the next button is not highlighted so i can not activate it ... it also comes up with an error and i have uninstalled previous version and other programs and shut down and restarted many times ... all i get is problems ... now i use another online scanner but i am just off to the store to try to explain this to get my money back ... wish me luck -LRB- i have used nortons successfully for several years so i understand that we all have different setups and something may be clashing with this new version ... i have also done a search on the error and nortons admit that there is a problem but as yet they havent got an answer -RRB-
 This has been the `` industry standard '' for anti-virus products . I 'm not sure why . It slows down the computer so much , that you think you need a new machine . What you need is another ant-virus product -LRB- like Avast -RRB- . The constant updates are extremely sluggish in being implemented . And what it does to the boot-up time is terrible . This is a dog . Save yourself a lot of frustration , avoid it .
 I 'm disappointed that it does n't clean the system of spyware and adware !! Oh why did I buy this ? I must have been on crack ! I should 've bought Spyware and adware removal tool instead of this crap . It would probably be good for detecting and erasing viruses but not spyware and adware , which I recently learn is more dangerous than viruses . Oh man , tough luck for me that I paid Norton $ 50 bucks of my mom 's money and did n't even turn in the stupid $ 10 rebate that came with it because it was to expire `` VERY '' soon . :--LRB- A sad ending to this product review .
 just try and renew your subscription.it never works !
 Norton Anti virus 2003 was a terrible product with lousy support . Anybody can post FAQ 's on their web site . What matters to people is speaking to a live person that 's not going to charge you when you just made your purchase.These folks just do n't get it ! So why buy the 2004 product !
 I installed NAV 2004 last week on my Windows 98 system , and activated it a few days later . This morning , I experienced an unrelated PC problem -LRB- no sound from my system -RRB- . Since I had installed some major software the past few days which may have caused the `` no sound '' problem , I restored my windows system from a backup I had made on 12/7 prior to the software changes . NAV 2004 was installed and operating prior to the backup on 12/7 . The sound returned but I was left with a more severe problem . Within a minute of windows starting , it ran out of memory -LRB- Windows memory resource quickly went to 0 % with a power on reset required for restart -RRB- . I have a 512MB system . After spending hours troubleshooting , I determined the cause was NAV 2004 . I decided to uninstall and re-install NAV 2004 . The uninstall using Add/Remove in Control Panel completed OK . The reinstall completed OK . However , as soon as I clicked on the NAV 2004 Icon on my desktop to begin the activate/reactivate process , windows memory resource started dropping like a rock until it was quickly 0 % . I restarted my PC and tried uninstalling NAV 2004 again . The uninstall did not complete because as soon as I enabled my cable modem -LRB- from standby to on -RRB- for the NAV 2004 uninstall to continue , windows memory resource drops to 0 % before the uninstall is even half-way done . A second windows restart and uninstall attempt results in an uninstall error message - a missing dat file . So I ca n't uninstall or install my copy of NAV 2004 - CATCH-22 . I have used NAV since 2000 and did not have install/unstall problems this serious with prior versions . I suspect the problems that I am now having are related to the new activation technology . My opinion right now is that the Activation technology is Broken . I recommend that folks sign up for another year of virus definitions for their NAV 2003 rather than purchase NAV 2004 . Forums and reviews on the internet suggest that my problem is just one of many with NAV 2004 .
 I 've had serious problems with Norton products and customer service is of little assistance .
 I purchased norton and they lied about how many computers I can install there product on . I called them they said 3 computers then after I had a computer crash i called them about not being able to register it . They said you can use on 1 computer only , `` When they said 3 computers on the phone '' I would stay away from this company and never purchase there products . Also bad customer support
 I was actually downloading a renewal it took forever 3 or more hours my computer crashed and a large no of spyware programs were included i ended up removing the norton from my system this was original software and installing a different software so not only did i lose the original software but also my money for the upgrade i am trying to recoup the cost of the download thru the credit card co what a disappointment
 I bought this product to replace the 2003 version . BIG MISTAKE ! Multiple attempts -LRB- seven -RRB- to download and install the product were unsuccessful . I had success downloading and installing earlier versions , the last being 2003 . Norton Antivirus 2003 is a wonderful product ; but the 2004 version has multiple problems that I , an experienced program downloader , could not overcome . I had to uninstall 2004 and reinstall 2003 in order to remain protected . Worse than the 2004 version , is Symantic 's appalling lack of customer support . Buyers should expect to solve all Symantic product problems without assistance .
 I got an E-machines computer with Norton Antivirus 2003 installed and a free trial period . I was looking for new virus protection but when I read the horror stories on Amazon and elsewhere , I decided to go with another product . When I uninstalled NAV 2003 , all appeared to go OK with the process but the network would not function afterwards . After two days of playing around , I managed to figure out that NAV had killed Windows XP DHCP process which assigns an address to a machine when the system boots . I happened to run across comments from someone else with a fix . Needless to say , I 'm more convinced than ever never to install NAV again . Hope I have a better experience with something else !
 I had a problem with installation even though my computer far exceeded the product 's requirements . There is absolutely NO PRODUCT SUPPORT -LRB- online or otherwise -RRB- . It makes no sense to buy from a company that does not stand behind their product .
 When I heard the 2004 release of the worlds most famous anti-virus software was upon us , a strange feeling of excitement hit me . I had always loved the software and although it had down sides , I could always trust them , with the reassurance of popularity somehow proving this . The protection which came with the software had always been amazing , and when installed , I felt pretty much 100 % safe against any nasty viruses or trojans which could creep on to my computer.Sadly though , having a lower end pc at the time meant performance was great , but terribly slow and I had to disable it every time I wanted to do anything else my computer that never made use the net . Start times were effected badly and I seriously was able to go toilet and return to still find Microsoft office still loading up . Although this may seem irrelevant , just bear with me . So with the new version quickly approaching , I was hoping that performance speed would be much faster and it really would become the best , as up to now , I had always thought the speed was too much of a compromise , but being new to computers , I wanted to play things safe.So just before the new version was released , I went out and bought a new pc , though not for the reason of speed or to coincide but I thought this would make my computing much easier and not so much of a chore . The selling point this time round , was the fact that Norton Anti-virus could now hunt out all spy ware related files such as dialers and had an expanded searching system . This seems a great addition , and on paper is ... but this is where things turn sour.Installation was quick and simple , and after registration I updated successfully and everything seemed to be working well . Though upon restart , I noticed how long it took to load and that was an immediate blow to what I thought of this new version . To be honest , the speed had n't improved and in fact got worse , at least for me anyway and I obviously was n't happy , and new it was n't the computers fault as I had just shelled out for something a lot better , and expected performance to be reflected . To test the new spy ware searching technology , I performed why weekly scan of ad-aware which found a few files , but I left them there and ran a Norton scan . Sadly , the spy ware went unnoticed which shows the software effectiveness ... So it seems the virus protection is still there and still as strong , but the new features are pretty poor , the software still uses the same resources and if you have a previous version , I do not recommend an update and if you do n't have a previous , I suggest you look as well for everyday virus protection . Lets hope the resource problem issue is resolved in an upcoming version ...
 I suggest everyone to sue Norton 2004 for what they did to their PC 's . My friend is gon na sue Norton 2004 big time for what Norton 2004 did to his PC . he had to reformat his whole system and lost his work and time . he is very anger at Norton.Im so glad I never touch Norton 2004 . Im giving this very bad review ... do not ever upgrade to Norton 2004 .
 First of all you can only install one copy of this bloated program on one PC , and they keep bugging you about updates and otehr subscriptions . Then , it does n't stop the latest viruses , plus it wreaks havoc on your system . I think this is the biggest virus of all time . Symantec is the most shameless company in teh world . I feel sorry for the legendary Norton name .
 I thought I was doing the right thing , by updating my antivirus from Norton 2002 to Norton 2004 . Boy was I wrong . Although I did n't experience the problems with the install that others did , I do notice an immediate performance slow-down of my computer . I have P4 1.6 ghz , 512RAM and I can tell it 's slowing my computer down . It may be worse for those with lesser systems . If you download programs to install , they vanish untill Norton decides their safe , which may be a safe thing if you have kids , but it 's downright annoying if you are downloading from trusted sites . It 's always running and scanning and refreshing in the background , monitoring everything you do online , causing glitches and pauses in your programs . It got downright maddening and , since it does n't uninstall properly I was forced to go into the registry as well as several other places to wipe all of it 's traces out , and completely uninstall and re-install SystemWorks to ` roll back ' to 2002 . My advice , get this ONLY if you desperately need it due to unruly teens or family members who share tons of files in chat rooms . Otherwise , for the smarter people stick with 2001 , or 2002 and keep it updated . This 2004 is bloatware plain and simple . We MISS you Peter Norton ! Come back !
 i have just bought NORTON ANTIVIRUS 2004 , but i think the passwords they give me is wrong , the password from the casingca n't see clearly , can u give me a clearly wan.thank
 I purchased the Nav2004 edition so I could gain the benefit of having background spyware detection.So after installing , rebooting . . I thought I 'd give it a test and download some known Gain spyware such as Precision Time and Data Manager.Nav2003 let me do this without any warning !! . . also when I scanned my system , it still did n't notify me of this . . After waiting for over 1/2 hour on their support line . . I gave up and requested a refund . . Very disapointing . . as I had hoped that I would have a good solution against spyware ... the bane of the internet ... So if you have 2003 , stick with it . . the new version is n't much better . .
 Symantec Corp is a vindictive company ! I let my Norton Antivirus subscription expire and the software proceeded to block my access to web pages with an error message such as `` user domain not recognized '' . Deleting the software from my computer was no easy task either since the program requires a product ID code to uninstall it !! Since the software was preloaded when I bought my computer , I had no CD and therefore no product code . It seemed the only solution was to renew my subscription . The solution to uninstall was found on a `` geek '' site . I have now purchased McAfee Internet Security Suite 2006 . Stay away from any Symantec product .
 I 've been using Norton AntiVirus for 5 + years . It 's been a decent product and keep my computer relatively virus free . For this I say thanks . But , this year I upgraded to Norton AntiVirus 2004 Professional . From day one I had problems installing and activating it . Finally , after hours of troubleshooting , holding on the phone , and re-installing I got the product working . Not that the support professionals at Symantec could help . They finally told me that they could not find the solution and that they would issue me a refund . I basicallqy rebuilt my system and got it running . I wish I had taken the refund !!! It worked fine for several months . Just last week I bought a new DVD Writer to back-up my data . Installed it with ease . Upon reboot , Norton AV informs me that my product has not been activated and that my trial has expired . The nightmare returns . I re-install , re-activate , and call for help . I spent a total of 6 hours troubleshooting it again . 3 hours on hold for the three departments -LRB- Online Store , Tech Support , and Activation Support -RRB- . Finally , a rep siad they 'd send me a CD because the downlaod version could n't be activated by phone , the only alternative when the product wont activate . Got the CD , spent another hour on hold and finally got it activated.Software has issues and sometimes we need support , but when a company decides to put an activation requirement on thier software but ca n't support it , it 's a shame . Some might say they supported it but I 'd rather have my time and money back and use a product that is n't so aggrevating . I would n't recommend this product for those that are not technically inclined , extremely patient , and/or willing to lose the investment when Symantec is practically unable to re-activate their own product . I will not be upgrading to Symantecs future AV products and would advise others to do the same . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 First , I had NAV for many years and all went swimmingly . Yesterday , I decided to upgrade to NAV 2004 , so I went to Symantec and downloaded the upgrade version . I am no computer neophyte , and I followed the instructions -LRB- written for an audience of third-graders -RRB- , and it simply would not allow me to continue the verification process , i.e. , the encrypted security key must have been SO encrypted even THEY could not decipher it.In any event , it also destroyed my registries for anything related to Norton products , rendering Norton Internet Security unloadable . And , I have no idea how it did this , but I could n't even get my e-mail server to respond.I went to the Symantec site , followed all the troubleshooting instructions , uninstalling , installing ; several times , and decided I had to contact a person . Oh , yeah , this you can do , but it will cost you . I will NOT pay for tech support of a product as problematic as this . I simply will no long purchase anything from any company that does not have adequate , PERSONAL customer support .
 I paid $ 54.99 for this product and it loaded and looks real pretty . Gee it would be nice if Symantec had put on the installation disk the lusetup.exe file . This means that the product purchased is worthless as you can not get Live Updates without that lusetup.exe file . Do n't bother trying to download it over a weekend , Symantec is closed for business then . Once you get the lusetup.exe file executed , you still ca n't get Live Updates , you either get error 1853 or 1814 or any error they would like to give you . I am returning the product for a more user friendly one , not Norton .
 You can get the same product directly from Symantec and it will include 1 year 's live update subscription . I purchased this product for the full price and there is no way I can activate it without having to pay for another 1 year live update subscription which should have been part of the product !!!!
 This is very popular but very poor software . It will slow down your system significantly.It claims to do it all , it does but it does it all poorly . If system protection is the goal , NAV is better than nothing , but you can get much better for free.Just go to Microsoft site auto-update and go to `` 1-2-3 '' and in step 3 go for one year free AV download , go here http://www.my-etrust.com/microsoft/
 I upgraded from NAV & PFW 2003 - Computer became sluggish and would `` pause '' every once and while . Boot time was increased.Internet connect speed was DECREASED by 32 % !!!!! NAV & PFW 2003 are some of the finest programs I have ever used-How can Symantec put out a 2004 product like this?Don ' t they beta test ?? I bought this productline because of my trust of the NORTON name.Emailed their support -LRB- twice -RRB- - not even an answer back.Things have really changed - this used to be a first class product and operation.I guess the 2003 products are going to be the last Norton/Symantec products I buy .
 I agree with the above . I 've used Norton for eight years with little trouble . Instead of upgrading I made the mistake of starting with 2004 afresh . Big mistake . For a start , I bought it as a bundle -LRB- Anti Virus and Firewall , both of which I 've used for years -RRB- and downloaded it . Worked fine for two weeks then decided it was `` trialware '' and would NOT let me `` activate '' . Hours and hours with tech support . Eventually one tech told me it conflicted with Roxio -LRB- CD burning software -RRB- so I deleted Roxio and Norton and started over with Norton . Same problemAlso , computer has slowed down a LOT.It sucks , I have to reluctantly say .
 I bought a copy of Norton Antivirus 2004 and proceeded to install it on my Athlon based PC running Windows 2000 Pro -LRB- Service Pack 4 -RRB- When I went to install the Norton Firewall that came bundled with it , my CD drive would not recognise the media in the drive . It gave an error D :\ is not accessible - incorrect function.I then uninstalled the product and the CD Drive now works fine again . Symantec technical support charge 29 Euros to speak to you about each technical problem.So their software screws your machine up then they want to charge you for sorting it out . Most would call that corrupt , possibly even illegal.I tried installing Norton Firewall after this -LRB- having uninstalled Anitvirus 2004 -RRB- and it had the same affect on the CD drive . ############## PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT ################
 Oh boy ... if you have Norton Firewall 2003 on the machine and Antivirus 2003 on the machine , you may be in for it . I upgraded to Norton Antivirus 2004 , and the Firewall software is now corrupted . I get the pleausre of going through the nightmare of deinstalling both products to try to resolve the problem . Makes me really confident when a software company ca n't get it 's OWN products to work together . It may be time to move on to the competition at this point -LRB- since I had the same problem with LAST years programs -RRB- . How the mighty have fallen
 I had bought Norton Antivirus product for my older Sony Vaio Computer & renewed it , there were viruses which got in & I had to format the computer.I had the recovery disk & I loaded the norton antivirus from it & try to update the definations which it did not do . I have a valid subscription till march 2005 . I wrote many e-mails but got no help whatsoever from Norton people & thus getting fed up I bought Bullgaurd which is working well.I bought a new HP preserio which had Norton Antivirus with it , The subscription would end on 12/14/2004 & so on Dec. 11.2004 I have bought downloadable version & for which a hidden cost of $ 6.99 was charged for Extended download service . Well I paid everything & since 3 days I made several attempts to download the program & I could not succeed . I am praying to god that perhaps I learn Hi tech coputer skills to download this program.I would adress this issue with various consumer rating agencies.I am fed up with this attitude , & computer generated response from Norton people . I have wasted lot of time in doing the same.I thus rate this program as Useless , & HopelessSanjeev Athale
 Symantec is so worried about software piracy that they have rendered their products worthless to those of use who BUY their software . You have to re-activate the product at random or any time you make a change to your system , and you only have limited activation attempts before it shuts itself down . Match that with NO support for the product and you have the worst combination of software available . A poor program with NO support from Symantec . I have tried to contact Sysmantec 5 times and have never received a reply to my requests . You can of course PAY extra for support , but when the software is BAD out of the box , you do not expect to have to pay for support . This program also will really SLOW down any system . All in all the WORST software I have ever purchased . Unless SYMANTEC gets their act together this will be my LAST purchase from them . Avoid this program at all cost . It is worse than what it is supposed to protect you against . It should be re-named Norton AntiConsumer .
 All I can say is , pray you do n't ever need to use Symantec support . I bought this program and installed it , then decided to upgrade my operating system from Windows 98 to XP . When I tried to reinstall the Norton product , it assumed that the software was a pirated copy and would not let me . Ok , I thought ... reasonable ... I 'll just get on their website and see what I need to do to reinstall my legal copy . Good luck . A maze of questions with no good answers on their website , and support email addresses where you submit problems and NEVER get a response . I guess I could spend $ 30 for their support line where I can talk to a human , but that does not make much sense for a product that I could buy all over again for about that same price . Dreadful experience .
 The service is terrible , they will not help you at all.It will not delete the viruses , it will not quarantine , it will not fix . I am very upset with this whole thing . Thank goodness for rebates at least I did n't lose all my money .
 product started to work great like other versions but soon started to go haywire . tech support was no help as each step of the repair lead to another problem . load after reload failed to cure what ails it . stick with the older versions this one is worse than junk . other virus programs picked up viruses not detected . they are fully aware of the problem but continue to sell the product even though they know it will fail shortly after 60 days
 Have had the same problems that everyones else had.My computer was so slow after installing Norton 2004 . I want my money back.It took over 20 seconds to open my browser.Other programs would n't open.Thats too bad I had Norton 2002 that came with my computer and worked great.now I have Mcafee Virus Scan , took under 2 seconds to open my browser , have n't had a problem with other programs opening either.Oh well you win some and loose some , just wish I could get my money back though.But I doubt I will .
 On August 30 , virus definitions say August 16 AND up-to-date -LRB- auto-update is turned on -RRB- . Rip-off outfit wants 30 bucks to help -LRB- no doubt they get the $ 30 even if they ca n't help -RRB- . I should have known that they 've got an average rating of two stars for a reason .
 Purchased this product and received and installed it on July 10 , 2004 . Took 6 hours to install , have it not work , uninstall and then diagnose problems etc. . Endless little hassles and it makes me think this product was not yet ready for release , but the company wanted to start people out on it so they could cash in . I previously had Norton Internet Security 2003 and wanted to upgrade to 2004 Professional as it advertised the spyware and keystroke logging interception . Well the 2003 version worked ok , but now it is gone with the wind , replaced by this new one . If I had known how much trouble it would be , I would have kept what worked and not tried this new one . I have Windows XP and you must uninstall the XP hotfix patches , install the Antivirus , then reinstall the patches . What a headache ! Well I think I have it working now but my system is running very slow , and there may be repercussions . Also , the instructions on the Symantec website for problem resolution will have you going in circles ! Buyer beware . Maybe they will improve this product at a later date .
 This version slows down everything . Even the hard drive scans are slow . Avoid this version !
 This awful program caused a fatal crash on my Windows 98 OS and I 've had to reformat my hard disk ! Thanks a lot , Symantec.Honestly , a virus itself could hardly have caused much more damage.Luckily , I keep back-ups of important files and the PC running 98 is no longer my main system . However , I am now left totally unprotected on this system and will probably have to reformat the disk again or mess around in the registry to get it off my system , as it wo n't uninstall properly.This is licenced theft and vandalism .
 Symantec is following Microsoft 's mistakes . Greed is requiring you to register . I am going Mac . This is insane . No one in the PC world respects privacy . It is enough that we have to buy crappy software to stay ahead of terrorists because of Microsoft errors ! Symantec now joins the club .
 from what i 've read , and what i 've heard from friends , nav 2004 only crashes on windows xp , and old comps with windows 98 are untouched by crashes , but still plagued by slowness . and i do not recommend McAfee unless they 've rewritten everything since 7.0 , cuz that didnt even find one of the 4 worms on my computer . i suggest norton nav 2003 , or avg free .
 We bought a new PC , installed NAV2004 , our new system crashed ... finally got it uninstalled , a nightmare , had to edit the registery , terrible support from Symantec ... taking back Norton and buying Mcafee . What a piece of garbage NAV2004
 Norton Antivirus 2004 should never have been released . You may not be able to activate the license ... and once activated it may not stay activated -LRB- and Symantec ca n't fix it -RRB- . It also significantly slows your web browsing and email , and may make your new system seem like the one you had 5 years ago . And do n't even think about doing something else while scanning your disks ... it 's a CPU-hog . I 've used past versions and they worked great -LRB- especially the enterprise version of Antivirus -RRB- ... skip this one .
 I got this product because virus protection is a must . Norton is supposed to protect against viruses and adware/spyware . When I scan my computer I will get a couple things of syware to pop up occasionally . Then when I tell Norton to delete the files it always says `` delete failed . '' Amazingly , it always fails to delete when I can locate the file myself and delete it manually . To get rid of spyware you should download LavaSoft 's Adaware . It is a free program that really works . Antivrus 2004 new feature is the ability to scan incoming emails . Again , it always tells me there is a virus and can not quarantine the file . What is up with that ? It ca n't repair it or quarantine or delete the corrupt files . The only thing that makes this program worth it is that it does at least let me know where teh file is so that I can delete it manually . This program also eats up a lot of RAM for it to only give so-so protection . There are better utilities out there and I will definatley not be signing up for a new license with Norton .
 This software recently came preinstalled on my PC with a free 90 day trial subscription to Norton 's ` pay-extra-for-virus-definition-updates ' service . First off , this service is a COMPLETE rip-off for the average user . The continued monthly price you have to pay to get the new updates will quickly exceed the price of just buying a new computer should the RARE case occur that you actually get a virus.Second , I chose not to pay for their service , but I still get ` reminder ' pop-ups from Symantec -LRB- maker of Norton antivirus -RRB- asking me to renew my subscription EVERY SINGLE time I connect to the internet ! These popups are worse than the virsus themselves . One time I was playing a game in a live online tournament and I lost the match because a Norton popup caused Windows to close my game and return to the desktop to show the popup.I 'm currently considering my options for legal action against Symantec and I urge you all to avoid the headache associated with these rip-off virus program . The new virus definitions should be free with the purchase of the product , not paid subscriptions . But at the very least you should n't have your privacy invaded by reminder popups if you choose not to pay for their service.Do yourselves a favor and avoid the headache by purchasing an antivirus program that is n't more trouble than the viruses themselves !
 ZERO RATING !! I have used Norton products from the Windows 3.1 days . I have used Norton Systemworks -LRB- NSW -RRB- and Norton Antivirus -LRB- NAV -RRB- since 1997 ... I guess from Systemworks version 1.0 !! My complaint is not about installation issues or incompatibilities with other pieces of software , or even memory hogging issues . Over the years I have learnt to fine-tune NSW to make it work for me . And in the 15-20 times that I have installed NSW , I have had to do only 2 manual uninstalls -LRB- NSW v. 2.2 ... I think ! -RRB- . A little painful , but I got it working.My complaint is that NORTON ANTIVIRUS DOES NOT WORK !!!! BACKGROUND : I needed some partitioning software . Partition Magic -LRB- PM -RRB- -LRB- Another Symantec product , though in all fairness I had this issue last year too when Powerquest owned PM -RRB- had just botched up a 3 step partition routine . I was trying to see if there was any freeware/shareware I could use.MY EXPERIENCE : I updated NAV with the latest definitions and proceeded to download . I downloaded this partition software and ran the zip folder through NAV . NO virus detected ! I then extracted the files and ran the extracted files through NAV . NO virus detected ! I ran the install , but nothing happened , I ran it again and nothing happened . I clicked on `` windows search '' and it gave me an error message . I suspected that I had been infected . I went to Mcafee and ran their FreeScan software , within the first 5000 files they had detected a few instances of Trojan Horse `` Exploit-MHTRedir '' and of a dropper program `` Multidropper-jz '' . I let the scan complete . I did not have a Mcafee product or subscription , so was unable to delete the virus.I was confident that NAV would pick up these infections and clean them out . I ran NAV scan , BUT IT DID NOT PICK UP THESE TROJAN HORSES . I was SHOCKED !! I thought , `` Hey ! Maybe Symantec does not update the `` LiveUpdate definitions '' everyday . Let me try using the Norton web-scan similar to Mcafee 's FreeScan . It scanned and came up with NADA ! Nothing !! I thought , well , let me just look up the virus library , pickup the definitions and apply them manually . This was the SHOCKER !! Symantec acknowledged the existence of these viruses and based on the dates of the virus definitions -LRB- April 06 , 2004 -RRB- , and my frequency of updates , I should have had protection against these viruses.I was in total shock ... I was living in false security . I had trusted this company to look after me and my data , but it let me down . I will NEVER , EVER PURCHASE a Symantec product again !!!! MCAFEE EXPERIENCE : On the Mcafee side , they had these Trojan Horses as well as the `` droppers '' and their variants listed in detail -LRB- compared to Symantec 's one generic listing -RRB- . On the Mcafee Scan , I noticed that one of the droppers was tagged to IE and so decided to go with a retail copy of Mcafee , I drove down to my local Walmart at 11.30 pm -LRB- I am kinda ' obsessive , compulsive !! -RRB- and picked up a copy . I installed it , but I could not get the latest updates.I dialed into their chat service and , WOW ! I was connected to one of their agents instantly . Within 5 minutes I had got instructions to uninstall Mcafee , download the latest definitions and run a DOS Scan.I followed the instructions and half-hour later , I got a report saying that 6 instances of Trojan Horses and dropper variants had been cleaned from my system . I Googled for the virus and noticed that the dropper could drop an instance each time a browser was opened ... that might account for the new instances!Norton Anti-Virus is USELESS . VERY , VERY DISAPPOINTING !!! NEVER AGAIN !!!!
 I do not recommand this product at all . There is a major design flaw with this product . As many other mentioned , it realy kills yours system . I installed it in a Windows 2000 machine with P4 1.2 Ghz but after the installation the system went to complet halt nothing was working properly and system was extremly slow . I had to reformat and reinstall the entire system and the NA only worked properly after I installed it in the clean system after installing only the OS . This the only way you can fix some of your problem you have with this product . They should have mentioned on the box reformating and and reinstalling all your exisitng software necessary before using this product . So for those who have already bought this product going through a complete reinstall might fix your problem.But if you are thinking of buying an AntiVirus stay away from Noroton 2004 at least until they will get their act togther and fix their problem . McAfee works pretty well and it is very performant as well.My last word DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
 This product was extremely worthless since it does n't load on my computer even though I meet all the stated requirements and am running windows XP . Look elsewhere for your protection .
 Norton AV2004 under Windows XP Pro turns itself off and you have to uninstall and reinstall . Have done this weekly for two months . It really is a hassle , but not as much a hassle as trying to get through to a live Symantec person on the phone . Their phones were hardly audible although the volume varied widely . Plus you have to PAY to get the product you paid for to work . BTW , sales people are ready to take calls , not so with service types.Not me . Any suggesstions for a Norton substitute ? This long time user has deleted and installed Norton AV 2004 for the last time .
 Buy an inexpensive broadband router such as the D-Link DI-604 -LRB- this is your firewall -RRB- and a copy of PC-cillin from Trend Micro -LRB- this is your virus software -RRB- and you 're good to go .
 Had Norton AV about a year . . it 's terrible . Has never caught a virus in advance , despite updates every three days . Takes over your system , nags you to death , and serves no purpose , assuming you do n't open executable email attachments from strangers . What prompted me to write this negative review is a `` feature '' where Norton reboots your computer after an update . . with no way to cancel after you have agreed to the update . I hit cancel , and the machine rebooted anyway ... ugh . get a clue , norton.Poorly designed , poorly engineered , and of little use .
 I bought this on Friday 9th January and demanded and got a refund the next day -LRB- not from Amazon , I might add ... but I am posting this review to give a `` heads up '' to people -RRB- . The Email Scanning did n't work and gave me an error message that Symantec had no info on their site about , and the AutoScan option kept resetting to Off every time I restarted my PC . There was a note at Symantec stating this was a known problem and they posted a `` fix '' for it which I tried a few times to no avail . The direct customer service was less than helpful . They told me immediately that they had to call me back due to a long phone queue and then did n't ring me . When I called again , I found the customer support office was closed.I wo n't be purchasing anything from Nortons again and have since chosen another company for my PC protection needs .
 I installed this last week and I 've already uninstalled it . This SLOWED down my computer dramtically . I 've heard other users call this program Bloatware and now I see why . I just downloaded pc-cillin and it is great so far . My computer speed is back up and I 'm happy again . I would not even mess with Norton anymore .
 After several months of not being able to renew my 2002 Professional Edition NAV subscrition , I bit the bullet and purchased a new 2004 Norton Anti Virus . It initially installed correctly -LRB- apparently -RRB- but after a week or son I noticed it was n't performing automatic scans , so I ran one manually . It identified some files that needed to be deleted which I did . Since then the whole system has been acting up . I tried several times to uninstall and re-install NAV 2004 with no luck . With info from the Symantec site -LRB- they have been no help at all and are obviously still denying there is a problem -RRB- , I have tried everything . I have even now returnred NAV 2004 and purchased NAV 2003 . This will also not install because of changes to files that NAV 2004 caused . I have serached and deleted all the files I can that were associated with NAV 2004 , but still no luck . I recommend using other products .
 Like most people I like to have the latest and greatest . I went out and bought Norton Antivirus 2004 and had some problems installing it . Once installed it was hogging alot of system resources . My computer slowed down drastically and my uploads & downloads were slowed down . It seems to be too much in controll of my computer . I tried it on another PC to make sure and same results . I went back to 2003 after having to delete some registry settings as uninstall does not clean up very well . I will never buy a Antivirus product from Norton again and McAfee is looking good right now . Unfortunately I can not get my money back .
 Unfortunately , I did not listen to the bad reviews and assumed this product would work just as well as the 2003 version . Shame on me . Three days later and the product still will not properly install . To make matters worse , just as I am preparing to eat the money I spent and move on to another product , I ca n't get it to uninstall ! To make matters doublly worse , Symantec wants $ 30 from me to call them and ask for help . To make matters tripply worse , I called and got a recording telling me to call another day -LRB- today is friday , that means I wait until monday -RRB- . NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY ANOTHER SYMANTEC PRODUCT !!! TAKE HEED FROM ALL THE REVIEWS AND DO NOT INSTALL THIS PRODUCT !
 I have been using Norton 's products since they first appeared . They have been excellent in all respects . I have used them on dozens of PCs and servers and recommended them to friends.NAV 2004 and its Norton Internet Security buddy have changed my mind . See the other negative reviews - they detail the many issues I have seen - huge resource use , code bloat , system hangs and blue screens even on Microsoft 's professional operating systems , email issues , no support , and , now add a buggy `` security install code '' to the list . 2004 is nearly impossible to uninstall completely once installed -LRB- see the Norton web site for details . -RRB- I have had to scrub and reload several PCs completely and delete the products from others due to the variety and severity of problems . Try Avast , PC-Cillin -LRB- the best -RRB- , EZ Antivirus -LRB- CA Associates -RRB- as alternatives . Do not try the full version of the McAffee product as noted in other reviews . Same problems as Norton . Finally , forget about free support from any manufacturer . No one provides it any more . Those days are gone forever .
 Norton has made good products for many years . Her old Dos Utilities were second to none . I rescued many a disks with Norton Utilities and restored systems with Ghost.Live update is aweful . One thing thats troubling is updates seem a bit late . MyDoom response was far too slow . The nice GUI and buttons and features many are just not needed and more for user entertainment . I guess really novice PC users like it but really it does take a good amount of system resources vs some other solutions . I dont care for McAfee much either . One I found that works well is F-Secure Inc. . They dont sell boxes in the stores but its a bit less bulky and they update really often . That lil Finnish company has been first on many of them . They have an auto updates through backweb . Its pretty nice . . Norton needs to get back to basics and stop trying to design its Av software like its a playstation game . My 2 cents . . But Norton Ghost is still greatness ! - Nate
 Norton is and will probably continue to be the benchmark for antivirus protection . The problem being , this seems to have gone to there heads ... If your system is running Windows 2K/XP you will `` PROBABLY '' not encounter many problems other than a drop in system performance ... on the other hand , if you are running Windows 98/se be afraid , be very afraid . DO NOT INSTALL NAV2004 ON WIN98/SE SYSTEM 'S ... . best advise , purchase the virus defintion update for NaV2003.of course this is just my informed opinion , I have installed over 30 copies for our clients and this is what I have found in a real world situation . .
 That expense is making your computer run slow ... and I mean very SLOW ! A free 90 day subscription of this program came installed on the new computer that I just bought . To give you a small comparison between this program and the AVG Anti-Virus program ... With AVG installed on my computer I can scan my system for viruses , watch a movie with PowerDVD off of my hard drive , compress and install a DVD movie to my hard drive , and load two graphics intensive webpages all at the same time with nary a slowdown.With Norton installed ; my computer takes longer to boot , will barely run my internet browser when doing a system scan , will barely run any third program while using PowerDVD and the internet simultaneously , and it just does n't seem as fast even when using Windows Explorer.I 've used Norton Antivirus in the past on different computers , and it does stop viruses very well . But if you 're looking for a program that does all that but does n't bog your system down in the meantime ; I 'd highly recommend that you do some reading up on the competition . I did , and now I know first hand that this program is indeed a serious system hog .
 I 've used Norton antivirus on ME and did n't have any problems , but when I changed to XP everything that could go wrong went wrong and the reason was Norton antivirus , it just does n't seem to work right with XP . My system was running at a snails pace , and just would n't act right . Could n't find out what was wrong with my computer it was working fine and then it was n't . I tried everything to fix it and then started thinking about the time that all the trouble started . It was just after Norton Antivirus was installed , I removed Norton and the computer was back to normal , on line working great . I changed over to another Antivirus and everything now is working great again .
 I work in a small office and loaded Norton Antivirus 2004 on our four computers . It SERIOUSLY affected the performance of every one of our machines . My PC was nearly unusable so I ended up having to remove Norton . My computer froze in the middle of this process and we ended up having to get a computer expert in to fix everything.I have been using Norton for five years and never experienced any problems at all until this 2004 release . DO NOT BUY IT !
 The first time I suspected that my computer was infected with a virus , I downloaded the trial version of NAV from the Symantec website . After scanning my drives NAV reported back that it had not found anything . Unfortunately , I could no longer access the CD/DVD drive , the A
 Most disappointed with this particular version . Have used Norton A/V for 5 years with few problems . Was unable to complete installation of Norton A/V in that I could never get the windows page which would allow one to install the activation code . Had 3 separate telephone calls in the course of 3 days with Symantec Priority Care Support -LRB- Ticket # 1637215 -RRB- , each tech advised that I had to re-enter a `` target code '' into the properties code ; this coding was a fairly long string of characters and I requested and each tech agreed to send an email with the code string within which would allow a copy and paste . Was assured that the email would be sent within 20 minutes . After waiting 5 days , decided it was time stop wasting time and accept the fact that my money was poorly spent . Now a proud owner of McAfee Virus Scan Pro .
 i am by no means a computer expert , but most software and hardware nowadays should be plug and play . i 've never encountered anything that just does n't even properly install until i purchased norton antivirus 2004 . i tried installing it on my laptop - no go ! i tried installing it on my desktop - nothing . what a waste of $ 50 ! and symantec wants me to pay $ 30 for live technical support - i do n't think so . by the way , mcafee installed on both machines the first try and i was done in 20 minutes . i 'm boycotting symantec products from this day on .
 i am really sorry i did not read the reviews before buying this product . i have been a norton user for a long time but this product has really turned me off . i am running windows xp professional and this product only runs half the time . most times it crashes on bootup and has caused problems with other programs . sometimes the crash also seems to screw up my video memory . a trip to the support web site is no help if you can get it to respond at all . last week it decided i was not registered and then refused to run -LRB- anyone have a lawyer handy ? -RRB- . a call -LRB- the only way you can do it -RRB- turned up product support is closed on the weekend . looks like they spent all their effort trying to copy protect this product rather than making one that works . do not waste your money . if you have norton 2003 stick with it or try something else .
 After installation , I activate my product through internet and the product shows it is activated . However , the product always show it is not activated after reboot and I have to activate it again and again .
 I spent the better part of a day trying to get this program to work , without success . There was a `` setup error '' that suggested I go to the Tech Support site . I spent several hours following the links and instructions , without success . This included about fifteen to twenty reconfigurations , computer shutdowns , uninstalls , reinstalls and other instruction followings . Automated website troubleshooting -LRB- which did not work -RRB- is free . To speak live to someone about your new product , you have to pay a fee of $ 29.95 per encounter ! I had NAV 2003 previously , and had no problems with that older version .
 I downloaded the free trial of Norton AntiViurs 2004 and in 30 minutes got sick of it.It needs 64 MB of RAM , what the heck is that ?! That 's disgusting.It slowed down my computer , and I got so sick of it , I uninstalled the program . Then , you 'll never beleive what happened . Programs would n't work.After uninstalling Norton ... Help wound not load , System Restore would not load , The Program Compatabillity Agent would not load.After clicking on these items the cursor would show the hourglass for a second , and low and behold , after waiting 5 minutes , my program would n't open up . It just refused to load , as if they were deleted.I got so sick of this I ended up reformatting my Hard Drive , and reinstalling Windows XP Home Edition , and then put in McAfee and now my computer works great ! : - -RRB- Norton , is nothing but a big bulky , resource hog . And all the gold colors get annoying . It 's probobly all gold like that because Mr. Norton is conceited and thinks '' Hey , the whole world likes my AV software best , even though it 's a pain , I think I 'll paint gold all over it as if to show off that I 'm # 1 '' Please.Norton is too expensive a product to be wasting your computer on .
 Absolutely do not buy this product . First , though you KNOW it IS be compatible with your machine it decides to do a system `` check '' to make sure you really are compatible at install time . If it does n't like you or your machine , it wo n't install . I ca n't install it ; so I tried to Customer Service to help me get it to install . After almost an hour on the phone trying to get in contact with customer service -LRB- which they wanted me to pay for -- they should pay for my cell phone bill -RRB- . They told me in three words or less that this product wo n't work on my machine . -LRB- This was after they spent ten minutes of my time collecting information -- after the hour wait on the phone and being hung up on . -RRB- Obviously unless you have the perfect PC , you ca n't have this product and they wo n't help you -- they do n't care .
 Upon installation of your Norton Antivirus 2004 , which took a total of 3 hours . . given all the messages , incessant scan and defrag attempts , etc. etc from this software , I no longer can access MS Word or any other application thanks to the problems starting with the Installation of Norton AntiVirus . I am held hostage to a host of Norton antivirus messages that wo n't go away , despite registering and a successful installation confirmation . It always wants to scan and defrag my system , it somehow uninstalled Microsoft 2000 version , leaving me with version 98 , the Word icon when I clicked on it exploded into some kind of configuration which looks like a `` tinker toy '' icon now ! Same with PowerPoint icon . What is going on ??!! What did this software do to my computer ???!! Now I have to hire a computer tech to undo the damage this software has done to my computer ... and who do I backcharge for the cost of undoing this holy mess from Norton ?!! Norton ??? I have work to do now I ca n't use my computer . Thanks for this TROJAN HORSE !!! I ca n't even access any other function on my desktop . The annoying Norton Antivirus screens keep coming up and wo n't let me go anywhere else ! Is the only way to get rid of this terroristic software to throw my computer out the window ??
 I 've used Norton AnitVirus products since 1996 , but I 'm thoroughly disgusted now . The 2004 version has given me more fits than any other version combined.I 'm in to my 4th month of my annual subscription and have had problems with : - losing activation -LRB- managed to do enough patches to get it to remember me -RRB- - the scanning not workingThe second problem is much more serious , it simply stopped doing the virus scan yesterday . After about six hours between yesterday and today of going through the uninstall/reinstall/check support pages routine , I uninstalled it as completely as possible and started hunting for an alternative . Right now I 'm trying a free -LRB- for home use -RRB- product called Avast ! Antivirus and will use it until I have done my research for a better product.Stay away !
 I worked on a friend 's computer who upgraded from Norton 2003 to 2004 because Norton sent her an email saying her subscription was expiring and 2003 was n't being supported . She bought Norton 2004 for her Win98se computer and installed it but it would not take her serial # . She uninstalled and reinstalled . I tried uninstalling and reinstalling also . The error was 3030,26 . I looked it up on Norton and it 's a known issue that they have n't fixed yet . Some people who have First Aid or Help Spot can solve this problem by removing it , but it was n't on her computer . I reformatted her computer with Win98se -LRB- OS only , not a system restore cd with all the junk -RRB- and still could n't install Norton . She called and got her money back . We use Norton Corporate 7.6 at work and have had no problems , but I would not recommend the Norton home edition . Get Grisoft 's AVG instead , I 've never had problems with it .
 By many accounts , this is the most highly rated anti-virus software out there . I bought it as an act of good faith , but when I installed it , the files were corrupt . I ca n't return it , because I 've broken the seal . Norton , freely admitting that the files are frequently corrupt on even new copies of its software , declares that it is not its problem , but mine . Forty dollars later , I have never been able to run the real-time update feature . Not once . Now I have McAffee . It runs great - right out of the box . Just to be clear , I do n't recommend this product .
 Do NOT buy this product . It hosed up my brand-new , out-of-the-box , no-other-software-installed , system big time ... would n't let me install or un-install it or any other program ; trashed my internet access ; and would n't run itself properly . I tried -LRB- several times -RRB- the 8 or 9 different possible manual solutions offered on the Symantec web site to fix or remove the software -LRB- an indicator of how bad this software is -RRB- ... to no avail . After a complete re-format and re-install of XP Pro and AFTER HAVING TO PAY VIA THE 900 Symantec `` SUPPORT '' NUMBER -LRB- they wo n't help for free -RRB- I am finally rid of this piece of crap . The online tech -LRB- at the per-minute charge -RRB- admitted that they have lots of disgruntled customers and unresolved problems.DO NOT BUY this program -LRB- or Norton Internet Security -RRB- which caused similar problems -RRB- ... go with McAfee or another vendor instead ...
 I upgraded to 2004 at the request of the sales rep - she said they would no longer support 2002 -LRB- which was working just fine -RRB- . So , I said `` ok '' . Bad move ! In addition to spending some money , I 've had blue screens -LRB- windows xp -RRB- and very high cpu utilizations . It finally got so bad , I had to uninstall . I 'm now running 2002 again , and everything is ok . It 's nice to have a fast machine , once again . DO NOT INSTALL NORTON ANTIVIRUS 2004 !!!!!
 I tried to install the product on a machine with Windows 98SE , and repeatedly it gives an internal program error just prior to finishing and crashes . I tried all of Symantec 's recommendations -LRB- virus scan off CD , virus scan from their website , install in a differend directory -RRB- , but get the same result .
 I have tried to load Norton Antivirus 2004 on two computers now . The first machine was rendered completely inoperable . I had to remove the software manually by using safe mode and running a couple of programs downloaded from Symantec 's site.The second installation was somewhat more successful . After the machine was restarted following the install , the computer was locked up until I killed the program called ` cfgwiz ' . I assume that is the program that takes you through the steps of scheduling scans , updates , etc since I was not presented with these options . I must kill the ` cfgwiz ' every time the computer boots up.Anyway , this is the most unbearable software I have ever encountered and wasted two days trying to install and uninstall the program on two different computers . I was a long time fan of Norton but I will find something else after this experience .
 I was forced to buy the newest version -LRB- 2004 -RRB- when they stopped supporting the version I had . Immediatly after installing , my machine slowed to a crawl , and my printer stopped working . I tried to get help , but there is nowhere to get it unless you pay . There 's not even a place to complain about that.So , I removed the software and my problems vanished.Quite a scam
 I just tried to renew my subscription to Norton Antivirus 2003 ... what a major ordeal . They send you a subscription key code with a huge document on how to correctly type it in . Does n't go thru at all . I worked their tech support several times to no avail . Very frustrating . I ended up eating the cost of 1 year subscription and bought McAfee instead . Much better .
 As a product , Norton Antivirus makes a great coffee table coaster because that 's all it 's good for . NAV let a virus eat my laptop . To Norton 's credit , the remedy instructions were clear , concise and easy to follow ; unfortunately , they just did n't work . Several months of work lost and untold cost was the price . I religiously kept it up to date , scanned every night , scanned all email and attachments and Norton still failed . If you live and work through the internet like I do , put this product back on the shelf and reach for the red box.Thanks for nothing Norton !
 I bought the retail version of NAV 2004 . About a couple of months since I installed and register the product , I started having a lot of problems with the software . It kept on disabling and finally deactivated itself . I re-installed the software a few times which worked fine for a couple days at a time . I called the customer support but could never get through to anyone as they place you on eternal hold . I held on as long as 45 minutes on a couple of occasions . I e-mailed thier tech . support dept and they replied telling me to call the 800 number . I e-mailed back tell them how I ca n't get through on the number and thier reply was to fill out the customer feedback form . Frustrated , I removed the NAV 2004 and Firewall and purchased the McAfee security suite instead . I think the product is good when it works but I have to give it a low mark for the terrible customer support . I also never like the fact that they require that you renew the subscritpion evey year for a fee to continue the use of the product .
 I 've always been a fan of Norton Antivirus and Norton SystemWorks . After purchasing and installing Norton Internet Security , I ca n't even get Norton Antivirus to run !!!!! Free installation help takes 3-4 days by email . Now Norton Antivirus wo n't even install after hours of cleaning files and registry keys from Norton tech support documents . You have to pay to get live installation help . What a rip !!!!
 After installing Norton Anti Virus 2004 , I immdediately noticed how much my system had slowed down.Prior to the installation my system ran very fast . So I uninstalled Norton and my system speed returned . I sent the product back for a refund of my money .
 I just bought Norton Antivirus 2004 for a new computer with Windows XP . The product will not load . When the licensing window comes up , it can not be read in its entirety . There is no `` accept '' or `` decline '' checkbox . Your choices are `` cancel '' and `` back . '' Symantec now charges $ 30 for technical assistance per incident -- nearly the cost of the software -- so I opted to exchange it for McAfee , which loaded easily .
 I upgraded from 2003 version - the product activation keeps resetting itself , even though it has been activated already ! It is really annoying to keep redoing the activation - I am going back to the 2003 version .
 Instead of just buying a new subscription for my AV 2003 , I decided to buy the 2004 version , figuring newer is better . Not so ! About a week after installing it , my computer , on start up , would automatically launch my internet software and then freeze -LRB- and AV 2004 would not load -RRB- . Ctrl-Alt-Del succeeded in shutting down the internet software , only to have it start up again in an endless loop . Eventually , the computer kicked into safe mode and the loop stopped , which allowed me to uninstall the internet software and reinstall it . This happened three times , but I know the problem is with the AV 2004 and not my software -LRB- AOL 8.0 Plus -RRB- since it was running just fine before I upgraded to 2004 ... I should have left well enough alone and kept my Norton AV 2003 -LRB- which worked great -RRB- and just bought another year 's subscription for virus definitions . Do n't buy this until Norton comes up with a bug free version or unless you just happen to be a computer expert . Not worth the aggravation to figure out how to fix the quirks ...
 If you ever need to reinstall your operating system , such as when you upgrade or replace a hard drive , Norton Anti-Virus 2004 activation will think you are pirating the software -LRB- since you have already activated it once before -RRB- . LiveUpdate then quits working . I 've been working with Symantec Tech Support for weeks -LRB- with no virus updates in the meantime -RRB- , and they have been slow and no help . Best resort is to repurchase the software -LRB- or go with McAfee instead -RRB- .
 After having spent over 4 hours trying to get this damn upgrade to install , I gave up . I ca n't even boot to a `` Last Good Configuration '' in XP because Symantec has taken over.Tried just about all their dead-end online fixes.Over the years I have weened myself from the other all-too-obtrusive Symantec products . I still liked AntiVirus till this upgrade.NO MORE SYMANTEC !! Plus , I have to PAY if I want to get LIVE support ! Their online support is useless!Stay away from Norton Products . Look to the many other equal if not superior options!Now I need to find out how to get all their garbage out of my `` previously perfectly '' running system.Fred
 When I first bought a computer about 3 years ago , Norton 's products were always well recomended . And for the last 3 years I 've used nothing but Norton 's products . So when I got the new 2004 version of thier antivirus software I thought that the quality would be consistent with the other versions . WRONG !!! This program is horrible . First , it never installed properly . When you load the program onto your computer you are supposed to restart your machine and then an `` Information Wizard '' is supposed to appear that will activate the program . That `` wizard '' never appeard and thus it was never fully activated . The program was half installed with no way to access it.Secondley , it made my system unstable . I had freeze ups , system crashes , fatal errors galore . Norton 's should have put a few more weeks of quality assurance into this program . But I have a feeling they rushed it on to the market.Lastly , this program is a resource hog . It 's so bloated with superflous features that it sucks up alot of system resources when older versions would run smoothely and unobtrusively.I am very VERY dissapointed in this program . When I buy an antivirus program I expect that it would at least do what it 's SUPPOSED to do and run unoticed in the background . This did niether . I am considering using MacAffee from now on as a result .
 I had been using NIS 2002 with no problems but thought I ought to change to NIS 2004 . Downloading from the Symantec Store website was a nightmare . The installation kept stalling out . After four tries I slogged through the maze of the online tech support website , found nothing that I as a non-techie recognized as being useful , and sent an email requesting assistance . An auto-generated acknowledgement was emailed to me stating they would get back to me in a 24 to 48 hrs . A day or two ? I tried to phone them for help -LRB- $ 29.95 per call , not toll-free -RRB- but they were too busy with other calls and suggested I call back between 8:00 AM and 10:30 AM Pacific time . Problem is that 's 4:00 AM to 6:30 AM where I live . In desperation I contacted a techie at my DSL provider who kindly and generously spent a lot of time trying to help me , finally suggesting that I uninstall the program from the control panel -LRB- Symantec also suggests this on the tech support website -RRB- At least this re-established my internet connection which I had lost for a while , but I kept getting error messages that seemed to indicate that the program was n't completely uninstalled . One especially scary message looked like it came from the land of DOS . Now I was unable to run NIS 2002 or NIS 2004 so I was completely unprotected when I went online in hopes of an answer to my reqeust for help . The response , which I received more than a day later , was mostly irrelevant to my problem , or so technical in language that I had no idea of what they were talking about . One suggestion was that I try downloading and installing again , which I did successfully - after five tries and two days of frustration . I still had to tweak a lot of settings mostly by trial and error to keep the program from being a nuisance . So does the program work ? I guess I 'll find out . I am keeping my fingers crossed , knowing that for all practical purposes , no help is available . My recommendation
 Norton is Slow - when it 's scanning , you ca n't do anything on your computer -- even on a fast computer . The ability to schedule scans is terrible . You can pick scans on Monday and Tuesday etc. . But whatever you do , it will still scan every Friday evening -- which is a night when some people may actually want to use the computer . Have n't found any way to turn off this nuisance.The worst is that when it came to blocking viruses , Norton let me down big time . Even though virus definitions were fully up to date , W32netsky virus came in and wreaked havec , installing itself in over 5,000 files . Nice Job Symantec ! Then once it knew the virus was there , it could n't eradicate it . Each time I scanned the program would freeze after about killing off 300 virus files . You really expect better performance than this . If I could I would give it NO STARS.Finally , I got Viruscan , which wiped out the software quikly and easily . Guess I 'm moving to Viruscan.The Activation process is not a big deal -- not terrible like Quickens Turbo Tax from last year .
 Bought this version prior to 98 to XP upgrade , as NAV 2000would not be compatable . Installed under 98 , seemed fine.After XP upgrade , Norton reported license problem , asked meto uninstall . Uninstall had errors , re-install wo n't work.NAV 2003 wo n't install because of traces of 2004 . Not recommended if you are planning to get it to `` get ready `` for XP upgrade .
 Worthless -- No support , waste of time to even attempt to use it ... There are better freeware software that work , really work without any hassle ...
 -LRB- 1 -RRB- This software interfers with any direct download of a . pdf file from the internet . On some internet sites , the . pdf file may be copied to your desktop and opened . If the . pdf save option is not available on the website , the PDF converter software has to be removed and the windows re-booted before accessing the website . pdf files . -LRB- 2 -RRB- The PDF converter download wizard automatically sets their software as primary to open . pdf files . Selecting Acrobat or any other . pdf software as primary is not allowed . -LRB- 3 -RRB- There is no support contact information in the quick reference guide , help menus or anywhere else ... You can bet , I will spread the good word about this software ... Scan Soft is now Nunance ... email request for technical support are $ 9.95 ... interesting revenue generation methodology ...
 Images , tables and graphs are not always converted into Office 2007 -LRB- only get black images and partially reproduced tables -RRB- . They are working on it . Terrible support , virtually impossible to contact ; expensive service -LRB- over 9 bucks for an e-mail answer , knowledge base very limited . Spent three hours trying to talk to somebody knowledgeable about this problem and could only obtain customer service people who would read the text from the web site.Zero stars
 I might as well have taken my money and flushed it down the toilet . This program works as good as garbage . Yes , it converts PDF files to Word Documents . Only problem is they do n't look anything like the original . Then when I tried to open and print existing PDF files that I have saved , or that come in as faxes via efax , all it does is print a blank page . There is not one feature I tried or needed to use on this product that worked . It should be taken off the market . Am I angry ? You bet I am !!!
 Could not get it to work with Internet Explorer in Windows Vista Ultimate . It would open pdf in one window , then crash itself and IE when the next pdf window was opened .
 I purchased this product which I run on a Dual Core Processor under Windows XP Professional . Software is very unstable and crashes often . This happends when I want to open a document from a URL . ScanSoft solution is that one should save the document in once PC and then open it up . This is of course unacceptable as this software should handle this and this is just a Band-Aid fix.Customer Service is the worst I have ever experienced and NUANCE/Scansoft need to greatly improve this . I have submitted on various occasions emails which I never ever receive a response . When talking to customer service they promise they would get back to you and so far have NEVER EVER done so !!!! Extremely unreliable service . I own many of their products and will NEVER EVER purchase another one of their products .
 I have used this product in the past , version 3 and purchased the upgrade thinking it would function a little better . When I constantly had issues with it not working and printing too many copies I contacted Nuance and found out from them they were aware of the problem , there is not a fix and they had no idea when there would be a fix ! I would think next time it would serve the customers a little better to put a product out that works we kind of expect that when you spend a lot of money on a product .
 I bought PDF Converter 4 and it causes MS Word to crash . I can now only open MS Word in safe mode , which is very frustrating . Nuance has ignored all my requests for help and their `` knowledge base '' is not helpful . Uninstalling MS Office and reinstalling both software packages did not fix the problem . The only fix I have found so far is to uninstall PDF Converter 4.0 , so at least I can continue working . Be very careful before buying this software .
 I 've been using PDF Converter Professional since version 3 with mixed results . At first it did what I wanted and allowed me to edit PDF files , and to easily convert exiting documents into forms . Then I ran into an insurmountable issue . I had about thirty 40 + page PDF files that I would love to print to my Brother duplex printer . Well 3 to 20 pages into the document PDF Converter crashes . This was an old Athlon 64 3000 system running XP.No big deal I though , I 'm replacing that PC anyway . I load version 4 onto my brand new Intel q6600 super system running Vista Ultimate and to to print to my Brother HL-5250DN with 256MB of RAM and once again PDF Converter crashes on page 4 of the document . Hmmmm maybe a bad batch of 30 + PDF files so I load up Adobe Acrobat and it merrily printed them without any hiccups.Hmmmmm it crashes on multiple systems , it crashes on multiple operating systems , it crashes when printing multiple documents so we 've ruled out the computer , the OS , and the documents ... Yet those same documents print from Adobe ... That tells this old IT guy that there is a bug in PDF Converter Professional 's underlying code . Support is $ 10 but I may just save this hunk of junk for editing and use Acrobat for printing.Good luck with it !
 Product works on some of our machines and crashes others . Tech support was not good , with a Canadian who barely spoke English.We 've made a company decision to move back to Adobe .
 This is a mediocre hard to use program . If yu fight with it you can accomplish most of what you need . However I would suggest that if you need to do serious work with pdf files and your time is valuable look for a different program such as an Adobe program . If all you need is to convert and combine pdf documents check out pdf995 . This program is free -LRB- annoying ads offering to upgrade but at least you did n't waste any money -RRB- and will do most of what you need . at least check it out first .
 You must be kidding $ 9 + to report a problem with their software ???? I really must consider this ` scam ' when dealing with my clients.Unable to register the ocx to allow simple viewing of pdf 's on web pages . A simple task that has become a nitemare .
 Confucious say -- Ahh , if the software maker is charging alot for tech support , then their software must be full of bugs that you must swat , and we will charge you for the swatter.Translation
 I ran this program with some success on Windows XP for two years . I say some , because at times it was slow and crashed often . I have also experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers . Still I was able to finish the various tasks for which I used it . Recently , it stopped working altogether
 3.0 worked well , 4.0 has bugs and customer service for this product has not been helpful
 I 've recently been reviewing PDF creation & editing software , with a specific focus on creating/editing PDF Forms . I was hesitant to try Nuance PDF Converter Professional 4 because of the reviews I read regarding version 3 , but I figured version 4 must be an improvement . I should have listened to my gut , and to the other reviewers.I used their `` FormTyper '' to convert an existing PDF into a `` Forms '' PDF . That actually worked reasonably well , placing Text and Checkbox fields on the PDF , however it did miss a few . Here 's where the real problems begin . There is no way to access the Properties of each Form Field -LRB- properties like Field Name , Border & Background Colors , Orientation , ToolTips , Field Actions , and so many more properties that are available in other - all cheaper - programs I 've evaluated -RRB- . So , after running FormTyper , that is what you are stuck with ... you ca n't change/edit/add what it does . Additionally , there is NO WAY to place a button , combo box , or list box fields on a PDF form . Where is all this functionality ? Almost every other program can do these things . I searched the Program Help ; the on-line knowledge base -LRB- VERY little information - mostly about defending their software activation process and policies -RRB- ; all on-line documentation -LRB- of which there is very little regarding version 4 -RRB- ; and I tried to find a user forum or community - of which there are none . -LSB- . . -RSB-
 I recently upgraded to MS VISTA and MS Office 2007 and I upgraded to the VISTA version of PDF Converter Pro 4 . BIG , BIG MISTAKE !! The program installed some sort of pdf `` add-in '' to MS Office that caused Excel , Word , and Outlook to CRASH . As soon as you opened one of the programs it would give an error message and close . It took hours on the phone with Microsoft to figure out and correct the problem -LRB- THANKS MICROSOFT ! -RRB- . However , I got ZERO help from Nuance , they wanted to charge me to even REPORT a problem ! BEAWARE YOU WILL NOT GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITH NUANCE PRODUCTS ! Before I upgraded , I used PDF Converter Pro at home whereas at work I used Adobe Pro . There is no comparison , PDF Converter Pro while considerably cheaper , does not do near as good a job of producing pdf files . I 'm still looking for something that works but is cheaper than Adobe .
 I would rate this a minus 1 star but 't is not allowed .1 . PDF converter does NOT convert Word hyperlinks into the PDF file it creates2 . There is no customer support available for simple questions , like `` why the heck are n't my hyper links converting ? '' . -LRB- Unless you want to pay $ 10 -RRB- .3 . There is no meaningful content in their so called `` knowledge base '' .4 . There help documentation does not match the application . They instruct you to click on menu options , etc. that do not exist.I suspect they do not have a support forum , or decent knowledge base , or documentation , so that you are forced to subscribe to their expensive technical support plan.Stay away from this piece of junk .
 I deinstall the product after two weeks of use . It did not allow me to select Adobe Reader as my default program and was not able to open many PDF documents . If a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing . Also , the feature to allow editing of the documents in Word or Excel was most often non-functional .
 This has caused serious technical errors on my systems -- all new laptops , desktops . It will cause MS Word 2007 to crash and also cause a number of errors on your file system , possibly requiring you to re-install your Vista OS.Worked well in Windows XP and Office 2003 environment , and they claim this is Vista compatible , along with Paperport 11 . The company will not offer me a refund . I will pursue .
 I tried this product at work for a while . Fortunately I did n't have to pay for it . I found the open source PDFCreator to be superior . You can download PDFCreator for free from SourceForge . PDFCreator just installs like a printer , so you can create PDFs from any application that supports printing . I 've never had a problem with it .
 I bought this product in March 07 . It loaded and worked great till 3 days ago . I woke up to find all my PDF 's unusable . The program was unusable and just like others I quickly found that there was no way to get answers or a fix without spending money ... 19.95 or 9.95 to email tech support . The one free call got me a tech who had an accent so strong I could not understand him and when he could n't fix my problem -LRB- after messing up my registry -RRB- he told me it was my spyware that was to blame ... `` disable your spyware and reinstall . '' I tried ... no luck . Funny the parent company Zeon who is holding everything up , is offering an upgrade , hmm ! more $ $ . STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT !!! I wish somebody had warned me .
 I make books on Cafe Press and they require the document to be uploaded as a PDF , but must have all fonts imbedded . I 've put three books into Scan Soft for PDF and the files work great - till I try and upload at CafePress which says the fonts are n't embedded . Reading and reading and reading on Soft Scan , since I ca n't find any support/help for it , it says all fonts ARE embedded BUT English Times . Well , I do n't use English Times in my books for that very reason - yet the PDF does not show up as having embedded fonts . I can find no way to affect embedded fonts on Soft Scan . Every time I need a book PDF , Cafe Press has to make me a PDF that can be uploaded . Grrrr . -LRB- and soft scan is terribly slow -RRB-
 I was very disappointed with the installation for Windows Vista . I installed from the actual CD . After installation , I upgraded to the Vista version . Then I was instructed to uninstall the software that I just installed and download the Vista version from the Nuance website . It 's a huge 414 MB zipped file . I then extracted the zipped file , run the install , activated the software . If you 're on a dailup internet connection , be prepared for at least an hour download for Vista , thankfully , I have a broadband connection.However , the software freezes -LRB- crashes -RRB- both PDF Converter 4 Professional as well as IE 7.0 on Windows Vista when opening a PDF document in the browser . To counter the problem , I downloaded Adobe Reader 8 and set it as my default PDF Reader.There is no realistic support for this product . There is no toll free support number and after the first incident , the charge is $ 19.99 . I would avoid this software until Nuance provides a better and more stable product and offers free support.Joseph Smouse , Phoenix , Arizona
 Freezes IE 7 and you have to close out and restart ... besides that , the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the `` Print as Image '' selection for anything that is scanned . Overall it is OK , and with the vast price difference with Adobe , I can live with it . BUT , make no mistake , this program is far inferior to the Adobe products
 While it does teach you , the downside is it automaticly downloads aton of other programs into your PC . For a beginner you then have to fiquire out how to get rid of them . You then have to down load the entire program to get rid of them . Not cool at all .
 After I installed the software , I could not access anymore the my account page in the Amazon.co.jp and ny earthlink web mail.Actually , I am trying to find out a solution to it before trying to install the software again . I have no comments about the efficiency of the program in translating yet .
 This book has some good points to make and helpful resources to list . It also offers badly-needed clarification of what `` classical '' really means.On the other hand , there are problems with the curriculum suggestions
 I really wanted to like this book as I had heard it is concise and readable as to the `` whys '' and `` hows '' of a true classical education ; my children have been studying Koine Greek for 3 years now and we started Latin this year . I think I have read every book currently available on the subject and I was hoping to be able to recommend this , a short-ish book , to families I know who are considering classical home schooling but do n't want to invest large quantities of time in the usual longer books -LRB- `` The Well-Trained Mind '' , Teaching the Trivium '' , etc. -RRB- . So here is my review , and I direct it especially to Christian home schoolers.The first section discusses why a classical education is superior to modern methods . The author , Andrew Campbell , makes several good points , but he is admittedly mostly rehashing other books such as `` Climbing Parnassus '' , an excellent book that already explains quite well the `` whys '' . He quotes `` C.P. '' extensively , so my suggestion is that you read THAT book with the quotes in context instead.Campbell is emphatic that the classical languages -LRB- especially Latin -RRB- have THE central role in a classical education , which is certainly correct . Respecting the stages of the trivium model alone -LRB- grammar , logic , rhetoric -RRB- is not a classical education per se and there are some out there promoting that it is . He critically refers to those who promote that view as `` neoclassicists '' and rightly so . But why he put the Bluedorns and their long-printed book -LRB- `` Teaching the Trivium '' -RRB- into this category is beyond me . The Bluedorn book places HEAVY emphasis on the classical languages as central to a classical education ; in fact , they emphasize a thorough knowledge of Latin , Greek AND Hebrew as all being central to a Christian 's classical education.Campbell then emphasizes the principle of ` multum non multa ' -LRB- essentially `` less is more '' -RRB- which is a solid classical principle . A child 's education should be broad and deep in a few subjects , rather than a smattering of this-and-that in a multitude of subjects , which is the modern methodology . This is what the Bluedorns call `` trivium vs. trivia '' -LRB- yes I am partial to their book ; I think it 's better !! -RRB- . Good principle , absolutely crucial in fact for a successful classical curriculum as there are only so many hours in a day . But strangely , Campbell then proceeds to lay out a scope-and-sequence which is anything BUT `` multum non multa '' . Seven subjects for a first grader ?? -LRB- PLUS read-aloud time -RRB- . How is this any different from the curriculum suggested by `` The Well-trained Mind '' ? It seems to me the Latin is getting lost again . In other words , in the scope-and-sequence he puts forth , it seems Mr. Campbell contradicts his own advice.Another problem specifically for Christian home scholars
 I bought this package the Spy Kids The Underground Affair and I did not receive the book which you said comes together . I can not get into any of the activities so I am not pleased with this it is impossible to play or use without the proper items for example the book.Thank YouRyan
 I 'm sorely disappointed in this new version of Money , because it ca n't even open my 2003 money file . There 's no indication as to why . It just ignores my old file and start a new , blank file without alerting me . -LRB- Luckily it did n't corrupt the old file , so I was able to roll back to Money 2003 easily . -RRB- In terms of interface , it looks and behaves pretty much like Money 2003 , so I think this is just a minor update .
 Contrary to what the box says , as of right now Money Deluxe 2004 will not convert from Quicken 2004 files . Microsoft says this is because they have n't gotten the Quicken 2004 file formats yet from Intuit , but they also say there is no estimated time to resolve this . Quicken 2004 has been out for a few months now - this is really a surprise .
 Why pay for a used version of the software , when you can download it free from Microsoft ? It is called `` Microsoft Money Plus Sunset '' .
 I bought Money 2004 , and I 'm starting from scratch - not upgrading from anything . Windows XP professional on a 1 year old Dell with 500 megs Ram.When installing the program I got an error about Norton AntiVirus preventing Money from connecting to banks , and it said to click the More Info button . The button opened a web page that did not list this error . I had to call Tech Support to install the program and they said I may have to call again if I have trouble connecting to Banks.I spent 3 long solid days setting up my budget and catagories and paying my 1st 3 bills . With all the videos and many kinds of help , the screens were not very intuative for just the basics of how to set up a budget and catagories and writing checks . I have not even tried the advanced things like balancing your check book or setting up a portfolio.I had problems setting up my Budget . I get paid every two weeks and video shows you how to set up your paycheck so it knows your gross pay as well as putting your deductions into catagories . My problem is that all reports show my annual gross pay as the wrong amount . I get paid ever 2 weeks which the program lets you enter . Thus there are 26 pay checks per year . The reports show the total income as 25 checks per year which is a very significant error . I tried increasing the date range of the budget , thinking it was chopping off one pay period since the 1st pay check is on 1/6/04 . This does not fix the problem . I 've had 3 Tech Support calls on this issue and they have not resolved this issue yet . They now admit there is a bug that prevents the annual income from your paycheck , and the budget column total from being correct . This is the basics folks , and it 's WRONG !!! Reports do not show what you want to see . After setting up my Budget with budgetted amounts for each Catagory , I wanted to print a report so I could see my Budget . The only report like this prints the budget but also prints 2 columns for each month of the year . If only fits 2 months on a page so a simple 2 page report prints out as 12 pages ! And I did not want any months at all . Customizing the report does not fix this problem.After spending lots of time looking at the 6 kinds of HELP it provides and not finding answers , I went to the Microsoft Web site to look in their Knowledge Base . As of 2-1-04 , you can not search the database for Money 2004 . It only goes up to Money 2003 . I 'd ask for my money back , but after spending all this time getting it set up , I 'm going to live with it.Don ' t waste your money on Money 2004
 The software looks good and feels professional , yet when you try to delve into it , it bites you.Software like this is supposed to make life easier . However this software seems extremely rigid in its approach and unintuitive . It doesnt predict common issues that are bound to crop up . If you want to resolve what seems like a simple problem theres usually no direct route to do it and you have to spend an hour tinkering and working around things.Unfortunately typical Microsoft product I have to say , seems like they 're more interested in crosslinking you to their websites and pay services than they are in providing you with a competant and truly customer orientated piece of software .
 Itried ms money 04 deluxe but encountered problem after installation when I was reaching the final stage of data entry for my accounts . Apparently the software is geared to access data with hooks to microsoft net passport and msn money site . although I have a hotmailaccount it gave me en error `` money has encountered an error and will shut down ... . this errror is related to a mspfct10.dll file problem . Msn email tech support could not solve it and they tried the ususal tricks related to another dll file problem witnessed with this product . There is a sample account in the system folder of this software which one can use and it functions without a problem , but you loose the additional functionality by noy logging to the account and web via passport.Also downloading statements to the accounts was unreliable and sometimes inaccessible . I returned it to ms after 10 days of B testing . I would stick to quicken new user edition which is easy to function but still is inadequate
 Worthless software . You will be better off keeping a paper record . It 'll be faster to do !!
 I have been using Quicken for a number of years . Believe me , I am not a real Intuit fan , especially after that `` Safecast '' number they pulled on Turbotax users last year.However , compared to Quicken , I think Money 2004 runs very slowly . I mean 25 seconds to show an account vs. about five on Quicken . Perhaps it calls for more RAM than my Quicken 2002 . Or maybe those annoying smiling faces in the photos use up more memory and slow the computer down.And the Money interface is drab and hard to read . Not enough color to offset the entries and make the page readable . It gave me a blue screen and crashed the computer the first time I used it . That was enough .
 I purchased Money 2004 for use with my Pocket PC . I have had nothing but trouble with it . It will not Sync properly and gives bad data .
 Not user friendly geared to stocks and investing i was miss lead by vague descriptions of options
 I have been using checkbook software for over fifteen years , starting with the Mac and Quicken , moving on to various versions of Quicken on the PC . I switched to Money from Quicken at the turn of the year for three reasons
 I have been using Money 2003 Deluxe for almost two years and found it to be a very helpful program . Because I was so happy with this program I decided to upgrade to the 2004 edition.This is where I get unhappy with the product . Unlike the 2003 version I could n't get the 2004 version to update my stock prices . I contacted Microsoft 's technical services which told me that if the portfolio you are trying to update contains American Depository Receipts -LRB- ADRs -RRB- , because of some bug your portfolio will not update . BTW , I do n't think all ADRs are effected , just the ones that trade Over-The-Counter or on the Pink Sheets.This astounds me . How could a previous edition do something perfectly and the updated version not ? This is also not a small bug , since I ca n't be the only one trying to use this program with ADRs in my portfolio . In any event , I uninstalled 2004 Deluxe and reinstalled 2003 Deluxe . Now all fine , but for the fact I am out of the money for costs of Money 2004 . Go ahead , ask me if I 'm going to buy the 2005 version ?!?!
 I have Microsoft Money 2003 Deluxe so I was looking forward to Microsoft Premium to optimize my finances . At the store , I scrutinized the features on the Microsoft Money Premium Edition box and thought paying the extra -LSB- money -RSB- for `` capital gains '' and `` tax information '' was superfluous . Mind you , it was a difficult decision . First , Money 2004 Deluxe is simple to install and seamless to update from previous editions of Money . This may sound confusing to the layman , but the product was so seamless to update from my Microsoft Money 2003 information , that after my update was complete , I thought I was still running Microsoft Money 2003 ! I closed the application down and restarting it thinking there must be an error . Then realizing it was n't , I recall saying to myself optimistically , `` okay ... they must have changed something '' . I proceded to attempt to ascertain the upgrades from 2003 Deluxe to make myself feel better for having spent -LSB- money -RSB- on 2004 Deluxe . There are some changes I discovered , although you would really have to search for them and I can honestly say it is nothing noteworthy at all . Just my opinion . No easier to use budget setup or dramatic enhancements to the investment portfolio . In fact , the interface is pretty much a replica of Microsoft Money Deluxe 2003 . I guess I should not have expected much since it had only been a year but I admit , I am a sucker for these products.One thing I was happy about was that there is some financial service products available to buyers of Microsoft Money 2004 . Good services too . I opened an ING Direct savings account yesterday and today I have already received -LSB- money -RSB- credited for free to my account -LRB- and there are no minimums/fees attached -RRB- ; established Experian 's credit manager and was able to obtain my credit report ; checked out a handy Bank One credit card advertised in the packet of information that boasts 1 mile for every -LSB- dollar -RSB- spent going to any airline ; and mailed in my -LSB- -RSB- Microsoft Money 2004 Deluxe rebate to New Jersey . I felt the financial services were the best part of the package which goes to tell you that the product , at least as an upgrade to Microsoft Money 2003 Deluxe , is n't all that great .
 I have been using Quicken for several years , and currenty using Quicken 2002 -LRB- I did not update after reading the reviews ... THANKS for the customer reviews ! -RRB- . I use Q for investments and keeping up where I spend my money . I took a chance with Money 2004 Delux to see if it was any better , since Q was 2 yrs old . BAD MOVE!After using M for 2 weeks , I am going to return it -LRB- 30 day money back guarantee ... first I have to figure out where to send it -RRB- . Since I use Q mainly for investments , Q has MUCH superior report capabilities . One click on Portfolio brings me right to the screen that has all the data I need ... plus the capability to modify the colums for different data . To get to the same screen with M , I have to run a report , and the options for modifying the columns for data I want -LRB- e.g. daily profit , etc -RRB- are non existant.In Q , to view a list of all the securities -LRB- investments -RRB- you have , 2 clicks and you are there . In spite of going all thru the help screens , including the on-line help -LRB- which is a task itself -RRB- , I followed the instructions to the T and never did find the way to show all the names of the different securities that I had in my portfolio.To top it off , I use Turbotax and I tried to download all my investment data -LRB- dividends , etc -RRB- to keep from re-entering it in Turbotax . Well , it did n't work ! Only one account showed up . BUMMER !! That was the last straw.M has some good features ... sorta bells and whistles ... like biggest winners and losers in my portfolio for the day and some other stuff . But the basics of what I need and use are inferior to Q 2002 . I sure hope the folks at Q step up to the plate and get Q 2004 fixed so that I can upgrade and stay with Q.
 After years of using Quicken , I thought it might be time to try Microsoft Money . I have had some issues with Intuit 's products lately and with the tax software/Microsoft Money rebate combos , I cound try Microsoft Money Deluxe free . What a disaster!I have multiple accounts at many of the financial institutions I deal with and Money gave me fits trying to get the information downloaded into each account . My mortgage setup was mess as Money kept calculating different values then my bank -LRB- and Quicken -RRB- . I do not believe the user interface is intuitive or as easy to use as Quicken and the help files were not always accurate.After less then a month I have gone back to Quicken 2003 and I plan to never invest my time with Money again . Thank goodness it did not cost me anything to try Money .
 Is Microsoft even listening to their customers ? I agree with the previous review . This version adds a few things that you do n't need and call it an upgrade . I downloaded the trial version and will not pay for this upgrade . The interface is exactly the same . There are no usability improvements and no improvements in the look of the product . Sure the Gainskeeper is useful but requires extra money for full use . The Experian credit manager does not even work if you have too much credit information -LRB- They will not produce a report ! -RRB- . Hopefully , nobody will upgrade this year and force Microsoft to make some real improvements even if they have to borrow ideas from Quicken .
 To the chase : Tax Estimator is a general reporting tool in the software that will lookup your recorded transactions that belong to `` some '' of your defined categories.Categories = classifications for how to account for a type of transactions -LRB- e.g. , Expenses marked to Utilities
 I downloaded the trial version and started transferring my data from Quicken 2003 . Everything seemed to go pretty well and it automatically let me use my password from my Quicken but after using it a few times I went to log on and it did n't accept my password . Luckily I was still using my Qiucken and the loss of data was n't any big deal but I 'm certainly not going to switch to Money 2004 . If I had been using only Money the loss could have been a major problem .
 First , some background on us . We are very experienced computer users who setup the computer systems used by some of the largest banks around . Yet we can not get Microsoft Money 2004 to connect to our own personal accounts.One bug
 For Quicken Usrs
 My new PC came with Money 2004 . I was very happy with my old Money 99 but I thought I 'd try it . I 'm so sorry I upgraded ! You can also download an 60 day trial but you 'll run into the same problems . Once you upgrade you can never go back . If you 're using Quicken or an Older version of Money , Money 2004 makes it extremely difficult for exporting data back to Quicken and there 's no way back to older versions of money . On the Money 2004 FAQ , it leads you to believe you can , but you ca n't and then you find yourself 60 days in and find out you 'll either have to buy or spend time reentering all your transactions for the last 60 into your older version . Do n't Do it ! Also 2004 is a subscription service so expect some features to expire .
 I 've used Money 2000 for about 3 years now , and finally decided it was time to upgrade to 2004 Deluxe . Big mistake.Microsoft has made the budgeting features of Money nerely impossible to use . You used to be able to get good reports out of it but most have been replaced with busy readouts that are unintelligible . It 's hard to interpret what the few reports are trying to tell you . For example
 No aspect of financial management is more important than budgeting . The flaws in the budgeting features of Money 2004 are severe , and as a result this software is utterly inadequate.By way of illustration , after spending a couple of hours inputting our basic financial data , I constructed a household budget for the coming year , and a list of our cherished financial goals . Having done so , I discovered , not surprisingly , that the sum total of all the things we 'd like to do are beyond our means for the coming year . Clearly , it was time to print out the budget and our goals , so that my wife and I could look at them all together , and make some tough choices . Unfortunately , the program does not provide for this . Our only option is to scroll through the budget looking at the small sliver of it that is visible in the window that Money opens on the laptop screen . Each time we modify the budget or the goals , we have to switch back and forth between screens for the budget and the list of goals . It seems to be possible to print an expense report comparing outlays already made to a predefined budget , but you ca n't print out budgets in advance of spending . It 's amazing to me that a multi-billion dollar industry leader would shortchange such a basic function . You can be sure that Microsoft 's financial department prints out budgets for study and modification before spending starts . But MS could n't be bothered to make that basic planning tool available to the households using its products.I chose Money because the Amazon reviews were so negative for Quicken . At this point I think I 'll go back to using spreadsheets to construct my own budgets and cash flow projections . It 's timeconsuming , especially because of error-checking , but at least I can perform this basic task of financial management .
 I have Microsoft Money 2003 Deluxe so I was looking forard to Microsoft Premium to optimize my finances .

I felt the financial services were the best part of the package which goes to tell you that the product , at least as an upgrade to Microsoft Money 2003 Deluxe , is n't all that great .
 I downloaded the trial version from Microsoft 's Web site , and imported all my Quicken data . I started using the program , but soon noticed that numbers were subtly wrong . Some odd transactions -LRB- ones that were in Quicken , simple check payments -RRB- were missed ; and the loans were so screwed up that some of the payments were showing negative principal payment.I ca n't trust the data I imported or anything I 've done since then , which means that I wasted a half dozen hours on this . Save yourself the time , and do n't do the same . If you want to use this -LRB- and it seems okay , except for its insane handling of `` matching '' transactions that are months apart to different payees for different amounts -RRB- , start from scratch and do n't import your Quicken data .
 AppleWorks is n't really a bad product - it 's been around for quite a few years , previously as ClarisWorks - but it desperately needs an update . For example , version 6.2.7 still does n't take full advantage of features found in Mac OSX . Furthermore , it has some rather strange interface quirks and lacks some important features -LRB- spellcheck as you type , for example -RRB- . My recommendation
 First of all , let me say I love Apple and dislike Microsoft . I would always choose to support Apple over Microsoft . If you are one of those people that never has to share documents with a Windows friend , then AppleWorks will be fine . I do n't think it 's as good as Office -LRB- or Word or Excel , if you are n't buying the whole Office suite , -RRB- but for the price , I 'd buy AW instead.Anyway , my frustration level with AW has reached the breaking point , and now I 'm going to have to go out and do what I never wanted to do - buy Microsoft Office . AW is supposedly compatible with Excel and Word documents , but AW has often converted incoming Excel and Word documents to junk , if it is even able to open the Microsoft documents at all . Also , if you want to save an AW spreadsheet as an excel document , do n't expect it to transfer your work nicely . Simple data cells it can handle , but charts - no way . As a business school student , it 's essential that I am able to send and receive Word and Excel documents without issues . AppleWorks does not do the job.It breaks my heart to recommend a Microsoft product over an Apple product , but until Apple makes a truly compatible alternative to Office , I have no choice but to recommend that my fellow Mac users buy Office instead of AppleWorks .
 I bought my Powerbook because I was fed up with Microsoft Windows and all of the problems associated with the OS . I hated Word and many things about Microsoft Office , so I did n't want to buy a Mac and then load it up with more Microsoft crap , like Mac Office . Although it seemed like the only mainstream commercial product , I could n't bring myself to buy a copy.There were free Office suites , e.g. OpenOffice , but I was learning the Mac again and needed something I could quickly get up to speed with . The only other options , as far as I could tell , were iWork and Appleworks . Iwork did n't offer a spreadsheet or database , which I needed , so that left me with Appleworks.I first experienced Appleworks on an Apple IIe in the 80 's and it 's later iteration for the Mac in the 90 's . It was a good office utility program in the `` good old days '' , so I decided to give Appleworks a try . I shelled out the $ 80 bucks for the program , loaded it up and immediately stepped into the Wayback machine . Here was my $ 1500 Powerbook with all the latest bells and whistles and a beautiful interface running a program that had n't changed in over 20 years . I should have read the Wikipedia info on this program.I thought that over the last 20 years the program would have evolved . Well , it did n't . The program still performs the basic functions in the same basic , bland , convuluted ways . Saving a document and importing a document , such as a . doc file , is the most cumbersome and confusing excercise you could imagine . Try to open a Word . doc file and iWorks takes over , but unless you agree to buy iWork you ca n't save , print or do anything with the opened document . According to Wikipedia , it has n't been updated to take advantage of the latest features of the Mac -LRB- has n't been updated since 2004 -RRB- and will be dumped for iWork that has no spreadsheet or database . I guess every genius has his problems.Bottom line
 Appleworks really needs a thorough overall . In the latest version , the interface under OSX sucks . Why , oh why can not the document window automatically expand to fill the screen , and let 's have a page layout view that makes sense.Word and Excel support is very inferior , I would suggest grabbing NeoOffice J or Open Office if you need to open Word and Excel documents.The good news is that the next version of Mac office will support xml format documents ...
 I had used AppleWorks for OS X fairly happily for some time . I never loved it ; the interface seemed both sparse and clunky and the included templates were a little lacking . -LRB- How about a simple invoice template replacing just one of those certificates ? -RRB- It gave me some problems when I tried to make a document with slightly more creative formatting and send it to a PC user , but it was at least servicable . When I bought a new Mac , it came preinstalled , so I continued to use it . Then one day , my boyfriend recieved a contract via e-mail that needed to be printed up , signed , and returned . To make a long story short , we dicovered after the fact that AppleWorks had somehow randomly selected a few paragraphs and changed the text to strikethrough . It showed up this way on both of our computers , both Macs running AppleWorks , but not on my PC running Microsoft Word at work . Fortunately , we managed to sort everything out and thanks to some very nice HR people , no harm was done . But under different circumstances , AppleWorks could have quite literally cost my boyfriend a job . Needless to say , we went out at our earliest convenience and picked up Microsoft Office for Mac . Also needless to say , we will not be using AppleWorks ever again .
 Microsoft Money Deluxe 2004I had the earlier version of money and it did very well . This version is very problematic . It is full of bells and whistles which override your entries . Finally , it eliminated all the content from my money file , costing me 10 months of entries and work .
 I installed the product . and it wo n't run on my XP professional !!! do n't waste your money .
 I 've been using Quicken for years , but I like to check out alternatives . So , since there were many positive reviews , here and in the PC mags , I thought I 'd give Money a try.Forget it ! Here 's why :1 . A pain in the neck to set up .2 . It would n't import my Quicken data .3 . Could n't review and modify what was being set up .4 . Documentation inadequate.Need I go on ? I 'm not a novice , so if I had trouble , I expect that so will most others.Quicken is far from perfect , but on the whole it has been solid , powerful , and fairly easy to use . The latest versions have annoying ads , but I find that easier to live with than the Money interface .
 Beware Quicken users!I 've been using Quicken since 1991 but thought it was time for a change . I 've read some good reviews of Money and have never had a problem learning new software , so I took the plunge and bought Money 2004 . What a mistake ! Here is what I liked least :1 . The interface is absolutely nothing like Quicken . Figure on spending hours to acheive a basic familiarity .2 . It 's a typical Microsoft product . That means the software tries to outsmart you rather than letting you work the way you want to .3 . The interface is way too cluttered . At every turn Microsoft is trying to sell you something - insurance , mortgages , baked apples , whatever . It 's like working on a billboard .4 . To use Money you have to sign up for various external services , like Net Passport or whatever it 's called - a real pain .5 . There 's no Quicken.com where you can put your accounts on the Web.All in all , a tremendous disappointment . Under no circumstances would I advise anyone to switch from Quicken .
 I got a copy of MS Money 2004 for Christmas as requested . I 've used MS Money 98 for a long long time , and I figured it was time for an upgrade.I installed the program , and installation went perfectly ; no problems . However , as soon as I tried to launch the program I got an error message , and the program would n't even run . I tried a few things -LRB- I consider myself quite computer savvy -RRB- , but none of my solutions worked . I still got the error message.My only choice was to beg for the mercy of Microsoft . Since I was n't about to pay for the expensive phone call to talk to a live person , I decided to use their online assistance . So far I 've dealt with two different technical assistants , and neither one of them seem competent . The second individual is actually quite condescending . Hopefully I 'll get a third helper that 's nicer.I 'm still receiving `` help '' from Microsoft , but none of it is working . I 've NEVER had any problems with ANY other software working on my PC , so I know it 's MS Money 2004 . Until Microsoft can fix their faulty program , I rate MS Money 2004 1 star . The only reason I 'm even giving that one star instead of none is because I really liked MS Money 98 , and I figure it could n't have gotten any worse -LRB- If it worked -RRB- .
 I bought Microsoft Money Premium because of the reviews listed here , was a former Quicken user . Sorry , but I had nothing but problems with it . Could n't get it to connect to my E * Trade account or my Fleet bank account , only Fidelity . Their solution was to have me talk to E * Trade , yah right ! Problem is on Microsoft Money 's side as my Fidelity account has no problem interacting with Fleet and E * Trade . Also documentation was terrible and I 'm an IT person that writes software for a living.Bought Quicken 2004 online and had it running and connected to all accounts in less than an hour , no problems . Save yourself the headache and get Quicken 2004 . Have had no problems whatever running it on Windows XP SP1 .
 Item was returned and purchase price was refunded . Software requires a password to open , which I was unable to find , since the product is no longer supported by microsoft .
 I have MS Money 2004 , which Microsoft elected to discontinue supporting the online stock/fund updates without any warning or notification to me . Money 2004 was great while it was fully functioning with the online financial updates , but now ... ? Why would anyone want to buy this product that Microsoft no longer produces or supports?I am switching to Quicken 2010 as soon as it is available . I have no choice .
 I purchased Money to replace what I had so I could restore my backup , but it could n't be restored . Therefore , the software was worthless and has been returned . Not even an IT specialist could restore it and Microsoft would n't give any help without crossing their palm with silver .
 I 've been a Money user for many years . I love the design and find it easy to work with.Imagine my horror , then , when doing my tax reports this year I discovered that Money failed to list all my tax expenses . I noticed this only because a major expense was missing from the report , so the error was glaring.When I then went to check , I found Money failed to list around 20 % of my expenses . If I had not discovered this error , I would have ended up paying $ 5000 more tax than necessary . I have n't checked past years ' returns , yet , but if this flaw has existed in previous versions , then I 've been overpaying my taxes for years thanks to Money.I have checked and rechecked over a dozen times to ensure the error is not my own . It 's not . The missing expenses are correctly categorize as tax expenses , they are in accounts which are included in my tax reports , and they are for the correct reporting period . Strangely , Money will report a similar expense and then skip the next , similarly categorized expense.If you 're going to use this product , treble check your reports at tax time .
 I 've been using MS Money products for about a year now after switching from Quicken . I was tempted by the lower costs and on-line freebies . While the product overall works ok , I believe that the reviewer that made this comment > > > 2 . It 's a typical Microsoft product . That means the software tries to outsmart you rather than letting you work the way you want to . < < < < makes a very good point . This is very frustrating to me because we do n't all think alike . I 've always been able to set up Quicken exactly the way I wanted and it was always very intuitive . I 've never felt that way with Money . Just this week I was trying to get Money to set up my budget the way I wanted it . Paychecks can be entered in several different ways . I told Money that I was paid every other week . After entering the bi-weekly amount it then proceeded to calculate a yearly total and then avereaged it over 12 months . This then is the budgeted income amount that shows up on budget reports . Being that there are some months with 3 pay periods instead of 2 , this averaged amount is never what I am actually paid . It 's just one of the frustrating little ways that Money trys to outsmart you . I 'm going back to Quicken .
 Microsoft just continues to top itself year after year with the continual poor quality of it 's software . In that one regard , Money 2004 does not disappoint.As other reviewers have noted , many previously functional parts of the -LRB- mostly well-designed -RRB- program have been crippled , or do not work at all . A prime example that I can site is the Debt Reduction Planner ... the whole point of the tool is to allow the user to create a program to automatically pay-off the highest interest debt first . It no longer does this -- or much of anything else ! When you set up a debt program , the tool used to schedule all of your payments in your Bills and Deposits listing to present an accurate cash-flow forecast . Now it only presents the most immediate payments ... USELESS !!! Add to this sporadic unexplainable data corruption and a complete absence of I/O load balancing in the `` background banking '' sub-app and you get a software tool that destabilizes and imperils your critical financial data . Oh yeah , and you 're paying out the nose for that privilege!MS Money used to be the only reason I stopped thinking about switcing to the Mac . At this point , Quicken is beginning to sound appealing.I recently was subjected to inane blather from a financial number-cruncher about how MS is going to eventally conquer everything and everyone in the distributed computing arena ... . I say it wo n't happen . They are committing the one sin that all companies have paid for eventually ... arrogance and distain for the needs of their customers . Yeah , Windows will still be around in 30 years . But not much else ... and who knows if MS will still be the owners .
 I 'm a longtime Quicken user , but because of the sunset on Quicken 2001 I decided to take a look at Money 2004 . Money converted my Quicken files , but ALL of my accounts -LRB- bank , IRA , mutual fund , brokerage -RRB- had errors.Money outputs a word file saying there were problems , but gives no details . The file only says `` Your Quicken file contained invalid transaction types '' . It does not list out what transactions had problems . Other accounts have the wrong balances and no explanation at all . Some transactions are missing for no apparent reason.OK , so I resigned myself to stepping through each account to try and find the problem transactions . I found the problem in one of my mutual fund accounts
 This is the worst software purchase I have made in the past 2 years ! The password protection -- Passport vs. standard -- is extremely confusing . The fact that the software talks with Microsoft gives me the creepy feeling that it 's collecting data on me . I do not like the idea of an institution like Microsoft having complete access to my monetary data . This idea of remote access is rubbish . In my entire life I have never ever needed to check how my investments were doing while in the middle of a busy day . Not only does it have all my information , it also has a nice little banner that cheerfully asks me to Upgrade Today to Microsoft Money 2005 . I paid for this software , and I 'd appreciate that , if Microsoft wants real estate on my desktop it should pay for it !! The amazing thing is that , while it uploads my most materially important information to MSN.com and forces an advertisement in my face , the anti-adware/spyware softwares do not even detect this hellish piece of trash . I 'm seriously considering going back to Money 99 .
 Do not buy ! Worst game ever ! The graphics are terrible . And its confusing ! there 's no manual !!!
 There is n't one reason to get this update if you alerady have MS Money 2003 Deluxe and Business.Wait until 2005 when they actually might include some real reasons to upgrade .
 I brought this because I have a small business and I wanted something I could use but also affordable . No one told me that this software doesnt ' work with Windows XP . So I called Microsoft Tech team for assistance , they told me that do n't have any technical information that could solve my problem for Microsoft Money 2004 . They had helpful tools , hints , solving problem issues , for 2003 , 2005 & 2006 but not 2004 so they were useless . The problems is that software didnt ' give me the option to input my user name just password so every time I tried to log in it would tell me invalid username & password . Instead of giving me a box to enter my username it only gave me a file destination location . TRUST me , this software does n't work with XP .
 I will not upgrade from 2002 version , even though invoices are not very customisabe . The only problem 2002 had was you could not save your invoice design for use , if you need to reinstal . And it does not seem that it is fixed in this version . So I will not purchase this product this year . I may even switch to Quicken .
 There are more than one reason not to buy this product ! 1 -RRB- All support for MS MONEY is now in INDIA and the folks there smile a lot while talking to you , but they do not know the product .2 -RRB- There are major software bugs in the software - features that worked in MS MONEY 2003 are broken in 2004 and MS knows about them but refuses to fix them ! 3 -RRB- Is a very hard product to install if you have MS MONEY 2003 and are upgrading - more so than the 2003 install was over 2002 . So if you want to ensure US employment of folks in the USA , then do n't buy this product .
 As with many other Microsoft software products , it appears that some software who has n't used the program decides that some feature or interface that has been around forever long is now passe or that a new and different feature is just the thing that everybody wants -LRB- Bob , Clippy , etc. -RRB- . Microsoft Money is a prime example of a strange new interface.Some things I like , but I am doing extra work to get results.In Quicken , budgets could be entered in a spreadsheet format so you could see budget categories on the left and months across the top with totals for each month and each category AND you could decide exactly what the budget should be . Does Microsoft follow this simple and effective approach ... Nooooo ? You mark an item as recurring and it automatically with no `` should-this-be-part-of-your-budget '' question . Theoretically this seems like no big deal , but it does n't work right . I spent most of a Sunday afternoon trying to stop paychecks from appearing twice . It is n't just items appearing twice , it 's my monthly parking that simply refuses to show up even though I 've done exactly the same steps as my paycheck . I guess I 'll stay with it , but I will be trying Quicken .
 One of the real values of these products is to import or autmatically update your transaction history for various accounts . There is more support for Quicken than MS-Money . Even though MS-Money claims these can be converted , it is n't by any means consistant . Wan na buy my MS-Money version , I switching back to Quicken ?!
 At $ 20 -LRB- after rebate -RRB- this is way overpriced . For all practical purposes , this is a glorified spreadsheet . All the extra things are merely annoyances or little gotcha 's that you have to fork over even more $ $ to microsoft to use . If this is an improvement over previous versions , I 'm glad this is the first one I 've used . I could n't even use it to edit a simple budget after I 'd entered only one -LRB- ! -RRB- scheduled deposit . Overall , annoying and worthless . I 'll buy quicken next time .
 I recieved this product with my new dell computer and have been trying to figure it out for the past 3 weeks ! I was hoping it would be somewhat easy to use , but no luck ! I am now going to buy quicken 2004 because this product is in my opinion poorly built . I am not a computer saavy person , so hopefully quciken will not be as confusing .
 Microsoft Money has encountered a problem and needs to close . We are sorry for the inconvenience ... Please tell Microsoft about this problem ... I just received the product this afternoon . I install it and even restart my PC many times . It still can not ever start ... Really disappointed . DO NO BUY THIS PRODUCT !
 I just bought this product . After installation , I can not even start it . It really sucks .
 ... Basically , Online services are now a `` SUBSCRIPTION '' service and will self destruct -LRB- ie stop working -RRB- after a period of time and FORCE you to upgrade to a new version.Thanks , but NO Thanks Microsoft . What a way to force users to upgrade to Quicken or some other competitior . Wo n't be long until your copy of Windows will stop booting 2 years after you installed it . `` Online services valid two or three years from first use . Online bill pay , downloading transactions from your financial institution , downloading stock quotes , and the ability to synchronize with MSN Money Plus or MSN Money expire two years from first use of Microsoft Money Standard or September 1 , 2006 , whichever is earlier . Online bill pay , downloading transactions from your financial institution , downloading stock quotes , and the ability to synchronize with MSN Money Plus or MSN Money expire three years from first use of Microsoft Money 2004 Premium or September 1 , 2007 , whichever is earlier . ''
 I purchased Microsoft Money to keep track of my monthly budget and a couple of small investments that I had . While there is some good stuff there , Money has quite a few shortcomings which make it much less than what I expected.The Good - Connects directly with financial websites such as Ameritrade to download stock portfolio information and banks to get check information which is then seemlessly integrated into your budget/analysis/etc . Very useful.The Bad - Confusing interface which was hard to transfer from one view to another - No financial tools to analyze your holdings . No ROI , no NPV , no aggregate betas , nothing beyond stocks current price . - No way to aggregate accounts of stocks and bonds or to analyze your holdings across accounts . - The budgeting software was not very effective . It was hard to categorize checks . You had to do it one-by-one in a process that takes a pretty long time . - If there was an automatic bill-pay mechanism , I did n't figure it out.OverallFor my needs , I would not buy this product again . I thought about upgrading to the professional version , but did not see that it addressed the problems of the standard version.There is really nothing in Money that you ca n't do just as easily in an Excel worksheet and a Yahoo! Finance portfolio . In many ways , Yahoo 's free web service is superior to Microsoft 's software .
 Go to the Money 2004 site and READ the FAQ . Basically , if you convert from Quicken or an older version you can never go export your data back out . No version of Quicken can read Money 2004 and no older version of Money can read 2004 . Also this version has a subscription service which you need to renew in order to keep it going . A last it is fully integrated with . net , which I do n't find a good thing . Even when you turn off all the features to make sure your financial data does not get sent anyway , the product still finds a way of bombarding you with the latest and greatest financial news , at least the way MSN sees it . Stick to you 're old tried and true , or you 'll find yourself up late reinputting all your last months transaction . It 's 3:53 am now ...
 If I could give this `` application '' no stars I would . `` Features '' within the application are nothing more than a direct link to several of Microsoft 's websites . When I inquired about deactivating these `` features '' , Microsoft 's reply was essentially `` sorry , this is part of the software . `` As an avid and loyal user of Money since 2001 , I will be switching to another package or trying to find my MS Money 2001 disks.I already owned Money 2001 Standard Edition and expected similar feature sets in Money 2005 Standard ... oops . If you want `` retirement accounts '' , you need to purchase the 2005 Deluxe . If want the monthly Cash Flow forecast -LRB- like in Money 2001 -RRB- , that feature is GONE!This is nothing more than brochure-ware for Microsoft 's web sites , YOU have to pay for it , AND M$ has the audacity to actually have pop-up messages built into the product ASKING YOU TO UPGRADE . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I downloaded the free trial of Money from Microsoft 's website and decided to give it a try . The trial runs for 2 months and it allows you to do pretty much the same things as in the full versions.My first impressions are mixed . On one side , the interface is very slick and it sure looks like a good tool for managing everything . On the other side , my Excel files do the same thing for free , lacking only cool graphics and buttons.While updating accounts seemed to work pretty fast , what it updates is a mess . I spent most my time working with my Brokerage account , since that was my main interest . For once , while the stocks were imported correctly , the tools were showing me bad stocks as leaders that make me the most money . Follow that and you 'll either become a Warren Buffet or file for bankruptcy ... Second , the info was really not personalized . I was being sent to the MSN Money site for further information or for plotting the stock shares evolution ... Well , how can I say this
 I was sailing along quite happy with my lil ole Money Standard 2000 . I used the budgeting and reporting some , but mostly just kept track of my accounts and downloaded bank activity . THEN my bank upgraded and `` recommended '' we upgrade to the most recent version of Money . Oh , WHAT A MISTAKE ! I hate it . Downloading items from the bank website , Money just enters them into your statement , matches the entry with a VERY wrong mate . I think it looks at your upcoming bills before it actually looks at the transactions -LRB- which , okay , I do n't always have entered exactly right penny for penny -RRB- . Before , in 2000-land , I did n't know how good I had it matching entries . A simple 8-transaction download can take 15 minutes at a minimum . Way , way too time consuming for something that 's supposed to make my life easier . I ca n't imagine that ANY product testing was done before this was released . Save your money if you can . I 'll deal with it until I ca n't stand it anymore and then convert to Quicken . ARRGHHH .
 I wanted to update my old Quicken software because it has a clunky way of editing your entry errors . Quicken does calculate correctly . I purchased Money 2004 Deluxe edition and installed it . It imported my data from the Quicken files correctly . However , when handling bond fund transactions , it does so incorrectly . To make the values turn out correctly , it has to fudge the numbers -LRB- number of shares and prices -RRB- because it assumes you are holding individual bonds rather than shares in a bond fund . I talked this over with the Microsoft person over the MSN chat room and got a stupid answer . In going to their old help files , I found this was a problem with Money 2001-it appears to still be a problem . Quicken does this correctly -- I am going to trade in the Money 2004 for an new version of Quicken . This is a serious problem .
 I was VERY dissapointed with this product . Every CD I tried to burn had a coaster or failed withought a warning on my computer . I have used other bad products before , so I bought this one hoping it would be better than the others . . but I was heavily dissapointed . Never judge a book by it 's cover . . or in this case , never judge a BURNER by it 's name . I have done the burning process many times before this , and I was shocked at how easy it was at first , but then during the copying of my files and other complications of CD 's , I was shocked by how my computers responded to the product . I think that you should spend your money on something worth the dough ... and not something that could be better .
 In reading the description , I was expecting that it would guide a child in writing their own book . NOT SO . It just has a story written out , and blanks for the child to fill in . It is NOT their own book . My daughter , who is 9 years old , is very much into writing and has written many chapters of her own imagination . I thought this product was going to help her fine-tune it and guide her along proper techniques and examples of how to perfect her writing into a book that she can be ready to publish . So , beware . This program is already a story written , just fill in the blanks .
 As my daughter enjoys reading and writing stories , I thought this program would be fun . But to my disappointment , she did n't like it , as all it was is a fill in the blank program , and the program writes the story for you .
 Like some of the other reviewers have said , all you do is fill in some one word answers in a story that 's already written . Thought my child was going to get to do alot more creative writing .
 This is NOT `` Books By You ! '' This is `` Books By John Lithgow ! '' The description is misleading . I thought this software would enable my daughter -LRB- age 9 -RRB- to write and print her own books . NOT SO . Kids are simply filling in the blanks of provided stories . My daughter played with this for 20 minutes and has n't touched it since . Absolutely UNINSPIRING ! A waste of money .
 Books by You no longer works . Knowledge Adventure says they were sued and can no longer sell it themselves . If you make and then try to publish a book , it wo n't work . It was once a great product , but now it 's worthless .
 Think twice before purchasing this software . We have had it about 3 years and the first time we printed a book it worked fine , but now , after my daughter spent a few hours creating the fill-in text for this book , it will not upload properly and there is no support on the Knowledge Adventure website . In fact , I called the support number which says it is open until 9 pm -LRB- Eastern Time -RRB- and I called at 7:50 pm and the recording not only says they are closed , but they will reopen on `` Monday . '' Today is Tuesday and there are no holidays this week ! It appears that there is no way to get support for using the software or printing the books . It was going to be a Christmas gift for my daughter and she was so excited . The publishing company , LuLu.com , no longer has the appropriate uploader for uploading the files for the books made with Books By You -LRB- and it took me over an hour with their Live Chat to finally get an answer on that -RRB- . Your only option is to print the -LRB- PDF -RRB- document of your book on your own printer . If you 're willing to only have that type of copy , you can get the software .
 The quality of this publishers product line has declined dramatically . The Pro CD and Info USA line used to be invaluable to our firm and the previously easy to use database marketing tools now have limits and features rendering them essentially useless . Info USA 's 2001 YellowPages main menu is now a clunking wanna-be web browser designed to push users to their web site rather than aid consumers in using the data contained on the CD ; the one purchased ! Anyone with info on another publishers product please let me know asap c/o ExAir@GTE.net
 When researching new clients , we used to work with the 1998 version . It allowed the sorting of potential clients but it also permitted the printing of labels to send promotional material . This new version limits the ability to export the data or print labels . Also , it will not allow you to purchase only the segment of the country you use most often . Furthermore , their service , technical support and sales team is horrendous . They are so busy selling you labels for 8 cents a piece that forget to customize the service to the clie n't needs . Not worth for small businesses who want to target customers other than by phone .
 You can only access 1000 records and then you have to pay more to get more . This is a terrible rip-off . Feel free to contact me on e-mail and I will tell you more . Just do n't buy it and you will be happy . This is not the good stuff they had two years ago !
 This program is a good program for researching phone numbers by category or just a listing with one big exception . You are limited by the number of time you can use it . No one tells you this , it just suddenly do n't work . Forcing you to call USA info , then being told you will have to pay for additional usage.They will allow you limited usage free but , you 'll soon ran out of that , then you PAY !
 SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY -- Do not purchase this software unless you ONLY want to use it for reference . If you intend to use it to print mailing labels , or even to print any type of list , you are only allowed to print 1,000 names , then you will be forced to purchase additional names @ 10 cents per name ; or as was quoted to me I could purchase 25,000 names for $ 1,000 . If I had wanted to spend $ 1,000 for mailing labels , I would n't have paid $ 65 for this software .
 I used to love ProCD products , but since InfoUSA bought ProCD the pricing and quality of the products are awful . I really hope another company emerges to compete with InfoUSA .
 I have Pro-cd select phone 1997 , I thought I would like to have a later edition , so I purchased Pro-cd select phone 2001 . What a let down , nothing like the earlier edition , this one must have been written by someone who wrote programs for free , well Pro-cd sure got their moneys worth . Save your money get all phone books from all the states takes more time to look up but at least it would be hassel free.I would advise everyone to by pass this program .
 It willonly let you export 1000 names for printing purposes then they want you to pay annualy for limited information . Do not buy this product . ...
 In my past life , I used the phone disc power finder in my research efforts back in 1997-1998 and found them to be the best business productivity tools on the market . The `` superman '' of market research products . Upon using the latest versions of the phone disc , I find myself in some `` bizarro '' world and left utterly speechless . In a span of 2 years , they have destroyed what was once an essential business tool . While , the basic setup is essentially the same , they now limit mass exports to other software programs forcing you to buy more export privilege . I for one am outraged not necessarily at the fact that I have to pay more to export listings , but that infousa can get away with this bs . Anyone know of any alternative vendors . . give me a ring . . please .
 Do not buy this it is not what it used to be . dont waste your money !!!!!
 The Corel Linux OS was written over 11 years ago and is TOTALLY obsolete.It never ran well to begin with , honestly . Corel rushed it to market to jump on the early Linux bandwagon . After huge financial losses and thousands of unhappy customers , Corel shuttered their Linux division and sold it to Xandros.This software is n't worth the box it came in - save your money . It wo n't work on your computer and it 's only worth about $ 5.00 for souvenir value .
 This movie-making software does not even offer scrolling titles or text , unless you upgrade it to Plus or Ultimate version . What kind of so called video editor does n't even offer that?This video is bare bone basic video editing , I used to use Arcsoft Showbiz from 2002 and it has better features than this piece of junk . I only upgraded to Studio because the product was compatible with windows Vista , however , Microsoft 's movie maker software is even better - how pathetic.Don ' t waste your money , now I have to spend another $ 80 to upgrade to the plus version of this software to get any usability out of it . Then each feature you want to add to the editor is another $ 20 - $ 100 , by entering activation codes . Pinnacle nickle and dimes you every step of the way . This is the last time I will purchase a Pinnacle product .
 I had Pinnacle Studio Version 10 with a computer with an XP operating system . When I got a new computer running Vista , the Pinnacle Studio Version 10 would not work . So , I bought version 11 that was advertised to work with Vista . It does n't work . I can capture the audio portions of VHS tapes but for video , I get only a still of the first frame of each clip .
 My order was received promptly . I found it difficult to install and had to uninstall and reinstall 3 times before it installed the full program properly . Still having trouble with it recording onto a DVD+R or - R. Will only record to a DVD R/W and then I have to go to another program to make a copy onto a DVD+R .
 Do n't waste your time with this software , it will not work at all , period ! I spent over two full days just trying to get it to see my DVD Burner , it never did . It is also prone to frequent crashes and glitches . It wo n't behave the same way twice ! I do n't know how Pinnacle got this software on the market , but I now have a $ 50 coaster .
 This software will not do many of the things it claims , unless you pay for the $ 49.99 upgrade to `` Studio Plus 11 '' . I am running XP pro with dual processors 4GB ram and 2 ea 500gb sata drives and dual layer dvd writer . The software locks up every time i try to write to dvd . The included `` Bonus dvd '' does nothing but take up space because all of the features must be purchased seprately for additional cost . If you must buy this software buy the `` plus '' version right off and save yourself $ 10.00 -LRB- this software plus the upgrade is $ 90.00 , the plus version is $ 80.00 -RRB-
 Pinnacle 's Serial Numbers and Activation Keys expire after two years.This applies to all Pinnacle software , not just software downloaded online . Activation Keys bought online AND Serial Numbers for software bought in retail stores only work for two years.It 's in the fine print - which you ca n't even see until you rip open the box -LRB- thereby forfeiting your right to a refund -RRB- and click the `` Yes , I Agree '' button during installation.If you have to reinstall the program -LRB- or any part of it -RRB- two years and a day after buying it , you will have to completely repurchase the software.What 's especially fishy about Pinnacle is how it will suddenly start crashing at 2 years after initial installation . My video drivers stopped working at a point , I 'd later realize , coincident with the 2 year anniversary of my having installed the Pinnacle software.In trying to fix the suspiciously-timed program crash I was mystified to learn that a number clearly printed on a CD sleeve was suddenly `` Not a Valid Serial Number . '' The Activation Keys I 'd bought online , and had on file , were suddenly incorrect.I contacted Pinnacle , who informed me of the two year statement in the agreement . Here is an excerpt from their email : `` The reason you are not able to obtain a redownload of your purchase isthat the Extended Download Service was not purchased with your downloadand the time to purchase this service has expired . Unfortunately , thismeans that in order to obtain the product , you will need to repurchaseit . `` Keep in mind - I was asking Pinnacle for no software . All I needed was a Serial Number and Activation Keys , because the Serial Number printed on the CD sleeve itself , and the Activation Keys I 'd received two years earlier no longer worked.Just something you might want to keep in mind before buying Pinnacle software .
 I have been using an old copy of Pinnacle Studio 8 to make videos . I had some complaints about the software , but figured most of those issues would be resolved in 11 . Unfortunately , 11 is just as buggy as 8 is , and even more crippled . The software expects extra licenses to upgrade features previously available in the standard version of 8 . Some of these features -LRB- multiple menus on a single DVD for example -RRB- are not well documented on the site when deciding which version to purchase.Making even a single menu in the software was n't easy , as the software does n't do what you would expect it to , or even do what it did the last time . It would shift titles I gave to each chapter , and the screenshots for each chapter would sometimes change.On the positive side , the software rendered my movie a lot faster than the previous version . It also seemed to calculate the free space on a DVD a little better , which used to be an annoyance in the older version.Overall , the software functions , but I still think it needs work . If you have a previous version , I 'd reconsider what is making you upgrade , and try and determine if this version really addresses it or not .
 the audio is glitchy ... if you tell it to pause it just keeps playing . It has nothing a real video editor needs or wants unless you pay up the wazoo for the upgrade ... this version of the product is the most basic P.O.S. I have ever witnessed . It wo n't play properly unless you load the clip completely , when I used Sony Vegas , you could start editing without waiting two hours for Pinnacle to go , `` oh yeah ... there is a clip there ... sorry about that '' to only have the audio s -- nd l -- th-s . It 's ridiculous ! Not to mention it reads very few files ... seems to really only read AVI -LRB- which is a massive file and difficult to hold a large amount of clips on one computer -- hello , video editing ? -RRB- and wmv ... which I ca n't think of a single camera that records in that file . So if you have any other file ... you need to download a third party program to convert the file over ... which adds even more time to your editing . I work as a video editor -LRB- at home -RRB- and for one of my clients , it takes an entire day to edit ONE video simply because of having to convert , load , edit , and render . It 's a piece of crap .
 Nothing but problems , as some of the other reviews point out . Even after upgrades , still freezes and can not burn DVDs . There is no customer `` service '' , just words which are unhelpful . They want you to buy more . Just another corrupt greedy company ...
 Software constantly locks up or crashes . Customer support is non-existant . The main purpose of this software is not to edit video , but rather to try to sell you upgrades and `` premium content '' . It wo n't recognize either of my DVD drives , so I ca n't use it to burn DVD 's after making videos . Lots of bugs that cause editing problems too . A huge waste of money and lots of frustration . I was a sucker this time , but will never buy a Pinnacle product again . I should have listened to the comments from the people who reviewed it . Just look at all the other bad reviews .
 I bought this so I could convert mpeg2 files to divx ... I 've spent multiple HOURS trying to get the feature to work . Support is available on a VERY limited basis , and they do n't know how to solve the problem anyway . They always send you a link to a faq that says the problem used to exist , but that it 's been fixed ... not so . Stay away from pinnacle . They make a poor product , and then want to charge extra to get support for it and try to get it to do what it 's supposed to do . How do I get my money back ?
 I 've used Pinnacle Studio since version 1.06 and it seems that with each new release software quality deteriorates more and more . Studio has severe problems capturing analog video -LRB- from Pinnacle 's own capture card no less -RRB- and corrupts portions of video during editing / rendering . Support is horrible to say the least - after an email exchange where all suggestions were taken from FAQ I was told that my issue is redirected to `` level 2 support '' which apparently stands for `` black hole '' . I 've never heard back and further emails went unanswered.The bottom line - spend your money elsewhere .
 I installed this software and as soon as I launched it my computer crashed.I uninstalled it , removed all traces from the registry and reinstalled itand it still crashes.I have Intel QX6700 quad core processor EVGA 8800gts640 and 3mb of ram , more than whats needed for this software.Not Only that but Vista sucks too .
 Pinnacle version 11 does not install on my pc because the install disk is a dvd , which is not video that my windows xp will recognize on my pc . If Pinnacle goes back to cd install -LRB- I have version 10 -RRB- on another pc -RRB- then buy it . Otherwise stay away from it . I threw out my DVD install disk because it is useless . Only a trick to buy a more expensive program .
 The CD did not work with my Vista Windows . It would not load at all so I could n't use it .
 The software seemed really good ... until I ran into a glitch . I was only part way through the beginning feature when I could not advance to the next section . When I reported the error to tech support , they were no help , saying they would address it in the next revision .
 I bought this on impulse at a Toys ' R Us in Ottawa while on a care trip , so I may have a Canadian edition . First , the upside
 My 4 year old is just learning to use the computer . The games in this software are creative but the navigation is not user friendly . First , it uses only a small square in the center of your screen . You choose a game from the delightful menu but you can not get out and back to the menu if you want to move on . The games are much too long for my son 's attention span and I had to use the task manager to quit the program if when I wanted to leave without finishing the game . I am very new in the kid software realm and could have been missing something but this was much tougher to use than any of the others I 've bought .
 It feels like the programmers rushed this game to market without putting it through beta testing -LRB- the testing where people who act as real players put the game through its paces -RRB- . The failure to remember game progress and the need to completely exit the game at certain stages are incredibly annoying for both parent and child .
 I have fond memories of playing with math blaster and reading blaster as a kid on an Apple IIc . However , as a parent , I do n't feel that this updated version of reading blaster would have much educational value . It is not suitable for kids still learning their phonics , but perhaps may provide limited fun for kids who are more advanced . The games are too easy to succeed at by simply guessing at all the words -LRB- there are no penalties or buzzing sounds for wrong answers -RRB- . I would not consider this to be a useful educational title .
 My son and I love to play the daily puzzle of the game of SET at the website setgame.com . Naturally we were excited to see that this version listed `` Includes online play '' as a feature , because we have multiple PC 's at home on our home network.The CD version I received gives the error message `` Sorry , your IP address is invalid for this Demo Version '' when we try multi-player mode . Then I realized communications options lists only 3 modem speeds - 1200 , 2400 and 9600 baud.Cmon folks - This is the year 2005
 This program does NOT say on the box that it only supports rectangle and square digital pictures . In fact , when looking at the box , it clearly shows ovals and specialty shaped photographs plopped right on the templates ! Once you have opened the program and installed it , only THEN do you discover such is not available.It is neither fast , easy , nor fun to print and cut when you want to E-MAIL something on a template . UGH . Do NOT waste your money on THIS Hallmark program . The Hallmark name should not have gone on this.It 's not even ONE star -- it 's a TURKEY .
 If you are planning to use with digital photos , do n't get this one . You must actually do the cutting to place photos . Has a lot to it but most is useless if you plan to design and print with your pictures .
 I was so happy to get this , but then so disappointed . I have all the Hallmark Card programs , and love them.I thought you could import your phtos , and they would fit right into the shapes of the templates , like the photo projects in the card programs , but they do n't , and it 's a pain to try to get them to fit in just right , and then they look distorted.I think it also caused problems with my other Hallmark programs because I 'm having gliches there that I did n't have before .
 I just bought this software today and ca n't tell you how disappointed I am with it . It installed just fine , but every time I try to work on one of the templates it `` freezes '' in the middle of loading and crashes my computer . This is the most frustrating experience I 've EVER had with ANY kind of software , I 've even tried uninstalling and re-installing and it still does the same thing . I have the Hallmark Card Studio and loved it , but I ca n't believe this program is made by the same people . This one 's going back to the store as fast as I can drive !
 I originally bought the Scrapbook Studio Deluxe , and although I loved the pre-made templates and graphics , was very disappointed that I could n't get my photos into the layout in the fancy shapes it showed -LRB- not even an oval ! -RRB- . When I saw the upgraded version , I quickly bought it , hoping that I would now be able to layer my downloaded or scanned photos into the templates without them becoming distorted or having to manipulate it in another program . Not the case ! If working with squares or rectangles I could manipulate my images , but it just is n't user friendly . I ca n't even crop my photo in the scrapbook program , so I have to estimate in another program and bring it over . My understanding is that the intent of the program , or any scrapbook program is to display and preserve your photos in a creative and appealing way . I do n't want to print out a template and manually cut the hole and lay it over my photo . I want it all done in the program . Also , I have noticed that if I tilt a picture to accommodate the layout , it prints out fuzzy with all the pixels at the edges showing . This has not been a problem in other scrapbook programs I have used , nor is it an issue with my printer which is excellent at printing photos . Once again I am highly disappointed that the program did not live up to all that it has the potential for . I will be returning this second version since I am still within the 90 day money back guarantee and hope that the engineers in R&D can create a program to actually work hand in hand with downloaded and scanned photos , and can reproduce images at a much higher quality !
 I just bought this and I will be returning it . It has alot of nice templates but they are set up for the pictures to go OVER them which means they have to be shaped and cropped to the exact size of the boxes . What is worse is that when you import your picture into the graphics holders on the page it stretches the image , losing the original aspect ratio . If you want to crop the picture it actually says you must load up the included utility and change the picture there , then import it . Anyone with any experience with this kind of thing will immediately realize how ridiculous a concept that is . What a dissapointment . I wish I read the review here before I bought , now I have to waste my time further with a trip back to the store .
 Why would you want to buy a scrapbook program where you have to print out the pages , cut holes for the pictures , then lay the template over your photos ? You would n't ! This software does not place the picture behind the template frame like almost every photo program has been doing for years . It 's utterly absurd that to make scrapbook pages in this software you have to crop your photo to the frame and try and get it to fit exaclty and try to maintain aspect ratio mannually . I 'm amazed at how nice the templates are and how bad the software is . This one is going back !
 I had the previous edition for Win98 and thought the new edition for WinXP would have fixed the previous problems but it has not . I was able to load the software fine and it runs well , and the pre-designed templates are great ! But ... it still wo n't allow you to import digital photos to shapes other than squares/rectangles . So , at least half of the templates are useless unless you enjoy printing the template and manually cutting out the design -LRB- star , oval or circle -RRB- and putting a hard copy photo behind the shape . Yes , it is more like real scrapbooking , but come on ! I know the technology is out there and it is just a matter of layering . Wait until Hallmark wakes up and smells the Elmers and makes a top-knotch scrapbook program ... which we can only hope will come soon !

 It is so frustrating because you ca n't work a 2 page spread with the two pages side by side . I 've only used this for printing out some clip art and/or sayings and such . And when I 've used it for a full page layout , it always leaves a 1/2 inch boarder around the edges of white ... I know that 's a printer issue but it 's still annoying . I would never use it for a full page layout .
 I saw this in the store the other day and thought what a wonderful idea !! Considering the Hallmark name , I thought it had to be decent . I hate it . I put in the time to learn how to use it . I have a technical bachelors degree and work in the IT field , so you 'd think I 'd be computer savvy enough to use this . I have hundreds of digital photos and was quite upset to see the note in the instructions to only use the square or retangular templates with digital photos . What ??!! That makes it useless to me . $ 20 down the toilet .
 I was very anxious to receive the Hallmark Scrapbook Studio . The day it came in the mail , I installed it on my computer only to find it did not work . Each time I tried to use a pre-designed template , my computer would crash . I was unable to use the software even after contacting Sierra for advice . My computer exceeds the operating requirements yet the software did not work . I would not recommend this software .
 Despite the higher quality clipart/graphics -LRB- I ca n't deny that Hallmark has some REALLY nice stuff in there ! -RRB- the ways in which this application `` simplifies '' things just are n't friendly or functional . Just frustrating .
 OK ... so the product is probably 3 stars in terms of functionality ... but one of the main reasons I purchased Ejay pro was so that I could blend songs using their fade in/out features.My initial problem is that I ca n't burn anything using Ejay . It took 6 weeks for their tech support to get back to me regarding my issue . I even gave them the model number & link to Plextor 's site . It turns out that they do n't support Ejay on XP . Period . Nice . They did n't even offer a work-around . Thanks for wasting 6 weeks of my life . I 'll be returning the product and picking up Roxio 's ... . at least they 're up on the technology .
 This software is an example of wasting a perfectly good CD-ROM .
 It took three days for them to answer my first email with `` what version of windows are you running ? '' as a response . I emediatly sent back a response and 3 days later I still have n't heard back from them . The product will not rip from cd 's in ` normal ' mode , only ` fast ' mode which makes the music sound like garbage .
 Age appropriateness
 This game has excellant vusals and a nice audio track . My daughter is 4 years old , and for about2 years I have been buying educational CDs . This CD is definitly not an educational one , but has a nice game that could be interesting the first time around.The glaring omissions are :1 . No educational content in the game .2 . Every time you play the game , the same sequence is played .3 . No different levels.If you have not tried it , I strongly recommend Dr.Seuss Pre-school CD-ROM . I saw great reviews for this CD that prompted me to buy it , but am very disapoointed .
 For a 3-5 years old -LRB- what is recommended -RRB- , it is very confusingand boring . There is little help , and not enough animation andfun games to play .
 As far as I can tell , this running natively on OS X is it 's biggest plus.To start with , none of the three year olds I know can play this . It requires solid mouse skills , a good memory and reasonably complex problem solving . Next , I did n't see any kind of documentation or referencing of the mini-games and spent the whole game wondering if I was supposed to be collecting these marbles and trying to find an apparently non-existant use for them.The chapter format does give specific tasks -- sometimes . It also blocks off areas of Ollo 's world , presumably to make completing the current task easier . But ending the game did n't allow special access to the mini-games or any other special features , which I 'd kind of expected . Also , it did n't look like it would vary any if you played it again , but I ca n't be sure.It just did n't seem that fun or that interesting . Kids old enough to master the skills required will probably be bored with it ; those younger will need help . My kids all prefer Pajama Sam -- they may not be able to finish the game without help , but they have a * whole * lot more fun just playing around with it . And if you 're actually looking for a toddler game to run on OS X , the new Reader Rabbit 2002 * seems * to run natively for me -LRB- it 's not using 9 in any case -RRB- and is * vastly * superior for the three and under crowd .
 Disney continues to market games with graphics that would have been considered to be poor over 10 years ago . It 's amazing to me how they can charge so much for such a terrible product . The only recent game that I 've seen that was worse than this is Disney 's Lilo & Stitch Trouble in Paradise !
 I ca n't believe they say this game is for 5-10 yearolds ! It is SO SLOW ! You spend alot of time going backand forth , there is ALOT of repetition . The charactersmove slowly and you have to keep going back and forthto different spots to find different things you needto get the treasure . It is no where near as fun orentertaining as Pajama Sam , I ca n't believe the samepeople made this game . Huge disappointment !
 This product does not work on Treo 650 . It sent my phone into an endless cycle of reboots , I ended up having to do a hard reset to remove the application.The AIM Mobile and AOL Mobile both did not work !!!!!!
 THIS GAME IS SIMPLY A RIP-OFF ALL CARS GAMES , AND FOR THE REVIEW WHO SAID MARIO KART LOOKS LIKE SH ## YOU DO N'T HAVE IDEA THAN MARIO KART IS BETTER THAN THIS TRASH .
 Unfortunately , I never received the game from my selected seller because he did n't have it for my console . So too bad .
 This product is cumbersome - it is like something from the 1980 's . I expected something useful and more up to date .
 Jan. 3 , 2010 review
 The product is cumbersome , very difficult to work with . I ended up using a sample Plan and making modifications , which I could have done for a fraction of the cost . The questions do n't produce answers that make it easy to create a good plan . The cut and paste feature is no help . The thought process to create a plan is not smooth . I regret making the purchase .
 This was purchased to obtain the maps of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail . The AT is administrated and owned by the National Park Service , If so , then why is it not included in this map set?Had I known this I would not have purchased this set of CDs . The description did not indicate that that 2175 mile long trail was not included .
 3D Globe does n't seem to DO anything much . Click on a city name and it does nothing . Click on ANYTHING and it does nothing . It does n't even zoom closer than a standard state highway map . So the globe rotates and shows night and day ... and you can look up cities and countries . You can do that with an encyclopedia . By comparison , Encarta is a thrill ride IMHO.To me this software performs like something from the $ 1.00 CD clearance rack .
 I too , have installed lots of software but I 'm not impressed with this one -- firstly , I tried it on Win98se -- message
 Hi , I have installed lots of software , but Red Shift 5.0 has me stumped ! I tried on-line to register my SN , but it keeps giving me a ` error ' . Also no email support ! I tried there on-line web support , but it said my probelm did not fit a certain creteria so had to just give up . I might add I can run the program if I use the CD each time , but since I could n't register I now wo n't be able to update any of the comets data , etc. . I had expected better!Wally . .
 I tried to use this software in a school setting and it simply would not work for long . I got the same error message as others have gotten . If it was reliable it would probably be an excellent educational reaource . Too bad .
 What a piece of crap . The Start-Up/Welcome movie plays on an endless loop no matter which of the three installations you choose and the only way to kill it is Control/Alt/Delete which , then , kills the program as well and then you start the whole game all over again . According to the manual , you will always need to use the CD to access the software unless you use the CD Key , yet you are never allowed to get that far because you will be forever stuck in the tedious ten minute Welcome loop.Save your money . Do not but this . It is worthless . Spend the extra money on Starry Night or something that is n't a complete rip off .
 This program does not install as described . I have Windows XP . Lots of available memory . The main disc installed , but did not prompt me to insert the second disk . Maybe that 's why most options on the main disc menu are not enabled ? I 've tried to install the second disc separately . It does not work properly . Very hard to navigate . I did n't pay much , but expected everything offered to work . Complete waste of money , no matter what you spend .
 The program will not update . I purchased it April 9 , and sat down on the 14th -LRB- procrastination is a strong suit of mine -RRB- to do my taxes using the business edition . Whenever I tried to download the latest forms It kept freezing up . You can not submit it until it is updated . I visited the web site , did everything it suggested . Spent an hour on the phone with `` tech '' support , who basically walked me through what the web site said . Then said well you will have to call customer service to get the update cd . Customer Service Charged me -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB- to overnight it to me . I understand they have to recoup CD and Shipping costs , but just put it somewhere where I can download it and I would be happy . The personal solution is good , the business is poor . Do n't buy it .
 I purchased this product to file taxes for a prior year -LRB- business -RRB- . The software was clumsy to use , not intuitive , and a bit hard to navigate . But I got through it . You may have to fill some forms manually , and if that is the case , the system offers very little instruction on whether you are doing it right . Still , I appreciated the final error checking and access to all the 2002 forms I would possibly use . The 2002 version is not great software , but it sure beats doing it by hand .
 I give it 0 stars . We used it for a small business and it was a pain in the neck . It was n't easy to use like TurboTax . One example
 I 've been extremely pleased with the personal TaxCut for several years , moving over when TurboTax got too bloated and Intuit too cocky . However I 've stayed with Business TurboTax because of the import capability from QuickBooks.QuickBooks , now also bloated and chock full of full of Intuit product promotions , has infuriated me with Intuit products in general . After reading about their fiasco with product reg protection in the personal TurbopTax , I decided to make the jump this year , import convenience be damned.TaxCut Platinum made sense since I 'm using their personal module and I frankly expected the same level of polish on the business version . However running the 1120 module reminded me of the old DOS tax programs I used way back in the late 1980s . It really is sloppy and non-intuitive . As the others mentioned , I 'm shocked that re-opening a company does n't take you to an auto bookmark , but instead to the first interview page . And forms management is non-existent . It 's nice to have a live Q&A window on each data entry sequence , but it 's tiny and non-scalable . And maybe it 's a registry bind with my XP Pro system , but I ca n't resize or minimize the program window - it 's full screen or nothing.But it did prepare the return , and did so at half the price of Intuit 's offering . Still , Block really needs to go over this thing though , because it 's no where near the quality of their personal module .
 For several years up to 2002 , I used TurboTax from Intuit - both the business and personal editions . Using TurboTax has been a pretty sucky semi-manual process that I 've never been happy with . Believing some erroneous reviews -LRB- thanks for nothing Walt Mossberg from the WSJ -RRB- , I vented my frustration by using TaxCut this year . It is horrific . It probably would have been easier to do my business returns by hand -LRB- even with having to look up calculations for depreciation -RRB- . The other reviews cover most of the probs
 I bought Tax Cut Platinum Business version . The help system is really lousy . Very skimpy . The interface is not intuitive . And worst of all , fter spending 20 minutes figuring it out and filling in the information -LRB- without much help -RRB- , the software failed with a `` runtime error '' message.I assumed it was some sort of fluke , so I rebooted and tried it again . About 25 minutes into typing my information , I got another `` runtime error '' message and my computer froze up . I then went out and bought Turbo Tax Business Edition ; I cost more , but it was very nice . The interface is very intuitive , help screens are more helpful , and best of all it works .

 I started a parntership and a corporation this year and went to look for tax preparation software . Tax Cut Home and Business was cheaper than the alternate Turbo Tax product . The lower cost and the reviews I read on this site caused me to buy the Tax Cut Home and Business 2002 , even though I have always used Turbo Tax for my personal taxes . I received my Tax Cut last week and started to prepare my return . Frequently the interview at Tax Cut just says `` fill in the form '' . Never in whole interview did the program mention how to handle my organizational costs -LRB- must be amortized over a minimum of five years -RRB- . After messing with that for an hour or so and getting poor results , I got back on Amazon.com and ordered Turbo Tax Business 2002 , hoping it would be more like I am used to with the good interview that puts everything in the forms for you . It arrived one week later and I installed it and prepared my partnership return and K-1 's . The Turbo Tax was great . The interview upon asking if I started the partnership this year , then guided me through how to handle the organizational costs . The interview never just said go ahead and fill in the forms , it asks you for everything and puts it in the form . While the Turbo Tax cost a lot more , it was worth every penny . The complaints about not being able to install it on other computers do not affect me , since I am using it on the one I have . If you need it on multiple computers you have to buy additional licenses . I highly recommend getting the Turbo Tax Business 2002 over Tax Cut Home and Business . The ease of use and detailed interview process was worth every penny extra I had to spend . My only wasted money was the worthless copy of Tax Cut I now own .
 A note to any readers who are contemplating purchasingSystemworks . I have always been a user of Norton 's Windowsprograms , be they Norton Utilities , Systemworks orwhatever . The last version , however , I would recommendagainst buying , at least if you are using the NTFS filesystem . The Speed Disk feature is much slower thenMicrosoft 's built in defrag aplet , which is an offshoot ofExecutive Software 's Diskeeper program . While you can useNorton Disk Doctor to diagnose a drive , you must use XP ` sbuilt in CHKDSK function to actually repair it . The newprogram does not have the benchmark features from theformer releases in the System Information . As previouslystated , I do n't see a good use for Cleansweep , as XP has afaster and better uninstall program . There is no longer aregistry editor or optimizer in the Norton Utilities part , XP now incorporates Faxing , so the limited version ofWINFAX PRO is no longer needed . A limited version of RoxioGo Back is included , but whether this is superior to usingXP 's System Restore and Backup -LRB- for data -RRB- features ishighly debatable . The Rescue Disk has been discontinued.The only programs that seem to be worth having are NortonGhost and , of course , Norton Anti Virus . Since I purchasedNorton 's Internet Security program , which includes a farbetter firewall than XPs , a parental control program thatactually works with Windows logons , and the same antivirus program , I really have no need for Systemworks.Possibly , the diagnostic features -LRB- Win Doctor -RRB- areworthwhile , but while this always identified a lot ofproblems and cleaned them up , it never actually bailed meout of a Windows problem that I was epxperiencing -LRB- I 'm noteven sure if this is available for XP , or what it does . XPright now is running fine - if it ai n't broke , do n't fixit -RRB- . I saw a note on Microsoft Newgroups that Win doctor acutally trashed one uer 's machine to the point of unrecoverability .
 First , Symantec needs to revise their OS claims ... The ONLY program out of the box that works with XP is the anti-virus . I like the de-frager , but it really is n't as fast as the built in one -LSB- from Diskeeper -RSB- GHOST is excellent , but is a specialised tool for pros ... that I already bought separately , which most companies using it will . My main problem is none works with XP ; their last offering -LSB- 2001 -RSB- was released for win2000 , and all the apps worked with it ... this one was released for XP & nothing works .
 I purchased Norton Systemworks Professional 2002 for my home PC running Windows 2000 . I was already running Norton Antivirus 2001 and wanted to unify my tools suite into a single interface -LRB- instead of the scattering of different tools from different vendors -RRB- . When I installed Systemworks , I was very annoyed to learn that the 200 days of license time left on Antivirus 2001 would be lost since you can not install Systemworks 2002 when other Norton products are already installed . Strike one for the software . I uninstalled Antivirus 2001 and installed Systemworks Professional 2002 on the system . I began having problems with other major applications . Things became so unreliable and unpredictable that I decided to get current backups of my files and reinstall everything . Strike two for the software . I reimaged the machine and installed Systemworks on the clean image . After running it for some time , I have now discovered that other actions that I took for granted with other tools are not available in Systemworks . While this is my fault for not investigating fully before purchasing , I feel like a `` Professional '' version should deliver more . Much more . Strike three . When I get the time , I will reinstall without Systemworks . I have previously been a happy user of Norton Antivirus and PCAnywhere , but this is the end of the road for me when it comes to Norton products .
 This package is dangerous for the casual user of a computer . The biggest problem is unstalling it , since Systemworks 2002 fights hard to remain a part of your system software.If you are not extremely comfortable working in the registry , I would not buy this program since it loads an entry in every folder in Windows.The Systemworks software has been sliding downhill since 1997/98 versions but this is the first one that causes more problems than it solves . I deleted it from three of my computers because of the time spent undoing problems caused by Systemworks.The only positive note about the package is Cleansweep but that can be purchased separately .
 One good thing about this system is that it comes with Ghost . I recommend Ghosting your hard drive before installing anything else.The whole installer setup they use is one of the sloppiest I 've seen . I would recommend tracking it with a program like InControl -LRB- freeware -RRB- . So I install antivirus on a clean system using the systemworks installer . Later I try to uninstall it , but it tells me to turn off norton antivirus first and try again -LRB- but not without breaking something first ... -RRB- . So I disable everything that loads NAV at startup ... and reboot . Then , the systemworks installer lists it as uninstalled -LRB- but it is n't -RRB- and refuses to do anything until I uninstall the standalone version -LRB- which I never installed -RRB- . At least a lot of hacking around in the registry and the windows installer system straightens that out.The tool to fix windows problems is underpowered . It also seems to think that the best way to fix registry keys with errors is to delete things . The same goes for shortcuts to non existant files . Letting it do this is a good way to fubar an otherwise decent winXP install . I would have expected it to at least do a search for the missing files -LRB- like Windows does automatically when you load bad shortcuts -RRB- and provide better details about what it wanted to delete . Pretty much your only options are to delete or manually edit , and the manual option does n't even start regedit at the problem , you have to navigate to the right key yourself.Systemworks leaves bloat behind after it is uninstalled -LRB- both in the registry and on disk -RRB- . This is unacceptable . I should be able to install systemworks , then uninstall it , and end up with exactly what I had before it was installed.Many of the tools are redundant with windows features.I can accomplish most of the same tasks -LRB- and then some -RRB- using windows features and various cheap and freeware utilities without the hassle of a giant monolithic overintegrated registry infesting suite like systemworks.But really I just bought it for Ghost after a -LRB- unrelated -RRB- hard drive crash . So since I 'm doing reformatting and clean installs anyway , its no big deal to me.Ghost is pretty good at least .
 After having horrible installation problems with NSW2001 last year , I decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt . Maybe I actually got a bad disk both times I purchased the software -LRB- I had to return the first one -RRB- . But after facing the same installation problems with a newly purchased NSW2002 , I have decided No More Norton . I have gone to the extremes of a clean boot in 98se , as well as installation component by component , and still ca n't get it to install . The support at Symantac is non-existent . There is no reason that I ca n't put the disk in the drive and have this software install nicely . I refuse to pay this kind of money to have these kinds of problems .
 Well a bunch of utilities that do about nothing . These utilities are worth nothing . Cleansweep does the same thing windows does . Speed disk is much slower than disk defragmenter -LRB- which is all that it does -RRB- the new goback which is one of the reasons that i got it is a step back from all previous versions of goback and tends to forget many things . The firewall is ok but why pay for it when you can get a much better firewall from zonealarm.com for FREE !! Some tools can be useful but they have never actually solved any of my windows problems . You can get all the seperate utilities on this package for free or very -LSB- inexpensive -RSB- from other companies .
 This software tried to uninstall SystemWorks 2001 and basically corrupted my Windows 2000 . I had to reinstall the OS and then SW2002 installed fine . However , I am kind of disappointed at Norton 's Win 2000 support . Seems half of the features in Norton Utilities are unavailable . Kind of sad , since lesser known Ontrack SystemSuite has much better support for Win 2000 . Also , I do n't see much of an improvement over SW2001 .
 I in stalled Systemworks 2002 Pro on my computer running ME . After installing the software I started getting messages that I do not have enough memory . I have 640megs of RAM . It began to say that my registry was corruted . I allowed it to repair the registry . The machine crashed and I lost everything . SystemWorks is suppose to keep your system working . Instead , it prevented it from working . I do not recommend this product to anyone . If you do not have problems before installing it -LRB- I had no problems before installing -RRB- you will when you do install .
 I would reconsider buying this software all it does cause more problems when there are already problems . Problems on top of more problems , I had to format my computer becuase of this software causing an error to my computer . And the utilities are useless they are the same thing windows already provides . If your looking for a anti-virus program i say just go with Norton Anti-Virus .
 be on alert!max version is being shipped instead of windows version
 TaxCut Platinum is fine if you are doing a relatively simple return and do n't need too much help.I bought TaxCut Platinum based upon recommendations to avoid TurboTax due to privacy issues . I have used TurboTax for the past several years . I will be going back to it this year.While preparing my daughter 's very simple return , with itemized deductions , I had a couple of questions during the interview process . Mostly , I was seeking definitions of the terms in the interview questions . The help files did n't even provide detailed explanations of the questions asked in the interview . There was also no help available from any on-disk books except for the IRS 's own instructions . TurboTax Deluxe , by contrast , includes Money Magazine 's Income Tax Handbook as well as other useful help.TaxCut Platinum also does not provide for supporting worksheets to enter data . TurboTax , however , allows you to itemize each vehicle 's property tax -LRB- for example -RRB- on a worksheet . Then TurboTax uses the total for the IRS form . The worksheets print for you alone and are not submitted to the IRS . This is a very helpful way to keep itemized records of individual expenditures without writing each one down separately , but it is n't available from TaxCut Platinum.TaxCut Platinum pretends to show your tax owed or refund amount as you go , but even on my daughter 's relatively simple return the amount never changed during the data entry . The program apparently was not thoroughly tested , as the text sometimes was not visible , and no amount of scrolling attempts could make it so.In spite of the on-line registration issues for TurboTax , I will be ordering a copy of it for my return , which involves numerous deductions , depreciation , employee business expenses , and other items that should not be that complicated . After all , I put up with the on-line registration from Microsoft for Windows XP.I feel that TurboTax is worth the nuisance and minor intrusion . If you do n't want to have Intuit know about your computer , buy TaxCut , but do n't expect the sophistication from TaxCut that you get from TurboTax .
 Being ... off by Intuit 's new `` protection '' system , I decided to try TaxCut this year ... Well , now I have a second thought . I ran into so many bugs and inconsistencies in the TaxCut that I am simply scared to submit to the IRS the returns forms generated by it . Examples
 I , like others before me , bought this software for the first time due to the bad reviews turbotax was getting over it 's registration process . In working on my girlfriends taxes today , I have two major complaints . The most severe being the lack of informative help . I remember turbotax providing so much more help whenever there was a term I did n't understand . This software only includes the IRS instructions and many links to call a tax advisor for explanations . The second problem is the user interface . It was NOT TESTED . There were screens in which the text was n't completely clear -LRB- covered by other text and not scrollable -RRB- . This is completely unacceptable and I will be buying Turbotax to redo my girlfriends taxes and begin mine . I honestly do not feel that this software was properly tested and would n't trust the tax return it spits out .
 I had been a user of TurboTax for several years and was very satisfied with the results and ease of use . I had logged on one day to pick up a copy of Turbotax but based upon some of the reviews here I decided to get Taxcut . Big mistake . Taxcut is very buggy and it even locked up when I was first trying to register it online.I had already calculated my taxes based using my tax info from 2002 and Turbotax deluxe 2001 . I figured it should give me a ball park figure since tax laws ca n't change that much in one year.At any rate TT estimated I should pay in a small amount . When I entered all the numbers in with Taxcut platinum it showed me as having in pay in almost tens times as much . I re-entered the data several times and it would give me different results but always on the high side . I even completed a brand new form and made sure I had the latest sotware update . It said I had the latest update but still yielded very high info on taxes and it was n't a consistant number even though my tax info was constant.Finally after messing around with this for about ten hours I decided I would just uninstall everything and throw the software disk and everything associated with Taxcut in the trash . Hopefully I can wipe this nightmare completely from my memory.I ordered Turbotax today and I will used that program this year.Taxcut is not a very user friendly program and in some of the interview questions it was mising a specific line number to get info from . Also , the look and feel of this program is a bit on the edge of being amateur/professional . Very similar to some of the shareware programs you can find where somebody wrote the program from their basement . It may be just a cut above that.Looking back on some of the reviews of TT the negative on the product had more to do with the activation process rather than how the program performed.If Taxcut has worked fine for you for years than stick with it but I am never going to touch this program again . I should have know better than to change something that was working fine for me .
 I read this years reviews for Turbo Tax and discovered that Turbo Tax was charging $ . . more for their Mac Version , which did n't seem fair , so I decided to give Tax Cut a try this year . Big Mistake.First of all , Tax Cut 's Mac State products will not be out till February 28th -LRB- you have to really dig deep in their site to discover this -RRB- . This contradicts other information given by their site and by customer support that indicates it is available now.Also , at present , the most current -LRB- Feb 6th -RRB- updated Mac version of the Federal Tax Cut has a bug which prevents you from passing the review -LRB- you can not file -RRB- . The Error indicates you should upgrade to the newest version available mid-January . I just sent this error report in to them last night , so I can only guess when it will be fixed.Finally , the program is not a nice a product as Turbo Tax is -LRB- or at least , as last year 's was -RRB- . The implementation is crude . Video help had decompression problems . But worst of all , every time you double-click a word that you want defined you have to go out to the taxcut.com website to see the result . Please ... . How hard would it have been to define these terms within the program ? Thank goodness I have a cable modem , always on , connection.It is really so bad that if my e-mails to TaxCut do not get resolution in a few days , I am going to just eat the cost of this poor product and pay the extra $ . . and by this years Turbo Tax for Mac.I 'll update this review and make it more positive if I receive positive resolution , but if I bail , I am going to let this one stand .
 I wanted to switch from Turbo Tax to TaxCut because of Intuit 's registration process . I purchased but plan to return TaxCut because it dose n't have the `` interview '' features that Intuit - TurboTax does . TaxCut may work fine for someone who has a couple W-2 's and maybe a schedule D . But if you have much more , you 'd better get TurboTax . Especially if you want advise and not just a blank tax form - like the 4835 is on TaxCut - no interview .
 I made the switch from TurboTax to TaxCut because of Intuit 's copy-protection schemes that treat me like a criminal and make we worry about not having access to my return in the future . I figured TaxCut would be the same as TurboTax or maybe a little better since I never loved TurboTax . However , I found it to be worse . First the good points , it did import my dad from Quicken and last years return fairly well . Now the bad :1 . It had an annoying inconsistency in entering dates . Sometimes it insisted you use 2-digits etc. . I think software should be smart enough to figure out the different ways people enter dates , rather than force people enter dates one way .2 . The platinum upgrade is worthless . I got it for the `` capital gains assisteant '' but that turned out to be nothing more than having you enter you information on multiple screens -LRB- interveiew style -RRB- rather than one . If you go with TaxCut save the 10 bucks and go with the deluxe or standard editions .3 . It did some to know how to handle my Employee Stock Purchase Plan . It did not ask me about the discount I bought the stock at -LRB- which is taxed differently I believe than the capital gains -RRB- . Since I sold at a loss this did not worry me .4 . It had me enter information many times when it seemed like it should have been smarter . I think I enter my address 4 times - why ca n't the program figure out that I am not moving?I am hoping that Intuit treats their customers better so I can go back to TurboTax next year . If not , I am not sure what I will do .
 Since this is my first year of trying to file US Income Taxes _ myself _ , I picked TaxCut since I did n't like the TurboTax registration annoyance . I later hat the opportunity to enter my Federal and my California Tax Info on a friend 's computer with TurboTax Deluxe and thus was able to compare the Interview process.My tax situation was very easy except for 3 issues :1 . I had to pay tax due in 2002 for my 2001 State Tax Return2 . I collected foreign dividends , interest and captital gains3 . I payed foreign taxes -LRB- on those foreign dividends andinterests -RRB- and thus filed form 1116 . So what happend :1 . Knowing on where and how to enter the fact that I payed statetaxes , was a major hassle with TaxCut . The interview processasked about it at one point , but then you were left aloneto figure out on which of the following screens you hadto enter this information , so that it would properly carryover to the State tax program . There was nothing in the FAQ , in any of the help sections or on the website . It tooktwo emails with customer support to get an answer to thisquestion.TurboTax explicitely asked that question in its interviewprocess and had my enter the amount right away .2 . Neither program provides any support for dealing with foreigncurrencies , so you 're on your own with the conversion .3 . Form 1116 was another nightmare with TaxCut , which basicallyleft you to filling out the forms / worksheets by yourself.TurboTax made it much more easier.Other issues : - Changes in the Federal Data did not always carry overproperly to the State Return -LRB- i.e. when I deleted infoabout Estimated Taxes payed -RRB- . I only noticed thiswhen comparing the figures with TurboTax - I bought the `` Platinum '' version , but I did n't see anypractical benefit.At the end of the day both programs calculated the samefigures , however TurboTax ' interview progress was much clearerand mad me much more comfortable.If TurboTax did n't have that awkward registration scheme I would never use TaxCut again .
 I too turned to TaxCut in order to get away from TurboTax and Intuit . Unfortunately , I 've so far spent two hours trying to convince the software that I do NOT owe $ $ $ in ATM -LRB- an apparent problem with their worksheet -RRB- . The software also missed the Capital Loss carry over . A little poking around and I discovered that I was required to enter last year 's data in order for it to know this . Guess they could have included that in the `` interview '' . It also turns out they they have made no provisions for self employed health insurance deductions . They have the worksheet , it 's just not tied into the 1040 form . And once you make an override to any form , TaxCut will not allow you to E-File your return to the IRS . In summary , no I wo n't go back to Turbo Tax , I 'll just do my taxes the old fashioned way , by hand . A lot faster and A LOT LESS FRUSTRATION !
 I just bought Taxcut Platinum for Mac and it does n't work !! Completely buggy interface . Shuts off and takes me back to the desktop screen . Lost data three times before I gave up . I read the other reviews from this year and am wondering if they are legitimate as I also -LRB- too late -RRB- just read the reviews on this site for Taxcut 2001 which indicate problems similar to mine . I do n't even want to give this product one star but that 's the lowest option . Also , 20 minutes on the long distance charge help line with no answer and no answer from the e-mail tech people . Caveat emptor !!! Class action suit anyone ???
 I purchased TaxCut instead of TurboTax because TurboTax required initialization over the internet to use it . My daughter and I both use the program and TaxCut allows up to 5 family members usage . I DID NOT like the fact that I had to download updates to both this and the State program that took almost an hour to do . Also the State program did not recognize that Harford County has only three incorporated towns and gave me an error message to list my town . I thought it should have been aware of all local information .
 Last year I used Turbo Tax and was able to file my state return electronically . This year I switched to Tax Cut and it does n't support E-filing the Oregon State return . Now , at the last minute , I have to print and file a manual return . This will add about 2 months to the time it takes to get a refund . Next year it 's back to Turbo Tax , no matter how bad it is , it 's better than Tax Cut .
 After I have removed some previously entered Schedule D transactions it still prints security name on the printed forms . The same forms printed `` not for filing '' or displayed on the screen do not have these records , so there is no way to remove this garbage.Investors / Traders who have wash sales should consider TurboTax Deluxe rather then TaxCut Platinum.Product integration with GainsKeeper is incomplete . TaxCut is unable to import Wash Sales from GK . Transactions , which do not result in wash sales , are imported correctly.I have asked TaxCut customer support regarding integration with GainsKeeper . Contrary to product specification they responded that TaxCut can import data only from Quicken/MS Money , but not GK . Response to my other technical question about arranging schedule D transactions in particular order was even more useless ...
 It 's easy to install and set up , but it 's impossible to configure to the way you want it to work . At first I set it for maximum security and quickly realized it was annoying me with messages and alerts on every page I clicked on . On every single java applet or active x control it would prompt me for an ok . Even if I said ok it would usually block it anyway or it would n't work properly after Norton got done with it.So I decided to go the other route and allow pretty much everything to work by default . Norton would STILL mess everything up . My own personal home page has some shockwave menu buttons , Norton blocks them so they no longer work . On this site , norton blocks pretty much all little graphics such as my 1 star rating and the menu tabs at the top of the page.Basically I wanted a program that would keep my information private and let me know if people were attempting to hack into my system . If it blocked ads and popup windows - that 'd be a nice bonus . It does provide a cool little alert tool in the shape of a half-globe that alerts you when suspected attackers are trying to access your system . In my case it was mostly script kiddies trying to enable subseven . As far as releasing personal information though , who knows ? I 've caught Norton numerous times allowing various programs to access the internet without my permission -LRB- for example , annoying programs like Windows Media go to the msn site upon launch without my permission or others will check for updates to their software -RRB- . If Norton allows that , what else is it going to allow - personal information and backdoor trojans it does n't yet know about sounds like a logical conclusion.Most annoying , though is the so-called ad blocking . It does n't work - plain and simple . Even annoying popup windows continue to pop up . It does , however , block graphics you do want to see . The whole purpose of graphics blocking was to enable web pages to load faster . These settings already can be controlled by Netscape or IE so why Norton does this is beyond me . Plus , with Norton Firewall enabled it takes so long to load a web page it defeats the whole purpose of graphics blocking in the first place.The Norton Knowledgebase was no help and it became ridiculous trying to get an answer from someone with a pulse or a brain . I found myself disabling the program constantly just to get web pages to load properly . This kind of defeates the whole purpose , does n't it?I 'm going to check out the latest release of ZoneAlarm . If I do n't like it , I 'm going back to Black Ice . In the case of this program , let 's see if the uninstaller works like it 's supposed to .
 Wow . Based on the very positive experience I 've had with other Symantec products , I had high hopes for Personal Firewall , but unfortunately , it resulted in way too much trouble when weighed with the benefits . I purchased the SystemWorks/Personal Firewall package and installed both . Firewall apparently prevents key operations in Norton System Utilities from working -LRB- such as Disk Doctor & Speed Disk -RRB- , and is aware of this . The response in their support knowledge base ? `` The cause is unknown , and there is no solution at this time -LRB- Document # 2001100208343509 -RRB- . '' They do provide a workaround fix , but their added suggestion of uninstalling everything & reinstalling Firewall first did not solve my problem . Also , I was receiving a constant error message involving the `` Symproxysvc '' file in the Firewall program . Again , the knowledge base document stated `` The cause is unknown , and there is no solution at this time -LRB- Document # 2001091207181936 -RRB- . '' Finally -- the final straw -- came when I found that I suddenly could not access any internet web sites . After some technical support from my ISP , I reinstalled my browser . This worked for a short time , then it happened again
 If you 're just a plain home user who do not want to bother customizing your personal firewall 's policy , this is the firewall for you.On the other hand , if you would rather have a mix of a smart firewall that also gives you the flexibility of fine tuning rules to your needs ... . open certain ports -LRB- tcp or udp -RRB- , let certain applications access the internet , ... this software can be a bit confusing.Though the 2002 version lets you do it , it takes a lot more extra steps for one to customize the packet filtering which is a total pain . The 2001 version is a lot more flexible and geared towards the more `` savvy '' user.This is one of the few products that pretty much is n't worth an upgrade if you have an earlier version.On the plus side , functionality is great , it provides good protection and a simple interface .
 After I installed this product on my Windows 98 system , my previously fleet computer began taking three to five minutes just to boot up . I accessed the Symantec support web site -LRB- they charge for individual support -RRB- , and found that many other people are experiencing even worse problems with the software.When I tried to uninstall the program , it was as though Hal had taken over my computer . Firewall refused to uninstall without an `` access number '' -- only `` my supervisor '' could make such changes . Unfortunately , I AM my supervisor . I finally was able to uninstall using a separate program on the Firewall CD that I knew of only after an hour of searching through support messages on the Symantec site . Even after uninstalling , my system is still extremely slow to boot up.I do not recommend this product .
 Sure , it blocks ports ... all of them ! After fussing for a day to get Remote Desktop to work -LRB- and unblocking port 3389 numerous times -RRB- I finally decided I needed help . To my surprise Symantec offers NO free tech support . I surfed the `` online support '' -LRB- term used loosely -RRB- and found nothing referring to Remote Desktop ... Finally I needed to get back to work and decided to pay the $ 29.95 for phone support only to get a message stating that they were too busy , please check the website for solutions.Sure wish I could return this . It 's money wasted .
 The 2002 firewall creates problems with so many other types of software and internet applications that you may want to think about installing ZoneAlarm 's wonderful product instead . I uninstalled Norton 's 2002 firewall with great difficulty -LRB- call the company , get an uninstall key -RRB- . I still use Norton for antivirus protection .
 I would just like to comment very briefly on this product , that all seemed to be doing well and it did manage to work very well for a number of weeks . However it completly prevented me from viewing any websites under a ` secure server ' Its caused me many wasted days with little access to the net . Money down the drain for this product , avoid !
 Firewall has annoying bug
 You ca n't get firewall protection from a piece of software . Norton Firewall is more annoying than it is helpful . If you want firewall protection buy an actuall router/firewall . Linksys 4 Port Cable/DSL Router will do the job without the hassle . It 's an actual hardware firewall for only $ 30 more than this software . Installation could n't be easier , just plug in your cable or DSL line , and you 're done ! And you can network your house with it -LRB- if you want -RRB- .
 The software comes with my cable modem . When the cable guy came to set me up , he preferred not to install the firewall software that comes with the cable driver CD . Now I guess I know why . Do n't take me wrong , in several occasion I was ... happy that it stopped every attempted attacks . It was able to detect attempted hacks from Korea and Canada . Pretty neat-huh ?! Well , I will give a brief introduction of what the software consists below . `` Internet Status '' section reports the number of attempted intrusions and attempted attacks . `` Personal Firewall Settings '' section let you configure security level -LRB- custom level , high , low and medium -RRB- . `` Personal Firewall Internet Access Control '' scans for applications that transfers and receives data from the net , and you can decide whether to permit the application to do so . `` Personal Firewall Internet Zone Control '' allows you to specify sites/IP addres that you want to allow access to your computer and sites/IP address that you want to restrict from accessing your computer . Personally , I find this to be very useful especially when you have the IP address of the node that tries to hack your computer . `` Personal Firewall Intrusion Protection '' is very cool , it can automatically restrict an IP address if it tries to scan for your ports -LRB- can choose to disable auto restrict -RRB- . `` Privacy control '' with option of low , medium and high level of protection on your credit card , email address and cookies information to reach the net . `` Ad blocking '' does not work very well . Like the other posting says , it blocks some graphics and failed to block ads.The firewall gave me problems the very first day I installed the product . I had my computer running for 4 years without any problem . When I got it installed , my computer crashes at least 5 times a day . Initially I thought someone planted a trojan or some sort of proxy on my computer . Then today -LRB- after 8 days with the product -RRB- I come to realize the SymProxySvc.exe which failed to respond today . So I checked the web and linked to Amazon . Here I found the same sort of problems that others had faced . I agree that disabling the firewall helped coz I was able to have my computer up without crashing when I disabled the firewall program once . I will check out Symantec 's web site on the workaround solution that others had mentioned . I strongly recommend you to check out some other product ... until Symantec fixed this error . -LRB- Do get a firewall especially with cable modem , if you think you are secure think again !! -RRB- Best of luck .
 Norton Personal Firewall 2002 is neither the easiest-to-use product of its type , nor does it offer the best protection.I found the program to be very tempermental
 Norton Firewall 2003 failed to install correctly on my Windows XP Pro machine with 512MB of memory ! Every time I tried I got a blue screen with `` Dumping physical memory '' , despite following the installation procedures to the letter . When I finally managed to install the program , it blocked a large number of websites , including symantec 's own ! And yes , I allowed pretty much everything on the setup screen . I finally gave up after three days , wrote the investment off and downloaded Black Ice . Installed correctly the first time , has been running with no problems whatsoever and has caught 20 + hackers in the past 24 hours . I am sure my experience with Norton Firewall is down to my failing somehow but I do not have the time and the patience to `` investigate '' .
 I have used TurboTax for several years , but downloaded TaxCut for 2002 after reading about the C-dilla software issue . If you 've used TurboTax before , you 'll be disappointed in TaxCut.First the good . TaxCut downloaded and installed easily . It imported my 2001 TurboTax tax information easily.Now the bad.First , the interview failed to ask about my real estate taxes as I was entering my deductions . Fortunately I remembered , but I had to search around to find out where I had to go to enter them , otherwise I would have missed out on that significant deduction . What else might have been missed?The second problem is related to the code boxes in 12a and 12b of my W-2 forms . I have two W-2s , each of which has an amount in 12a -LRB- which has code C -RRB- and box 12b -LRB- which has code D -RRB- . I entered the codes and amounts appropriate for each W-2 . However , when I finished filling out my Federal return , TaxCut went through it 's check , gave me several warnings , and in the process of reviewing those warnings , I noticed that on one W-2 , both 12a and 12b were coded `` C '' , on the other W-2 , both 12a and 12b were coded `` D '' . I have corrected this at least 10 times , each time my change appears to be accepted . Yet each time I go to verify my W-2 information , the boxes have been reset to both C and both D.Now I do n't know how those codes are used in the filing process , but the program appears buggy and made me lose confidence in the whole package . If TaxCut wo n't accept my W-2 codes , what else is wrong that I ca n't see ? My tax information is critical and I do n't feel comfortable using this program to file my taxes .
 This year , I purchased both TurboTax & Taxcut . I 've used TurboTax for the last several years , but decided to look into switching after hearing about TurboTax 's copy-protection fiasco . So obviously , the `` big plus '' for TaxCut is the ability to do your taxes on multiple computers without buying another copy . However , that seems to be the only plus compared to TurboTax . Here are the issues I had with TaxCut : - Can not handle large fonts . If you are using windows at a high resolution and have chosen large fonts , be aware that none of the screens will look correct . Input fields will overlap each other , the running `` refund '' amount will be cut off , etc. . Very annoying . - Does not take advantage of high resolution displays . If you maximize the window , it still only makes good use of what appears to be a 640x480 part of the window . To be fair , TurboTax has this same issue . - A nice new feature of this year 's TurboTax is the ability to import your W2 electronically . TaxCut also has this feature , but said that it could n't import my data ! My employer uses ADP for payroll , so I do n't understand why TaxCut could n't do this . - TurboTax downloaded my 1099-B information from Salamon Smith Barney . Taxcut could not . * Very * tedious entering stock sales by hand . I remember doing this 2 years ago with TurboTax . - Dates require 4-digit years to be entered . I do n't see why they ca n't accept 2-digit years for ease-of-entry , and then convert them . I believe TurboTax does this.It basically feels like TurboTax from a couple years ago . Not a bad program , but definitely second-rate compared to TurboTax .
 This program insisted on a 4/15/03 or earlier date for one entry , but would n't let me enter it ! It kept producing an error message . I finally had to use a 4/16/03 date which allowed the return to process . The next day the return was rejected for a late date , even though the software said it would be registered as on time if submitted before midnight which it in fact was . It then would n't allow me to log on to check on my re-submitted return . Live technical support was worthless , as they will not acknowledge or correct this major software error . I have used Turbo Tax for the previous several years without a glitch , and even saved money by using it . I did n't care for the spyware they have installed , and thus did n't use it this year . My returns are relatively simple and usually are done in an hour or less with little effort , using TT . Do n't waste your money on Taxcut , and learn how to uninstall spyware .
 TaxCut provides support via a long-distance number -LRB- Dallas , TX -RRB- not an 800 number . Their tech support online is useless unless you just need some hand holding . They promise e-mail Tech support in 48 hrs , but my request took over a week to get a non-satisfactory reply . I wanted to return this for a refund , you 'll also find they make that difficult.On a side note , if you were leaving TurboTax because of the spyware/spam associated with it , TaxCut may not be a good choice either . Read their privacy policy , they will sell your information to third parties .
 Like others , I am long-time TurboTax user but switched to TaxCut because of the new copy protection scheme in TurboTax -LRB- see amazon.com 's reviews of TurboTax for more information -RRB- . TurboTax is much smoother and slicker than TaxCut . For example , like TurboTax , TaxCut keeps a running display of your tax liability/refund . However , on my system the number is cut off by other elements of the screen , so I can only see part of the number . This same problem persists throughout much of TaXCut . I suspect it comes from the fact that I use the Large Fonts settings for my desktop , but that is no excuse for a garbled display.Furthermore , when attempting to print I got a program crash . The TaxCut website was no help in resolving this . There are a few other quirks that show a lack of care -LRB- e.g. , when filling out the home office deduction , you have to `` fake '' out the error-checking part of TaxCut by putting in a value for value of your home even if you rent -RRB- . The printouts are also slightly off with some some of the numbers and form elements just slightly askew . Although this does not mean the program is unusable , it is annoying.In summary
 This software has a serious bug that may cost me a great deal of money.My wife lived in Illinois for a year while I lived most of the year in California . In such a case , it is imperative that we file our Federal returns separately , otherwise Illinois will tax us on the money I earned in California!TaxCut not only did n't warn us of this , it incorrectly computed the Illinois taxes using the part-year resident form . This was in spite of my having specified that my wife was in Illinois the whole year , and in spite of it being very plainly stated on the Illinois form that under such circumstances , a couple filing jointly could not use the form!Unfortunately , I allowed TaxCut to e-file my return before I checked the state returns . Now I have to file an amendment.I was also unable to get any help from TaxCut 's customer support to stop the e-filing before it went through.I 'll never use their software again .
 I have used this program for the last three years , switching from TurboTax . I had always been happy with it so I bought it this year without looking on the Net to see if others were having troubles with it ... Yes , even bought the `` Platinum '' edition because I have a business.What a mistake . This new version is full of bugs -LRB- and judging from the Internet comments a quick search found , I mean REALLY full of bugs -RRB- . Even though I bought it a few weeks ago , my install told me that I had a pre-January version -- so I started by having to update everything -LRB- since , the program told me , it could n't even fill out some of the simple forms and process them without error -RRB- . Six hours later after chugging through the forms , things started going haywire . My spouse was suddenly earning only about 10 percent of what I knew she 'd earned -LRB- and which I had carefully entered on the form -RRB- , my son -LRB- the program told me -RRB- needed to fill out a 1040 form of his own due to his earnings -- which I had not entered since he had none . Finding the form , I found he had `` earned '' a MINUS 7,000 some dollars.Right.Then my withheld money could n't be entered . And finally instead of owing money as I had expected , the program claimed the IRS owed me almost 10 grand.Right.If you use this to do your taxes , be sure to add a `` go to jail '' button as the IRS will think you must be a crook when they see the form . It is a total mess of a program . I 'm taking it back to the store and hoping I can find something that works before April 15 , now that I 've wasted a whole day fighting this blankity , blank poor excuse for a program.Never again will I buy TaxCut . The company has lost a formerly happy customer due to its almost criminally sloppy programming . -- DL
 Just finished using TaxCut Standard 2002 Federal . Absolutely awful as compared to TurboTax . Many questions and statements in the interview are ambiguous . The navigation through the program is good , but TurboTax did a better job of helping you categorize some entries . In many cases , TaxCut defaults to IRS tax guide language , which is sketchy , at best . For example , under itemized deductions , TaxCut uses standard government language for the various item categories , including the nebuluous `` other . '' TurboTax uses more familiar categories , distinguishing such items as `` software , '' an item TaxCut does not recognize . Also downloaded TaxCut State 2002 for Georgia . Georgia has not adopted the Federal Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 that allows you to take a bonus depreciation on certain types of property . The bonus must be excluded on the Georgia return -LRB- and in many other states . -RRB- TaxCut leaves you hanging on this issue , tells you to get the Georgia forms and rework the depreciation for Georgia manually . I gave up at that point and bought TurboTax . TurboTax accounted for all of the state and federal law differences automatically and , it also filled out all of the additional state forms without prompting . One last problem with TaxCut . If you elect to use the integral electronic filing system , it balks at `` too many ___ forms '' `` too many entries per ____ form '' and `` wrong punctuation on line ____ , '' etc. . TurboTax did the electronic filing without a hitch .
 This year , I purchased both TurboTax & Taxcut . I 've used TurboTax for the last several years , but decided to look into switching after hearing about TurboTax 's copy-protection fiasco . So obviously , the `` big plus '' for TaxCut is the ability to do your taxes on multiple computers without buying another copy . However , that seems to be the only plus compared to TurboTax .

TaxCut also has this feature , but said that it could n't import my data ! My employer uses ADP for payroll , so I do n't understand why TaxCut could n't do this . - TurboTax downloaded my 1099-B information from Salamon Smith Barney . Taxcut could not . * Very * tedious entering stock sales by hand . I remember doing this 2 years ago with TurboTax . - Dates require 4-digit years to be entered . I do n't see why they ca n't accept 2-digit years for ease-of-entry , and then convert them . I believe TurboTax does this.It basically feels like TurboTax from a couple years ago . It took me much longer to enter all my information into TaxCut , due to not importing my 1099-B or W2 information electronically . Not a bad program , but definitely second-rate compared to TurboTax .
 My tax situation might be different than most , but I feel like it is still worth warning folks that this software does n't know/do as much as TurboTax . I used TT for the last 2 years with no problem , but the reviews on the 2002 edition were terrible because you have to maintain an internet connection . So , I bought this - what a mistake.I have something on line 14 of my W2 's for some stock options I cashed in . This program did n't understand what was going on and kept telling me I had a problem because line 1 & 5 did n't match . Then it tried to ding me twice by recording it as a Capital Gains on a Schedule D. Turbo tax understood that my Line 14 was related to my Capital Gains and handled it appropriately.Of course none of this should be so complicated that I have to trust a software program at all , but I guess that is the way it is ... TaxCut may be fine if you have `` routine '' earnings and deductions , but I would worry that if it ca n't handle my situation and TurboTax can - what else ca n't it handle?Needless to say I am using TurboTax 's online version this year . That was -LSB- a waste of money -RSB- ...
 i had an almost identical experience as the person from Oregon ... when using this software . I want to voice my utter disgust with this product.After corrupting my tax data file TWICE with this product , and getting nothing from their technical support except `` start over '' , and getting no idea as to why my submissions were rejected , i ended up manually printing out each form -LRB- which in itself was n't straightforward -RRB- , and sending snail-mail , TWO days after the tax deadline . The TaxCut people quickly agreed to refund me my $ ... , though thats zero consolation considering the money i 'm going to lose from filing late with the IRS !! i assure you , no matter how cheap they sell TaxCut , it is simply not worth it ! it should not be trusted to handle official government documents . period .
 Bought this because I did n't want the extra hidden software that installs with Turbo Tax . It messed up the icons on my desktop , jumped back and forth when I entered data , continually returning to the box to enter my middle initial . MUCH less straightforward than TurboTax , which I used last year and actually bought again this year . I just gave up on TaxCut and chalked the wasted money up to a learning experience .
 This program would not let me e-file . It flagged an item it should not have and would not allow an e-file . After multiple e-mails to the company and basically useless answers I purchased TaxAct that accepted and e-filed the data just fine . I used Turbo-tax last year that also worked fine with the same situation . Basically all three tax programs worked about the same for the data input part.My situation was I needed to claim alimony during a seperation . The program flagged that I could not have the same Social Security Number for both a spouse and an alimony receipent . I even had to refer to the IRS publication paragragh about this in an attempt to get a decent resolution out of the company.This program did not perform as expected and the `` technical help '' was useless . I wasted time and money by -LRB- not -RRB- using this software and would buy something else if you do n't have a very simple return .
 Yes , it costs only ... and -LRB- after jumping through hoops -RRB- you can get -LSB- a -RSB- rebate . But check the fine print on the back of the box and you find , `` TaxCut State sold separately . '' ... My state return is really rather simple once the federal one 's done , but TaxCut wants -LSB- extra -RSB- for the state software . And when you get ready to e-file , Voila ! , that costs extra , too ... Add to this the unhelpful Help and Search features . And on Schedule A , the program blithely allowed me to enter the state tax I had paid , even though it had already done that for me . I caught the duplication when I finally got a look at the form itself . The ultimate frustration came when TaxCut locked up my computer as I tried to print my record copies of the forms . I 'll try something else next year .
 I have used TurboTax for the last 15 years -LRB- actually 5 years were MacinTax but that 's beside the point -RRB- , and never had a problem . Like everyone else I tried this program because of the price and the other `` issues '' . This program locked up 35 times , and never downloaded any of the updates . I went to the website , download pages were not available , the customer feedback form was also not available , hmmm ... Here 's where it gets `` good '' , I CAN order an update CD for only $ 5.95 ! OR ... Why do I feel like my `` value '' is going out the window ? My advice , brave the spyware and get a product that works and wo n't suck your wallet dry .
 Will not allow you to electronically file with a state of prior residence . Did not provide or support many of the forms for Wisconsin . Really has trouble with W2 's from different states.It was a waste of money .
 So I thought that because H&R ; Block was involved , this would be a great tool . So , so wrong ! The streaming video was a cool aspect , but when you are entering information and get to the charitable deduction section , you find that this portion of the program was n't completed by the time of release -LRB- this is what it says in the program itself -RRB- , so it is n't so cool anymore . You need to go to the Tax Cut website and download the rest of this product . This is all fine , except I never could download -- my system kept saying ` no response ' . By the way , for tax information updates on TUBRO TAX -LRB- which I purchased after trying this piece of junk -RRB- , the program opened the internet , chose the correct updates and downloaded in a matter of minutes.The program also kept showing errors because I was n't including state taxes - which Washington does n't have -- so it would check and fax successfully . I finally was so frustrated , I uninstalled , bought TURBO TAX and tossed this piece of junk in the trash.Do I sound frustrated ? Yes I am . When I spend money on a product , I expect it to work within reason . Hey , I worked in software , and I understand that there are glitches . But , when you leave an entire section of software out of the product , and try to patch it with a download , then the company is looking for bucks , not returning customers . That 's like buying a bike , only to find that you need to send away for the wheels because they were n't available when the bike was assembled and shipped !!!
 Thank goodness this product was free . I am a previous user of TurboTax , and I found that the TaxCut federal was fine -LRB- perhaps even easier in many respects -RRB- , so I was very pleased with that . However TaxCut State -LRB- Minnesota -RRB- was completely worthless ! I scrapped it and did my state taxes by hand . The state program did transfer federal information that was relevant , but then the rest of the interview consisted of . `` Read the instructions to form ___ , and fill out '' After about 5 screens like this -LRB- and 3 forms that were irrelevant to my tax situation -RRB- , I gave up . It 's easier to read the instructions and fill out the forms from the paper copy -LRB- plus I do n't encounter so many irrelevant forms -RRB- . Very disappointing ! Try it if it 's free -LRB- perhaps your state is better -RRB- , but do n't waste your time or money if it 's not free .
 I think it 's shameful that H&R ; Block is selling a product that can easily create an inaccurate return for someone who trusts the software . The following is from my letter of complaint to them : `` I suspect your software creates inaccurate returns for many , if not most , Delawareans unless they are careful and override your defaults . Below I 've listed the major problems that I encountered : a. Your software automatically assumed `` joint '' filing , whereas the Delaware instructions make it very clear that when each spouse 's income exceeds $ 9400 , married couples in Delaware are generally better off to file using the status `` Married & Filing Combined Separate . `` b . Once I did override the `` Joint '' filing status -LRB- I had to read the Delaware instructions carefully to learn that we would be better off to do that -RRB- , I could n't figure out why your software calculated higher taxes using `` Married & Filing Combined Separate '' than under `` Joint '' filing . Eventually I realized that when I overrode the `` Joint '' filing to go to `` Married and Filing Combined Separate , '' your software automatically switched from using itemized deductions to using standard deductions.c . Necessary adjustments to the federal AGI were not made . When I completed our federal return with TaxCut , I included information on muni fund dividends that are taxable by my state -LRB- though not the federal government -RRB- . I also noted that some of the income was `` interest on U.S. obligations '' that should not have been taxed by Delaware -LRB- though they are taxed by the federal government -RRB- . Each of these should have been entered as `` modifications to federal AGI '' on the Delaware form and were not . In fact , when I entered the appropriate dollar amounts in the `` spouse '' column -LRB- Column A -RRB- of the Modification to Federal AGI form , your software automatically - and incorrectly - entered a negative dollar amount in the `` you '' column -LRB- Column B -RRB- so that the amounts would total to zero . I had to then override the spouse column.d . When I overrode the default so that itemized deductions would be used , the deductions should have been allocated between the two spouses in proportion to their incomes . Your software merely put all itemized deductions under the `` you '' column , none were allocated to the `` spouse . '' I had to calculate and enter the allocation manually for each deduction.e . Your software designates Delaware as one of the states that `` do not permit e-filing . '' Perhaps your software does n't support e-filing in Delaware , but to say that Delaware does not permit it is untrue . I e-filed our Delaware return last year with TurboTax and the 2002 Delaware instructions clearly encourage it -LRB- you can read this in the complete set of Delaware instructions that you provide in lieu of any real help menu to support this state 's software -RRB- . f. Your `` interview '' for Delaware consisted of one screen after another saying `` Complete this form if necessary . '' Short of browsing the entire -LRB- unindexed -RRB- set of state instructions , users were given no guidance to help in deciding whether they needed to complete the forms or how to do so . Many of the forms were clearly inappropriate given the information entered for the federal return ; for example , your interview should not have asked us about completing the Delaware form for people who are over 60 or disabled . Even the state software did n't `` talk '' to itself - while showing that I was owed a Delaware refund , your `` interview '' stated that if I owe more than $ 400 I should calculate the penalty.In addition to purchasing your Delaware state software , I purchased your New York software so that we could file 2002 taxes for a recently deceased relative from that state . Your New York software carried over information from the federal return to the state return very appropriately . The New York interview mode asked pertinent questions and provided relevant help regarding terminology and nuances.In contrast , your Delaware product is shameful . I imagine that many Delawareans ' tax returns were calculated incorrectly by your software . As a business professor , the greatest utility of your product to me is as a scenario for discussions of business ethics.Your software 's `` help '' offering for completing the Delaware return was merely the complete set of state instructions , which I selected from a menu of states that all seem to have low populations -LRB- Hawaii , Montana , New Hampshire , etc. -RRB- . I can only assume that your firm has chosen to sell poorly-developed software to residents of all of these low-population states . ''
 Using the CA edition . I have used TurboTax in the past and was used to them asking me questions to see if a tax rule applies to me . Many times , TaxCut State has just referred me to the CA instructions -LRB- not always included electronically -RRB- , which makes me wonder why I even bought the software . The help system is substandard . For example in the interview , `` California provides special credits and acceleration write-offs which may cause the basis of an asset to be different for California and federal depreciation . '' That sounds lovely , but the help system does not explain these special differences and I can find nothing explaining them on the California government tax sites . I 'm crossing my fingers and hoping that I do n't get audited .
 I was frustrated when I found that the California version does not include the Form 3510 -LRB- CREDIT FOR PRIOR YEAR ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX -RRB- which I feel should be needed by many in the Silicon Valley where incentive stock options are popular . The customer support instructed me to download the form from California 's FTB web site , then print it out , fill it in with pen , then plug in the numbers to the proper places in the program . And because the form has to be mailed in , I can not use e-filing . Oh well , what to expect when it is free !
 I found both the federal and state versions of TaxCut to be inferior to TurboTax . The worst part that due to some `` errors '' -LRB- which were not errors at all -RRB- I was unable to file electronically.I would have felt much more confident filing my return if I had gone with TurboTax .
 I used TurboTax -LRB- Federal -RRB- last year . That was my first experience using a tax preparation software instead of the paper form , a pen and my brain . It gave me a pretty pleasant result.This year I was lured to TaxCut due to various discounts - big mistake . I managed to get the Federal form completed after downloading the `` company planned '' updates . But the state version of TaxCut is more than useless . I need to fill taxes for two states and the CD in the State package can only install one state - the other state `` must '' be installed through website - not practical for my slow modem connection ... I am trying to find the downloadable version for the second state .
 I had to pay cash for my State Tax -LRB- Arkansas -RRB- so when I read that the program would not apply if I lived in the state for less than than one year I was ... I paid -LSB- $ $ -RSB- to be told `` Sorry you must use manual forms from your state '' ! How do you find this out?Load the Taxcut Federal Program , compute your tax . Load the state program and it computes your state tax with the `` Sorry '' caveat.If you have moved in the past year , don `` t buy this program . If you pay nothing for it - you get what you pay for .
 I had no trouble with the Federal version of TaxCut but the State version is useless . I initially tried to download the software from the TaxCut Web site . I kept getting messages to try later . I spoke with one of their technical support people only to be told she was getting the same message as I was . She told me to try later.Then I bought the software locally and installed it , only to get to the point where I 'm told to download the latest version of my state 's forms and programs . That did n't work . So I e-mailed tech support and they gave me a download link . It took over an hour to download everything and the program still does n't work . I ca n't get past the window that tells me to download the latest update.I give up . I 'll never use TaxCut again .
 The software does n't support electronic filing for the state of Oregon . What a joke . Last year I used Turbo Tax and it had no problems filing my state return electronically . That 's a lot Block .
 I had lots of problems with this software . The most user unfriendly software I have ever used . There were lots of forms that were not updated and need to be downloaded from the web . I would not buy this software again .
 Only after double and triple checking every line could I be sure that my state return was accurate . I would have saved time by using pencil and paper . While the Taxcut Federal software I used was semi-respectable , this is a disgrace ! Many entries are not calculated automatically -LRB- at least for the DC version -RRB- , you have to calculate a value youself and enter in the box ! Unless your return is very simple , I guarantee you will file an incorrect return if you trust this software blindly .

 I expected a well-known and popular company like Symantec to give me an easy to use , well designed product . My expectation was unfounded . Ghost 2002 is neither easy or well-designed . Expect extensive documentation that still manages to miss important points . Also expect multiple errors throughout the image creation process . I still have n't been able to create a complete image without a `` 12020 '' error . The Symantec web site list at least 3 causes for this error and none of the suggested solutions fixes the problem.This is a very disappointing product -LRB- especially for the cost ! -RRB- The pattern of the reviews here should indicate many people feel the same . I would suggest trying Drive Image instead . It could n't be much worse .
 Background Information - Intended use was in a small business scenario . - Three machines , networked together . - Desire to backup drive images to a networked machine.This product is really limited . I happen to not have a FAT or FAT32 drive on any of my machines , and therefore can not create an image of a drive and store it on a networked machine . Also , having to type in the serial number everytime you want to perform any work is a feature I 'm used to in shareware ... only problem is , I remember paying for this coffee coaster.I 'm definitely going to look for an alternative product .
 Many attempts to backup files from hard disk to CD-R 's failed . So much time and so many CDs wasted that it is unacceptable . The system I have is Pentium 4 1.7 GHz , 40GB IBM hard drive , 512MB RAM and Sony CRX 140E writer.Please make yourself a favor and save your money and time .
 This is the most difficult and annoying software I have ever purchased . I am extremely computer literate and found Ghost to be very difficult to use . Then after backing up my old PC , it was even more difficult to use to restore to my new PC . AND then after all this I have learned I ca n't get a refund because I opened the box . Robert Nelsen , Stevens Point , WI
 Tried to clone a laptop HD to CDRs on a drive that worked fine in the past - all CDs that Ghost wrote to were completely unreadable -LRB- tested in 3 different systems running Mac OS , XP , and Linux -RRB- . Plus , Ghost 's actual backup system feels like it should have been phased out years ago , and is in no way easy to use , or to diagnose what went wrong after the software messes up your backups . Some software pays for itself , but this actually costs you more as you waste CD after CD trying to get it to work .
 It stinks and Symantec is n't satisfied with the money they have duped us out of ... they want us to upgrade , further , to Ghost 7.0 . No thanks ... now what was the name of their competitor ? It 's looking pretty good to me .
 If you can get Norton Ghost to work on your machine , then the software can make a cloned image of your hard drive for quick restore . However , notice the word `` IF '' . Instructions for using Ghost are not straight forward . Creating a sucessful clone can be a real challenge . Additionally , there is no try before you buy option , so if Ghost does n't work with your system , you are out of luck . I 've had much more success with a program called Drivebackup from Newtek , Inc -LRB- NTI -RRB- . With Drivebackup , I easily made a self-booting image copy clone of my Windows XP laptop computer for emergency purposes . Plus , NTI 's website has a trial download option so you can make sure their program works on your machine before purchasing .
 This version is next to useless . Ca n't communicate with a USB device , which makes it very clumsy to use . NG 2003 is supposed to fix this and many other problems , but after 5 hours with it last night , I still could not make a back up . It must run from DOS , so you must boot up off a DOS disk , and then try to get the storage device recognized . I suspect it will only work well when backing up to a second internal device , not an external device
 Thanks for making me waste money and about 30 hours of time trying to get this to work . When I finally managed to get two computers connected -LRB- do n't even bother with trying to get a CD burner connected -RRB- I found out Ghost recognizes NTFS drives only if they are the drives you are copying FROM ... not TO . Sounds like something the documentation could have mentioned instead of a sly remark telling you that the available destination drives will be those that `` Ghost detects '' . Brilliant ! I gave 1 star because Amazon did n't let me give 0 .
 ... I have not been able to get ghost to work . I 'm using a P4 1.5 ghz 256mb ram ... with a 16X CD-RW . Gives an error message after burning about 2 % of the disk . The solutions on Norton 's site gave some things to try , none of which worked . I bought Disk Image 5.0 , and it worked on the first attempt .
 Where Drive Image has solved so many of our problems , Norton Ghost has caused even more . Symantec support is also non existant . I guess once they have your money , they do n't want to hear from you any longer . I have received no help or constructive help from either customer service or technical support . Do n't waste your money !
 I think this program is intentionally crippled so as to prevent companies from buying Ghost 2002 as a substitute for the enterprise edition . By doing this , Norton has made this program unusable for all but the most basic of needs.For example , I wanted to copy a partition on a laptop to an image file on a desktop computer using my home network . Ghost 2002 allows this , with the limitation that both computers must be booted to DOS using Norton 's boot disks , and the `` slave '' computer must run Norton 's server software . After a few hours getting the DOS drivers to work , I was able to boot both computers to DOS and get them to see each other over my network . -LRB- Note , how to do this is not explained in the manual . You must go to Norton 's support web site and search for `` Slave '' to figure out the procedure . -RRB- While I was able to get the `` master '' computer to see the DOS drive on the `` slave '' computer and begin the cloning , I was very surprised at the throughput speed . The cloning process was averaging 1MB/min and would have taken 14 hours to complete.I aborted this attempt and instead tried to clone the laptop 's NTFS partition to an image file on a DOS partition on the same laptop hard disk . This cloning proceeded at 150Mb/min and took 11 minutes.I see no reason why disk cloning over a 100Mbps network should proceed so slowly unless the program 's performance is intentionally retarded to thwart those administrative tasks typically done in enterprises . Unfortunately , I 'm a home user who wants to clone a partition over a network to a network drive . Ghost 2002 will let me do this , but only if I tie up both computers -LRB- in DOS mode -RRB- for over half a day .
 I recently purchased Norton Ghost 2003which , I was told , was suitable for my Windows-2000 Professional/NTFS environment . The program could not produce a boot diskette that could `` see '' my second HDD containing three NTFS-formatted partitions . Multiple pleas for help to the Symantec Support website produced multiple suggestions - none of which worked . I needed to abandon my old Quantum HDD -LRB- my C
 This product caused problems on my system you would not believe . It caused operating systems to not boot , damaged partition tables , and cost me hours of work . I have waisted time and money . I 'm sticking with PowerQuests Drive Image .
 Ghost has great potential but there are still bugs to be ironed out . I tested it on a Windows 98 system and a Windows XP system . The test was to backup my systems to CD-R 's . The backups worked flawlessly but the Integrity Check to verify the backups , told me my CDs contained errors and that I had to start all over again . Also , Ghost caused my Windows 98 system to lock up repeatedly to the point way I had to re-install the operating system .
 I bought Ghost based on my experience with using the corporate edition at work . However , the home edition is severely limited compared to the corporate edition . The biggest problem I had was that the home edition does n't allow writing to a network drive . I have a big server machine on my home network , and I 'd like to just dump images of the hard drives of the other machines to it . Ghost 2002 does n't allow this . It 's worse than just Ghost 2002 not supporting it ; it can write an image to a drive letter , so it should be able to write to a mapped network drive as well . It actually checks to see if it 's a network drive , and refuses to write to it if it is . Deliberately crippling the operation this way is unacceptable to me , so I got a refund.The only way to get the ability to write to a network drive is to buy the corporate edition , which has a 10 license minimum . If Symantec sold a single-license `` Ghost Pro '' that had most of the abilities of the corporate edition , I 'd buy that . But they do n't . I ended up getting Powerquest 's Drive Image , which does allow network drives .
 Ghost is not only cumbersome to use -LRB- two seperate boot floppies for CD-writing and CD-reading operations !? -RRB- , but surprisingly spotty for a DOS application . Even Symantec 's support site admits a long line of possible hardware compatibility problems with not only CD-RW drives , but with CD-R disks themselves ! Although Ghost will record backups on 700MB CD-Rs on my computer with no problem , it has great difficulty reading off of those 700MB CD-Rs afterwards . It works okay with 640MB CD-Rs , but since those are becoming increasingly scarce , I will have to opt for much slower backups on 640MB CD-RWs . Bottom line
 Hi , please send me a quotation for the Norton Ghost 2002 or for the best disk imaging product that you would advise me to use on the local network.Waiting for an urgent response.regards , Flo
 I have to sadly agree with many of the negative reviews . But I 'm including thie review not to be negative , but to relate what I 've found that you CAN and CA N'T do with this product . -LRB- 1 -RRB- As others have said , this is n't going to work with a network . And I guess if I wanted to directly burn CDs then I 'd need a DOS device driver -LRB- good luck finding that for a Sony DVD+RW -RRB- , so I 'm glad I 'm not doing that either . Fortunately for me , I 'm working with a test machine that I deliberately configured with an extra hard drive just so I had a local place to Ghost back and forth with . -LRB- 2 -RRB- While Ghost does a fine and fast job shuttling entire-drive clones from drive to drive , it has this incredibly annoying habit
 I wish I had read the reviews here before buying Ghost 2002 as an upgrade to my old Ghost 5 . I have a WinXP machine with a 75GB hard disk . It is partitioned into four logical drives . Usually , all I 'll want to do is make a backup of selected partitions like the C
 In general , Ghost is a fabulous piece of software , in particular , I am thinking about Ghost 2001 . I was excited to see that 2002 was released and that it supported XP . I owned the software for about 20 minutes before I returned it . Symantec has a `` new license procedure '' where you have to write down a long serial number -LRB- 15 digits I think -RRB- that shows up on the splash screen , and then type that number in the next screen that requests it -LRB- and no , copying and pasting is not allowed , nor is there a switch where you can manually bypass or enter the license number -RRB- . I suppose Symantec 's idea was to annoy people using the product to Ghost multiple machines into buying the Enterprise version . Regardless , it is silly exercise of writing and typing that legitimate customers should n't have to endure . I hope Symantec wises up.Overall , unless you are needing support for XP , stick with Ghost 2001 .
 This software is a real MARKETING breakthrough ! They have taken away the ability to backup across the network via an ftp or rsh server . I ended up sending it back and getting my money returned . The package promises , '' ... cloning using home network IP connections ... '' This is true however you must be running their DOS server software on the server . Also , their server does n't support NTFS or EXT2 partitions for saving the image . I ended up developing my own system using Linux -LRB- dd | gzip | rsh -RRB- for FREE ! I spent a better part of a week wasted on this product . If you want to duplicate a harddrive in the same machine then it will probably do what you want but do n't expect to use your network connection reliably . Also , it comes with a paltry amount of drivers for USB external CD Drives . Not recommended for any situation where the hard drive you want to backup is not in the same system as the spare hard drive .
 What a piece of junk . I was using Ghost 2002 for several years , and it did do the job . During that time I was not totally happy as I always had to delete my backup before I created a new one ; plus I 'd always have to check on some options otherwise I 'd be stuck checking on my machine every 15 minutes . I recently upgraded to Windows XP , and found out that 2001 version does n't work with it . So I had to pay for a 2002 upgrade . And would n't ' you know it , the stupid thing did n't work either . Oh it installed all right , but I kept getting an error message that would n't ' allow me to make a backup . Well , Symantec has no phone support , so off I went to their waste-of-a-time support site , and found no help there . I looked at other reviews on Amazon and saw similar problems , and chucked it in.Do yourself a favor and buy DriveImage 5 . It blows Norton away in usability , plus they actually have phone support . And best of all , the product makes backing up your drive a no-hassle pleasure.As for Ghost , the name is fitting
 I have been very happy with Ghost 2001 , which I purchased a year ago . The only problem Ghost 2001 had was that it does not support Windows XP . Therefore , I purchased the Ghost 2002 upgrade.My advice to you is not to touch Ghost 2002 . A real clever marketing person in Symantec had devised a new trick , never before used in the industry . Each time you restore a Ghost image , they make you type a 16-char license number into the restore screen . The way it works is
 I purchased Norton Ghost to see how it compared to Drive Image . It damaged my system and required me to do a low-level format of my hard drive . I had to restore my system using Drive Image . Now Symantec wo n't refund my money . Seems like I 'm stuck with it . Beware !!!
 My primary use for ghost 2002 was to backup my laptop . After extensive research on the Symantec sevice and support website . I was given the impression that a parallel connection is the only way to interface between my laptop and my Backpack CD-RW -LRB- suggested by the Symantec CD-RW compatibility list -RRB- . I followed the Symantec , and Backpack instructions to a tee and everytime -LRB- 6 times , until I giveup -RRB- I received a 12020 error - `` failed to write to disk '' at different times during the burning process . Now , I understand software has bugs and sometimes it just does work , but at least I would think you could get some free person to person tech support for home/small business users ; but with symantec that idea was tossed out the window . Symantec provides an extensive knowledge database and its easy to understand . But when the solution to your problem is not in the knowledgebase they expect you to pay $ 29 per incident ; that 's half the price for the software - give me a break . Symantec is a leader in the drive cloning and backup arena and I 'll give them this ghost 2002 was user friendly but overall , for my application , it was extremely slow and just did n't do the job . That is why , if it was an option , I would n't give ghost 2002 any stars . But what do they care they already have my money !
 After reading an Amazon review about how superior thisproduct was to Turbotax , I decided to give it a try . I ` veused turbotax for the past 5 years and never had any troublewith it . My first surprise was when I downloaded theupdate . It took close to an hour . As I went along , I wasannoyed by being referred to USGovt publications which , of course , I did n't have lying around.The interface between the questionnaire and the actualforms was tricky to access . There was not enough room tolist all my charitable contributions.At the end , I attempted to print out my tax form on mydot matrix printer and got two strips of type
 Having happily used TurboTax for several years , this year I switched to TaxCut because of the onerous spyware and activation in Intuit 's product . I simply refuse to allow programs to make unauthorized and stealthy changes to my computer like Intuit has TurboTax doing this year.But the cure may have been worse than the disease . I encountered several bugs in TaxCut :1 . If you have more than 24 lines ' worth of Schedule D info to carry over to your state form , it spills onto a `` Copy 2 '' that is invisible unless you look hard . This made my state numbers seem wrong .2 . Like others , I ran into the problem where TaxCut links your state of residence with the state on your first W-2 form . This makes it impossible to file , at least electronically .3 . There were several places in the interview where the dialogue at the top came to wrong conclusions , e.g. it claimed that I had made an IRA withdrawal which I had not , and several other similar things . This makes me wonder if I entered something incorrectly somewhere .4 . The `` Take Me To ... '' checklist shows many items as still needing completion when they are actually done . This feature is useless.So
 TaxCut appears user friendly until you actually try to enter any data that is not completely straightforward . For example foreign tax paid could not be entered in dollars , which makes no sense . Also the fidiuciary returns were completely wrong , most of the forms are n't on the CD -LRB- this is the Business Platinum version -RRB- and you ca n't download them because the program does n't recognize the downloads . It often did not enter my corrections , crashed repeatedly , and left me with the feeling that I have no confidence in its accuracy . Final insult is that it would not print properly . As a result , I am now taking it all back to my CPA and will never let anyone I know buy Tac Cut , ever .
 If you want an unrepsonsive , cookie cutter program that looks like it was thrown together in a weekend , than this is the product for you . You can also expect some erroneous error code when you try to e-file , that is neither listed in their help file , or in their knowledge base online . Just an error like Fatal Error UNDEFINED_SOCKET_ERROR . Then you 'll find there is no way to actually speak with a human being about your problem -LRB- unless you want to buy it of course -RRB- . So you 'll send an email , five days later you 'll get a response like try closing tax cut and re-sending it , what a revelation why did n't I try that , oh that 's right I did . Seriously too much of a head ache , horrible support if there even is any support . And from a technical persons perspective a truly terrible peice of software .
 I used H&R Block 's online filing to generate and e-file my Federal and North Carolina return . There is an error in the NC return . No Declarations Control Number is generated for or printed on form NC-8453 , which must be mailed to the State . H&R Block 's tech support was no help , and they refused to refund my money . If their online product has this bug , I expect the purchased software does too . North Carolina filers - beware !!!
 I chose Taxcut this year because of the spyware Turbotax was installing with their software . You know what ? I do n't do anything wrong -LRB- pirate , illegal copies -RRB- with the software anyway so what 's the difference ? Anyway , I miss TurboTax . Taxcut is not very helpful in guiding me through complex forms -LRB- itemized deductions , proporty tax stuff -RRB- . In fact , I could not get any interview guidance with writing off my home office until I went in and manually began filling out the form . After that is when I could use the interview process.The help in Taxcut is very primitive . When I got stuck within a form and clicked on the help button , it took me to the page , `` Getting help with Taxcut '' . Not useful at all.I look forward to TurboTax next year .
 I tried to save a couple bucks using this junk -LRB- instead of TurboTax -RRB- and I regret it . The program is not close to the quality of TurboTax and is a total pain in the rear to use on the Mac family of computers .
 I bought TAXCUT - during the installation procedure it asks you if you want Earthlink ISP -- you say no and it STILL PUTS THE ICON on your desktop and install the library for Earthlink . TAXCUT is putting their advertisements on your COMPUTER even when you say NO !!!!!!!!! . I find this to be annoying and people should PASS on buying this product .
 I purchased this based on some reviews I had read about Turbo Tax . When I first loaded this program I was happy because it could use my Turbo Tax return . However , when I tried to update State & Federal it crashed 8 times before I finally got the upgrades ! And I 'm using a Broadband connection , not dial-up . When I tried to download my W-2 , it crashed every time . I ended up just using my paper copy . When I went to do my State return , my return was incorrect because I lived part time in one state and part time in another and for some reason it could not figure that out and my State return was constantly completed with my total Federal numbers . Next year I 'm going back to Turbo Tax . If you have n't bought this product yet , DO N'T . Go buy Turbo Tax instead - you 'll be happy you did .
 Why should it be such a pain in the neck to use tax program !? I paid money for TaxCut , so i can file easily and save my time and energy . It messed up and i either have to start over -LRB- grrr ... -RRB- or file paper forms . I miss old good TurboTax when it did n't have spyware yet .

 I have no idea how this program works . It will not download . Went back and it said it had downloaded and would not let me try again .
 The previous year 's version failed to print out some required forms for me , and the IRS mailed me a nasty note.Also did not limit assorted credits properly , gaining me another nasty note from the IRS.Emailed my concerns to the support page , and got no response.This year , the program crashes repeatedly `` Creating a copy of form TCImmutableIdentifier
 I just got off the phone with tech supportPlease start your taxes again ! The file you have worked on for 40 + hours is corrupt!Well not completely corrupt as it passes all of the checks , itit prints . It just wo n't allow the state program to work.Once you install the state program it will have runtime errors and corrupt the program.This program is poorly written trash .
 I have been doing my taxes via computer programs since they have been available . This is certainly the worst program that I have ever used.It does n't navigate easily . Last year I used TurboTax . With that program all you have to do is highlight the line of the tax return or worksheet , double-click and you have a range of options . Not with TaxCut ... go to the pulldown , jump to form then if you want instruction use another section of the program to pull that up - what a hassle !!! With TaxCut simple questions are n't addressed . For instance , we refinanced our home loan and I wanted to know the tax treatment for settlement charges . Do you think that in a record year of refinancing that simple question was answered ? NO . There was a link that did n't work . So off to the IRS website I had to go.I got suckered into the state program because it is free to TaxCut Deluxe buyers . IT DOESN `` T WORK for Michigan ! There is a form that automatically generated to calc the Homestead credit . It does n't apply to us and it wanted data entered . I tried to delete this non-relevant form - could n't . I tried to fill in the missing information - could n't . Basically , the state program is worthless . I am going to get a form from the state and file the old fashioned way and save myself alot of time in the process.I do n't know who the people are that think that this is a good program ? Perhaps they work for H&R ; Block ?
 After using TurboTax for several years , decided to save a few $ $ and try TaxCut . I was expecting a modest tax refund , and TaxCut ended up saying I was * OWING * several thousand . Went to IRS site , downloaded forms and did things manually and it showed a refund . After several failed attempts , downloaded the latest update for TaxCut , and now it showed the same refund as my manual calculations -LRB- I did n't change ANYTHING in my entered numbers , and had already installed a TaxCut update a couple of weeks earlier -RRB- . OK . Tried to file electronically . First TaxCut gave me several warnings about my numbers -- turns out it was FRACTIONAL pennies - I was 1/2 cent below its calculation for FICA and some other things < sigh > . Got past that and tried to complete filing . After 6 failures connecting to their server , I decided to buy TurboTax . TurboTax downloaded , installed fine , data entry was easy , it showed same refund I 'd calculated , and the electronic filing was fast and trouble-free . I 'll never try TaxCut again . TurboTax is worth the few extra $ $ .
 I purchased this product based on the reviews that it was better than Turbo Tax , but was very disappointed . There were so many errors and omissions in this program that could n't be repaired , and no explanation about what was going on . I had to go back and change some items and they were either never recorded or recorded incorrectly . I eventually compared my results with Turbo Tax , which offered much clearer explanations , and I went from owing over $ 1000 with tax cut to getting a refund of $ 400 with Turbo Tax . Tax Cut needs to be improved before it should be released to the public !
 After reading the negative reviews about TurboTax on Amazon , I decided to purchase TaxCut this year . It installed ok , but the interview questions were not easy to understand and the `` Help '' was not helpful either . After spending many hours entering my data , my return was full of errors.I decided to go back to TurboTax . It took me less time to enter the data and also found deductions -LRB- such as CA vehicle registration VLF -RRB- that were not part of the TaxCut interview.If time and money are more important to you than activation scheme and spyware , I would recommend TurboTax .
 I used TaxCut five years ago to file my taxes and found its interface awkward and hard to use . I have been an avid Turbo Tax user for the past four years . This year 's version of Turbo Tax has added spyware code that sends information to the company about your computer even after you have uninstalled it . So I thought I would go back to TaxCut and give it a try again.BIG MISTAKE!Tax Cut will not load properly if you have a home network , cable modem , or virus software . I found this out after completing my entire tax form and attempting to e-file my return . For some reason the program had changed all of my address and zip code information erroneously . After giving tech support way too much personal data they suggested I totally uninstall the product , disconnect my network , unplug my modem , turn off my virus software and dial in via modem ... . then re-type my entire return in again . Did that and then could not e-file . After two more calls to support it was determined that TaxCut could not complete an e-filing successfully . I was told by the support staff that my State did not support e-filing , but I have filled electronically many times in the past with Turbo Tax , like I will do next year !
 The prodcut says it will import TurboTax data from last year . However the product fails to import and Tech Support tells me my file is too large -LRB- 100k -RRB- . They say the only way to import is to open the file in last years TurboTax -LRB- I threw away -RRB- and reduce the file size and then import.Both TurboTax and TaxCut get failing grades this year . They both should be ashamed of themselves .
 Yikes ! This was a nightmare for me . I thought I 'd try TaxCut out this year and I 'm sorry I did . I used Turbo Tax last year and I felt as though I always knew what was being done , but this was not so for TaxCut . TaxCut never showed me the final form until I searched all over the software to find the right link.I recommend Turbo Tax whole heartedly !
 I read about the bad things about TurboTax this year , so switched to TaxCut . But it has problems .1 . It does n't know about the handling of ESPP or Options , in this edition , no question about ESPP or option isasked . You have to do you own calculations -LRB- e.g. the ESPPgain is already included in W-2 etc. -RRB- , I ended updoing the math manually myself .2 . It can not do E-file behind firewall , or even home networks!I am stuck now , can not do E-file ! I used to do E-file withthe same network with Turbox Tax last year without problem!This is per TaxCut tech support that you ca n't file if youare behind firewall .3 . Other misc usability issues.I would recommand getting Turbox Tax and that third partysoftware to wipe out those bad softwares .
 While the program is great , the customer support system is lacking . I called the 800 phone number for a recorded message that directed me to a long distance phone number . When I dialed that phone number , another voice message instructed me to dial a different long distance phone number . Two long distance phone calls later I spoke with a customer service representative that was not very helpful .
 I never thought I 'd find a glitch in a reputable tax accounting software program but TaxCut Deluxe has one . This probably would n't affect 99.9 % of potential buyers , but it did affect me . My daughter had unearned income of over $ 1500 last year from sale of stocks . She is 12 years old , and the tax program picked up on this and stated it would generate the `` kiddie tax '' but it wo n't figure it out for you . You need to know your gross income , but you ca n't access that on the return at the time . It tells you to complete Form 8615 which you ca n't do until you complete your return first . Very frustrating .
 I have used TurboTax for the last 10 years , but based on the recommendations of people who wrote rave reviews about TaxCut ; I thought I would try it . I found it to be very confusing and went out to day and purchased TurboTax . I have a used TaxCut if anyone is interested .
 I just wasted 22 bucks . I have no way to download this product
 I went to TaxCut because of the spyware problem in TurboTax last year . The program started out fine , but would not end , and could not make electronic submissions to Fed or State . Talked to everyone in TaxCut and I felt I was debuging the program . Had to snail mail the State after finally getting the Fed return to work . Took an extra two weeks to do this .
 I was lured to TaxCut by spyware mistake in TurboTax . I can not reget more . For : a. Immensely lower quality . Items left marked `` To Do '' after I gone through them several times . Questions asked `` Are you subject to ... ? '' In order to use this program you must know already everything in tax law , or its plain useless unless you return is extremely simple.b . And it finally got my return REJECTED !! Why ? I did not supply Electronic Funds Withdrawal amount and date ! Check printout , I DID supply . OK , proposed solution
 Same problem as other user below - ca n't import last year 's TurboTax data . IN fact , this was a problem LAST year as well , I 'm shocked they have n't fixed this `` little '' problem that 's keeping their customer base from moving to TaxCut .
 After reading the comments about TurboTax 's registration policy , I abandoned years of its use in favor of TaxCut , and this was a mistake . Those reviews must have been written by TaxCut employees.TaxCut 's interview asks you things like , `` Do you need form 2112-yyz ? '' I do n't know those answers ; just ask me simple questions as TurboTax does . For some reason TaxCut thinks I own a business , although I do n't . Now I believe in `` garbage in / garbage out '' and take some responsibility for a wrong answer somewhere throughout the interview , but I never suffered this confusion in any of the years I used TurboTax . Anyhow , I 'm stuck in a cycle where I fix errors only to generate more errors . When I fix those I get the first set of errors again . It 's maddening.A friend used TurboTax this year , and did n't find the registration process intrusive in the least .
 To add insult to injury Tax Cut also inaccurately calculated my tax return resulting in a correction from the IRS and a lesser refund . There 's nothing like the cold-chill up the back when you see `` IRS '' in the return address box on the envelope . Thanks H&R ! The mail-in refund people play games with the Catch 22 of needing original copies of the receipt and UPC in two places at once . Of course I got the cheaper refung only . I never seem to get used to all the incompetence & dishonesty in our society everywhere . Zero Stars for Tax Cut !!!
 Save time , just throw your money out the window .
 For the prior four years I used TurboTax . This year , heeding warnings of TurboTax 's adware and spyware , I tried TaxCut . I found many differences between the two , with TaxCut being worse by far.For example , where TurboTax asks simple questions in ordinary language , TaxCut 's questions are often phrased in technical IRS jargon . Where TurboTax makes complex calculations `` behind the scenes '' using IRS rules , TaxCut in many cases requires YOU to make those calculations . In some cases the program required me to download an IRS publication and use a worksheet to figure out what TurboTax does automatically.My taxes are not especially complicated . Part of my income comes from employment with taxes withheld , and part from self-employment , for which I pay quarterly estimated taxes . TurboTax handled both very easily , even figuring my estimated tax for the coming year -LRB- based on the prior year 's income -RRB- . TaxCut required me do make the estimates . When I entered the dates I had made quarterly payments during 2002 , the program flagged them as errors -LRB- `` dates are prior to beginning of year '' -RRB- . What year ? 2003 ? They were estimated payments made DURING 2002 . Because of such catch-22s as this , I finally just closed the program and uninstalled it.In a nutshell , TaxCut requires you to interpret IRS tax rules and use them to make complex calculations that TurboTax does automatically . And TaxCut 's `` error '' check put me in a trap I could n't get out of . I will definitely not use TaxCut again .
 I 'm always hesitant to write these reviews on products I do n't like . Not that the reviews are n't worthwhile - I 'm just fairly unmotivated when it comes to this sort of thing . But TaxCut was such a dismal piece of software that I just had to tell other interested folks about my experience . I purchased TaxCut because I wanted to `` take a stand '' on the TurboTax locked-license issue -LRB- read the TT reviews for more info -RRB- . After this experience , though , I am * very * glad that the Quicken folks have stated they wo n't lock next year 's TT ! Otherwise , I would 've had to resorted to doing my taxes by hand . For me , TaxCut was that bad - I would 've saved more time and frustration by doing my taxes by hand.I used TaxCut for both my wife 's and my individual taxes -LRB- we filed separately -RRB- . We filed both Federal and California taxes . My wife worked for a company for the entire year , and I worked for a small company for about of the year , and then contracted for of year . My wife and I are both computer folk -- I 'm a Windows software engineer , and she 's an NT/Unix SysAdmin -- so we know our way around computers & software . Regardless , TaxCut caused me all sorts of grief . Here 's a list of the problems I ran into whilst using TaxCut : - Though I have a full-time broadband connection , TaxCut could n't find the network . This meant that I could n't do online updates -LRB- I had to download & install them manually -RRB- * and * I could n't file my taxes online -LRB- hence I could n't take advantage of TaxCut 's online-filing rebate -RRB- . TaxCut 's technical support was worthless at helping me solve this problem - though admittedly I did n't spend too much time working on this problem , and just resigned myself to paper-filing . - The software reported incorrect results for my wife 's California return ! It was reporting that her refund was going to be every penny she paid in state taxes -LRB- ~ $ 6K -RRB- , rather than owing $ 133 , which turned out to be her real state tax liability . Oddly , though , when I reviewed her internally-generated state tax form -LRB- using the `` view Form '' feature -RRB- , it showed the correct -LRB- owe $ 133 -RRB- value - somehow TaxCut 's left hand did n't know what the right hand was doing ! This was problematic , because even though the form was correct , the `` interview '' wizard still acted as though I was going to get a refund - and I have no idea what sort of deduction it was using for the federal taxes . After banging my head against this problem solo for quite a while , then going round-and-round with TaxCut 's horrible tech support folks -LRB- they were utterly worthless -RRB- , I finally started over w / my wife 's taxes - this time , it got it right . -LRB- Note
 The reason I bought TaxCut was reading negative reviews of TurboTax here on Aamazon.Now I know that TaxCut is inferior to TurboTax.Keep your receipt and UPC barcodes so you 'll have a chance to use their money-back guarantee!Here is why :1 . Update download fails if you are using HTTP proxy software.Download can not be cancelled , and `` details '' button is always disabled , so you really ca n't tell if you need the update .2 . GUI feels unnatural for Windows users , menus behave strangely .3 . Text in forms overlaps with numerical entries . Looks like the engineer did n't realize that fonts sizes differ from installation to installation . Biggest drag is that numerical entries often do n't fit in their boxes . This is especially annoying and misleading when minus sign is cut off .4 . Impossible to insert entries in the middle of list -LRB- for example in Schedule D -RRB- . This forced me to reenter the whole list of 56 entries because I have missed a few wash sale transactions .5 . Only name of transaction is displayed in list , no dates , even though there is plenty of space . Consequently , it 's hard to tell apart transactions in the same security .6 . No way to reorder or sort transactions .7 . Often when you hit enter to continue with next field , input jumps randomly to some previously entered field , rather than advancing to next field .8 . When I tried using mouse to advance to next field that fared even worse , as the whole form would than scroll , making it hard to track my progress through the form .9 . I could not figure out what part of the interview would bring me to Schedule D. Interview seems to be worded so unintuitively , that it 's easier to simply fill out the forms.To conclude , TurboTax CDilla screw-up seems innocuous comparing to the incompetence of people that built TaxCut.I ca n't believe Baron gave it # 1 rating !
 I was a happy TurboTax since the days of 3.5 '' disk install.I moved to TaxCut because of the hype about spyware in TurboTaxAnyway , big mistake . Here were the problems .1 -RRB- The product did not transfer over data related to Alternative Minimum Tax from TurboTax - meaning that Alternative Minimum Tax Credit was not calculated . Tech Support response - start over and do n't use TurboTax import .2 -RRB- I finally got TaxCut to recognize my AMT credit . But it kept `` forgetting '' it . If I touched a field , the 1040 would include the credit . But next time I loaded TaxCut it was gone .3 -RRB- I tried to e-file and the program crashed . Tech support says to start over . A real hassle given the amount of data I had entered . Now I will have to paper file .4 -RRB- In general - does not feel as solid and reliable as TurboTax.Back to TurboTax next year .
 I used TurboTax for the past two years . After reading the review about TaxCut , got fooled to buy this product.My wife has only Tax Payer ID -LRB- TIN -RRB- , with that the state program did n't start to work and complained SSN is not correct ! Customer service says update the latest from the website , looks like standard answer , that does n't solve the problem . They never tested this simple thing I guess . Finally I found a workaround , enter some random SSN number for my wife and proceed to State program and then come back and change the SSN . What the heck ? Then what about any complex calculations ? How can you be sure that it has been tested?I crosschecked my tax calculations manually to make sure it matches before e-filing . Good news is I got the refund in 8 days , a big relief to me.I 'll going back to TurboTax , no doubt .
 I tried TaxCut this year after years of using Turbo Tax . It turne d out to be a massive exercise in frustration . I was prompted to get the latest tax forms , and the download locked up . Tech support told me to update my Windows XP , which took hours . Result
 I 've been a Turbotax user in the past and had no problems , but concerns about spyware this year made me switch to Tax Cut . Since Turbotax has provided a means to uninstall the questionable program , I 'm going to use that this year after all even thought I have `` finished '' doing my taxes with Tax Cut . Why ? I 've had a host of problems and outright mistakes , impossible to override without losing e-file ability , because I moved last year . Addresses change willy-nilly within the software . State income is computed incorrectly . My state tax income withheld is no where to be seen , and trying to override the entry takes me noplace except the dreaded threat to void my e-file status . I 'm technically competent with a PhD in science , and this thing is more frustrating than an oral defense.Bottom line , Tax Cut seems to be just fine for federal filing . If you moved and are a partial year resident and trying to file your state return -LRB- s -RRB- with Tax Cut , just forget it . This stinker makes Microsoft 's worst dog a prize winner .
 This software is not user friendly at all . My employer 's address is out of the state in which I live . This program in its infinte wisdom decided that I did live in that state . And after much searching through the documentation , there does not appear to be a way to override this . Even if I could , I am uneasy at the fact that if it has messed up something as simple as a state field that it may have messed up some other field or calculation . Quality is extremely important in a product like this and this one does not make the grade .
 I found in using the Delux version that a form was missing , 8582 CR which is needed to establish whether a specific content of Form 8582 , namely , a tax credit would be allowed and yet the latter form was available . The state version -LRB- CA -RRB- also had forms missing , namely , forms for reporting installment sales . These forms are all available in the largest selling tax prep program , TurboTax . I was also very displeased with the fact that you can not print out a listing of interest or dividend sources for inclusion in the return to support the numbers in Sched B without the following printed on the form in bold and large letters `` Not For Filing '' . Their were other problems with the listing . I contacted the company re ' the missing forms . Their reply was for me to get the forms from the government but they also pointed out that then the return could no longer be submitted electronically . Their money back guarantee is also a laugh since they require the inclusion of the originalbar code from the box . But in my case , I had alredy sent this in for a rebate . I suggest you buy TurboTax .
 After spending several hours entering my Federal return , TaxCut crashed upon entering the state program . To fix the problem , Block tech support told me to start again from scratch and re-enter the Federal return without doing an import of my previous years return.Rather than fixing a blatant bug , they want me to spend time entering my return again . ...
 I decided I would try TaxCut this year instead of Turbo Tax since it had so much bad publicity . Well TaxCut was a big mistake . It was very confusing to use and would constantly come up with different refund ammounts every time I opened the program , even after saving it ! I called tech support and they gave me the `` Well its not us , it must be you '' answer . I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING TAXCUT NEXT YEAR !! I will most likely go back to Turbo Tax , which served me very good the last three years . Hopefully Turbo Tax gets their act together and changes things for next year because TAXCUT IS HORRIBLE !!
 As so many have written , it will not import TurboTax data , despite the fact that I had called AND written TaxCut prior to purchase.They really pitched me on how easy it would be to change over . Heh . Boy , do I ever feel like a sucker.I wo n't take everyone through my nightmare , but the upshot is that on my very powerful , new , no-problem pc , TaxCut does n't cut it . It fails all over the place when trying to import my teeny file from TurboTax . Yet , they say it 's too large a file . Right!They have 3 fixes , and the `` tech support '' gives them over and over and over again . They wo n't listen that you 've done those 3 things 20 times each , and they do n't work.So they got my money once , but they 'll never get it again .
 This product is terrible . I 've used Turbo Tax for years and switched because of the bad reviews on Amazon . What a waste of money . The questions are unclear , the help is terrible , and unlike Turbo Tax , which figures out what is needed for you , this program keeps asking questions that it should be able to figure out . Instead , I will have to sift through tax documentation to figure out the answers myself or buy Turbo Tax after all . This product is not much easier than just filling out the forms by hand .
 I bought this one because of the reviews it 's received here . However , my road is not quite smooth as advertised . Since I 'm living in New Jersey and hence there are two mandatory contributions -LRB- SDI and UI -RRB- by the state which show in the W-2 form . However , this software does n't carry over all those two items into the `` state and local taxes '' section of Schedule A for itemized deductions , instead it only considers only one of them . I called the technical support -LRB- who was professional and responsible by the way :--RRB- and it ended up with manually enterring the missing one there . However , after I entered that , my federal tax return got screwed up with some riduculous numbers . It did n't help even after I chose `` Recalculate '' menu from the `` Tools '' and I had to shut it down and restart it . After navigating my tax summary , all the sudden it corrected itself . I have no ideas regarding what was going on underneath but am just worried about its accuracy if I continue to use the products of the same family . The print-out is not quite well because all the enterred number are in regular instead of bold font . I 've decided to not go with this product ...
 I have been using Turbo Tax for many years , but because of the spyware installed with it and because of the reviews I read of this product , I decided to try Tax Cut this year . It specifically states in all the information that you can import information from last years turbo tax form into tax cut ... but guess what . It doesnt work . I wrote customer support and asked them about the probelem and how to fix it ... and their response was ... `` I understand your frustration . I recommend that you update Turbo Tax . `` It sure doesnt sound as if they want my business . I will probably use the product this year because I have already paid for it ... but next year , I doubt it . And I definitely would not recommend it .
 I bought this because TurboTax instituted it new one computer policy . It is not worth the money.Federal and state deductions are different in CA , and TaxCut calculated the state deductions incorrectly.It 's user-interface was not user friendly.The help site at IRS.gov was easier to use and understand than the help with this product.The error checking created more errors than it caught , and ended up creating a loop so that I had to manually fill in the forms to fix.In the end , it told me that it could not electronically file a standard form in California . It can only file the EZ form , and I would have to print out my forms and mail them in.By the time I downloaded the extra forms and worksheets needed for this progam , battled with the software , and was rejected by the e-filing system , I could have filled in the forms by hand with a calculator and done a less frustrating , faster , and better job .
 TaxCut made my tax filing slightly easier for me . The program does not explain tax lingo sufficiently . Because of this program , I am extremely frustrated since I do not understand anything the program explained . As a result , I have many errors on my tax return . I am very new to doing my taxes on my own . In previous years , accountants did my taxes for me .
 My kids had investment income which generated the `` kiddie tax '' . TaxCut has me running in 5 different directions with different forms to compute this . The problem is I 'm not sure it 's correct . I will probably have to see a tax accountant to ensure this has been properly computed . Seems to me this program should be able to handle any type of tax problem .
 As with many others , I bought TaxCut because of the spyware issues with TurboTax . What a mistake ! TaxCut misinterprets a fairly important tax law change from 2001 which allows employees to contribute to both a tax-deferred 403 -LRB- b -RRB- and 457 -LRB- b -RRB- plan . The tax law allows contributions up to $ 11,000 in 2002 to each of these plans , for a total of $ 22,000 . TaxCut incorrectly added back $ 11,000 to my income because it believed I was making an `` excess contribution '' to these plans ... which makes a $ 3,300 difference to my tax bill . TurboTax interprets the law correctly ... so I 'm spending another $ ... to go back to it .
 I have used turbotax for the past few years but switched to taxcut because of product activation . Well , what a mistake ! I had numerous problems with software and tried to contact technical support . Standard answer , contact tax advisor for 19.95 . Then after e-filing for many years with turbotax , I can not with taxcut since I live in New Jersey and work in New York . The tax software can not figure out that my income is taxed in both states and doubles my federal income on the New Jersey 1040 form . As such I owe NJ $ 2000 instead of my $ 600 refund . To correct this , I have to override the software which prevents e-file . DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE STICK WITH TURBOTAX !!
 I switched to TaxCut this year for the usual reasons , and so far am very unimpressed after trying to get started after just one day . Here 's why :1 . The update is over 14MB that needs to be downloaded .2 . The auto-update locked up when I tried to run it twice .3 . The non-auto update file locked up during installation the first time I ran it .4 . TaxCut Deluxe keeps giving errors trying to import my TurboTax file . It took me 20 minutes to get the TaxCut customer support guy to understand the issue . He was very insulting , kept interrupting and kept trying to give me advice that did not apply . FINALLY he asked a supervisor and gave me a very non-detailed suggestion involving going back into TurboTax and re-saving the file after hitting radio button 1 -LRB- which he could n't tell me anything else about except that it is radio button 1 ! -RRB- .5 . -LRB- minor -RRB- The program makes me save my tax info before doing anything even though I have n't put a single thing into it yet .6 . They would not give me tech support without giving them all sorts of personal information -LRB- they even asked for my internet provider ! -RRB- .7 . According to tech support , you have to turn off virus checking software to install or use TaxCut.All in all , very unprofessional , poorly designed , lousy tech support , and after just one day trying to get started I 'm really annoyed .
 I would have rated this `` 0 '' if it was available . Below is a copy of a letter I sent to H&R Block . I hope this review saves somebody else from the problems I have had with H&R Block.Since H&R Block is always offering advice I would like to take some time to offer them some .1 -RRB- You should stay out of the electronic/online tax service . I have used your online browser in the past to file taxes and was unable to complete my taxes after spending 2 hours filling in forms with information only to find out that a form I needed was not available online . Then this weekend I spent another 2 hours doing my Federal taxes , using your TaxCut software , and at the end I could not E-File because of an error message about `` Can not find server_socket_windows '' or something like that . That was with my Cable modem . Then I tried a dial up ISP and got the same error message . Then I called your tech support -LRB- used that phrase losely -RRB- , and was informed it was `` probably '' my computer that was the problem and thanked me for calling . Lot of help that was . Final solution was to print out my tax return and mail them . Gee , why did I not just do that in the first place and forget about paying for your software ? 2 -RRB- Even your computer information that I had to fill out above did not have Windows XP as an option for OS 's . How long has XP been out ? 3 -RRB- I was not happy with Intuit putting `` spyware '' on my computer so I tried your software thinking it would have some privacy . After this `` second '' attempt at using online H&R Block products you can bet that I will `` NEVER '' be back.Not that one unhappy customer makes a difference to you but you can bet that I will share my experiences with my friends.Thank you for `` my '' troubles ,
 My mother worked for H&R ; Block for many years , so I have no personal problem with them.I have not used the 2004 , but I just quit working on the 2002 edition . I got halfway through my return -LRB- 20 hours work -RRB- and I finally quit . The numbers were incorrect , but I did not notice until the last few entries.I have rental properties and , even though I entered the information where it belonged , it somehow got transferred elsewhere . All of my real estate taxes got moved from where they belonged to form A. Entering the information directly onto the tax forms required me to override every single step -LRB- 3 mouse clicks , I think ? -RRB- . Also , I was not able to go to help and figure out what my standard mileage cost was , so it took me considerable time to go through their mileage dialogue boxes when all I wanted was standard mileage.I had used Turbo Tax in previous years and was not unhappy with them ; however , I had heard that Turbo Tax put spyware on the computer , and that it was difficult to install on more than one computer , so I decided to opt for a change . TaxCut was cheaper , and I figured there would really be no difference -LRB- I used Parson 's tax software years ago and liked them until they stopped making that program -RRB- . Anyway , at least for year 2002 , TaxCut is much worse than Turbo Tax and Parson 's old tax program . The big problem is , it puts information in the wrong place ; and I have been doing my own taxes for 20 years , so it is not a mistake which I am making.I downloaded TaxAct just a moment ago ; it is cheaper than either turbo tax or taxcut , and so far , it behaves just like it is supposed to . I have been entering some info by their prompts and other info directingly onto the tax forms , and , except for the fact that the auto-save requires me to hit the hardreturn every time , other than that , I really like TaxAct . It is functioning exactly how it is supposed to . Furthermore , I have entered in a couple of properties and printed it out , and everything is going where it belongs .
 I agree 100 % with the last review from March 28 . I also had some income on a W-2 and other income from self-employment . TaxCut made me fill out more than 1 form manually , one of which I had to download off of the IRS web site . Also , I had to be sure to delete any forms I decided not to use on review - answering No to use the form during the interview will not erase answers previously entered . TaxCut really let me down . The only positive thing I can say is that it did import my TurboTax information and as a whole ran well on XP . I switched from TurboTax because in past years the IRS has made adjustments to my return making me think TurboTax was doing something wrong . Maybe I still made the right decision - since I had to fill out forms manually , my return may be more accurate this year .
 I 've used TurboTax for 4 years but bought this after reading all the reviews about cdilla etc. . I needed something compatible with importing from Fidelity and TaxCut says it is . Big Joke . It wo n't let me import my financial info and the helpline people were useless . Kept sending me `` solutions '' that had nothing to do with my problem . After calling and emailing for 6 days - their ultimate solution was that I should input all my financials by hand instead of trying to import . What a waste of time and money !!! ...
 I decided that I would try the less expensive alternative to Turbotax , a software program I have used for 5 years , with flawless service . I had to calculate mileage for business , although we receive partial compensation for that mileage . What a joke ! taxcut does nothing to assist with simple calculations with business expenses , so I tried customer service ... a much , much bigger joke . After 4 emails , and being advised to claim ourselves as a separate business , we rec 'd this in an email - `` Our Technical Support team provides technical expertise for issues pertaining to TaxCut software . If you have a specific tax question or need tax advice we recommend that you contact the IRS '' ... So , if the software does n't work for your pasrticular situation , too bad . Call the IRS . May as well go to the post office and buy a # 2 pencil.We never had this problem with TURBOTAX . Taxcut is a one time mistake . Save yourself the time , moneey , and frustration . I want software that works .
 I purchased this app because I was fed up with paying the annual Intuit surcharge plus the inclusion of dodgy policing software.However much you dislike TurboTax at does manage to work most of the time unlike Taxcut . This looks and operates like an old DOS application running in a fixed Windows shell . I have n't seen anything so bad since the mid 90 's . It also crashed a fair number of times under XP.Then there is the so called interview process which is about as user friendly as looking at the IRS guidelines . Half the forms that I required had to be downloaded and added in , an excruciating painful and slow process . And getting the depreciation process to work was close to brain surgery . In the end I was so confused by the collection of seemingly random forms required that I requested a refund and purchased TurboTax.Don ' t waste you time with this amateur offering resembling a real software product .
 For the 2002 version Intuit has put a program on the software which requires the user to `` verify '' the software . This Macrovision software is to prevent sharing of the software . I have no problem with that , if it would allow it to work on my computer !!!! Intuit does not have a fix at this time ...
 I have been a TurboTax user for years -LRB- and always liked it -RRB- but did n't but it this year due to the registration problems . I tried the switch and will never EVER use TaxCut again . With a cable modem , firewall , and antivirus software , I am completely unable to find a way to efile despite following any -LRB- useless and difficult to obtain -RRB- advice from TaxCut . Moreover , I took my file to another person 's house with a dial-up and was still unable to e-file . If this was n't enough , the program is inferior in just about every regard to Turbotax unless you are filing a very uncomplicated form . If you have your own business , do taxes for an elderly sick relative , or have any complicated issues -LRB- or if you want to e-file -RRB- , avoid this software even if they give it to you for free .
 ~ ~ ~ The tech support was useless . I called four times without my problems being solved . All four representatives that I talked with seemed not familiar with the product at all . Moreover , the tech support is not provided through a toll-free number . When I sent my questions through e-mail , the feedback that I got was just to uninstall and reinstall the application . It was not even for my specific questions.Furthermore , the software was not user-friendly when I intended to revise ~ ~ ~ ~ information that I had inputted previously . Sometimes the system failed to reflect the changes that I had made . ~ ~ ~
 This product was a huge disappointment ... P > First off , the price does n't include e-filing costs or state tax forms . You can get rebates to cover the federal e-filing charge and the state tax prep software , but not the state e-filing charge . ... Second , the questionnaire was poorly designed . For example , the questions relating to IRAs were obviously written by somebody who was a little unclear on the concept that there is such a thing as a non-deductible IRA . It was capable of handling it , but a lot of the questions did n't make a lot of sense . Also on the IRA subject , it asks you what your contribution was this year and then what your basis `` is '' in the IRA . It does not say whether it means what was your basis before this year 's contribution or what is it now . Despite the use of the present tense , it really want the number before this year , but do n't expect the help to tell you that . Even the IRS form is clearer.Finally , the service was able to e-file my federal return with payment by direct withdrawal from my account , but could not do this with the state filing . The message simply said that my payment information had not been transmitted to the state tax office . It gave no indication of why . Their tech support line also had nothing better to suggest than try again . ... Do n't waste your time with this product .
 I bought TaxCut after hearing all the concerns about changes to TurboTax this year . This was a mistake . The TaxCut software is simply unable to cope with a home network and with a proxy server and a firewall . I had to perform updates manually by going to the TaxCut website , and when I had successfully finished my return , I simply could not e-file and had to file the slow and old-fashioned way -- with a paper return . I plan to go back to TurboTax next year ! I never had such problems with TurboTax .
 I read the reviews of Turbo Tax this year , and since there were so many people disappointed with the product , I decided to try Tax Cut . What a mistake !! I 've spent more time fixing the errors that this program created than all of the time that I 've spent doing taxes using Turbo Tax in the last several years . It does not bring over all of the information when you import from last year 's return . If you uncheck a question , it does not automatically uncheck the rest of the items that are related to the question . It does not give you all of the correct options that the forms have . If I had not been familiar with doing taxes and had no idea what my end result would be , I would have paid $ $ $ in taxes instead of getting the $ $ $ $ refund that I was supposed to receive . The software is faulty and there are too many glitches in the program . I am throwing out this c.d. and will go back to my trusty and easy to use Turbo Tax !
 This year I have bad experience with both TurboTax and TaxCut.First , TurboTax . I bought it but never installed it . I can accept their activation scheme and I can accept their hidden directory on the machine . But when I learned that they also install a background process on the machine that runs forever even after TurboTax is uninstalled , I said enough is enough.Then I bought TaxCut . The first problem was the GUI layout . On my NT machine a lot of fields overlap so I can not read the numbers . Second , when I imported my last years tax return from TurboTax , it listed the depreciation items of a rental property multiple times . Third , TaxCut complains that my wife 's name has ' - ' in it and therefore I can not file my return by paper . Well , that is how her name shows on the social security card . Fourth , when I worked on the depreciation items of a rental property for my state tax return , TaxCut asked me to open the Tax form , read the state tax instructions , and fill in the form myself ! In other words , the only difference from filling a paper form is that the form is on the computer screen . Eventually I had to dig out my return of the previous 2 years and learn how TurboTax did it.So I think I need go back to TurboTax after all . I will buy a new computer and dedicate the old one to TurboTax . They can do whatever they want on that machine .
 After using TurboTax for years , I thought I 'd give this a try because a -RRB- it 's slightly less expensive and b -RRB- it has more flexibility than TurboTax , from what I 've read . I wanted to be certain that I would n't face hassles down the road if I needed to reference an old return from a different computer or hard drive , and I was n't assured that TurboTax would provide that . Nor did I want TurboTax 's additional spyware installed on my machine.So , I installed TaxCut , and the installation and product update went fairly well . It easily and correctly imported data from my old TurboTax return . It did slap an annoying EarthLink icon on my desktop , even after I declined their `` offer . '' After working on my return for several minutes , the program quit with a C++ runtime error -- without saving my return to that point . So , I opened it up again , set the autosave for a smaller increment , and continued . I was glad I did that , because it shut down twice more.That 's plenty irritating , but in addition , I found that the program was not as thorough as TurboTax . There were a few times where my answer to a question was a `` special case '' and it referred me to an IRS form , without any further assistance . This occurred a couple times on the state form as well -- the program basically said , `` Find the tax form instructions and read them ; we have no idea how someone would qualify for these credits . `` In summary , I found TaxCut was not nearly as good as TurboTax , but at least I knew what I was installing . All things considered , I think I 'll go back to TurboTax next year .
 I tried Tax Cut instead of Turbo Tax this year and was terribly frustrated . If you have moved from one state to another , yet have W2 's to file from the first state , Tax Cut changes your residence state to the state of the employer on your first W2 . If you change the residence state back , it changes the employer 's state . Their Technical Support was unaware of this problem and were unable to help solve it . I finally fixed it by listing as the first W2 one from an employer in my state of current residence.To make matters worse , I bought the State program . If you do n't do the above fix -- still unknown to Tax Cut -- the program wo n't recognize that your W2 's show you paid any taxes in the state of prior residence.The final strike came when I discovered Tax Cut State will not allow me to file electronically with my state of prior residence . I can only do it with my state of current residence . Again , I called their Technical Support . I was told that 's the way the software is designed . When I pleaded that they neglected to include this information in the software ads and packaging , it was explained to me that the readme file included this information , as if that should have informed me of the restriction before I bought the software.This software is quirky , buggy , and unprofessional . Do n't buy it .
 This year we decided to go with TaxCut due to the security concerns of installing TurboTax - that was a mistake . Let me preface my review by saying that I have an IT background . I had trouble navigating through the steps and ensuring all the appropriate steps had been completed -LRB- when I actually filed , many checkboxes were still blank on the outline of steps to complete , but we felt confident the ones that were still blank did not apply - nevertheless it was very disconcerting -RRB- . Navigation was also difficult when trying to find a specific form and the questions that populated that form.At one point , I found myself in an infinite loop & multiple copies of the same form were being developed . I called technical support -LRB- a number they make it very hard to find -RRB- & did get to speak with someone who helped me resolve the problem .
 TaxCut provides support via a long-distance number -LRB- Dallas , TX -RRB- not an 800 number . Their tech support online is useless unless you just need some hand holding . They promise e-mail Tech support in 48 hrs , but my request took over a week to get a non-satisfactory reply . I wanted to return this for a refund , you 'll also find they make that difficult.On a side note , if you were leaving TurboTax because of the spyware/spam associated with it , TaxCut may not be a good choice either . Read their privacy policy , they will sell your information to third parties .
 I get the TaxCut because I bought a laptop from Dell and Dell give it free . I decide to use it after I read so many compaints about TurboTax . After using TaxCut , I feel that maybe I should consider filing my tax return manually.The program has several problems . The step-by-step guide provides little help . When you hit `` Help '' button , it always bring you to the help home page and you have to dig out the information yourself . Sometimes I think I might as well just read the IRS booklet myself.The program has many bugs , to name a few ,1 . I import my last year TurboTax tax return . After that , the program somehow links the zip codes of my home address and company address together . If I manually change any one of the zip code , the other one will change together . I can only have one correct address no matter what I do . I end up just start all over without importing at all .2 . Do not use the `` Review your entries '' feature under the `` Report '' menu . I try to use it to correct an error . TaxCut crashes on me when I click the `` Interview '' button in order to get back to interview steps3 . TaxCut State for California keeps blocking my e-filing . It keeps saying that I have illegal hyphen or punctuation in either the tax payer or the spouse 's name . I checked over and over again and there are neither hyphen nor punctuation in any of the names . I decides to start all over the third time and carefully re-type everything . I still can not e-file . This is the worse year for e-filing a tax return I ever has . I am wondering why these company can not do a good QA on their product . This is just so frustrating and unbelievable .
 ... This program is buggy . If not because of the turbo tax bashing issues , I would have sticked with them.The numbers for the returns are off the display boxes . Then , if you want to mail the state form manually , the grid that has all your stock information DOES NOT get expand automatically to show the name of the company . Hence , I had to use a pen to rectify this problem . My suggestion is make sure you print out your tax forms and check them . Who knows what else is in there.Who knows what else is buggy in this software ...
 After using Turbotax for years , I decided to try TaxCut Deluxe because of concerns over spyware and product activation in Turbotax . A recent PC Magazine review recommends either program , so I expected little difference between the two.After trying TaxCut Deluxe 2002 I must disagree ! TaxCut seems like a product that was brought to market without being fully tested . The TurboTax user interface is much more polished , and the TurboTax help has more depth.Examples of TaxCut bugs : - printing W-4 with `` Not for Filing '' option selected cuts off all the data on the printout . - Tax Estimator Form for looking a multiple scenarios displays extra columns that ca n't be deleted . - Cursor does n't follow standard Windows convention of moving to the next field when Tab key is pressed on some forms . - Several typos in the text of help screens and forms.I 'll probably switch back to TurboTax next year to get back to a polished and mature product . -LRB- If Intuit pulls their head out and get rid of the spyware and product activation problems in Turbotax . -RRB-
 After completion of all data entry for my Federal return , TaxCut ran an error check that resulted in a message that this was a half-baked version . I was instructed to download an update . Well , imagine my surprise when I found that THE UPDATE WAS NOT AVAILABLE ! Now , what am I supposed to do - file an extension until they can get the software updated ? This is a terrible way to treat a long-time user ... Make that a `` former '' long-time user .
 Great firewall and antivirus software . If you 're buying this to use the parental control feature , however , do n't . The lack of working URL updates for parental control makes that piece of the software useless . Symantec has known about the URL update problem since Sep and has yet to provide a solution .
 This is the most problematic program I 've ever tried to use or uninstall . My first problem was with my wireless internet connection card from Cingular . Norton would not allow me to load web pages . Boy ... I was protected ! I could n't even load the Norton web site to try to find help . I disabled NIS and I was finally able to load web pages.Then , I could not download my mail into Outlook . I called Earthlink , my dialup service , and told them the error message I received and they told me it was NIS . Surprise , Surprise , Surprise . NOT !! I called Norton ... it 's not our fault , it 's Earthlink 's fault . Not even close !! I did a web search for the error number and 3 of the 5 possible causes for this error , according to Microsoft , deal with NORTON !! After repeated calls to Norton , and disabling certain parts of the program , I finally went in and edited my startup list , removing NIS , and now my computer works better . However , I 'm unprotected against internet attacks because I 've had to disable all of Norton to get anything to work.Even with NIS disabled , I still have trouble with my CPU usage spiking at random times . I 'm going to follow the directions on the Norton site for removing the entire program and using something else . Alcatraz Security rated The Shield Pro 2005 as the best antivirus program so I 'll give them a try . Anything HAS to be better than the trouble I 've had with this program.Oh ... I have several friends who have tried this program on their laptops and are experiencing the same problems I am so I know it 's not me and my computer , it 's Norton and personally , I 'm tired of hearing them say it 's not their fault and it 's not their problem . I 'm moving on to hopefully greener pastures .
 Once upon a time , a little company had a product called AtGuard that would :1 -RRB- Monitor your connection for hack attacks and other surreptitious communications ,2 -RRB- Allow you to explicitly determine which programs could contact the ` net -LRB- outbound , inbound or both -RRB- ,3 -RRB- Allow you to block or accept cookies from particular sites , and4 -RRB- Block almost any banner or popup adAll of these items could be configured in a ` learning mode ' which prevented long hours of configuration . Every time a new communication/cookie was attempted , you would be able to block it on a one-time or permanent basis.The company that published AtGuard went on to other things but many of the features -LRB- and much of the source code from the look of the interface -RRB- was purchased by Symantec/Norton and made part of their Internet Security package.Unfortunately , in their typical attempt to make the software usable for all , Symantec has made the software usable for none , thanks to the big-button syndrome.Configuration items that were a single mouse click away in AtGuard -LRB- or accessible via a ` dashboard ' -RRB- are now buried in layers of dialog boxes and ` advanced ' options . Since when is blocking ad strings an advanced option?Let 's face it - the cookie controls in modern browsers are still pretty lousy and mysteriously there are few , if any , ad-blocking tools . Of course , any company doing business on the web has zero incentive to block ads , since it might be one of their own.AdSubtract is probably a better choice but I find it delays page loads.If you want to monitor/control traffic , use BlackIce or ZoneAlarm.Fine print from the warranty
 I 'm still testing Security 2002 on my XP Home addition so my opinion may change over time . I bought IS 2002 mainly for the parental control . I should n't have bothered . The control is entirely unacceptable . Yes , you can pick sites to block and applications but you can not limit time on the internet or chats . It either blocks everything choosen all the time or not at all . So , if I want to restrict Jr. 's online use right after school , but allow access after his homework is done I have to go into configuration and reset everything each time . Both NetNanny and Cyber Sitter allow you to set access times . I 've also heard that IS does n't block access very well either . One thing I found curious is that one of the default blocked catagories of websites in the parental control is `` Religious '' . I 'm not sure what the rational is behind that , but do n't we want children to learn about religions?The instructions are vague and incomplete . Most of what IS does can be done by various freeware available on the net ...
 Not only is this horrible software , but it will destroy your ability to open your Email program . When you go to Norton / Symantec for help , you will learn that they have built a tremendous firewall around the company against its customers . Their technical support consists of a bunch of meaningless white papers . Call them , and you are told you will be paying $ 30 for the call . If you are willing to do this , you go thru many levels of questions , only to be told that this `` service '' is not available . I am extremely technically savy , but I ca n't get this to work . My ISP provider has no ideas either . There should be a big warning on this box that it will foul up your Email . BEWARE ... buy this product at your own risk .
 I have always loved Norton software . I 've used Norton AntiVirus for the past few years , upgrading yearly . I purchased Norton Utilities and Norton CleanSweep , also finding them quite easy to use and very helpful . However , Norton Internet Security 2002 -LRB- NIS -RRB- has caused me quite a few problems . For reference , I have a Pentium III -LRB- 650 mHz -RRB- laptop with 192 MB RAM running Windows XP , and I use a high-speed internet connection.First , the good news . NIS 's firewall is easy to use and works well . There are plenty of customizable features , good protection against intruders , and awesome cookie-blocking . The Ad Blocking feature is wonderful , though it has issues , as I will soon explain . Norton AntiVirus 2002 -LRB- NAV -RRB- is , as any Norton user knows , a great antivirus program , and it integrates perfectly into NIS . If NIS could manage to keep all of these components working , this would be one fantastic suite of software.As other reviewers have noted , NIS has some bugs that Symantec has yet to fix . There is nothing more annoying than having a problem , visiting Symantec 's Tech Support website , and finding a lovely `` We have no solution to this problem at this time '' message . Very polite , Symantec , but not helpful at all . One bug in particular that 's causing me some problems involves the Ad Blocking feature . It suddenly does not work anymore ... Apparently this has something to do with an update I downloaded with LiveUpdate . Now , correct me if I 'm wrong , but are n't updates supposed to * improve * one 's software ? Hmm.Another bug involves Norton AntiVirus -LRB- NAV -RRB- . Sometimes , AutoProtect will not be enabled when I start up Windows . If I right-click the tray icon and select `` Enable AutoProtect , '' nothing happens . If I attempt to enable AutoProtect using the NAV menu in NIS , I get a wonderfully useless `` Internet Script Error '' message . The same thing happens if I try to enable AutoProtect using either the NAV menu in NAV itself or the Options menu for NAV . I found a fix at Symantec 's site , but really ... What a pain.Now , for the really messy stuff . The following complaint only applies to Windows XP , as I never had this problem before I upgraded my laptop 's OS from Win 98 SE to Win XP . I 'm rather good with computers , but know this
 I received this product with my new Compaq computer which is a Pentium 4 , 1G Ram , running Windows XP . At home , I have a central server which all my computers are networked to access files and the DSL modem . After I installed Norton Internet Security 2002 , none of my computer could access the files on the server or see each other . I called support , and the only way each computer could share files was to take off all the security settings . This defeats one of the purpose of the software - internet security . As for the virus scan , everytime I tried to retrieve a file on another computer , ie file server , my computer would freeze . I uninstalled the program and everything was fine .
 Guess how I spent SuperBowl Sunday !? In complete H * LL dealing with Norton Internet Security -LRB- NIS -RRB- ! It 'll be a long time before I ever buy anything from Norton again . You name , it happened . Spiked CPU usage , no more internet connection , IMPOSSIBLE to uninstall , WORST TECH SUPPORT PHONE MENU SYSTEM I 'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED , unqualified techs who gave up on us and yes , our only option now is to wipe the hard drive and start over . I 'm a software engineer with 20 years of programming experience and am often asked by my friends for computer help . This is by far the worst experience I 've had to deal with . Removing viruses and adware is easier than attempting to remove Norton Internet Security -LRB- NIS -RRB- . I 've wasted more time with NIS than I have with adware for the past 12 months ! I 'd rather leave my computer open to everyone on the net than try to install this software again . Okay , I 'm done , but as you can tell , this software has caused us a lot of grief .
 Symantec 's Norton Internet Security combines a firewall , anti-virus and ad blocking in a nice package . The LiveUpdate feature makes updates easy . However , Symantec will give you LITTLE to NO support even if you find a bug with their product . Good luck contacting them because they have hidden their phone numbers on their website to force you to solve problems yourself . The problem is that some problems are not solvable by anyone other than Symantec . For example , they have a bug that basically breaks ad blocking . Ad blocking does not work . I paid for this functionality and it is completely broken . They gave no way of reporting the problem and left us customers in the dust . There are other problems too that happen from time to time . The anti-virus software sometimes ca n't scan your e-mail . So , you wo n't be able to read your e-mail until they fix their software OR you take the risk of disabling antivirus and getting a potential e-mail virus . I urge everyone who owns this product to complain to Symantec about their complete lack of support . It 's one thing if they want to filter out common user problems that waste their tech support staff 's time but it 's another issue entirely to leave your customers with no recourse .
 I installed this product when I was running IE 5.5 and it istalled fine , but I kept running into the problem that after a few months of use , it would take all the system resources to 100 % , forcing me uninstall to re-install it . This happened for the second time recently , and in the meantime I had installed IE 6 , and now it does n't install properly . As the others that gave it 1 star said , the Cust . Serv . line is virtually useless as is their web support page . I have looked at their FAQ 's and still have n't had a resolution to the problem . Their answer was to wait for the upgrade that is supposed to be automatic , but even that is n't working now . So I 'm stuck , and my 50 bucks is wasted .
 I use this product with Windows ME and XP . In many ways , it is a great product -- if only it did not fail me in the one area for which I selected it -- parental control . Much of the time , the Parental Control feature does not bar my children from visiting restricted web sites . Symantec admits on their support site that they are aware of the problem , but offers no substantive solution . That flaw is substantial to a home with children . For that critical reason , I do n't recommend this product to families .
 If you 're purchasing this to use the parental control software , do n't . Although Norton identified a problem with URL updates for the parental control list in September , they have yet to provide a fix . The antivirus and personal firewall software works like a charm . But Norton 's support -LRB- they do n't respond to email or letters -RRB- for users of the parental control software is nonexistent !
 I love Norton 's products . I 've been using Norton Anti-virus and SystemWorks for years . So I was so excited when I learned they had an Internet Security product . Within the first day after I installed it , I was ready to throw it out the window ! I am well-versed in technology . I was a network administrator for a university department , and I 've written technology books ... so I know what I am doing . But I found this piece of software one of the most frustating exercises in futility EVER . Once installed , it began conflicting with other programs . It blocked many legitimate sites , even though the setting was `` low sensitivity . '' Several times after restarting the machine , it would n't even allow us to connect to the Internet . After 24 hours of playing with it , adjusting it , and reading the Help feature , I gave up and returned it for a refund . I would n't use it even if it were free .
 With the recent improvements in the security settings in MS Internet Explorer 6.0 , many of the features of this software -LRB- e.g. , cookie blocking -RRB- have become redundant . The remaining major feature , ad blocking , is useful but not worth the price of the software.Moreover , the software lacks several functions one would otherwise expect -- pop-up blocking and the blocking and removal of spyware -LRB- hidden programs that , once downloaded onto your system , report back personal information to whoever installed them -RRB- . Of particular concern is the fact that this program pre-approves ads provided by certain information-gathering companies , without bothering to tell you . -LRB- Improves the bottom line , you know ! -RRB- To find and remove these sites , you have have to go to `` Options -- Internet Security -- Advanced Options -- Ad Blocking '' and remove them individually . `` But did n't I buy this software to eliminate that kind of problem ? '' , you ask . Exactly my point .
 Its good protection , but the program 's a little bulky and excessive . The biggest problem
 This program is highly rated by experts . When it works , it works well . Unfortunately , it only works about 50 % of the time . When it fails , it lets EVERYTHING through.Symantec acknowledges that this occurs but , has no solution . Read this quote , concerning the program 's inability to function 100 % of the time , from Symantec 's technical support group
 This software is junk , and in six months of use has never worked as advertised . The anti-virus and firewall protection are marginally acceptable , but the ad trashcan function has never worked and the parental control function fails to load at least half of the time . Unacceptable performance when the primary reason for buying the software was to protect children from inappropriate content . The only thing worse than the software is the technical support . Do n't even think about talking to a real person unless you want to pay them even more money , and their web-based support is even more difficult to get to work than the software .
 I agree with the other one star reviews . I have been trying to update the last verison for weeks . I called customer service and was put on hold for 45 minets then a short session with an incompetant tech . then try something they suggest then call back on hold 1 hour 10 minets . On and on untill I wasted 8 hours trying to fix problem with update . Finally told that they would send new program . Three weeks later I am still waiting . No virus protection . Dont buy this program . It never found a virus . I dont think it did anything but interupt me whenever I tried to go to a new site telling me that the computer was trying to contact the web site . Well da . These people have made their web site purposely difficult to maneuver .
 When upgrading my Dell Dimension 4100 from Win/Me to Win/XP via a scratch install , I was forced to upgrade my NAV license to NAV 2002 for XP support . I chose the NIS 2002 upgrade over the NAV 2002 upgrade because with the ... rebate , it was ... cheaper overall , with more `` function '' . But it -LSB- messed -RSB- up my machine big time . It crippled my internet connection -LRB- cable -RRB- which worked just fine beforehand and the support options and solutions were pitiful.I finally got the thing completely de-installed -LRB- I hope ! -RRB- and bought NAV 2002 instead . I prefer NAV over McAfee but will never buy another Symantec product again after this experience .
 It can be a great product because it combines antivirus and personal firewall in one suite ; however , Norton Antivirus slows down computer a great deal , and requires buying the virus definition upgrade after one year of use . There are a few antivirus software that works better and cost much less
 I had Norton Internet security and returned it after a week . It kept changing my IP address which kept me off of the internet . Kind of scary that it has a mind of it 's own!Symatec also aknowledges a problem with system resources - at times they get so low that our computer clock would even stop . We noticed mouse problems too . While Norton was working , our mouse would n't ! Our cable network provider says that there are many compatability issues with Norton antivirus and also said that their firewall protection is way over-rated ! They recommended McAfee . I have since downloaded McAfee and have had no system failures and my surfing speed is now upto what I had expected for cable !
 Installed it . It installed easily and completely configured itself . Tested it from symantec and grc.com web sites . It performed flawlessly . The system was completely invisible ... Until the next morning.The next morning , the firewall was shut down and could not be restarted . ALL options in the entire system were disabled . The message on screen states it is NOT protecting the system . I was locked out because I was not a ` supervisor ' . I attempted to uninstall it but was not allowed to do so . I downloaded the uninstall program from symantec and uninstalled then reinstalled it . I was very careful this time to create three administrator accounts.It lasted about 12 hours then shut down again . I could not restart it . None of the supervisor accounts I created were accessable . I repeated this episode three more times . The only phone number available on the web site was the number to request a refund . I did . They did n't even ask why . There was NO help availble on the web site . I could have paid 29.95 for a phone call but did n't want to pay 30 bucks for them to tell me how to install a 70 buck program .
 I 'm running XP Home on a Dell Optiplex GX240 with a P4 1.6 ghz , cable internet access thru a Linksys cable modem and wireless router . My setup is all new and works fine . Bought NIS2002 yesterday and installed it . Installed fine , and LiveUpdate worked great . Got all updates , no problem . Set up personal firewall for ` Automatic ' , which is supposed to ask me when an application opens whether I want to allow that app to access the internet or not . Launched Outlook Express 6 , Norton worked OK , everything fine . Launched Netscape 6 and IE6 , and the fun begins . Bottom line
 I 'm only just evaluatingWinFax for my company , we have two PCs with modems , one in the office , one laptop for the boss to commute with . Both PCs use win2000 professional.So far we have n't been able to get it to work at all . On the desktop key features cause it to hang and be closed . On the laptop any attempt to initialize the software will cause bluescreen crash - and that 's really unusual for win2000 . Looks like we 'll be waiting out another year and staying with tried and trusted win 98 software . until we 're happy with further developments .
 I have an early version of WinFaxPRO -LRB- the later versions I 'm told are no better -RRB- that has become engraved on my computer . There 's no way to get rid of it , no way to reinstall it , no way from keeping it from peppering my computer with error messages , no way to get help from Symantec . Oh yes , if you persist , you will unearth a programmer 's directions on removing the program by deleting certain files in the Registry and doing other computer-threatenng tasks . With Symantec 's track record , I 'd sooner have a frontal lobotomy . The same dire warnng holds true for getting rid of GHOHT , and I have the latest version of that . It holds on to your computer like a muscle on a wet rock . Buy a backup program from a more civilized purveyor than Symantec , and for faxes , BUY A STAND ALONE MACHINE!W . Beller
 Trying to use this product on XP is a waste of time/money . Tech Support is useless , as is online support.We have been using winfax for 9 years , but the product has only gotten worse -LRB- more complicated -RRB- . Problems with 10.0 on XP include , word processors locking up , auto receive disabling after receiving 1 fax , lock up on send if using explorer at the same time .
 Once upon a time , Win Fax Pro had a decent program . Today , NOT!And certainly not with XP . The technical advisor was in India -LRB- out sourced -RRB- and I , unwittingly and unknowingly , allowed him to crash my entire system . Complain ? To where ? India fields the calls . Please pay attention to this horror story . Do n't purchase any version -LRB- 10.0 and over -RRB- .
 I bought this software and installed it on one of my customers machines , I set up a special computer to be a `` fax server '' to recieve faxes and organize them into different folders , strangely the WinFax will randomly reject faxes , somedays it will refuse to work , somedays it will work great , somedays it will reject 50 % , who knows what mood its in . I reformatted the computer so that the only thing installed is Win98 and WinFax , I replaced the modem TWICE , my customer moved to a new office in a different building with a completely different phone line and the product still does n't work . Total garbage .
 Absolutely useless . Causes word to lock . Will not uninstall . Symantec fixes do n't work . Hours wasted . Do n't buy this product .
 Please listen to the warnings posted by all the other reviewers ! WinFax Pro 10.0 and 10.03 , crashes a lot ! I got so fed up with it crashing that I uninstalled the software . I also tested it on my friend 's PC and it crashed on his system as well . Hard to believe that this is a product from Symantec . WinFax is on the same level as `` Crippleware '' . Many of us do n't hear that term often anymore , but it has re-surfaced in the form of WinFax . Do NOT buy this product , save your money and look for other Fax software .
 Although I am working around the vast amount of bugs this program carries with it , it does deliver faxes ok . The client/server functionality sucks . The areacode rules are supposed to be set on the server however for some starnage reason they do not work . KB articles on symantecs site only confuse things . HORRIBLE support of this product . I am looking elsewhere for a solution .
 Just bought the package to run under XP and using Outlook . It caused several crashes in XP and Outlook just quit . I used it under Win 2000 and it did well , but if you have XP , you may want to find another program .
 This program is great if that is all you need on your system . Do not expect Outlook to function PERIOD with Winfax 10 installed . It will lock it up like a conficted serial killer . The program itself is pretty functional despite a few operational bugs . But you just can have a program that does n't play well with others no matter how nice its features .
 WinFax Pro 10.0 repeatedly rendered my computer and software programs inoperable . I run Windows98 , and after I installed WinFax 10.0 , I had ongoing problems with multiple blue-screen crashes and had to reboot every 10 minutes . Even when supposedly `` inactive , '' WinFax gobbled up RAM memory -LRB- 128MB -RRB- to the point that I could n't even run other programs , ex . MS Word 2000 . I truly thought my computer was dying ! As soon as I uninstalled WinFax , my computer was back to its wonderful self.Unfortunately , I have had the same problems with several previous WinFax versions , but I kept purchasing new ones thinking that , surely , this version will fix all the bugs . Alas , I wasted alot of money . Every version has caused the same sorts of problems . This is unfortunate , because WinFax is very easy to use and has an well laid out , intuitive interface . But it is a complete NIGHTMARE for the computer system!While I 'm not a techie , I 'm a seasoned user of a variety of software programs , and I have never -- I repeat NEVER ! -- had a program consistently screw up my computer like this . And in all my years using Amazon , I have never written a review of a product . So , that should tell you plenty !
 I purchased WinFax for use on a Thinkpad T23 running Windows 2000 . I 'd had good experiences years ago with an earlier version and hadhigh hopes for this version . However , my hopes were quickly crushed.When installed , it corrupts the macros used by Microsoft Word , causingWord to crash on startup . There 's a fix for this on the Symantec website if you make the correlation and are willing to wade through themenus on the site , but I ca n't believe they 'd ship a product with abug like this . If there were one product to test it with ... WinFax can be configured to answer the phone automatically.Unfortunately , it continues to do this even when the option isdisabled . Very annoying -LRB- both to me and to the people who calledduring the 2 days it took me to figure this out -RRB- . FAX transmission worked . However , FAX reception usually failed.There are a number of suggestions for fixing this problem on theSymantec site -LRB- they suggest that it 's a hardware compatibility problem -RRB- , but my need for this product and my patience bothpassed before I was able to get WinFax to work reliably.Overall , this is one of the worst products I 've ever used , with mostmajor functions failing to work correctly . This product is so bad thatit finally convinced me to abandon Windows in favor of Linux . Why paythis much for a non-functional software when an equivalent donation in theLinux community goes so much farther ?
 This program is by far the worst I 've ever purchased . It clearly does not install/work as advertised with Windows XP . Tech support could n't help and in fact screwed up my registry while trying . Although Symantec agreed to refund my money -LRB- supposedly in 8 wks -RRB- , they wanted to keep the $ 29.95 they charged me to talk to tech support . I argued that if the program worked as advertised , I would n't have needed their tech support -- and certainly should n't be out of $ 30 at the end of the day . I 'm waiting to hear from the `` Consumer Relations '' department . No relief in sight for my damaged registry !!!
 I purchased WinFax Pro 10 from Symantec directly . I had had a WinFax program in one of my old computers -LRB- years ago -RRB- . I do n't remember the version number . So I thought that this new version has to be as good as my old one.I unfortunately downloaded the program after paying for it . My computer is now very slow , I have to keep doing ctrl , alt , del because the program and any other program on my desktop are unresponsive . This happened after I downloaded the WinFax Pro.I went back to the company because I somehow lost the exe file.You 're not able to redownload your purchase . If you have not copied the program to disk or CD you 're out of luck . I 'm really sorry I bought it . The original product I had was wonderful.Symantec does n't have any `` people skills '' .
 It 's the most outrageous , sneaky , aggressive , unruly program I 've ever dealt with , in my 20 years of working with computers . It insists on running continuously , answering all calls , and disregarding the will of its owner , no matter what ! I 'm running it on WinXP . I 've tried everything
 I was forced to upgrade from v. 8.0 when I upgraded my MS Office Suite . Now I have a fax program that hangs up when faxes come through , and sends duplicate copies of outgoing faxes -LRB- i.e. , same fax to John Smith AND to Smith , John -RRB- . Attempts to get help from the company or its website were futile . This product is the biggest piece of garbage I 've come across in a long time.Kerry GleasonAdWorks
 Winfax Pro has caused me more headaches than any other single piece of software . It is buggy and slow and crashes at the drop of a hat . As far as I can tell , it is essentially unmaintained by Symantec ; I do n't think they actually plan on fixing any of the many major bugs , and are just milking this old , old codebase for as long as suckers continue to pay good money for it . Beware !
 This program is virtually unuseable if you intend to use it on the same phone line that brings your DSL . This is true even if you place a filter on the connection to your modem . This is made clear on Symantec 's support pages , but is excluded from its promotional material . An unethical practice in my opinion . Given Amazon 's own uncomplimentary review , one wonders why they sell this product .
 how a company can release a program that does not work is beyond me ... it DOES NOT sync up with ACT ! the way is it designed to do ... I realize that ACT ! changed their software , but that 's no excuse ... the program basically becomes worthless - why no updates ? why no contact program ? why no vision ?
 If you are thinking about buying norton software simply because they are free after rebates , then reconsider it . Although it 's well known Symantec makes reliable softwares , When we talk about their rebates , they are liars . Yes , liars Cthey really deserve this . Based on my personal experience , I even think theirs are worse than the notorious I/O Magic 's -LRB- aka , Hi-Val , Digital research -RRB- . I bought several Norton softwares during last December , and submitted the upgrade rebates right away with required items , Guess what , until today I got only one of them , and it has been almost 6 months . I guess they are testing my memory but unfortunately I kept a good record of every rebate I submitted . That 's what we should do if we are going to buy Symantec softwares with rebates involved , although the best thing I would recommend is to avoid as long as you can .
 Total disappointment!I send lots of faxes as part of my job-seeking process , and when I read about this software I thought it would be particularly useful for saving paper and not using up the ink on my printer , not to mention that faxes get attention faster than an e-mail does , but I was totally disappointed that it DOES N'T work -LRB- symantec admitted so on their website , too ! -RRB- with broadband internet connections . Are these people DELIBERATELY trying to make their products unusable or WHAT ?!!
 I upgraded to Ver .10.02 so I could use it with Win XP . What a mistake ! Microsoft Word crashes on loadup , and Act freezes and wo n't close . As soon as I uninstall WinFax Pro 10 , everything returns to normal . Good Riddence!Want Winfax for free ? Get Norton Systemworks Pro Edition 2003 . Winfax comes with it as one of many usefull utilities , and it dose n't cause any problems .
 This product -LSB- is bad ... I needed to send my resume by fax to a few places and my server is currently offline , so I tried WinFax . While the very basic things work , there are a lot of business features that just do not exists . Such as , what if you want to manually send your faxes and hold them in a queue until you are ready ? There is no way to do this with this software.It looks like this product was released in 1999 or something . It is now 2002 . No updates and no upgrade ? Clearly this is not a product that is very interesting to Symantec . Then again , fax is a technology that is no longer necessary due to eMail .
 how anybody or any company can publish -LRB- in the 10th version in thiscase ! -RRB- such an overpriced and underperforming piece of garbage is unbelievable !
 Thsi will crash Outlook everytime you close Outlook . Period . Tech support is less than helpful despite the fact that they acknowledge it 's a known problem.Please fix this and restore Symnatec 's good name or retire this product .
 I have been using this product since winfax lite , -LRB- around 1995 -RRB- . Back then , windows was not as extensive and burdened with drivers and registry files . In theory , this is an excellent program , allowing an orderly record of all of your faxes ever sent . The unfortunate reality , is that this program will make your Windows PC behave as if it has a virus , and you will spend enormous amounts of time trying to find a virus and attempting to figure out why the system crashes whenever you try to do anything , most noteable , Microsft Word , and Dragon Naturally Speaking . Very few if any T/S people will be able to find a problem.Be prepared to spend lots of downtime and time problem solving if you put this program on a PC running windows .
 Install at your own risk ... will not unistall , will not work with other software , will not be supported , will not be upgraded . Only customers using light performance of this product will be satisfied . Power users beware ! Fax with anything but this item ... . You have been warned !
 I am not new to computers . I am used to fixing many kinds of software problems in Windows . This is not an easy product to install on a Windows XP system , especially after it has been upgraded to SP2 . If you are expecting to simply install this product , reboot your computer , and start faxing , you will be sorely disappointed . Despite warnings in many other reviews , I purchased v10 .03 for use on my Windows XP system with SP2 . While I was able to eventually get it installed and running , it slowed my computer 's reboot time to a crawl and trashed my scanner software . It took several hours to get most things working again.First off , you should not try to install anything less than version 10.03 on an XP system . Symantec warns you about this on their web site . If you insist on purchasing WinFax Pro - which I do not recommend - make sure you buy version 10.03 . Secondly , WinFax Pro conflicts with the built-in Windows Fax program in Win XP . You will need to uninstall Windows Fax -LRB- which can be done through Control Panel 's Add/Remove programs , but you need to look for it in the Add/Remove Windows Components section -RRB- to get WinFax Pro to function properly.Third , after you install WinFax Pro your computer may take forever to reboot . It looks like it is hung up in this process , but if you go do something else for a while it will eventually reboot . I have not figured out why it does this , but it has definitely slowed my computer reboot time to a crawl.Fourth , if you have a scanner , it may trash your scanner software -LRB- it certainly did mine - HP Scanjet 6300C -RRB- . Symantec 's web site has information about this in their knowledge base for WinFax Pro , so it must happen to many others , too . I did not use their fix , though , as I could not find updated twain.dll and twain_32.dll files that they recommend using to replace the ones they screwed up . Instead , I uninstalled and then reinstalled my scanner 's installation software . I had to run Symantec 's SystemWorks software to find/fix Windows problems and reinstall the scanner drivers a few times before it worked , but eventually I got the scanner working again . WinFax seems to have permanently disabled my scanner 's buttons for doing quick operations , though . I have not found a way to restore button function . But I can scan with the Precision Pro software that is part of HP 's available software downloads on their web site.As far as I can tell , after fixing the above-mentioned problems , WinFax Pro 10.03 does seem to work okay . It does not appear to be any improvement over prior versions of WinFax , so unless you have upgraded to Windows XP you will not likely find it worthwhile to upgrade . As many others have stated before me , this is very buggy software that causes many problems with Windows XP and will be horribly frustrating for anyone trying to install and use this software on an XP system . BUYER BEWARE !
 I ca n't remember ever feeling this frustrated , disappointed ... by a software purchase . Advertised as being greatly improved over previous versions , the only real difference between this version and previous versions is the font.Worse yet , the product is filled with bugs that should have been fixed in earlier versions ; amongst other problems , it is rife with '' . dll '' conflicts , causing even that most ubiquitous application -- MS Word to crash . In addition , several advertised features are just plain lies , including
 Billed as XP-compliant , I got WinFax 10.02 to work with Win XP Pro and Office XP last year , although it was such a headache to set it up it nearly drove me around the bend.THEN I got a new computer , upgraded to Office 2003 , and entered a whole new world of pain . Not only does WinFax 10.02 crash multiple times when installing and registering , it also crashes anytime I attempt to send a fax , crashing Opera , Outlook , and any other Office application I might have up . It is the first program I have ever encountered that even manages to crash the Task Manager , which I thought was impossible . Every re-boot is a new experience in which program or piece of hardware wo n't work.That was before trying to re-establish network faxing from computers that , until now , had done it fine with WinFax 10.02 . Now - somehow - it has screwed up my own computer so much that it crashes other computers on the network whenever they try to send something through the new -LRB- host -RRB- computer.Frustrated beyond belief , I tried to uninstall it , but apparently when it crashed during installation , it did n't create an uninstall file and has no `` uninstall '' function on the CD-ROM . The only way to get this monstrosity off of my computer was to do a system restore for a couple of days ago . That worked , but now I have to reinstall all of the software I have spent the last two days installing and configuring.Don ' t waste your time , money , or sanity on this misleading product .
 Check anywhere for reviews and they are almost always terrible ! You are pushed into this expensive upgrade to run XP , but eventually find out that it does n't work with your programs anyway , such as trying to mailmerge with Act ! or Outlook ! It is full of bugs if you succeed in installing it ! Technical service says they 've never heard of these problems that have been posted on their boards forever . Act ! -LRB- Interstate Commerce -RRB- recommends other software that DOES work like FaxNow and OneManBand . Be very careful , as there are a lot of people out of the faxing business because of this program !
 I bought this ... thing ... . loaded it up . tried to fax a Word document . There is no easy attachment icon , such as in Bitware.Then , when I tried to open a letter using Explorer , it would n't open my program ! It read error in VBE6.dll , whatever the hell that means.So I went thru the maze of the Symantec support department ... they wanted -LSB- $ $ -RSB- per instance for tech support.There are so many warnings and problems with this program , I deleted the damn thing . You are better off buying a fax machine . If you can return this piece of dreck , do it . If you ca n't , return their `` favor '' by writing a review.I am so angry !!!!!!
 WinFax PRO has been discontinued by Symantec . Do not purchase this software unless you are willing to use a discontinued software package .
 This program was very difficult to setup for faxing with Act 2000 . I live in an area that has two area codes for local dialing . This program along with Act 2000 which claims to do an area code overlay does n't work and the instructions -LRB- which are not clearly written -RRB- will confuse you even more . Forget , customer support each company blames the next . Act blames WinFax Pro , WinFax Pro blames Windows and so on and so on and so on . After six months of trial and error , I still have mostly errors . Area code rules , overlay 's etc. do n't work .
 I bought WinFax 10.0 and installed it on my pc only to have it CRASH my microsoft word program . I had to re-load my `` word '' software -LRB- luckily I still had the c/d -RRB- afterwords the WinFax program worked ok and was fairly easy to figure out but my friend wanted to get WinFax for his pc ... . but I told him to buy a new c/d instead of borrowing mine because I figured my c/d must have just had some type of error on it to crash my `` word '' program . My friend went ahead and bought new WinFax software , installed it on his pc and the WinFax software CRASHED HIS ENTIRE SYSTEM , corrupting his hard drive with a message on the screen reading : '' 7220 imminent corruption on hard drive FAILER '' . we tried to remove the WinFax from his pc ... but we had no luck , anytime we would try to open up any program or any files , even internet explorer the pc would just freeze , even typing '' ctrl/alt/delete '' would n't help . The phone support # 's for Winfax are busy all the time and the secondary # 's just ring off the hook . ...
 I got Version 10.03 for Windows ME.It would n't recognize my very popular 56K SupraMax fax/modem , and then it would n't uninstall . It 's another piece of junk from our fine friends at Symantec .
 The new Norton Systemworks Pro 2003 no longer includes Winfax . The previous version does , but it wo n't work with XP . Oh well ...
 I am running Windows XP and I purchased the 10.2 pack , which , after installing , failed to work . Symantec offered no help , despite spending about three hours searching their website and calling . When I called someone finally answered the phone after endless phone menu 's but gave me another number to call . Then , after many more phone menu 's I was connected with another person who was barely audible and who hung up on me . Basically , there is no help from Symantec online , or by phone . -LRB- There is a charge for the phone call , but I never got that far before he hung up , thank goodness . -RRB- The program never worked and even the tech person I use for my business could not get the program running correctly . Unless you enjoy spending hours of wasted time getting no where , I would not recommend buying this product.If given the option , I would have rated this zero stars , because it does not even deserve one . I hope this review saves someone else the expense and frustration I have experienced .
 I have used this program and earlier versions for nearly 10 years . I wish I never had . The later versions of the program have many , many serious bugs regardless of the operating system . The most perplexing thing is that these bugs have been known to Symantec for 5 or more years and they do n't even fix them ! For example , I just lost 100 's of sent fax records from the message store , and there is no way to recover them . This program may be OK for an occasional fax , but business users should never buy this piece of garbage .
 well i thought i had hit payday with this program , but its featurelessits good if u have very limited faxing , AND have a seperate phone line for just your computer , BUT also have cable mode/dsllet me explain why , whenever this program is on , its tieing up your phone line , so u cant use your dial up , so it needs its own phone line , i dont even know how a normal home user could use this programi have cable , so that isnt a problem , but only one phone line , so i got distinctive ring , and even tho winfax pro does have this feature , most computer modems do not , so either way it is not going to workfeatures on this are limited , and it can be a confuing program to deal with at times , and for the ... price tag it makes little sense t get when there are very nice printer/fax combos such as the HP V40SE , which i intend to buy ASAP
 Could not get the software to work , no customer support line and of course no refunds . Tried Winfax 's fax on demand to test software . Finally received the requested fax on the stand alone fax machine purchased THE FOLLOWING WEEK . What a waste !
 Amazon states that 10.0 will work with Windows XP . Version 10.02 is required according to Symantec 's own website .
 This CD is a piece of crap !!!!!!! My operating system -LRB- MS Vista -RRB- reads it as a blank disc . I think this item was misrepresented and I deserve my money back . I will never deal with these people again and would recommend that no one else use them either unless they just want to be taken . Not once did they indicate that this is for `` no operating system . '' If you are looking for a copy of this CD you can find mine at a landfill or better yet , I will probably use it as a $ -LSB- ... -RSB- + soap dish in my bathroom !
 The program is decent in terms of features , but it 's very slow once you get past the initial screen . It seems like the program was designed in the 80 's and updated with duct tape and rubber bands to get the current version.I recently tried to reach the management of the company because it seems they dropped their personal finance product . I wanted to make sure that MyBooks -LRB- and the entire company , for that matter -RRB- will still exist in a year.There is nothing worse than investing time and money into learning a program only to find that it is no longer supported . After almost five days I still have not heard from anyone in Appgen , and that has me a bit worried .
 I totally agree with Elmer P. VanDenburgh 's comment on this product , after buying this product you have to pay for extra cost to get extended phone service . On top of that , the customer service person at California is totally rude .
 Unless you are courageous enough to venture out on your own without any customer support , this is probably NOT the product to buy . In order to get the 2 months of free customer support the product must be registered using the serial number in the box . However , when I tried to register my purchase , I would get an `` Invalid Number '' error when I tried to enter the serial number . After making many telephone calls -LRB- some of which were not toll free -RRB- , I was told I needed a new registration number . After many more phone calls , I was given a phone number to fax a copy of my invoice and the UPC code on the box . This I did . I have not heard a word since . Meanwhile , the time remaining on my `` Two months '' of free customer support is quickly ebbing away .
 Mandrake Linux is , without a doubt , the most user-friendly , and probably least flexible , and most kiddyish , and frankly , somewhat idiotic , distribution of Linux there is.Now , let me say that this is the way to go for a beginner , who is looking for above average security , and a good level of every-day functionality -LRB- as well as a painless installation -RRB- . That aside , I must say it 's a ripoff to buy and not simply download , partially because there is a lack of decent commercial software , and partially because it 's just rather bad as far as programming environments and user-control go . About as bad as Windows in the end.If you choose on going with Linux , and do n't mind a bit of kernel configuration during , or after , the installation , I 'd go with Slackware , RedHat -LRB- though it has a bit more bugs -RRB- , or at least SuSE . That , or get yourself any distribution of UNIX -LRB- they 're all good -RRB- .
 This CD has no redeeming qualities . I sent it back for a refund one hour after I tried it out in my computer . If anybody knows of a Yiddish language course on DVD , please let me know . This is n't it .
 On the box , it says and looks like this product has really good animations , sounds , and pictures . But when you really try it out , it looks like one of those old Windows 95 games . The graphics are bad , and the navigation is horrible.I would recommend that you do not waste your money ...
 -- > Stay away from all products from this company ! < -- would n't install on xp/pro -LRB- product box and Amazon state this works on XP , but website indicates product does n't support this configuration -RRB- - installs on mac os9 , but works poorly -LRB- unreadable dark blue text on black background , sound is either too loud or too soft , fields not editable that should be , etc. -RRB- - even worse , company -LRB- Encore -RRB- would n't honor 30-day money-back guarantee -- after attempting to return product in original box , etc. to Encore , I received a letter back stating I need to return product to place of original purchase -LRB- contrary to product documentation -RRB- , and they did n't return product back to me to even be able to do this ! -LSB- attempts to contact via phone did n't work -- on hold for 30 + min 's -RSB-
 After installing the sound did not work on the computer -LRB- returning to a restore point fixed that -RRB- . Their online support seems to indicate that this is a common problem . We run Windows XP with multiple users . I assume it could n't handle that , at any rate I received many errors in path names when I tried to run it , although it did seem to come up . We are relatively computer astute , and maybe could have gone in and fiddled with things to make it work - but I do n't want to . Its going back.Another down-side for me is that it consists of single CD 's for each level of math , all of which need to be installed separately . Plus it has to be run from CD , not from the hard disk which is a negative for us since we want to make it as easy as possible for our kids to use !
 This uses Macromedia Director software to accomplish it 's animation . . which is all fine and well until you realize they are stuffing you into a tiny box ... with black backgrounds and white text . Do they know nothing about usability?I ca n't get very far into this , but throwing up some text on a small screen and reading it . . . is hardly dynamic.Might help some . . but with my screen resolution at 1024x768 I 'd actually like to use more than 1/4 of my screen to learn.Lame , lame , lame .
 I will not comment on the product-I never received the product . Order confirmed on 3-13-11 . After a few weeks , I was told there would be a delay and asked if I still wanted the product . I said yes at that point even though it was delayed . I was aware that Amazon would cancel the order if it was not fulfilled within a month.Just before that deadline , the supplier confirmed the order so that Amazon would not cancel . I waited another 10 days or so and contacted the supplier-they still could not fulfill the order and on 4-22-11 indicated they would give me a credit on my credit card . What really angered me was that all this time it remained on Amazon as if in stock and available . I guess they were looking for another customer to hose . This entire transaction was just unacceptable . I have ordered many times from Amazon but this was the absolute worst .
 If you have to twist or bend your wrist to use a wrist-saving device , it 's safe to say that the device is useless . This thing stands WAY too high even on the lowest setting . It stands a good 2 inches above your average keyboard on its highest setting . This means you have to bend your arm up then back down to type . I would have to prop my keyboard up somehow . To make matters worse , the gel does not give when you rest your wrist on it.This thing is very cheap but it looks well put together.It 's a lot bigger than the picture portrays . However , that all becomes moot once you actually try to type with it .
 All/any software for your cellphone is available through the website of your cellphone 's manufacturer . If you pay this seller to find the web address for you , you 've made a big mistake .
 It 's unlikely this will matter to most of you , but due to poor technical choices -LRB- or programmer incompetance -RRB- this game requires administrator privileges to run on Windows XP . For anyone concerned about the security and stability of their computer , the last thing you want is your kids running as admin , potentially deleting/changing your files or getting viruses on the machine . I use my PC for work and just ca n't risk losing important files , so this game has already been uninstalled since it wo n't work on the kids ' login .
 I bought this as an advanced level to try and maintain my Spanish and possibly improve it . To do the activities , you have to spend your time trying to remember which one is Asterix , which one is Obelisk , or whatever , and the non-spanish and non-english names of all the other characters . This is more frustrating than it sounds , when it asks you `` de que color fue la camisa de Asterix ? '' I bought this to learn Spanish , not to play memory games about what color they colored in Asterix 's shirt two cartoon panes ago . In other words , the ability to progress is n't based on Spanish knowledge , but trivia of the Asterix cartoon , which is n't even funny or entertaining . Not worth the money .
 I bought this program thinking that it would help me get a basic understanding of vocabulary and putting together sentneces . The first cd is `` ok '' , just gives you a lot of vocab . I went on to cd 2 and it instantly started throwing out full questions in spanish with words I have never heard before . Not sure how this program expected me to be able to answer the questions with them never teaching the filler words ?! I tried all the cd 's looking for the one that taught me the sentence structures , verb conjugations , etc. . Not there ! Worst thing I have ever bought and got very frustrated with it . Definitley a return item !!!
 I have been a fan of Canvas since Canvas 6 . I have upgraded and always installed new versions . With Canvas 8 I still have the same old problems of corrupting the data when saved . Then when you load back up , it 's corrupt . This time the modify , uninstall or just try to reinstall would error out also , leaving me with a program that does n't work . It does have some wonderful easy to use features , when it works . I used to prefer this over Corel 9 , but now I just do n't have the patience to work with its bugs , so its back to Corel 9 . I have had long periods of time when the bugs do n't pop up , so I recommend , buy at your own risk . Sorry Deneba
 In XP , this thing was great . I upgraded to Vista , and now the outputs have an unacceptable pop and crackle . The Line6 forums are all abuzz about this problem , and there is no solution yet . < edit > I heartily apologize . There was no solution at Line6 , but I eventually ran across a fix . Unsurprisingly , Vista is to blame , specifically the power profiles on Vista . The fault lay in the processor power-state transitions . This works ok on Vista on a laptop if you select the `` Always On '' power state . -LRB- Actually , there 's an occasional pop even then ; if you disable power state transitions in your BIOS , I think you can get rid of them . -RRB- My apologies , and I revise my rating to four stars .
 I am receiving a message stating DeltaView 3.0 this product is no longer for sale ... this is a confusing message . Does this mean we are not going to get the product I 've ordered ? - C
 I ordered this item a month or so ago and I still have not gotten it working . I am not inept at installing and configuring software , so I am at a loss why . It is not as if Farstone has been responsive . Have they dropped into a black hole?To begin , I received the CD from Amazon blank . A sealed retail package with a nicely printed CD with zero content . I decided to contact Farstone instead of going through the return/exchange process . I opened two tickets using an unregistered login . I have had no response from Farstone . It has been several weeks.I decided today to download the program from Farstone and use the serial number that came with my blank retail copy . It installed ok as far as I can tell . I can create images and I can assign them to virtual drives . However , the two boxed games I planned on running with the virtual drives are Leisure Suit Larry -LRB- uncut -RRB- and Myst 10th Anniversery edition on DVD.LSL installs well from a virtual drive , yet when I run the game , the copy protection kicks in . Farstone has listed LSL as a recently copiable software . I assumed the download would be up-to-date , but I assumed wrong . Live Update is available but has been down since 10 Feb , which was 17 days ago . So I can not play LSL off a virtual drive.Myst and Riven I have just imaged . Everything appears fine . Unfortunately whenever I try to insert the images onto a virtual drive , I get an error . -LRB- An error with no helpful feedback , just a number . -RRB- Did not the specs report suppot for DVD ? Well in my case , it appears not.I tried to open a new ticket with Farstone , but that service appears down as well . I keep getting linked back to the support page without ever opening a ticket . Now that I have a registered login , I expected to get a better reponse . Nope . Can not even contact them to get that support.In conclusion , every review I read appears to laud this software and its siblings , but I am left hanging . No one is helping me and I am well beyond frustrated . Thus this review . If Farstone can not get their stuff straight for me , I see no reason to give them my support.Hope it helps .
 I have read the previous review and I wanted to add to it . I have been using game drive for well over a year and I have come to love and hate it . It 's great when it works but getting it to work can be really tricky and sometimes just impossible . I have been to Farstone 's website and read through all of thier support documents but they are not very helpful . There are many many game titles that this software claims to support but does not . I also have never had any luck emulating a DVD . It will create the image and play it , but the picture is horrible . I wish I could recommend a better emulation software to people reading this review , but the only other software I know of is Alcohol but it is very tricky to use and has even less support than gamedrive .
 One thing that is not very clear with this software
 Let me first say that this product does everyting it says it does . The down side is that you can expect your computer to freeze up from time to time while the software is activated . The packaging says you need a processor of at least 166Mhz . I have a Pentium 4 , and it is oten using 100 % of its capacity when the Spy PC software is running . There may be someway to adjust the settings to fix this problem , but if there is , it is not very clear how to do this.Keep looking !
 I installed this on two PCs on a network . One 2000 and one XP . MS messenger would bring up the panel . This was installed in stealth mode . The XP machine also revealed itself . I came home from an errand and my girlfriend asked '' what in the he ** do you think you are doing monitoring my stuff , trying to get my passwords ? '' Well it did not even log those and the logs are real hard to read . Uninstalled after one day . Also got me in real hot water . Guess it was my own fault for lack of trust .
 I tried a demo version of this software , hoping to buy it from Amazon after evaluating it . One of the features in it is to be able to hide folders/drives on your pc . I tried it and it deleted permanently the entire folder and I lost my data . Their customer service has not been answering my requests regarding this matter . I am now looking for a reliable data recovery software , but it has cost me a lot of time , energy as well as given a lot of frustration . I hope Amazon notes this and cautions its customers before purchase , otherwise the so-loyal Amazon customers will feel cheated .
 ... but LiveMotion is not the god send . Even as a loyal Adobe user , I can not recommend this tool . Let me start with its benefits first , and then I 'll end with its problems.Two major/revolutionary benefits
 Livemotion was created from the ImageStyler product of Adobe . I am Imagestyler user and was impressed by its functionality and ease of use . Imagestyler 1.0 is a great product especially for web designers who would like pixel-point accuracy and flexible layouting tool.But it has some limitations though which I expected to have been addressed into Livemotion . Instead Adobe put animation features into Livemotion to rival that of Flash.When I evaluated Livemotion , these are what I found out
 I installed the AbleSoft Teacher 's Toolbox and while familiarizing myself with the menus and instructions , a colleague stopped me to recommend a different program he 'd `` test driven '' already and liked.Fine , I had no stake in the AbleSoft `` Teacher 's Toolbox '' program yet , so I decided to remove the program from my computer before getting too deeply into it and to have a look at my cohort 's suggested program first.Well , damn ! These AbleSoft people are clever devils ... or maybe they 're sinister bastards , who knows ? Hard to guess about these things these days.Turns out that there 's no UNINSTALL file in their program . You 're stuck with removing the damn thing bit by bit , byte by byte , file by file ... and still there are hidden and residual traces of the program that wo n't go away . That 's pretty irritating.In short , I do n't like people who write and market incomplete , inefficient , ineffective or `` system capture '' programs . These are either `` bad boys '' or fools . So even if this AbleSoft program has some useful functions , I would n't reward these scoundrels by buying their products . That 's my opinion . You 're free to form your own , of course . Good luck .
 This program takes several steps to do something that should only take one . It 's cumbersome and illogical . eClass Grades is much easier to use .
 Do not waste your money . The program is not user friendly and does not offer anything I ca n't find on any other program .
 My name is Christian Taboada , I 'm giving my name to make you know the truth about this product and for you to know that i do n't belong to emedia.First of all.I may sound like a crazy man . But let me tell you that i 've already tried the `` Piano Method '' both basic and intermediate from e-media . I bought this software because of rating , thinking this coud be a similar method . I could n't have been so wrong . I will make an effort to donwgrade it 's actual score with one star because it 's a big insult that this product have 5 stars instead Piano Method . For you out there , that like me are trying to learn ... this is a so plain game ... i will put all the facts down.1-Only has 5 modes of playing . Notes , Scales , Intervals , Key signatures , and the lame piano head challenge that is a recopilation of all previous excercises mixed together and leave your record on the internet . The idea is cool , but you will never play piano with this ! 2-You never play ANY theme like beethoven , mozart , not even gingle bells . Only notes , scales , intervals , key signatures . That 's all !! 3-No videos , no voices , no instuctors , no lessons .4 - Paying 20 $ it 's an outrage.5-the cd only has 8 MEGABYTES OF INFO !! you 're paying that much for only 8 megabytes !! 6-I got bored after two hours trying all the stuff . I lost 20 $ and my precious time.7-more simple than pacman . if you know about games.Now let me compare this to piano method form emedia.1-It has real instructor with voices and videos ! 2-Maaaaaaaaaany modes even ear training !! More than 300 hundred lessons !! not 4 !!!! 3-Learn to play REAL MUSIC !! from beethoven , elton john , billy joel ! 4-the cd has 650 MEGABYES of videos , voice teaching , etc !!! about 80 times more than piano head !!! 5-pay 50 $ for emedia let me tell you , you wo n't regret it . i purchased the `` deluxe '' method that has the `` basic '' and the `` intermediate '' . -LRB- more than 450 lessons -RRB- r get bored.6-This course TEACHES you , fingering , technique , position everything you need to know !!! 7-you will need MONTHS to complete al the courses . you wil NEVER EVER get bored.8-IT HAS ALL . PERIOD.Thanks for hearing . Buy piano method , and be like me that i 'm getting better day after day . I regret buying piano head . Do n't even worth a nickel .
 This was the worst law program ever ! In fact , this is probably the worst program ever made . `` Cosmi '' programs are usually the worst made programs anyway . If I had known that this `` Perfect Attorney Premium '' program was by this company , I would have assumed that it was well below program standards . Do not buy !
 I tried Companionlink for syncing Lotus Notes to Google . In spite of trying different configuration settings , I ca n't get it to recognize events that reoccur on an irregular basis -LRB- ie . every other day or events that occur only on Mondays and Fridays -RRB- nor the deletion of certain events .
 I do n't often review products , but this is a disaster.If you want to spend many nights trying to get this to work correctly to no avail , then this is for you.Thank heavens I backed up my Outlook data . This not only did n't work but scrambled my Outlook contacts.Product support is a joke.Too bad . They have a great product idea but horrible software.A product that runs circles around this is VCOrganizer Pro .
 I second the other reviewer 's opinion . I bought this before seeing that review . The graphics are weak and outdated , and where I had expected a library of images I could just copy and paste , you have to go through their software to insert images into documents that you produce using Cosmi 's software . If the images were high res or visually compelling , I might be willing to fool with it , but they 're not . The stock photos that come with MS Office -LRB- I do n't know if they 're available in all versions -RRB- are far superior , even if the selection is modest . Better to have one great photo than many low res uncompelling images .
 The software works fine , but it was far from clear in the description of the product on-line that it was NOT compatible with the TRIAL VERSION of Microsoft Office that comes with all the new Macs , and which sends the user online to buy an `` upgrade . '' One needs to buy a full NEW verison , NOT an upgrade , which I would have been glad to do if that had been clear from the start . Unfortunately , I hade to uninstall the `` upgrade ; '' return it for a refund ; and order and install the full version before I could get Office 2004 working . A lot of trouble that Microfost could have saved me by being more forthright in their product descriptiopn .
 I 've been using Office 2004 for a couple of days now , and so far I 've been underwhelmed . Everything feels significantly more sluggish than in Office X , especially Word . Entourage also crashes when I try to open 50 % of my HTML-formatted mail . Aside from being able to save longer file names , and the new columns view of Entourage , I hve n't found anything that compelling about this upgrade .
 The Project Manager is a nice feature , but 2004 is full of bugs and problems . Some examples
 I have been a mac user for 10 years , and am disappointed with the installation problems office 2004 has presented . Excel , Word , Power Point , all fail to open . I have a G4 mac running a freshly installed 10.3 OS X system with plenty of RAM . Both forms of Office 2004 installation -LRB- drag and drop and the auto install feature -RRB- have proven ineffective in resolving the issue . It looks like more time on the phone with tech support to resolve this one . Hopefully , they wo n't want to charge me for calling to figure out why a basic installation of their program has glitched . I will find out on Monday when they open after their early evening closing hours -LRB- 3pm -RRB- !
 If you use a Palm Tungsten T or E , and other PDA 's , the Entourage conduit is not compatible and will not allow you to sych your handheld with Entourage . This is a serious flaw if you use Entourage as your primary address , emal , calendar and to do list application . Microsoft is completely aware of this and offers no excuse . They simply state that the Entourage conduit will not work and they have no solution for it.In Office X the Entourage conduit worked flawlessly .
 -- Updated Review -- March 2010 : This CD-Rom will load on any computer , but the subscription service is no longer available.PayTrust is still around , and basically offers all these entry level services for free on their web site -LRB- no software necessary -RRB- . This makes the software basically useless . I believe the web site is too expensive , though , for what many banks offer for free .
 I have been with them since they were PayMyBills , but the software -LRB- actually , it 's their website -RRB- has become so filled with bugs that I am beginning to find it unusable.And the new owner -LRB- Intuit -RRB- does n't seem very interested in fixing them , although each `` enhancement '' introduces new ones.So I am now searching for a replacement . I would hate to go back to paper , but I just might do that .
 Why do you need software to pay bills ? Most major banks , and 3rd parties , like MSN and Yahoo offer web-based bill pay services . I did buy this when it first came out , and quickly dumped it due to finding out later I could do more by hooking MS Money directly to a bill pay service .
 This is not the fully functional version of Autocad . It is for the student version . It will not allow you to print without a watermark . It also requires that you have a valid school email to us to register the software . There is also a time limitation on the software . Complete ripoff . I would not have bought it had I known this .
 The current version of Office2004 is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH TIGER !!! Microsoft Word will crash on you , and to a crippling degree . Do not buy this if you have a Mac , since you 'll eventually upgrade to Tiger and Microsoft may or may not care enough to fix it . If you 've got some sort of Microsoft addiction and intend to buy it anyway , you could always see if they 've released a patch for it . Do n't just take my word for it , check out the discussions all over the net by searching `` word crash in tiger '' . There 's always NeoOfficeJ ...
 This item is not the actual software . It 's an UPGRADE . That means you have to have the actual software to use this . Unfortunately I did not have the actual software , therefore I can not use this product .
 As a user of v.X , I was looking forward to this . Well , as muchas anyone looks forward to new MS software . Maybe a root canal wouldbe more fun.I just do n't see it . They want me to cough up $ 350 for a some really minorfeature additions ? Even on the MS webpage , they have a hard time findingmore than 1-2 bullet ` enhancements ' for each component . And I 'd haveto believe that NoteTaker or NoteBook is a better application than whateverMS 's v1 of their Notebook facility is . And do n't forget the all important Messengerintegration : -LRB- Very disappointed .
 Microsoft Office for -LRB- or more importantly , Microsoft Word -RRB- for Mac -LRB- any Mac -RRB- crashes relentlessly and without mercy . I tried sending it back -LRB- on the day of purchase , get the picture ? -RRB- but I was turned away , having already opened the boxes and the inside sleeves.Run , do n't walk , away from this product . Get yourself a PC computer , and get Microsoft products , for that.Good luck : -RRB-
 My needs for are not complex enough to require the latest 2011 version of Microsoft Office , so I decided to buy this software to save some money.I was very surprised when I learned that this 2004 can not be used on post-2009 Macs . I found this out when I went to the Genius Bar at Apple and was informed of this fact.I have a 2011 MacBook Pro and if I want to get Microsoft Office , I would have to get the 2011 version . The page for this software is misleading in that it does not clarify this crucial exemption to people who are considering buying it .
 This software is incompatible with the OSX Lion operating system . Spoke with Apple and found that the 2004 program is no longer supported . You will get a message
 I sure did n't do my homework on this one . This is a 2001 product . Only Word loaded correctly . Excel would n't open at all , and Powerpoint opened , but would n't work , and would n't close . I had to force a shutdown to close the program . I called Microsoft 's helpline and they said not only is n't this product supported anymore , but that it would no longer work properly on Macs .
 It only became clear to me how MS undermines Mac by using its software as weapon when I began using MS office for Mac . I have used Window 's based Excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and I can not figure out how to use the Mac version efficiently . It seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago . If you want to work on PowerPoint docs at home created on your PC at work you will find the effort not worth it ... the docs will never transfer formatting properly . I bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the PC version . Having said that , there is no alternative to MS office ; this is the outcome of MS having monopoly power ... no support and an inferior product for Mac users
 So now you have a Mac and face the inevitable MS question-Do I need a Mac version of Microsoft Office?The issue is made more difficult in that unlike for other versions of Microsoft Office , there is no free trial version of MS Office for Mac.Since I am reviewing this office suite , you should assume I bought this product . It has Word , Excel and PowerPoint that look and feel just like the PC versions . It does not have Outlook , but offers a program called Entourage which manages mail effectively and even has a rather clunky project management component incorporated in it . If you use Hotmail as your primary email program , entourage will seem a necessity since Microsoft has kept third party mail management programs away from Hotmail . This includes Safari which does not work that well with Hotmail -LRB- although Firefox does just fine in web based Hotmail -RRB- . There is an alternativeApple iWork ' 08 . iWork '08 reads and writes to Word , Excel and PowerPoint . It has a free trial -LRB- 60 days -RRB- and is much much cheaper , user friendly , and jazzier . As an added bonus , it uses much less real estate on your hard drive . It does not solve the Hotmail problem , but you can by migrating your webmail to gmail , yahoo , or lots of others which the standard Mail program on your Mac supports.So here is the question , why do you want a Mac office suite that essentially offers no improvement over the PC program other than a mail manager ?
 I was able to install most of MS office but am having printer conpatability problems . I was n't able to install Vitural Pc properly and get error messages when i boot up . I 'm going to have to the Mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out . All in all I think that every thing will work OK but I 'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed . Maybe it 's best to stick with Mac software for Macs . I 've NEVER has a problem installing them .
 I purchased the upgrade since I 'd already bought both Office v.X and Virtual PC 6.1 last year.The biggest letdown is that Microsoft 's promised support for the G5 is nearly non-existent . I have a dual processor G5 with an ATI Radeon 9800 card -LRB- Apple -RRB- , and after trying to install Virtual PC 7 three times , I can not get a VM to work . It did install -LRB- and work -RRB- flawlessly on my G4 Powerbook . Googling for reviews finds it 's very hit or miss , but if -LRB- when -RRB- it misses , you 'll regret investing the extra $ $ $ in an immature product .
 This product arrived with 2 number 2 installation disks for the Virtual PC and no number 1 . As a result , I was not able to install VPC , which was one of the reasons I purchased this overly expensive product . The Office part does not seem that signicant an upgrade to the Office X that I had . So it is both an aggravation and a rip off .
 It does n't give you any kind of instructions on how to do anything . All you get is a cd and that 's it . So it is disappointing . . It would be nice if they gave you step by step instructions on how to make at least one so you get an idea of what your suppose to do .
 This software is only so-so . I really feel you could create a better design using graph paper and colored pencils.The good points : It has the most commonly used stitchesYou can create new stitch patternsColor palette offers a broad range of colorsYou can upload an existing imageThe bad points : Pre-cut shapes like the star , circle , and heart are not available and ca n't be createdSoftware creates white stitches on the background of uploaded imageSoftware has a hard time creating cut lines on an uploaded image
 After seeing the previews for this movie , I was looking forward to seeing family life with the female characters and their children . The children decide to seek out their father and the storyline looked promising . What it turned into was a sleazy affair between Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo -- betrayal , hurt and lost relationships -- too much of that already . Hollywood writers are stale and use sex because they have no imaginations . Zero stars -- viewer beware .
 Excellent cast . Spotty script . Viewer must be prepared for inclusion of porn . I thought the way porn was introduced was too direct and detracted from the storyline . However , I may just be a fuddy-duddy . Anyway , it became apparent at story 's end that `` The kids were not all right '' .
 I rented after all the `` picture of the year '' hype I heard about this movie . My opinion is that I must be too socially conservative to feel uncomfortable by some of the scenes in this movie . Just a warning to others who may feel like I did , the gratuitous gay porn movie -LRB- 3 scenes with it , over done even for those it did n't bother -RRB- and the F bomb being dropped almost as much as in Scarface ruined an otherwise well acted movie about a very non-traditional family just truing to live their lives in a so called normal world . -LRB- Do all lesbians swear this much ?? -RRB- I think the casting and the acting were perfect for the movie . The scene where Ann Benning is sitting around the dinner table with all the `` family '' and the film is slow motion to show her emotions at that time is acting perfection . You can feel her emotions like they were happening to her.I hate how movies these days feel the need to get the R rating to draw audiences when in fact the story could have stood by itself . I would n't call this a comedy as it is billed . I think of this as a complex family drama with a few dry humorous moments . Not a comedy . I 'd have given this 3 stars instead of the 2 I did if it was n't for the Howard Stern shock value of a handful of scenes and unnecessary language . IMHO , not up to the hype .
 This is the most boring and pathetic movie I have seen in years . Like most mainstream `` lez '' movies the straight actresses are reluctant to touch or kiss . OF course in maintream cinema every lesbian is unhappy and maladjusted . A serial killer or just waiting for some man to turn her around . An absolute waste of money and time . I threw it in the garbage .
 Do n't bother with this movie if you think it 's a movie that does justice to same-sex couples . First this movie insults lesbians by insisting that they really want men and what men have to offer anatomacally . The only way that Nic and Jules can have sex with one another is by watching gay male porn . I wonder how many lesbians the writers bothered to poll to come up with that nonsense . After Nic and Jules ' children decide to track down the sperm doner who spawned them , in typical straight person fashion , no lesbian would be a lesbian if only she had the right man to show her ... blah ... blah ... blah . Because we all know that a bored lesbian is going to jump the bones of any man who has a conversation with her . Right ? Yeah , because that happens all the time . In further ridiculousness , they end the movie by insisting that Nic should n't toss Jules ' back side to the curb because they 're too old to find anyone else . So , it ends happily ever after.Give me an F-ing break !
 Given the great reviews and honors I expected something special . But there was n't a moment I was n't aware of a script being acted out , actors being minutely directed -LRB- not one actor at any time looked relaxed or spontaneous -RRB- , and some sort of social agenda going on , though for the life of me I still ca n't figure what that agenda was . I found the father being cast out as the Devil and the mother who strayed being all sunshine , light and goodness treated as an angel at the end illogical and a false note . But , then , the whole film kept striking false notes for me . I guess one problem is I 've known so many gay people with kids and in my experience nothing unusual or conflicting goes on in their lives that does n't go on in anyone 's lives . And none of their lives would make a movie , that 's for sure.Adrift in the Heartland
 I get that it is difficult to raise a child in a same sex inviroment . What I do n't get from this is that it seems as if the message is that `` evil heterosexual sperm donor dad is evil '' . Seriously , wtf ? They cast the guy as a `` male slut '' or something because he is having consensual sex with a black woman ... `` he 's a slut but at least he is not rascist ??? '' Most retarded premise ever ... . ever ! Then a biological child finds out that they are his donation -LRB- world 's worst sperm bank ever -RRB- and the guy steps up as a dad -LRB- like super fast -RRB- . But I do n't want to ruin the rest of this sexist movie ... . oh wait , I do ! So dad -LRB- who happens to be a seriously awesome guy -RRB- finds out that he is a dad and he falls into love/emotion with one of the `` mothers '' and has nom noms with her . Well let me tell you the moral that I got from this . If you are a somewhat decent guy who is kinda of successful and you find out that you have kids that looked you up because of a sperm bank that -LRB- sereiously needs to be sued -RRB- let them know and then you go out of your way to be a great person to them but it causes problems in a relationship between a gay couple -LRB- it is the premise , so back off haters -RRB- and fall in love with one of the -LCB- mom 's -RRB- , said so called `` father '' is a horrible person who should be thrown away and ignored . Honestly , the most sexist movie I have EVER seen .
 SPOILERS!Bening and Moore play crunchy granola let 's - talk-about-all-of-our-feelings-ad nauseum lesbians who are discomforted by their children 's desire to meet their biological father . The kids grow to like the new man in their life as does Moore 's character , who has a tryst with him . Yap Yap Yap Blah Blah Blah ... the cheating woman -- after suitable hand-wringing and teariness -- is brought back into the family fold after her infidelity is discovered -LRB- if only he 'd cleaned the damned bathtub ! -RRB- while biological dad is kicked to the curb . Hell , Moore 's character does n't even come to the door to address Ruffalo 's attempt at apology but instead leaves him to weather Bening 's uptight , self-righteous , and controlling bitchiness alone . -LRB- So thoughtful . -RRB- Then the family unit treks off to take daughter to college . Ah , new beginnings . Heavy-handed symbolism -LRB- Ruffalo 's plaintive staring at his son through the window -RRB- , gender reversal -LRB- gay male porn to stimulate female sex drive -RRB- , and new age California stereotypes are also problematic . How are these two women even likable ? Consider the scene in which guilt-ridden Moore fires her Mexican laborer because she 's an adulterer . Or the moment when Bening yells at Ruffalo and daughter because Bening is projecting her paranoia on the two when seeing them on a motorcycle . Or think about the scene in which the two women argue in front of their restaurant dinner companions and then abandon them at the table . The kids might be all right , but I 'm not sure I 'd rate the movie even that highly .
 Mark Ruffalo -LRB- and the kids -RRB- were the saving graces of this pretentious , boring film . I am one of the few people I know who did not appreciate two of the most famously-straight women in Hollywood playing gay mothers . Annette Bening -LRB- dumbed-down wife of Warren Beatty -RRB- chewed the scenery so voraciously , I wanted to throw up . I do n't believe that an irritating character should also irritate the audience so drastically . She looked like she was sucking lemons the whole time . I think that is what she believes lesbians are like . Why did n't the casting people get real lesbians to play the parts , like Kathy Bates and Jodi Foster , or Ellen DeGeneris and her real-life partner , Portia deRossi ? The comment is made early in the film that the reason some lesbians like to watch male porn is that most lesbian porn is portrayed by straight women . This film makes the same mistake . I felt no credibility whatsoever in the gay-ness of Bening and Moore , though Moore was a bit more natural-seeming . And why was Mark Ruffalo shunned at the end by the whole family ? I thought he was the least neurotic , most normal person in the movie , and he had a great influence on the kids . The whole affair thing was seemingly blamed on him and the kids were not encouraged to forgive and forget . After all , he begged to be part of their lives because he really liked them . Strange . The whole thing was a squeamish bore and we almost walked out . I would like to see more films with real lesbians about real lesbian situations . `` Universal family '' my butt . This was just the same-old Hollywood Real Family farce
 Take what I 'm about to write with a grain of salt , because my friends and I shut it off with 45 minutes left to play.Nic - I did n't buy her `` alcoholism '' one bit . I have known alcoholics . she was not one , nor did she portray one to any extent that would make it any problem ! Her reactions to the things happening around her are perfectly justified , especially the whole motorcycle incident.Jules - Do I really even need to comment on this one ? I think the thing that pissed me off most about her was n't her cheating on her partner of 10 years , it was her being mad at her partner for taking a call from a pregnant patient while she was supposed to be in a bath . really Jules ? upset because your doctor girlfriend is fulfilling her hippocratic oath ? you 're a tool . And the fact that this character does n't support Nic when she 's trying to maintain being an actual PARENT to the kids is disgusting.Paul - You 're falling in love with Jules why ? perhaps the screenwriter can write a more convincing reason why two people would fall in love , other than being around each other for more than a couple weeks . Could Mark Ruffalo please also take acting lessons to try and develop a different character than the oaf-ish ca n't express himself type of dufus dude ? please ? I ca n't take seeing him act the same character in every movie!Joni - the only likeable character.Laser - wow . what a badly acted stereotypical 15 year old . come on ! He finds no real purpose in the movie , or any driving character development , other than realizing his best buddy is a jerk.Tanya - Sorry honey . I ca n't get past the fact you were in America 's Next Top Model . All I see is you posing in the last ep of that ANTM season on a rock telling the camera that you 're imagining poetry and beautiful things . lol.And overall , the one thing I hate most about this movie is all the blame being pushed onto Paul . It 's what I call the Jerry Springer effect , where the blame gets placed on the `` interloper '' , instead of on the people who made a commitment to each other . I hate that . I do n't like most of the characters in this movie . I have zero empathy for them . No need to watch this . You will find neither truth , nor knowledge in this movie ...
 I really wanted to like this film but when one of the `` Lesbian '' Woman starts an affair with a `` Straight '' male , they lost me . Being Gay is n't something you can change or turnoff like the Julianne Moore character.Since a Lesbian Woman wrote this film , you would expect that she would n't take the easy way out and go with the cliched plot point . If you can get past this , you may like the movie.How is it that it turns out to be the Mans fault at the end ? They tell him to get out of their life but they are the ones who sought him out . It takes two to tango and the Woman was just as much responsible.What does she get ? One night on the couch.Good performances for sure but the script really needed some work .
 In terms of acting , it 's a great film . Each character is fleshed out to the point where they seem like real people . The problem with slice of life pictures like this , is they often do n't offer a reason to watch . It 's so much like life that is boring . Nothing ever happens . I do n't mean that there needs to be explosions , or car chases or death . But beyond a few arguments , there is nothing here to make someone feel like the story should have ever been told , if there were a story at all.Conflict sure.Climax ... sorta ... Resolution ... not really.Just , a few bickers , a flighty affair , and then , nothing.Nothing is changed , solved or resolved.Again , actors are great , the story is not .
 -LRB- might be a spoiler if you know nothing about the movie - then do n't read ! -RRB- First I have to say all of the actors turned in top notch performances inspired by a worthy director . These all are characters one comes to care about , in spite of their flaws.Now the disappointment - what happens between Paul & Jules simply was not believable - lesbian women certainly are capable of cheating but not likely with a straight man . And Jules is too old to not be sure about her identity - she says several times she 's gay , not bi.Even if I allowed for the possibility Jules might be drawn to Paul , the reaction of all the characters toward Paul was nothing but mean-spirited . I was n't looking for a fairy tale , but if Jules deserved forgiveness - which she did , as her partner was a bit much to take at times , then Paul also deserved forgiveness , especially from his children.The problem ? This movie was n't sure if it wanted to be a comedy or a melodrama . I am glad I saw it , though I wished I 'd turned it off about 20 minutes before the ending.The best scenes were with all of them together , just being an unconventional family who actually liked each other . Why could n't the author have seen that was a much more interesting and important message than yet another movie dealing with couples ' cheating?One more great scene that made the movie worth seeing
 ~ **** spoiler alert **** So let me get this straight ... We have a neurotic , dysfunctional yuppie family where the parents happen to be a lesbian couple . Their daughter seeks out the sperm donor who is her biological father . Paul , played by an excellent Mark Ruffalo , is a flawed , never-been-married forty-something guy , but he is a warm , genuine , caring person . They draw him into their life and involve him in their family . He develops relationships with both of the children.Julianne Moore comes on to him , they have an affair , they get found out , the family is shattered . Moore and her partner , played by Annette Bening , manage to reconcile , but everyone hates Paul , who is left a broken man . Then , Moore and Bening and their son get in their $ 60K SUV , hold hands , and head back to their entitled , self-absorbed life , leaving behind a daughter who seems blithely able to just ... move on.The performances by Mark Ruffalo and Mia Wasikowska -LRB- as daughter Joni -RRB- were excellent . It was 60 % of a decent movie with stupefyingly ham-handed conclusion , an ending that sent a chill up my spine for its sheer callousness .
 Maybe heterosexual people like this movie ? I 'm unsure , but being a true lesbian myself in a committed relationship I saw this film over dinner with my other and our straight girl-friends ; we were all horrified at how the plot twisted and turned . The stereotypes that were played out and the fact that the main character sleeps with a man - or no reason really was ridiculous . -LRB- Not realistic what-so-ever to real life -RRB- . We all were a bit upset we spent any amount of money to watch this movie . I do love the actress Moore , but she wasted her talent here .
 I guess the problem I had with The Kids Are All Right was lack of focus and character development -LRB- although the performances were top notch ! -RRB- . It starts off being about the kids and their need to know who their biological father is , and then it turns into a `` soap opera-like '' affair between the donor and one of the lesbian moms . Frankly , I found the squabbling between the lesbians to be a tired , cliche-driven , melodramatic plotline . What was the point of it all ? That a member of a gay marriage can feel just as under-appreciated as a member of a straight marriage ? Wow . I paid 10 bucks to find that out . Really big deal . I was much more interested to discover more about the kids . -LRB- After all that was the title of the film . -RRB- I wanted to see more interaction between them and their biological dad . I wanted to find out how their biological dad affected their lives -- especially the boy who lacked a father figure and was the one who initially wanted to find out who the donor was . You can tell this boy , Laser , lacked self-confidence . He let his `` best friend '' Clay bully him around . You can also tell that the biological dad , Paul , was probably bullied around too when he was Laser 's age . That could 've been the reason why he did n't like team sports . Laser and Paul could 've had a much more meaningful connection in the story . But instead we were stuck with this lesbian soap opera jamboree . It did n't seem like the writer knew what she wanted to do with this story . It was going off in too many directions and subsequently lost its focus . So the kids lost respect for their biological dad because he had an affair with one of their moms . That was the whole point of having the kids in the story ??? I give it a C.
 I do n't know how on earth there 's been so much hype about this film . I guess it 's because of the big name actors.The relationship between the two women was not at all believable . There is no love between them . There is no sex between them -LRB- one scene shows a fully clothed failed attempt , that 's all -RRB- . They seem to be two strangers . And then one of them turns out to not be gay.There are three gratuitous , full-on naked thrusting mixed-gender sex scenes - between a woman who says she 's a lesbian and a very hairy man . It makes absolutely no sense at all . There was n't even a build up between them . The director just put them together . And outside of the director 's bubble world of LA , this reinforces a horrible stereotype . And people , it means the character is not gay . I know that labels are n't really important and sexuality can be fluid , but it 's the character in the film who calls herself a lesbian . A woman who has sex with a man like that is not gay . That 's just plain ridiculous.There 's another half-the-movie-long extremely gratuitous mixed-gender sex scene between the sperm donor and another lady . Was this film about a lesbian couple with kids ? Nope.I 'm not sure what 's wrong in Lisa Cholodenko 's life that inspired her to make such a horrible film . It is a pity because a story about this type of family could have been interesting . I know that Lisa is together with a woman and they have a child . So it begs the question , is she self-hating ? She quite obviously hates lesbians . I can only guess that she 's actually straight and trying to turn lesbians straight . Great , the world needs more of that , really .
 Very disappointing movie . Actually , the movie really sucked . Did anyone in production/creation of this movie ever meet a lesbian couple ???? Apparently not ... First , what 's up with the flower-child dialogue ? No one really talks like that ; in California or anywhere else . Right on ?? I guess someone was trying to follow a stereotype of granola , crunchy , non-confrontational lesbians ... ? I did n't see any Birkenstocks though ... hmmm ... the rest of the dialogue was meaningless fluff ... it was impossible to care about any of the characters since they were so poorly created . And since when do lesbians watch gay male porn ?? Are you kidding me ??? And of course , one of them HAS to have sex with a man ... Do n't waste your time .
 Another dismal offering in the long line of crummy movie portrayals of lesbians -LRB- by straight actresses , of course -RRB- . Just because someone can act does it mean it 's a good movie ? The plot `` twist '' is incredibly lame and unbelievable , and other than Joni the characters are n't likable . Seems like the director threw in a bunch of gratuitous sex and drug scenes just to get an R rating ...
 If you want to watch two lesbian moms with little affection for each other fight over a two dimensional sperm donor their kids discover and can handle poor editing , you 'll love this movie .
 The acting was good , the idea had potential , but the story was n't particularly compelling . It 's interesting to tell a store about marriage and recovery in the setting of an old lesbian couple . But , I just did n't believe it . Neither of the choices the female leads take are particularly believable . It broken my disbelieve and ruined the movie for me .
 This started out as a warm , funny film about an unconventional family . Annette Bening and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules , the two Moms . They have raised a daughter , Joni -LRB- after Joni Mitchell -RRB- and a son , Laser -LRB- after the sailing dinghy ? -RRB- whom they each conceived with sperm from the same donor , making the kids biological half-siblings . Joni is eighteen and college-bound . Laser is fifteen , and getting into trouble with his troubled friend Clay , who uses the word `` faggot '' too much , mildly physically abuses him , and knows no boundaries -LRB- in one scene he appropriates Nic and Jules ' battery-operated boyfriend -RRB- . Out of curiosity -LRB- and in Laser 's case in need of an older male role model -RRB- the kids seek out their biological father Paul -LRB- Mark Ruffalo -RRB- . The unattached Paul is a bit of a free spirit who owns an organic restaurant . Although he is at first bemused by the fact of having children , he is soon an enthusiastic participant in Laser 's and Joni 's lives.Nic reacts badly . She is the breadwinner , the disciplinarian , and a bit of a control freak who immediately objects to Paul . When nobody pays her any mind , she becomes ill-tempered and begins drinking heavily.Jules is the stay-at-home partner , more passive and more pliant . As Nic withdraws and becomes ever more disagreeable , Jules seduces Paul.For his part , Paul is thrilled to be part of the family , and begins to build castles in the air around his relationship with Jules and the children.Up until this point -LRB- about 5/6ths of the movie -RRB- this is a good-natured story of an atypical family facing a complex relationship issue . The last sixth of the movie melts down to slag , costing it at least three stars , because THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT suddenly transforms into a hideous anti-male , gay-bashing diatribe.The affair comes out . Although Jules instigated it and admits to doing so , Paul is utterly demonized . She is not . Jules breaks off the affair -LRB- `` I 'm gay . Damn you . '' -RRB- , and Nic calls him a `` F ***** g interloper . '' The kids -LRB- particularly Laser -RRB- reject him outright . `` I thought you 'd be better , '' Joni sneers.It was at about this point that I seriously considered shattering this DVD with a hammer . The utter callousness and cruelty of Joni , Laser , Nic and Jules toward Paul is truly nauseating . Not one of these self-absorbed Hollywood standard-issue Yuppie characters ever considers for a single moment that it is THEY who have brought Paul into their lives . Neither Nic nor Jules has the depth or honesty to understand that they have both manipulated and used Paul to work out underlying and long-standing issues in their own relationship . The dour Laser , in rejecting this caring male figure , probably dooms himself to forming attachments with troublesome and abusive males like Clay who will dominate him for years to come . Joni escapes the nest . The `` happy ending '' of this vindictive film consists of Nic and Jules rebonding . Paul has vanished , broken.This film was obviously written by a male-bashing , self-hating woman who chooses to portray all lesbians as stereotypically dysfunctional man-haters and all men as garbage.The film 's homophobia is manifest in that the women are controlling , manipulative , dishonest , insensitive and abusing without a scintilla of self-awareness . In retrospect , this movie 's unbending hatred of men is evident at the outset -LRB- what parent names their son `` Laser '' ? -RRB- . Male behavior is seen as destructive and irresponsible and weak -LRB- Paul , the `` sperm donor , '' has no family ; Clay urinates on a dog 's head at one point ; Jules fires the gardener , the only eyewitness to her infidelity , for no real reason at all in some twisted act of expiation and he slinks off without a single word -RRB- . In short , this `` warm family comedy-drama '' turns into a jeremiad against those of us who are so-called cursed with testosterone . Frankly , for me it 's a blessing . I 'd rather be Paul than be any of the four vicious losers in this film.This vile film was a big hit at Sundance , a Golden Globe winner , and an Academy Award nominee , I have to believe largely because of its oh-so Politically Correct portrayal of a married gay family . I will credit Bening , Moore Ruffalo and the kids with some splendid acting . Ruffalo in particular , deserves a combat medal for surviving this role psychologically intact . Obviously , the critics chose to overlook the unrelieved darkness and negativity that drips like poison from this film.Once again , cruelty passes for entertainment in the 2010s . Forget it .
 Okay , yes , the acting on everyone 's part was great . And yes , it showed -- surprise , surprise ! -- that lesbians are like everyone else . But why does all the hype about this movie , including the money shot featured in all the ads , give the impression it 's warm and open-hearted ? The Mark Ruffalo character , whose only crime was to donate sperm that these two women used to create a family that they love , is contacted by the kids -LRB- he is not the one who reached out -RRB- , hit on by the Julianne Moore character -LRB- he is not the one who kissed first -RRB- , steers his son in the right direction with respet to a destructive friend , and even dumps his gorgeous girlfriend because he 's starting to get feelings of wanting to be in a family , and at the end of all that he has the door slammed in his face and is told he 's an interloper . The final shot of him shows him looking longingly through the living room window at his son , while his son turns his back on him . And we 're also supposed to , what , laugh ? , at the fact that the Latino gardener gets fired simply because the Julianne Moore character feels guilty that she slept with a man.This film was made by a lesbian who is married and has a child via sperm donation . Fine , it 's her film she can do what she wants . But it 's kind of sad that the warm humanity in evidence does not extend to any adult male character in the film . It resulted in a movie that did not `` feel good , '' IMHO -LRB- and FYI , I am a woman -RRB- .
 The actors are great , but what 's up with the writer-director ? Is she trying to say `` I do n't really want to be mean , but ... '' -LRB- a -RRB- I ca n't help it , I 'm an American . -LRB- I loved the review that explained how the French would have handled the plot 's conflict ! -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- Hollywood makes me do it . -LRB- c -RRB- The movie-going public makes me do it.Anyway , the film as much as says it 's intended to be conventional , so it must have a moral , right ? Let 's see , that would be `` Sex is bad for you -- no matter what your gender , orientation , or state of confusion -- because you might become a mature , warm , happy person and it has no place in marriage . Oh , and you might have orgasm . `` One good thing about public art that totally misfires as this film does , is that it elicits good , negative feedback from the rational fringe . Although I do n't really keep count , I feel like I read more perceptive , informative Amazon.com reviews of this film than of practically any other product I 've looked into . These reviews are nearly all in the one - and two-stars columns , and I 'm happy to be in their company .
 i was looking forward to seeing this movie and it turns out to be the worse movie that i have ever seen
 A few thoughts -- 1 . Excellent cast and casting . The three leads were so good they could inspire a TV series from this film .2 . The writer wrote herself into a corner . A ` kiss ' opens a Costco sized can of worms -- leaving us two undesirable paths of resolution . The piece must manufacture a fall guy to end the story , but by doing so renders THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT pointless and unsatisfactory .3 . To me , this tale should have explored something more obvious
 I gave this movie 1 star because it would n't let me choose 0 stars . I chose this movie because it was a comedy and the description said `` heart-warming '' modern family movie . I only watched 2 minutes of this movie before I realized that it was not something that was going to warm my heart . The first scene showed a teenage girl considering sex , the second scene showed 2 teenage boys snorting drugs and getting into a big fight , and the third scene showed the two teenagers sitting down with their gay female parents for dinner . All this in the space of 2 minutes ! Since I disliked all of the characters from the very beginning it seemed pointless to continue watching . I think the description should have referred to a comedy about a `` modern dysfunctional family with serious problems '' . If you are a traditional family values oriented person I would recommend you stay far away from this movie .
 if this bluray is any indication of what will get PUSHED upon home movie watchers ... then count me out.this disc spends minutes of time wasting delays trying to find an internet connection.i dont have my player connected to the internet.i NEVER plan to connect my player to the internet.why do i want to ` interact ' with others while watching a movie?is it necessary for the attack on consumers to seep into every crevice of our lives?the answer to this question is `` NO '' . the reality is that the corporate machine will not cease until it does just this.isnt it enough that we must sit through all the copyright warnings ... in multiple languages . -LSB- with no option to fast forward or skip ! -RSB- nobody reads this crap.you got ta believe that the piracy people dont read this crap.whats the point?now we must wait for our disc to make attempts to ` connect ' to the world of higher consumption.the actual movie is becoming secondary to all of this corporate greed.stop.please stop.i am beginning to miss VHS.r | z
 I am so tired of Hollywood , and indies , getting on the bandwagon for lesbian rights , showing them to be so , so Normal . Give me a break ; lesbians raising two kids is NOT normal . I ` ts wierd .
 Not only does Hollywood have no more new ideas , but the ones they come up with are just trash!I can not believe that anyone would really like this movie , and I must not be alone because it was not released to the masses!This is border line brain washing . It is clearly another thread to push these values on America . To try to show it is okay and acceptable because we made a movie about it.I wish I could give it zero stars.This is truly gutter trash !
 Frankly I 'm really sorry I bought this DVD . Firstly it had an area code on it which was n't compatible with my DVD player - bang goes $ 27 . So I decided to bite the bullet and buy one locally , -LRB- another $ 30 -RRB- , only to find it was n't the light-hearted entertainment it was advertised as . If you like porn get this movie ; it 's peppered with porn and really does n't add anything to the plot . Story line was going nowhere and did just that . Pretty ordinary really . Only plus was an exceptional performance from Annette Benning .
 And every other cliche you can think of ! There was NOTHING REAL about these women , their ` love ' life , their parenting . The dialogue was embarrassing . The only believable character on the screen was the dad -- enough said !
 Short Attention Span Summary -LRB- warning , plot spoilers ! -RRB- :1 . We have a lesbian couple that are some years into a marriage and are raising two children together and have the boring sex life of married couples . -LRB- It 's not established who was who 's child -RRB- .2 . When one of the children is 18 years old , she decides to look up the sperm donor .3 . We meet the sperm donor , and see that he is a guy who has no problem getting women -LRB- he has a HOT girlfriend who is about 20 years younger than he is -RRB- .4 . Through a series of blurry steps , the sperm donor ends up in bed with the younger of the two women . They spend a lot of time acting like two little bunny rabbits -LRB- Neither of the women was identified as bisexual , nor was the issue solved . -RRB- 5 . The older woman finds the hair of her wife in the bathroom of the sperm donor and surmises that they are having an affair .6 . At some point , the sperm donor -LRB- Paul was his name , I believe -RRB- decides that he wants a family and that he should latch onto this one . -LRB- This is in spite of having a much younger , much hotter girlfriend with whom he would have a lot more fun starting a family . -RRB- 7 . The remainder -LRB- about 20 minutes -RRB- is taken up with the resolution of SOME of the conflicts in the film . Ultimately the older partner tells Paul that he needs to find his own family and that he is just an interloper . We do n't hear anything from him again.Lots of weird things in this film .1 . Julianne Moore is not the best looking woman . It is really hard to believe that this guy -LRB- who was shown to be so attractive to women -RRB- would pass over so many other younger , fertile women to chase after a woman that was nearly on the wrong side of menopause to try to expropriate some children that were not his . I am not sure if this was poor writing -LRB- the implausibility of the situation as it came across on the screen -RRB- or just poor casting -LRB- i.e , I might have found the relationship more plausible if Paul 's love interest was not played by the hideously unattractive Julianne Moore -RRB- .2 . Lots of things just came out of nowhere . The daughter turned into an angry / rebellious teen about halfway through the movie . Huh ? 3 . Too many things were left unresolved . Was the younger wife a closet bisexual ? What was wrong in the marriage of the two women that made it such that one of partners had to go outside of the marriage ? What happened with the friend of the son -LRB- Laser -RRB- who obviously had some mental problems ? Were n't we shown enough weird things to be led to believe that this boy 's obvious mental illness would lead to some event that would support the thin plot .4 . Political agenda overkill . Ok , so all the people who were heterosexual in the film had something wrong with them . First scene in the movie , the young kid who has been snorting dope in his father 's house gets wrestled to the ground by his father and told to take it somewhere else . This is in contrast to the Perfect Lesbian Household . Then , the illicit relationship has to be between a man and a woman , but the traditional and morally proper -LRB- = in the context of the stable house -RRB- has to be between two lesbians . Then , when a character expresses interest in someone of the opposite sex , she has to be a nyphomaniac / slut . When the daughter is emotionally damaged by her mother 's affair , she goes after a man * Yawn * . * -LRB- We got the point . Straight = bad . Gay = good . -RRB- 5 . Lots of pointless , raunchy sex scenes . Not quite sure what they were supposed to be establishing.Save your money .
 I can not understand they hype over this work - the characters are paper thin , the quality of acting questionable , but most disturbing are the negative images that are conveyed in this work about single sex parenting . The inter-relationships are totally disfunctional and the `` message '' - if there is indeed one - is confused.I would not have expected such badly crafted material to have been offered by a lesbian director.I am just so pleased and happy that my daughter who has two mothers has the privilege of being a totally whole and rounded person in the middle of a normal and loving extended family environment.This was an opportunity to show mainstream that single sex families can be just as functional as `` traditional '' families are perceived as being . That opportunity was lost - in spades !
 This movie was contrived , boring , destitute of anything charming , delightful , or good . The gratuitous sex was stupid , and the acting was mundane .
 Very disappointing ! I love Mark Ruffalo in movies , but this combo did n't work and the way the movie ended up going was n't necessary !
 The story was not bad , until the last 10 minutes , in which the guy was the only one who was condemned and held responsible , while the Moore character who started the affair , went back to her relationship without a problem or any consequences . Who the hell wrote this story?I was baffled AND disgusted by the sheer hatred against the man , that 's displayed in it . My stomach got totally upset.I 've never seen anything as cold and cruel . I really wish I could flush this story from my memory . Minus 5 stars for this one .
 Well , yes , the kids are all right - but with little thanks to the so-called adults around them . I am a huge proponent of same-sex marriage , but that is not what this rather dreary film is about . It is about three adults who can not stick to commitments , who are deeply self-indulgent , and who , if they exercised some self-restraint , would be far better parents . They all show signs of it at times ; there is clearly some love and some wisdom buried in these three characters , but it is thrown aside over and over . I could barely finish the film , and at the end thought , `` Yes , the kids are all right , but they might have been a good deal more all right if the adults in their lvies acted like adults .
 I -LRB- kind of -RRB- did n't like the spoiled and pompous characters the director created for this film - it was hard to feel a lot of empathy for them . I still like Cholodenko a lot and feel she 's a real artist . She used to be edgier though , and that 's what appealed to me the most about her art . This film was not as engrossing as some of her other works .
 Take a great cast , interesting story idea and come up with ... this ? What started as a promising film really turned out to a view of rather shallow people it 's hard to care about . Nic 's the stereotypical success-driven partner who seems to just humor her significant other , Jules , not really respecting her while often looking right past her . Jules is the bohemian dabbler trying to start a new business and is the best of the lot , but still evolves in to a spineless doe . Joni is the very bright , slightly older daughter of Nic who 's guarded , shy and turns out spoiled and heartless . Laser is the son of Jules who is being lead by a jerk friend and is kind of a douche himself but he wants to know who their biological father is so the kids get together and make contact with Paul , their donor.Paul 's a nice guy , kind of eclectic , still single and owns a successful restaurant . Without giving too much away , Paul has a house that needs landscaping and Jules ' new landscaping business has its first client . Paul ends up really liking the kids and they start doing a number of things together . On the landscaping front , Jules and Paul end up having an affair . Paul has dreams of settling down with Jules and having a `` family '' while Jules is just in it for the adventure , experience and to feel `` appreciated '' . When the affair eventually comes to light Jules takes some heat but Paul is shut out completely and in the end Nic and Jules are reconciling and Paul is just cast aside . The cliqueish , shallow , boorish behavior of the central family is really unpleasant and destroys any good feelings you have about them .
 Hated the way the film treats Paul - the children bring him into the family and ultimately the whole family uses him and then cruelly discards him in the end . He was the only character that felt like a genuinely nice and real person . The rest of the cast are more messed up than he is but the film forgives them and demonizes him . Really a lame movie .
 Not sure what all the praise was about . A bunch of smug , entitled unhappy people doing nothing much . Skip it .
 Still leaves me wondering what the point was ? I mean on the surface it was mice to see a family go through family problems as a married lesbian couple . However , throwing in the biological father would have been enough on its own , the affair , another obstacle , but the twist felt forced and upset the balance of the film , which then took focus off of the &#34; kids being alright &#34; .
 No one can fault the acting in this film . I generally like Annette Bening in her roles until this one . She is mentally , emotionally and physically repulsive . Her character is so vile as to cause actual nausea . The children are spoiled brats , and the spouse -LRB- moore -RRB- is spineless . This is just a lame story about a weak minded individual . So terrified she is of losing anyone due to her lack of substance , she is a tyranical hun . Do n't waste your time .
 So a movie is good if the male character is treated like garbage , I suppose ... this review contains spoilers . At the end , Mark Ruffalo 's character is referred to as an interloper by Annette Bening 's character . He was not the one who interfered with anyone else 's life , though . They interfered with his life by seeking him out and getting in touch with him . The message also seems to be that heterosexual sex is evil -LRB- because it involves a male -RRB- and lesbian sex is the purest , most saintly sex possible . Would the people who like this movie be happy if all the men in the world just killed themselves right now ? Would that satisfy them ?
 I hated this movie , but not because of the subject matter , rather I hated the acting by the Hollywood superstars -LRB- so predictable , not genuine or believable at all -RRB- and I really hated the disrespectful way the topic of same sex marriage/relationships was handled . It was so cliche ' and felt very disrespectful . The material was there , but the director and the actors flubbed it . My favorite part of this movie was the development of the relationship between father and daughter . That felt real and authentic and likely , although I find it hard to believe that a guy who was so seemingly immature could be such a successful entrepreneur in today 's volatile consumer market . I was also not thrilled with all the gratuitous sex that seemed to be thrown in just to hold our attention when the acting could n't . Such a disappointment !!!
 I was hopeful , yet disappointed in the plot line and complete dismissal of Mark Ruffalo 's character in the end . Film had strong character development , a great cast , and was well acted ~ the kids were very strong -LRB- ***** -RRB- . Hope to see them in future films .
 Largely humourless `` comedy '' -LRB- and a not so good feeling `` feel good movie '' -RRB- about a dysfunctional family , who ... . remains dysfunctional.The end.spoilers abound : Lessee ... . Lesbian life partners , one a doctor , focused , businesslike , with a over-achieving biological daughter . The other one showing evidence of drifting through life , trying various careers , never really sticking with one . HER biological child is a slacker son who 's drifting in unhealthy directions because of his seemingly passive choice of social outlets.So , let 's introduce the sperm donor into the mix , shake well , see what happens ... This movie did n't work for me , overall . There were a few bits that did , however.Great acting by Mark Ruffalo and Mia Wasikowski . Actually liked how Ruffalo 's character was developed , and how he went from being a bit of a man whore , to really loving the family dynamic , perhaps more than he should.Not much character development throughout . Not a ton of plot development.Slacker son realized that his one friend 's an ass.That 's the sum of his growth.The daughter 's too shy to put moves on the boy she 's always hanging out with . Until she gets drunk at a party and kisses him a couple of times . But then runs off , perhaps disgusted with herself , it 's not made clear.She ... well at least she leaves for college.The relationship between the two women does an occasionally-decent job of showing long standing hostilities that are kept under the surface , and what happens when they surface.Fairly realistic for an old married couple.Bening 's character seems to have it all together , until the sperm donor starts being part of the life , then she flips out . Julianne Moore 's feeling a bit ignored , so immediately has sex with Ruffalo . Repeatedly.Seemingly odd behaviour for someone who 's not attracted to men.End was very `` bleh '' . Only characters that really seemed to develop were Ruffalo 's , and to a lesser extent the son.To a much lesser extent.Lots of stuff that might go somewhere , but really did n't . I 'm sure I did n't `` get '' it , but ended up feeling that daughter was lucky to leave , and son , who had just started to shape up a bit from where he was at the beginning of the movie , was in for a rough ride.Not worth the time spent watching it , overall . And I found the marketing strategy for the film to be blatantly dishonest.Oh , and really , did n't need to see the manporn repeatedly on the TV .
 Mark Ruffalo played a great character in this movie , and I was disappointed that he was blamed for everything and chased away at the end of the story .
 My review title says it all . Life is very messy . The gay moms is totally all right with me . We are a product of our heritage and environment . This said , I felt horrible for the kids dad who was invited into their lives . I felt no sympathy for the moms . Kids are kids and all they knew was a life with the moms . No , the kids are not all right , ultimately .
 The idea of even introducing into this movie a scummy creep that demands his `` friend '' hold down an innocent stray dog so he can pee on the dogs head is so perverted and deplorable . You have lesbians raising a family & then meeting the sperm doner . That is the theme of the movie . A family . What in the name of God does such animal cruelty have to do with the script ? They did n't need to include that scene .
 One-star due to false labeling this film `` funny/smart/heart-warming '' when it is truly `` unfunny/too - ` clever ' / heart-rending '' True , the acting is superb and the writing feels spot-on at many points . But the plot is soooooooo contrived and the characters are so distorted so as to overshadow the acting and writing . From my perspective , one can view this film as ` funny ' and ` heart-warming ' only in a sick/bad/shallow way . Because the truth of the film is otherwise to experience this film as gross/inauthentic/mean-spirited . Earns one-star because zero is not an option and because Bening and Moore soldier through with great performances .
 This appears to be another movie people over rate the movie because of the subject matter . Good actors but I was very disappointed in the movie . It reminds me of the movie Piano , everyone raved about it so I watched it . That was 2 hours of my life I will never get back !
 Except for some scenes and Anette Benning 's acting -LRB- which was flawless BTW -RRB- found the movie ridiculous , most parts unbelievable and almost homophobic . It completely reinforced the dogma of `` being gay is a choice and these women need to be with a REAL MAN to straighten them out '' . The movie would have been good if it remained focussed on the turmoil caused by reentering of the sperm donor in this family 's life but the whole lesbian sleeping with the guy thing was stupid.I can understand a lesbian woman -LRB- who is shown to be decidedly Lesbian in her 40s at least - NOT bisexual -RRB- getting drunk and maybe have sex with a guy ONCE but conciously and repeatedly having sex with him AND seeming to enjoy it ... NO I dont buy that.In one scene she actually is shown to look at the guy 's penis and her expression is of pure joy and ecstasy as if she has discovered the true meaning of nirvana . I m sorry but that is not what a Lesbian make.There are some very good scenes involving the kids and the relationship changes they experience with the entry of this new person in their lives . However the movie was ruined for me by the whole lesbian women enjoying sleeping with the straight guy angle.Also , I could not understand how these beautiful women -LRB- the other straight African american woman the guy is sleeping with is GORGEOUS and much younger -RRB- are throwing themselves at this scruffy looking middle aged guy who looks like he has not shaved and/or had a shower since he donated sperm 20 years ago!As i said earlier it was clearly one of that `` THIS is what these poor women are missing '' moment . Icing on the cake is ... these women get off on watching Gay male porn . I dont know of any lesbians who like watching gay male porn while having sex themselves . I sure also dont know of any gay men who get turned on by lesbian porn.I can understand Lesbian women wathcing gay porn as entertainment and getting some laughs , even admire the male body for what its worth , but I dont buy the notion that they get turned `` on '' by watching gay male porn while having sex themselves unless they are bisexual ! I may be wrong but I dont think gay men would get off in a bathhouse while watching girl on girl action .
 I did not care for the movie . I do n't like sex scenes . I think they are unnecessary to tell the story . I like Julianne Moore . There are lesbian scenes in case someone is squeamish . The story of the kids finding their sperm donor is very good twist .
 It 's not the subject matter I object to , it 's the script -- I mean , cool , man -- if you like scripts with the vocabulary limited to like , yeah , cool , and more of that `` ilk '' -- enjoy . otherwise --
 I thought I was going crazy when I watched this ! I 'd heard so many good things about this film and omg it was one of the worst , most disgusting and appalling movies I 've ever seen and I 'm not joking .
 In this day and age when the media is trying to help the general public `` get used to the idea '' that gay people are `` normal '' , why would this movie portray a main gay character as NOT gay ? There were so many other ways to suggest a conflict in their lives besides her having an affair with a man . She could have had an affair with another gay woman , maybe ? And then the man could have had some problem with taking over the family in another way like maybe smoking a doobie with the 21-year old or maybe or bring the kids too much into his own family life . Something that could have been justified . But having sex with the lesbian mother ? Eew , it does n't make sense . And did the sex scenes have to be so gross ? And so often ? Give me a break . And the scene where the woman was under the covers was just ickey ! I do n't want to see a movie have a scene like that with men OR women . The juicy little kisses were enough . The movie was watchable , otherwise , if only to see what was going to come up next . Annette Bening was cool and bitchy and the kids were cute and realistic . The friend of the son was sort of weird and could have been strange in a different way instead of being portrayed as so ignorant and stupid . I really liked Mark Ruffalo . He played the part as best he could . I did n't enjoy seeing Julianne Moore in those creepy shorts and socks and do n't see how he could have been attracted to her . In the end the guy is just left behind as a sick bastard with no redemption possible . So many people think that gay women just do n't like men , but I do n't think that is true . I am disappointed that Annette Bening would `` go along '' with the plot line . She seems brighter than that . She could have said , `` Nyaaa '' `` I do n't wan na be in this movie '' !
 I only watched about a third of this film . The story may have been good , but the graphic sexual content turned my stomach . Sorry , I do n't need those kind of scenes to understand the story .
 Worst movie I have ever seen in my life . Stupid , no point or solid plot , dragged on so slow it 's crazy . Do not rent it you will wish you could get your money back .
 The product description on Amazon was not specific enough to inform potential buyers about system requirements . Product claims ; No hosting fees , No design fees , No update fees and No programming . All true , but because the software actually uses your home or office PC as the Server you also need ; a system with Pentium 1.2 Ghz or higher , 1GB of free hard disk space , DSL or cable Internet connection , to contact your ISP provider and have your service upgraded at additional cost to accomodate a `` Static '' IP address , your ports -LRB- 25 and 80 -RRB- need to be reconfigured to allow flow for webmail which by the way allows spam-mail to get through your firewall .

 Although the kids enjoy this game because it has characters that they like , it seems impossible to find all the clues and solve the riddles .

 Where do I start ? OK , I 've had been using Muvee 6 software for about a year and had heard the older version -LRB- Muvee 4 -RRB- was better than the present one I was using . So I ordered Muvee 4 and the software did n't even work . Called Muvee to complain and they said that piece of software had been discontinued and that it should n't even be on the market anymore . I personally found that a little odd because I 've never known of any company saying that a safe and effective product was taken off the market and should n't be in the stores . After a few emails back and forth from Muvee , they finally settle on the bases that the software was bootleg or pirated . I reported this to the seller who replied that it was a legit product . The seller asked me to send it back for a refund if I wanted but a refund was n't the point . The point was I wanted this version of Muvee . Finally , Muvee settled and gave me the highest version of their software -LRB- Muvee Reveal -RRB- for my inconvenience , so it all worked out . Although I did n't get to try out Muvee 4 , I have to say that Muvee Reveal does a very good job of making movies . I would n't put it totally over Muvee 6 , just because it 's a newer version , let 's just say they both are good but have some different attributes .
 This is the biggest rip-off in security software . You might as well throw your money out the car window on the way to the store and save yourself the aggravation . Virus definitions do not update and keep giving errors in the update process . Anti-virus keeps scanning the floppy drive whenever it feels like . Poor interface with the computer user . Constant conflicts in the various programs included in the suite . Causes system conflicts in Windows XP . Trying to remove it will make your computer unstable and hard to launch other applications . The worst software in the utility business . I would like to return this junk personally to the people that market this junk .

 Our church recently purchased this software to manage our church membership data and contribution data . We have been VERY disappointed with this product.Several of the features promised do not function at all . The custom filter features do not work at all - you can not print a report of just your `` members '' for example , or find all couples with children.Attempting to export data or print reports is a hit or miss proposition . Sometimes the program will respond to the options you have selected , sometimes it seems to ignore the selected options and do totally its own thing . Sometimes it does n't give you any of your data at all.The features that do `` work '' are so full of errors and bugs that it makes it a challenge to work with , much less a program I trust to safely store all of the data we want to enter into it . We have consistently encountered `` bugs '' both large and small . Dialog boxes that do not work . Check boxes that do not appear when checked . `` Address violation '' errors that freeze the program and require a computer restart , loosing any recently entered data.This program contains a `` Contributions at Home '' portion that allows a financial secretary to enter the data from their home computer and then update the main database . This section of the program does not reliably save the data entered , and to give you an idea , it creates a fatal error anytime you open the `` funds '' section of this module -LRB- A crucial part of this `` convenient '' feature -RRB- . We have found that while some of the program does work it is not enough to offset the frustration of the things that do not work . In addition to the frustrations of the program itself , the Customer Service and support has been minimally helpful at best . I am a computer literate indiviaul , these errors and problems are NOT simply operator error or lack of understanding.If the program actually , successfully executed all of the features it tries to offer it would be a great program . However , until this company learns to create software that is functional , I would strongly recommend that you AVOID THIS PROGRAM . It does not come even CLOSE to doing what it says it does .
 I echo the comments of the previous reviewer . I am Treasurer for our church . We previously were using Membership Plus 6.0 and we upgraded . After almost five months of trying to use it , I have reverted to the version 6.0 until I find a totally new product . That 's right - even after investing the money in this product , we are abandoning any further efforts to use it . There are many features that just do not work - there are frequent error messages -LRB- including during backup -RRB- , and the company only offers free support for 30 days . My opinion though is that this software is so buggy that the data is unreliable . I would have rated it with 0 stars if that had been an option .
 Allow me to add my disappointment to the other reviewers . We have been attempting to upgrade from Membership Plus 6 for two months , with little success in input and none in reporting . The canned reports are full of bugs , as is the rest of the package . Unedited operating system errors are generated from ordinary operations like changing a date range . Stay Away !
 When I came on as one of the Assistant Treasurer 's at my church , the previous A.T. showed me how to use the software and it seemed enjoyable enough . Well , lets just say the honeymoon did not last too long . The program is so bad that I feel it is my Christian duty to warn you to STAY AWAY!The program is unreliable , at best . The only thing that I have never run into a major problem with is when I am actually entering our weekly offering information . Other than that , it is a both a struggle and nightmare and takes days of praying to create the end-of-year tax reports for each member and many , if not most , of the `` features '' either do not work or are so difficult and troublesome to figure out , we end up doing it by hand anyway.If our church had the extra money , we would purchase something new , but for now , it is what we are stuck with . It is one of the most useless and unreliable managing software programs that I have ever worked with . Stay as far away as possible ! I , too , would have rated it with 0 stars , had it been an option .
 I agree with all of the other reviews . It was a nightmare and the support was little help . Besides everytime you opened Membership , you would have a new problem . We changed to Donarius . It is a small company and the program does n't have a lot of bells and whisles , BUT what is there works . The support is wonderful too . Think about it . You can find it on the internet .
 I purchased this product loaded it on the computer and then the fun began . WHAT A NIGHTMARE this has been . when I try to print a tax deductable receipt in one members name I have to shut down the program then come back to it in order to go on to the next member . It is constantly making me restart the whole computer because it freezes everything up . I have had to even unplug the computer on a few occasions to get away from it . It is a waste of money . I am looking for another program of this type . . Any Ideas anyone ??????????? DFarley
 I bought my daughter 3 pieces of software from Disney , and so far 2 have not worked.In this case , the game will run for a few minutes , then it minimized itself and stops responding.For the record , I am IT professional and have been doing computers for over 20 years , so it 's not a case of 1di0t error .
 The tech support for this product is virtually useless.The software prevented my computer from booting . It got hung up doing a Farstone checking routine that stalled at 38 % . My computer was down . Using another computer to check their web site resulted in no information to fix the problem . I used their `` automated '' support ticket to report the problem and ask for help . They got back to me two days later . The solutions they offered were useless.The first solution was to confess that Version 5 had this known booting problem and the only solution was to buy version 6 . Give me a break . To indicate that their software has a known problem and they do n't distribute an update free to fix a known problem is dishonest . I paid for the software and expect it to work . If it does n't , they owe their customers the responsibility to get it working , at no additional cost.If it is a known problem , why is n't a solution posted on their web site FAQ 's ? The second solution they offered several days later as to hit the -LRB- Alt + F10 -RRB- key while booting ... I could n't check this out I could n't wait for two days to use my computer at this product development site . I had customers waiting . The problem was that their program installed its own MBR -LRB- Master Boot Record -RRB- which I could n't get around . If their version of the boot record crashed , your computer was worthless . I found out by searching the web -LRB- on another computer naturally since mine was stalled with Farstone software -RRB- that I could use the Windows Vists DVD to run the `` Repair Computer '' feature . I then used the command prompt in the Repair utility to do the following : a. BOOTREC.EXE / fixMBRb . BOOTREC.EXE / fixBootThis removed Farstone 's MBR and allowed me to get my computer back up and running . Funny , they di n't know about this fix , or even suggest it as a repair option , or even post it on their web site FAQ 's . I spent hours searching the web trying to find this solution.I have since purchased version 6 and got it working to back up my primary drive . But I 'll tell you , I would never recommend this to any of my customers because if they have a problem , their support is useless . Having extracted funds from users , they should be able to provide technical support that is immediately reachable . If not , raise the price of their software or change a nominal fee for support , whatever it takes to back up their product in an intelligent and accessible fashion . So I would say about this software , `` Use at your own risk . Do n't expect any help if you have a problem . ''
 Even with the telephone assitance of a Microsoft Word expert , I have been unable to upgrade my Word 98 1 version to the 2004 Version , so the product has been no good for me .
 I was unable to use the product because of Microsoft 's inflexible policy on upgrades . For the upgrade to work , they require you to have the old disk , period . I had the old manual and my owner 's ID no . but they would not accept this as adequate proof of ownership . When I pointed out to their customer support rep that the other major software companies all accepted this proof , she made an insulting remark and cut me off .
 This is the 2005 version of garden composer , and it shows its age . Very clunky , difficult to use . The encyclopedia of plants soundsd like a plus , but again , very clunky - you can sort but you ca n't search for a specific plant . I would not recommend this software .
 ProComm Plus DOES NOT work with Windows XP , You can make it dial , but you can not use a . dir file , aspects , or scripts .
 You should know that this product is no longer supported . The last build was in 1999 . At the time of writing this , that is almost ten years old.In ' 99 , Google was just getting started , Windows XP was not yet released , and most importantly , SSH was n't used . So , no SSH with this software .
 While the language itself is not all that bad -LRB- in some aspects its actually quite good -RRB- . The compiler itself is hindered by a multitude of bugs and idiosyncrasies that make your average developer start foaming at the mouth.If you intend on buying this product , be prepared to develop a one to one relationship with Powersoft/Sybase 's support department ... some of the problems are solved by applying patches , but yet some remain because ` we wish to retain compatibility with the previous -LRB- bugged -RRB- versions ' ... frustrating response to say the least ... I hope they get it right next time , would be a shame if it was canned -LRB- by developers considering dropping the language -RRB- , as i said its quite a good language -LRB- and it is , honest -RRB- , just a crap compiler .
 I renewed my subscription ... they would n't send an updated version on cd ... when i loaded on other computers ... none worked ... even when I downloaded correct version off the web ... spam filter wo n't work ... Wo n't bother with this again ...
 I switched from Norton Internet Security because it let something in and could not remove it . When I installed PC-cillin my laptop would no longer print on my wireless network . I installed PC-cillin on another wireless computer on my network and the wireless network connection died . I had to run an Ethernet cable to get it back online but the computer would not print anyway . I messed around trying to get it working for almost six months and made no headway.I purchased McAfee internet security suite 2006 and installed it on the 2 computers PC-cillin had messed up . McAfee found a Trojan on my laptop which was the reason I had switched from Norton Internet Security . My computer would print on the network again . The other computer would also print and the wireless network started working again . On the good side , I only found 1 virus on one computer and one Trojan on the other . PC-cillin seems to work well as an antivirus.I could find no way to configure PC-cillin to allow my computers to print and there was nothing I do about it killing my wireless network.A complete waste of $ 75 ...
 Installed this on my new computer.Had problems and they had me reinstall.I now have new problems and when I send the problem to microsoft they say it 's pc-cillins fault.support gives me the runaround.I will go back to Mcaffe.Don ' t waste your money on pc-cillin . Do n't expect to get your rebate on it . . I did n't .
 The product advertises it works on Macs , but it does n't . We called several places for assistance , including DK Multimedia & no one could get it to work on our Mac .
 I just started playing it and hour ago and now I beat it . So if you want something that will take you longer do not buy this game .
 Reviewer :10 year oldthis game fun in the begining but hard in the end . I bought this game a year ago and still cant figure out how to free a person !! I was extremly dissapointed , I even asked the company people to help me . But they just ignored me !! i would n't by this game if you want to find all the players .
 The product page says it is Mac/PC , the box does too , and even the disc says it is . However the Mac session is entirely missing . It looks like it was remastered/copied by someone who did n't know what they were doing , and there was no quality control/testing . If you have a Mac , you are out of luck unless you have an emulator and a copy of MS Windows.I 've contacted Atari technical support , no answer as yet , if/when they respond I 'll update this review .
 If you are a Mac User - please be aware that this title is incompatible with all newer Apple Macintosh computers . Any mac with an Intel processor -LRB- from about 2006 onward -RRB- or with the newest operating system -LRB- 10.5 -RRB- will NOT be able to run this program . And even older macs will need the OS9 compatibility options installed . Yuck.If you are a PC User . I tried to install this program on my Sony Vaio running XP . The game complained of a missing WAV driver and would not run . Finally , I got it working on another Windows PC , but with issues . The game tried to switch to a lower resolution and my PC handled that by adding a black border around the game area . I do n't like the idea of my son squinting at a smaller image in the middle of the screen ! Also - occasionally my mouse cursor would sometimes change to a black square making it difficult to tell where you were pointing . I 'm sure this game will work fine for most PC users . I 'm not sure what was different about my two computers that caused the incompatibility.Finally - the educational value of this game is extremely limited . Basically it is a computerized book . As you flip from page to page , a voice reads the words to you and the text is highlighted . After the text is read , your child is given a chance to click randomly on the page . If you happen to click on certain objects , they perform some funny animation with sound . Some objects are click-able and others are not.There are 5 mini games hidden throughout the game . For example , on page 2 if you happen to guess to click on the helicopter , a small remote control pops up on the screen and you can actually control it and drop water balloons on a target.I only give it a second star because - despite all of this , my son really did enjoy it once I got it going .
 Arthurs Computer Adventure Ages 3-7 CD software is not compatible with my Windows XP software , even though the package states it is compatible!Even the readme file did not explain , and was written for Windows 95 & 98 ! Therefore , it lies on the shelf , totally unusable .
 This is advertised as being Mac compatible , but unless your Mac is very old , it will not work .
 I do n't know if this is any good or not . It will not run on Windows Vista , nor Windows XP . It apparently is for some earlier outdated operating system !! But they do n't tell you that ! It is up to you to find out about this only after purchasing this software !
 Looks like nice game , but it 's obsolete and does not work under Windows 7 -LRB- 32-bit -RRB- even with various compatibility modes enabled . I need to try running it in a Windows XP virtual machine .
 I bought this software after reading the reviews . Yes , this game is fun and my sons love to play it . But , that is all it is . Mostly they are just games . We have many other software titles where the children are always learning when they are playing . My children want to play this game . However , I want my children to use the computer as a learning tool , not a gameboy .
 No idea if it 's any good b/c though it says it works with Windows XP , as several others have also said , it does not , it crashes the system repeatedly .
 although it said it was compatable it never loaded so we have no clue what it actually teaches or does
 This Arthur 's Adventure software does NOT work with Windows Vista . Will not install . So do n't buy it if you have Vista .
 To work this software , you need MAC OS 9 . It would not run on My Mac from 2005 - that had OS X. Complex process to install OS 9 classic , for a $ 6 game . : - -LRB-
 Unless you 're already taking a French class , this product does n't help at all . It has some things to read and listen to , but it does n't teach you how to speak French , which was what I was looking for . Do n't buy this product unless you already know French and want to practice .
 The format was terrible ! You could n't find anything you were looking for . The games were very difficult , and it does an awful job of giving you vocab words . It would be much better for an advanced french student brushing up on the language , but I would not recommend it !
 This program has some useful features -LRB- like the voice comparison -RRB- but getting around is a pain , and it is difficult or impossible to do some things . It 's difficult to tell where to start , switching from word to sentence pronunciation is not possible , and it 's impossible to go back to the `` previous step '' if you accidently click the `` next '' button twice . The male french speaker was talking at warp 9 , and the `` slow down '' feature just put a lot of static into the voice .
 I returned this item . The voice was awful , and the structure was terrible . I was using XP , so this might be better with an Apple system .
 This was n't very helpful to me . The only thing that I liked about it was that you can improve your accent . If you wan na learn french take a class .
 I wanted to like this product , I really did . CN ! has a few unique and very helpful features , but the organization and lack of Chinese characters make it dificcult to recommend.First off , the program is not in Chinese . It is in pinyin , which is a phonetic transcription of Chinese using roman letters . Thus , this program does not even attempt to teach you to read and write Chinese . If you 're more interested in speaking and listening , you 're pretty well covered.The really good feature is this thing that lets you hear a native speaker , record your speach , and listen to them both . The computer even draws graphs comparing the two -- the pitch graph helped me learn my tones faster than working with a human teacher . -LRB- The computer does n't grimace and shake its head every time I say something wrong ! -RRB- Learning tones is the hardest part of learning Chinese for many native English speakers ; if you 're having trouble there , the program may be worth $ 40 for the pitch meter alone.However , you seem to be locked into Transparent Language 's course , which involves listening to and repeating dialogs . I wanted to use the program as a simple talking flashcard , and I 've found this difficult . There 's a feature that tries to do this , but it 's difficult to add words , and you ca n't make word lists that cross units.All in all , this is a great speech tool stuck in an otherwise awkard program . If they made the user interface cleaner , and made it easier to build lists of index cards , this program would be a very valueable tool to have while you 're taking a Chinese class.Oh yeah , it crashed all the time under NT , but that might just be my computer . It works fine under 95 .
 I bought this software because I was desperate to find a any Chinese learning software , so I bought this one an also the Rosetta Chinese learning software.Chinese now is the worst software I ever used , the user interface is very poorly designed and it crashes all the time.The software offer you meaningless translations and the speech recognition part is completely unusable recording less than one second of speech , you never have time to finish a word before it 's done recording.My only advice is do not buy this software ! , Only the package looks nice . You 're much better off with a book and a tape
 Do n't bother with this software . It is a really pathetic package . First of all , it crashes all the time . Obviously , this package is n't supported since there is no patch for the crash on their website . But secondly , there is no uniform strategy to their teaching methods . Basically , this is just an engine that speaks chinese along side pinyin text . And a few games are thrown in to the mix . The speech analyzer which another reviewer commented on is useless . I can say entirely different words than I am supposed to and it still indicates I am speaking correctly.Really , I 'm surprised that this package is even on the market . You wo n't learn Mandarin with it . So it 's a waste of time .
 I have been working on purchasing language software , and have found that the Learn Now series does not work with Windows 2000 . I noticed in another comment that they had the same issue . The program itself looked like it would have been pretty good , but I did not get a good opportunity to use it since it locked my system up . I worked with the technical support people at Transparent Language , but they could not figure out why it was happening .
 i am not impressed with this cd-rom as other ones that i have tried . Subjects chosen for the instruction are not useful . The voices used in the conversation are boring , unlively , and not play-acting enough to be more exciting . Publisher should choose actors or good readers for conversationalists in CD.I do n't recommend this CD .
 When I bought this software I was thrilled with the comments on this product that I decided to give it a try . However when I installed it , it was so boring that I lost interest in a matter of minutes . The vocabulary drills always take you to the same ten words , even though it says it teaches you 10000 . The bonus grammar software included will never teach you any grammar , however I must recognize that it has some good dialogues if you want to practice your listening skills . If you want a more complete software I recommend Learn to Speak German .
 I 'm interested in Learning German since I 'm in German Club at school and thought I 'd take a break from the german books and get software , huge mistake with this product . Its boring and is really is a waste of money . I begged my parents for this and they got it ... and I was happy . When I opened and installed it and ready to learn ... The guy said it had three levels and he had good feedbacks from other people that bought his product and etc . This is not for beginners ...
 I bought this for my girlfriend because her mother is German and she always wanted to learn . She found herself literally falling asleep at the computer !!! The speech recognition does n't work worth a damn !! I could say most anything in English and it would rate me as good ! The whole thing does n't seem to have any planning associated with it . You just muddle around trying to learn German . I sent it back to Transparent for a refund . Let 's see if at least they can get that right . If you are a beginner , STAY AWAY FROM THIS !!! Try Rosetta Stone , it seems more for beginners .
 If you are a beginning student , this program can be used as a suppliment to other learning tools . This program will not teach you Japanese by itself ! The good points are the video/dialog sections and the word record/playback feature -LRB- which I use alot to practice pronunciation -RRB- . A major drawback is the lack of a good lookup tool to find a specific word in context within a sentence . You are also limited to the words used in each lesson for the interactive practice sections . If you are just curious , this is an affordable way to explore the Japanese language , but if you are a serious student you might consider `` Power Japanese '' -LRB- which I think is changing names to `` Complete Japanese '' -RRB- . Konnichi wa !
 This was the first program I installed on a new computer . After 5 minutes of running the program I got an error message and the program shut down . After trying repeatedly to fix the error , I contacted the tech dept and they sent me SIX page e-mail with over 40 steps in the instructions to fix the program . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! As the other reviews noted , it 's not really for beginners , you should have a basic knowledge of the Japanese language .
 I bought this CD before my husband and I got stationed in Japan , and thought it would help me to get a little bit of a grasp on the language . It is terrible . I want to be able to learn the language step by step , starting basic and working to intermediate , like you do with any language , but this is impossible . It throws you into the language somewhere in the middle and you have to have a handle on the language before you even begin to work with this program . It advertises that it is great for the beginner , but I think I just wasted my money .
 This program has the worst user interface I 've ever seen in my life , and plenty of bugs to go with it.The video conversations are a great idea but they are poorly executed and there are too few of them anyway.The rest of the program vaguely resembles a reference guide but it 's to cumbersome to be of much practical use .
 If you speak absolutely no Japanese , this product is not for you . If you speak a little bit of Japanese you would hate this program . This is a horrible way to teach yourself the language and probably would n`t help beginners at all . DO NOT BUY !!!!
 `` I have nothing positive to say about this software . It does a insufficient job of explaining grammar , the vocabulary section is spoken at a snail 's pace , it uses overly formal speech , and worst of all , this software contains those `` lies '' -LRB- the act of overlly dumbing down and lying in an attempt to avoid confusion -RRB- which is common in most learning materials . For instance , the software 's explanation of `` atashi '' meaning `` I '' , which is used only by women . The software explains it as `` When women talk , watashi may sound like atashi . '' But the truth is atashi is an informal form of watashi . This software is just crammed full of it . '' Avoid like the pox .
 I do not recommend Spanish Now . First of all , it 's not very good for a beginner because it has no good way to build the vocabulary . Other Spanish programs I have tried showed pictures of items and gave the Spanish name for it to help build one 's vocabulary . Anything like that is absent from this program . All it does is give a list of sentences and read them to you and , if you 're a beginner , you 're expected to learn a lot of new words all at once . You can learn words from it , but it is a very boring and tedious way of doing so . Secondly , the program is just stupid . In one section , it gives a list of phrases that you would need to know if you 're planning a trip to a Spanish speaking country . Before each set of phrases , it has whole complicated paragraphs that tell about Spanish customs and they 're all in Spanish . If a person can read all these paragraphs about customs then they would n't need to be learning how to ask the location of a good restaurant or something simple like that . Third , I found the games that this thing has to be pretty boring . Fourth , the company obviously did n't proofread their product very well because it contains errors in the text . Worst of all , it has translational errors . So no matter what level you 're at in learning Spanish , I do n't recommend this software . As a matter of fact , if you 're a beginner and you want to learn the language , do n't buy any language software and expect it to be your sole learning source . I 've used several Spanish CD-ROMs and none of them alone will teach you much about Spanish . They 're only useful when used in conjuction with books , tapes , or other programs . And if you just want to learn enough Spanish to get by , this one will help you but there are far cheaper ones that will teach you just as much . I would recommend QuickStudy Spanish by The Learning Company .
 My experience with this product was not a pleasant one . First , I caught two translational errors and I 'm a beginner , so I 'm left wondering how many other errors there are that I 'm not catching . I e-mailed the company about this and all they did was send me an attachment with just those two errors corrected . They did n't offer me my money back or even offer me so much as an apology . I also had problems with the sound . And I knew it was in the software and not my computer , so I e-mailed the technical department and they did n't even bother to e-mail me back . I e-mailed the company again about the technical department not responding to me and the compnay did n't respond this time either . And it 's been about two months since I 've e-mailed them . So I would just not recommend this product . Even without the errors , the product still is n't very good .
 If you have no experience with spanish , forget about this program . I do believe that this title would be good for someone who already has some classroom spanish experience . Those with no experience will be overwhelmed and lost from the outset with this title .
 Do n't buy this , unless you just have an overwhelming desire to waste 50 bucks . The sound on the thing is terrible . It has a button to click to slow the speed of the people talking , but when you click it , the sound is distorted . The sound is also sometimes distorted when a letter beginning with an ` r ' is pronounced . And it 's distorted a couple of other times as well . The sound on my computer is fine any other time so I know that it 's in the software and not my computer . The product is n't really that good anyway , even if the sound were perfect . It 's definitely not for a beginner . It lacks information that a beginner would need and it uses a boring method of building the vocabulary . So just do n't buy this . It 's a complete waste of money .
 I do not recommend this product to anyone . It contains incorrect translations . For example , it says that veintisiete is 26 . Veintisiete is 27 . It contains other errors , too . In one section of the program , I found Spanish in the box where the English translation was suppose to be . I also had problems with the sound . When I clicked on the button to slow the speed of the dialogue , the sound was distorted . It 's a shame that the software has these errors , because otherwise , it is a very good program . It teaches in a very well organized manner . It has a section on grammar and the letter sounds for beginners and is also designed for intermediate and advanced students . But unless you want to keep a dictionary nearby and make sure that each translation is correct , then I recommend finding another product .
 I planned to brush up on the Spanish I had not used in 10 years . From the description , this seemed like the proper package . From the time I opened the box I was lost . There are no loading instructions , workbook or guide as to how to use the software . I had to call the manufacturer 's 800 number to load it . After that I still had no idea where to start since there were dozens of icons to press . I pressed a few . A video of a conversation appeared . I was n't sure it it was lesson one or lesson 100 . It may be a wonderful program , but I returned it because I had no concept of where to start .
 I actually have the 7.0 version which I acquired up when 8.0 came out . Ca n't imagine that the 8.0 version would be any vast improvement unless they 've really addressed beginners . Some people , like me , just do n't pick up new languages easily and this software was no help . It was not user friendly and definitely was not for beginners . Used it few times and it is now stored with my ever growing pile of relatively useless , overly hyped , software disks . I find it amazing that a field as potentially lucrative as computer guided , at-home , language instruction has so many unfriendly and painful to use products on the market . Good thing I acquired it cheaply , otherwise I would have been much more disappointed . Time to check out another product . Maybe I 'll get back to ` Spanish Now ' when I learn some Spanish ! For now , it 's just too tough to use . My computer did n't even like it . As I told my French teachers in high school and my German professors in college
 I 've used Transparent Language on a PC in the past and it has worked fine but I ordered this item - which it claims works on macs - and when I tried to install it was told that it was not supported on my computer . Mac OSX users beware , I could n't get it to work on my Mac OSX 10.4.11
 Do yourself a favor and save your money . I found this to be the worst learning tool I have ever seen . The CD basically comes with 2 or 3 stories that you can listen to and practice repeating.The only thing I found useful was going through the correct pronunciation of the alphabet.All the important items in learning a language are in text only format , so you 'd be better off buying a book
 This tool is useless unless you have a basic understanding for the grammer of portuguese , which I do not . There are no lessons . Like the other review said , there are basically four little stories and you can sit and watch your computer read through them.I was expecting a more tradtional approach of going through various items and learning how to say simple things . Do n't waste your time buying this ...
 Though this program may help you memorize common Latin phases , it fails to help develop basic skills that are needed in learning Latin . The program is not designed to build vocabulary , nor does it enhance ones understanding of the grammar . If anything it confused me . The graphics and visual experience is well done , but this is not a Latin Course . Though the Wheelocks Textbook has been very helpful as a beginner 's Textbook .
 I was very disappointed with this programme . It is one of the worst language programmes I have ever seen.I have studied Latin before and know many words and the basic grammar , but even I found it difficult to cope with the total immersion approach . The descriptions of the grammar were completely inadequate.This course would be very little use to beginners or advanced learners ; and only a moderate help to intermediate students of Latin .
 I bought this software in the hope of getting an interactive start with Latin . Instead the tutorial jumps straight into a complicated text without laying down any basics . Perhaps it might be more useful to advanced students but I got nothing out of it .
 As someone who has gone throught O'Siadhall 's Learning Irish and grew up in house with two native Connemara Irish speakers for parents . I also found the format very confusing . Where do you start ? Where is the structure ? I understand that they want to immerse you in the language as if you had just stepped off the bus at the village of Doire Iorrais in the middle of the gaelteacht , but that method only works for some people . How hard would it be to build a lesson structure in to the software so that users could approach it from a structured or non structured approach ? Not very , I 'm guessing . Add a few menus and some lesson plans . I also was very disappointed to find out the the writing software did not come with Irish script . I found it impossible to type anything with a fada correctly . This is one thing for which the company has no excuse . If you 're going to sell and Irish computer course , you ought to be able to type easily in Irish with little or no effort . I believe that with some tweaking , this could very well be THE product for teachhing Irish , but until the weaknesses with regard to course structure are addressed , this will continue to be a peripheral tool for learners .
 This was the only -LRB- so far anyway -RRB- Irish Gaelic language program that I have been able to find . First , the main menu is confusing , it gives you no real idea where to begin . You click on something and you get a lot of lines of text with links to places on the disc , some of these links only bring up more text to tell you how to get there . I finally found something that said `` step by step '' , I went there . It gave me an alphabet , which it pronounced for me . But then it did n't tell me where to go next . The next thing in line seemed to be grammar , so I clicked on that . I got a menu that had nouns , verbs , conjunctions , and absolutely everything about sentence structure ... only it was layed out in alphabetical order ! How are you supposed to know where you need to go first if it 's in alphabetical order . There is simply nothing here that tells you how to learn.I have both French and Spanish programs by the Learning Company in their Learn To Speak series . These are excellent . So I know that a language program can be done more comprehensively . I can only hope that maybe someday they will make a Gaelic language program.So , if all the Transparent Language programs are like this one , I suggest you stay away .
 Very complicated.Not for beginners.Would benefit intermediate or advanced learners of the Irish Gaelic language .
 Using this product , you can hear the words being spoken by native Irish speakers , and it does have some good language games -LRB- if you could type fadas that is -RRB- . Things wrong with product . 1 -RRB- You ca n't type fadas -- this makes much of the program worthless . 2 -RRB- If you are just starting out you need learn a basic vocabulary . There are no flashcards or anything to help you learn that basic vocabulary . 3 -RRB- Like most languages there are different forms of words depending on if they are a plural , if it is past tense , etc. e.g. mouse and mice , or was and were , or slow and slowly . Irish is even harder because the beginning of words change not just the endings , and this product does n't tell you why , how , or when those changes occur.This program is not great , but you can learn some Irish words and phrases , and it 's the only thing out there .
 Very complicated.Not for beginners.Would benefit intermediate or advanced learners of the Irish Gaelic language .
 This package is available in a variety of languages , and all they do is take standard phrases and show you the translations and grammatical tense for each word . You could mass produce a hundred languages in this fashion . I speak Spanish fluently and found this method flat and insipid . Nothing is fun . There is no interactive dialogue , no games other than some silly fill in the blank sentences , and no building on previous lessons . Plus nothing is interrelated . If you see that a word is a singualar possesive you should be able to see the full conjugation and rules that apply . Not that hard with modern software . Nope , you click on a menu item called grammar and get a boring list of rules and you need to find the one that is related . This is just regurgetated Windows 3.1 software with a flashy cover . I was fooled .
 While this program appears to be a great program , it actually is not user friendly . It does not include any instructions , other than how to install the discs . It does not tell you how to set up the microphone or how to use it -LRB- the program or the microphone -RRB- . When I ordered this I was very excited by the description on the box , but I was at a lost on how to operate it . As a professional opera singer , I bought this software to increase my fluency in Italian . I am very computer literate and also have taken Italian classes in the past , but felt I wasted money on this program .
 ... The software itself has not seen much action because everytime I try to use it , I get terribly bored . It is not too encompassing for a beginner . Perhaps with some knowledge of Italian the program would be of more use -LRB- ? -RRB- . The phrases that you begin with are not really relevant nor are they interesting and I find that I am still looking for that `` right '' software that will hold my hand through the basics .
 This product is not for the beginner . It has very poor basic learning information and they refer you to an extremely boring text file to learn the basic . The instructions on how to use it well non existant ! . You have to fumble around trying to use the product . They give no grammer skills at all . I would not recommend this product to anyone
 Hello , I have been speaking Italian for several years and I have lived the past two years in Rome and Milano and I RECOMMEND ANYONE WANTING TO LEARN ITALIAN TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROGRAM ... I bought this program in the states to teach my girlfriend ... what a waste of money !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want to re-emphasize what others have said in that this doesnt cover any material that teaches you how to speak italian !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was shocked at this program , as it doesnt even introduce -LRB- or contain -RRB- the conjugations for the verbs essere and avere ... as almost every other piece of instructional material on italian covers right in the beginning as its vital for italian ... and it doesnt end there as the help file contains many errors in the verb conjugations ... How can this be !!!!!!!!!!!! The video which for those that have no other way to hear italian might be good ... well , NO ! First off , the way these people speak is almost funny ... as they talk very exaggerated and I dread to think of people trying to copy this accent to speak italian as you would seem like a joke in italy ... not to mention that this video is quite old -LRB- they dont even pay with euro etc. . . -RRB- and it doesnt cover anything of the material it presents ... I laughed when I saw someone write a review with boun lavoro -LRB- Italians dont say this BTW -RRB- ... and it shows me even more how this product can only teach people improper italian !!!!!!!! And really I tried to teach my new girlfriend italian from this , and I just couldnt find anyway to begin here for her ... even the fundamental parts present very little information ... its all just thrown together ... I checked the fundamental section and the seventh word mountain -LRB- montagna -RRB- is present with a example phrasele montagne sono coperte di neve -LRB- which is translated properly to -RRB- the mountains are covered with snow ... here already it presents the passive voice of coprire , The verb `` coprire `` in this case is passive and femaleIo sono copertaTu sei copertaEgli &egrave; copertaNoi siamo coperteVoi siete coperteLORO SONO COPERTEcheck the software for why the passive voice is here in this manner anywhere in this program and you will be left out to dry , yet they quiz you on this later in the exercises like the crosswordsle montange sono ******** di nevegod this is just terrible to think that peole are memorizing the word coperte -LRB- covered -RRB- here already in the beginning without the knowledge of how or why it is ... and they will never learn from this program either as its not in here !!!!!!! This software as a way to learn its somewhat criminal to me !!!!!!!! THIS IS MORE THAN CRAP ... I CANT SEE HOW ANYWAY CAN LEARN PROPER ITALIAN WITH THIS ... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 This computer program looks as though some random guy just through a whole bunch of italian words on the software , got a woman 's voice on there , added ... fonts/sounds , and through in a box with a cover i am sure cost more than the program ! Getting a book would be better , but I have to give some credit for the few vocab . words I have learned , otherwise , this program is put into two words ! ...
 The version 8 is not supported for Windows Vista . So for me , it was worthless . I gave it to a friend .
 I must say that I ca n't suggest this software if you are looking to supplement a regular Russian language course . I bought Learn Russian Now ! thinking that its record/playback features would help me with my accent , and that the dictionary would help me translate readings for class . Unfortunately , it did n't have a dictionary that looked up Russian to English efficiently , so it was impossible to pick a word from a homework assignment and find its meaning/pronunciation -- you can only look up/hear words in the programs dialogs . Also , the playback feature would say my accent was perfect at times that my -LRB- human -RRB- tutor would cringe . If you do n't have access to a real life person , this may be the next best thing to teach you Russian . However , if you are trying to find something to help you out with a class , a regular old dictionary might be a better investment .
 The CD was outdated and did n't work with my operating system . The case was cracked . I sent it back , am waiting for a refund
 Crashes regularly on Windows 2000 . Does not have a module with the sounds of the alphabet , which makes it hard to get started . Overall , just lacks organization.It will probably turn out to be a good supplement to another program , but by itself , is not enough to get started learning Russian .
 An earlier version of this program came bundled with my scanner ; after seeing its potential , I purchased the upgraded PageKeeper Pro 3.0 . The software has tremendous potential as a consumer-oriented visual document management tool . I have experienced a number of problems and frustrations with it , though , and am waiting hopefully for further upgrading.First , the program seems to run agonizingly slowly . I can accept one to three minutes of processing time when a document is scanned , particularly with large , true color images . However , forty-five seconds is too long to wait just to reach the screen where you type in the name of the document to be scanned . And that 's after waiting another minute for the program to open and load . You ca n't leave it running in the background because it hogs resources.Second , I could n't get a lot of the features to work at all . The search feature -LRB- PageKeeper Find -RRB- is useless ; it failed to detect the existence of images and documents whose thumbnails I was looking at as it searched , and failed to exclude dozens of similar-but-not-identical documents when it did find something . Likewise , I was unable to get Smart Folders to work at all ; documents scanned into the default folder remained there without being `` automatically moved '' into the appropriate `` Smart '' subfolder.Third , the links between the virtual filing system and the physical filing system are easily broken . Once that happens , you have to remove the thumbnail from the virtual filing system -- wherever it occurs -- and then reprocess it.Fourth , I wish the program allowed you to maintain documents physically on a CD-ROM ; it does n't permit that , so unless you have unlimited hard disk space for the storage of large numbers of huge image files , you have to transfer them all back onto the hard disk and wait for them to be processed again.Despite all of that , I am still struggling to use the program and waiting hopefully for an upgrade . The virtual filing system seems like a good idea , because it allows you to organize documents and view their thumbnails easily . It 's also great for storage of images of documents that you want to throw out .
 Very difficult to use . The program trys to do too much and as a result it does n't do any of its functions well . Very user-unfriendly . Does not allow enough bar-lines per stave -LRB- only four -RRB- .
 It probably is n't worth buying . There are two many options . The program dos n't let you put an eighth note right after a sixteenth note or a quarter note right after an eighth note and so on . Ties are difficult to put in . It 's not so bad but it still is n't worth buying .
 MUSIC WRITE 2000 STANDARD/PROFESSIONAL VERSION = A WASTE OF MONEY !!!! IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT COMPOSING/ARRANGING MUSIC - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !

 This product is no longer being supported by Symantec . It is available as a free download at their site as it has been discontinued . Once again , there is no support for this product .
 TextBridge Pro Millennium came highly recommended . However , there 's a major glitch in the software and the company does n't know when it will be corrected . Look elsewhere for another product until some long-awaited future date .
 I read all the other reviews on Amazon , and I bought this software anyway . What a mistake . I had installation problems as well -LRB- running Windows 2000 Professional and Office 2000 Premium -RRB- . I kept getting some sort of registry error , and each time I got the error I was told to reboot my machine -LRB- which is only 2 months old -RRB- . However , when I was finally able to get the software to work -LRB- which was n't long because it kept crashing -RRB- , I discovered that the accuracy stinks . There is NO way this software is `` over 99 % accurate '' as it advertised . I have a limited edition version of OmniPage 7.0 that came with another scanner that is more accurate than this software . And , do n't think that what I was scanning was complicated . It was black and white , plain vanilla text on clean paper . Do n't make the same mistake I did in buying this software . You 'll regret it . ...
 This software is majorly messed up . When it works it does what it says , but it 's a major pain to get it to work . It 's constantly giving me errors and refusing to scan . This was the worst software purchase I 've ever made . It does n't even deserve the one star minimum .
 This product is completely worthless . I am pretty good w / computer hard/software but I wasted far too much time trying to get this program to work decently . The writers of this program must have dropped acid while they were writing the code for TextBridge ... and I trusted the Xerox name . Shame on me !
 TextBridge Pro Millennium was a big disapointment . First of all it was the installation phase , it seems that when it reaches the part where it goes to add TextBridge menu to Word 2000 , it fails and produces an error , then exits setup . Second , There 's a major glitch in the software and I do n't think the company is able to resolve it . I have been communicating with them for months with no solution . Third , everytime you contact/email customer support , you get a different person handling your problem -LRB- it is not like your file/problem is assigned to one person -RRB- . Fourth , their online help or support material relates to an older version . My advise
 Sounds like a great CD I wish I could get it to work with my windows vista operating system . Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ?
 C++ Builder is a pretty product . Within few minutes , you can finalize your IDE drag and dropping . Within few hours you can finish a medium sized application and even enterprise using its very powerful VCL -LRB- MFC 's counterpart -RRB- . Another major plus , it complies to C++ Standard . In addition , the packaged CodeGuard makes debugging memory bugs -LRB- C/C + + programmers nightmare -RRB- a pleasure . Compared to VC6 , this really is a gold.Why just 2 stars ? Compared to VC6 it has three major disadvantages that made me switch back to VC6.First is performance optimization . For some reasons , code produced by C++ Builder is larger than VC6 . I once developed an app simpler than a competitor 's . However , my app is still larger ! So I had to do it again in VC6 . I have also observed that my app written in VC6 runs faster and consumes less memory.Second Borland 's VCL is written in C++ but rather in Borland 's proprietary language Delphi . That means in order to examine the library 's code , you have to learn another language . This also introduces some quirks you have to live by . For instance , a class property , say `` Caption '' , does not necessary mean a variable , but rather a function that is made to look like a variable through language extensions . This means you ca n't be sure what does '' & Caption ; '' means unless you check the helpfile.Third , VCL is not as good in low level . For instance you are force to use your main application thread for all access to VCL objects , which include WIN32 controls . Also , you ca n't flush the message stack . Things you can do easily with MFC
 I got this program because I spend a lot of time traveling by car and I use it mostly for directions and it does an adequate job of that . -LRB- I have n't got lost yet ! -RRB- I guess I could probably have used Mapquest or something similar , but it was handier to be able to do what I wanted without being on-line . I do agree with other reviews though that heavy duty stuff may be best left to something else.In short , this is an ok program .
 I travel 80 % of the time for my job . MapPoint 2001 gives me the ability to get directions offline . The software advertise NMEA 0183 version 2.0 use on GPS units . Microsoft gives an address and the company said that it has no idial why Microsoft is directing people to there website . The software package would be worth it if it was truly compatiable with GPS units that can be attached to laptops .
 Although purchased item was delivered earlier than estimated , the product arrived with damage . Art cover was broken and squash down because Seller was not capable to pack the item in a box but rather shipped it in an envelop . Very disappointing - especially since this product could be rated as soon to be rare ! Comic is great !
 This version was for Mac OS 9 -LRB- also called Mac Classic -RRB- . Classic support was dropped from OS X years ago when Apple went to the Intel processor line , so you can not run this software on the newer Macs .
 DO NOT ORDER I ORDERED THE REFRIGERATOR AND HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT THEY SENT A PACKAGE TO THE POST OFFICE THAT WAS AN OLD VINYL RECORD SOME TRICK !!! I DO NOT KNOW HOW AMAZON ALLOWS THIS I SHOULD HAVE SUED !!!
 Overall , StampManage is a reasonably good application for keeping an inventory of your stamp collection . It is fairly easy , if a little tedious , to enter your stamps and provides a number of canned reports . There are some annoying quirks however . It does not provide a very comprehensive list of stamp types in its drop down menu . For example , plate number singles , one of my specialties , is not included . You can type it in , but have to do this for each stamp . There is no way to add to the table . There is no way to import data from another application , even other commercial ones which export data in comma delimited formats . There is no undo function , which can be disastrous . Because of some bugginess in the program it is easy for something to go wrong that ca n't be undone without restoring a backup . For example , when trying to enter a range of stamps into a collection by using the normal Windows highlight/shift-click method , it sometimes will select EVERY item previous to the last one in the intended range . Not good if you do n't notice . Such as the time it entered about a thousand unintended stamps into my collection . So , I end up doing constant backups . Some of the canned reports are odd , making me think that whoever designed them is not a collector . For example , one `` standard '' report seems to print the stamp data in random order , which makes it pretty useless for any purpose.The worst of it though , is the lack of technical support . They do not respond to repeated emails . They have a technical support forum , but due to what seems to be a bug , I have never been able to get authorized to post to the forum.I 'll probably keep using the software unless or until I can find something else that suits my needs and allows me to import the data I 've entered into StampManage . But overall , it 's been a rather disappointing experience .
 This program could be great if you could get a hold of someone at technical support to help you . Downloaded the program and none of the stamp images appeared . Have tried unistalling and re-installing at least 7 times . Product manual is not helpful and hardly has any information on installing or trouble shooting .
 I bought their 2009 software and then bought the 2011 update . When it failed to load I emailed them with the details . After two weeks of emailing and getting no reply I threatened their third party seller . They kept sending me the same software that would n't install . I finally went to PayPal and got my money back . Now the original software does n't work and wo n't load on my new computer . Forget support . There is none . I tossed it in the garbage . Buyer beware !!!
 I purchased this software after useing it for 3 weeks . It was the best Application for Stamp Collecting that I had ever used . Then I Paid for it and then the Problems began . # 1 the Product key they sent me did n't work and had to e-mail them . # 2 I got a new Code and it Did n't work and I tried to E-Mail them again . # 3 I Can Not get anyone from Liberty Street Software to return my E-Mails or My Phone Calls and We are trying to get a Refund . Besides Amazon I have found alot of people who have had the same Problems with this Company . If your reading this and still want to Purchase it , I swear you are not going to be very Happy once Installed . This Software would Be Great if it Worked , But it does n't .

 Program was written by a real bone-head . Very incomplete listing of worldwide stamps . Missing subcatagories , saves imputed entries to wrong country-just a complete & utter mess . The deeper you get into the program the more obvious the ineptitude of the creator is revealed . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !! As an UPDATE-upon the crash of my computer a few months ago I contacted Paul @ StampManager Customer Service for guidance as to re-installing the program -LRB- I originally purchased the `` download '' version-ANOTHER HUGE MISTAKE ? -RRB- . I 'm still waiting for a response . I originally purchased the program to organize my deceased father 's collection so I had back-up but needed the program . These circumstances forced me to re-purchase the DVD version of StampManger 2012 . I now can not upload my data to the newly installed version . Needless to say , my emails -LRB- no phone number & the live chat option for contact is a joke -RRB- have gone unanswered.DVD is going back-I 'm looking for a new program to catalogue our stamp collection .
 Lack of support and totally non-responsive to emails . Even made the forum webpage inaccessible so other users ca n't share their learnings . The software contains numerous errors in stamp images and descriptions , and is missing a ton of stamp images that you need to scan in on your own . Too much work to deal with . Do n't bother with it .
 I have had this software for many years , the last being the update in 2011 , when I bought the DVD version . After changing to a new computer , I found the software would not accept the activation code provided on the invoice . This opinion is given only after providing Liberty Street Stamp Manage software since December 2012 to respond . Nothing yet.Here is what I received from Great Minds the seller of the software . ****************** It appears that we filled your order in 2011 -LRB- 03/09/2011 -RRB- Are you trying to load a more recent version of StampManage , or are you using the original DVD?If you do n't have the original DVD , you may need to purchase an upgrade . An older code wo n't work with the newer version . -LSB- ... -RSB- I 'm sorry , but my company only fills the software orders . We do not have the ability to provide product support . We can only replace defective CDs , DVDs , etc.You might be able to find the answer to your question by searching the Liberty Street customer support forum :[ ... -RSB- I am also sending this email to Liberty Street Software.I am sure their support staff will be able to help you , if you do n't find the answer in the forum.Good luck ! ****************** I would recommend before purchasing this software you use the two links above and make up your own mind .
 Completely hosed the 250 GB HD on my new 20 '' iMac . Drive had to be replaced by Apple.Takes forever to boot from the CD and the fan operates at an extremely high rate . Tests seem to take forever to run and resulted in a drive that would n't mount and could n't be reformatted , S.M.A.R.T. reported the drive damaged.It is a shame as I have used the product in the past and found it to effective and reliable.Currently , I am using Prosoft 's Drive Genius which has fewer features , but seems much more reliable .
 I wish I had read these reviews before buying Techtool Pro . It seems rather like a defective product . I had a drive that would n't mount , and TTP recognized it , and acted like it could recover it , but when I switched from `` Drive '' mode to `` Volume '' mode , the drive was no longer visible to the software , so it would n't perform any tests . -LRB- In Drive mode , the problem drive passed all the hardware tests multiple times -RRB- I executed the data recovery routine -LRB- which took literally all night to run on my 40GB drive , and it found 700 + arbitrary recoverable files from the thousands I had on the drive . It did n't retain the filenames , so it was a crapshoot when recovering any of them -LRB- most were superfluous utilities and Word docs , rather than my important files -RRB- . If you have a defective drive , put your money toward a new drive , rather than this gamble .
 This program has messed up one disk -LRB- that was working perfectly -RRB- so badly that even DiskWarrior ca n't repair it . It has fixed no problems on any disk . Get DiskWarrior and hope that a better version -LRB- which is compatible with Tiger -RRB- comes along soon .
 Techtool pro 4 took 2 hours to load . Without asking it defraged my hard drive so it could be all in one block . After that I could not get my iMac Intel Core 2 Duo running OS 10.4.9 to start
 I used Techtool for years , ats been a good tool ... BUT ... Long story short , running TTP4 .01 on Tiger -LRB- OS10 .4 -RRB- turned my quite healthy disk into an UNUSABLE DISK - black screen . A horro show , with no warning whatsoever . Micromat 's current version is Techtool 4.1.1 , which may or may not be compatable - I 've totally lost faith in them . In any case , its unclear whether if you have this happen to you whether the newer version can repair it . I 'm certainly not going to risk it again . HERE 'S WHAT WORKED
 Normally a good product , but be careful , it does not work with Leopard . As of this date there is no patch or fix available from the manufacturer .
 Used Tech tool Pro 4.0.6 on my Powerbook G4 running Tiger . Ran maintenance and optimization and all of a sudden my computer shut down and would not boot up all the way . After days on the phone with Micromat technical assistance - still nothing . They told me to call Disk Savers who could recover my files for $ 1400 . Went to Apple Store , where we ran Disk Warrior - which had to rebuild my directories . -LRB- Why could n't Tech Tool do this ? -RRB- My files were saved , but now have to do a clean install of operating system , etc. . What a pain !! Warning - be careful with this product .
 I 've had Tech Tool Pro from the start . I thought it to be essential . Not so as it will not work for me with Mac 6S X 10.5 . I have a G-Drive 500 GB exterior hard drive . It is the item 4.6.1 can not deal with . I have just run a complete defrag of the G-Drive in this , my 20th or so attempt to get 4.6.1 to run . Running the medium program , as recommended for periodic maintence , it runs to Volumes , Volume Structures -LRB- for the G-Drive -RRB- to the point of Catalog File -LRB- B-Tree -RRB- number 1394362 of 2604014 and freezes . Nothing clicks . The computer must then be completely shut down then restarted in order to get the disk to eject.This completely worthless . And to think I paid an upgrade from 4.5 only to get the code more perfectly written to serve the Intel processors . My unit is still a Powerbook with G4 chip.And to think I paid for the 4.6 then the announcements about 5.0 began with explanation mmost all of us would have to pay for an entire upgrade again.If Micromat thinks we will all be sheep & buy 5.0 they have another thing coming .
 To begin with , TTP is not by any means the only game in town . It is however , going to be the the most expensive or completely useless . Micromat will be happy either way . As a current Micromat customer , I am the proud owner of an expensive utility that worked for all of two months . Leopard broke it completely . When Micromat updated their utility to be compatible with Apple 's current OS , they wanted all of us to pay them again . They simply renamed the `` update '' from `` Techtool Pro 4 '' r4 .5.3 to `` Techtool Pro 4 '' r4 .6.1 an `` upgrade '' . They 're also calling their all new `` Techtool Pro 5 '' an `` upgrade '' . Do yourself a favor , buy Diskwarrior and you 'll only have to pay for it just the one time .
 I purchased this product and it worked for a while , then leopard came out and I needed up purchase a upgrade disk for 25 bucks plus shipping , no download offered . Then after `` optimizing '' my harddrive I had to reinstall leopard because my permission were broken beyond the repair of disk utility . When I tried to contact their technical support they made me register the product , which is fine , then enter a registration number which I did n't seem to have , so no help for me . Now they 're advertising techtool 5 and despite the fact that I 'd purchased the product only one and a half months ago they told me I would have to purchase yet another upgrade to get the latest version ; so I tossed away the upgrade money for nothing.Disk utility is fine for disk maintenance , for SMART monitoring I suggest iStat pro . Do n't buy this or anything from micromat .
 I 'm not going to repeat all the problems with this product recorded elsewhere.As a Mac-ophile for 30 + years , I can say , without hyperbole , that this is by far the WORST disk utility program I have ever used . It completely trashed my 1 TB hard drive , forcing me to reinstall EVERYTHING from scratch . Older versions worked so-so , so I thought v4 would be an upgrade . It most certainly is not . If you buy this , good luck getting tech support from the nastiest customer reps in the industry.I simply can NOT recommend TTP for any living individual who owns a Mac . The sooner Micromat goes out of business , the better off the industry will be . And to think they used to make a decent product . It seems as if all their code writers have left to join other companies , because I refuse to believe anybody with any programming experience worked steadily on the creation of the monstrosity called TTP.So , if you do buy it , remember I told you so.DiskWarrior is an excellent product that performs some functions not offered by TTP and does it well.Of course , with the loss of Norton , Mac addicts are a bit at a loss for a good general disk utility repair program . TTP will not fill that void .
 This product was advertised as being suitable for my computer . It was not and I had to return it at a substantial cost to me . The seller Book Resellers was not responsible for the false ad , but either Amazon or the manufacturer
 After you use the program 's CD as your startup , it 's difficult to get back to your regular startup . The manual says if you start from the CD by holding down the `` C '' key , the startup preference is n't changed . Not true on my Mac . The manual suggests holding down the mouse button
 If you are running Mac OS Tiger on a G4 Mac , DO NOT BUY this product !!!! To use it effectively , you 'll need to create an `` e-drive '' which is a partition of your drive . Doing this in Tiger wipes out the startup file and generally messes things up . You 'll then have to get the Disk Utility that came with your system to repair the file before you can run your computer again !! And do n't count on Support to be much help . They talk nice , just like this program looks nice , but they 'll just keep you on the line -LRB- your nickel ! -RRB- and accomplish little.Repeat
 First of all , this game is n't by Activision , it 's put out by Gamemill Publishing and a design company called Stellar Stone , who exclusively use Russian designers/programers -LRB- 'cause they 're cheaper -RRB- . I guess that would explain why the Union and Confederate uniforms are backwards . Yes , you read correctly , backwards ! If the Russkies could n't figure out who wore blue and who wore gray , you can pretty well figure they did n't get much else right either . So much for the historical accuracy the game claims . This game is a total rip-off .
 This game was obviously programmed by people who had little to no historical knowledge of the Civil War . The only battle out of the four with even a semblance of the historical military balance is Gettysburg . The other three , the `` Seven Days Battle , '' Chattanooga , and Chancellorsville , bear no resemblance to the actual battles in either landscape or units involved . And as other reviewers have pointed out , the `` Confederation '' wears blue uniforms and the Union grey . In addition , artillery units are so deadly in this game that no other unit can get near them . They can virtually win a battle by themselves , which was certainly not the case in the Civil War.The game also crashes quite a bit .
 There 's nothing historically accurate about any of the `` battle '' scenarios.Union Infantry always gets mauled by Confederate cavalry - no matter what the odds are against the Reb horsemen . I 've thrown several infantry brigades at one under-strength cavalry brigade , and the infantry gets anihilated -LRB- ! -RRB- . It 's very difficult to extricate a brigade that is receiving a particularly harsh mauling when you 've got several brigades fighting in close proximity to it . Determining exactly which brigade you are throwing into or out of action is hard because it 's all one big jumbled mass of soldiers - no organized battle lines or anything like that.Artillery is useless . I never quite understood how to utilize it ... . and , should you attack an artillery position , it will wipe you out before you can over-run it . It 's all really hap-hazard and there is no real control over your troops ' effectiveness.I had a little fun watching the two armies slug it out ... . and throwing everything but the kitchen sink into the pitched battles.But , all in all , it 's a lame game . Fortunately , I didn 's spend a dime on it - it was given to me as a gift .
 This game is incomprehensible . It has no help section so I ca n't run it . I have gotten far enough to see the uniforms are backwards , but I do n't how to run it or what to do next . Total ripoff . Not worth a penny . I am going to throw it away and delete it from computer.It gets one star because there are no zero stars .
 What a waste of money ! Who ever desgned this game knows very little about the civil war . The battle fields are hopelessly exagerated , it looks like the the civil war was fought in the swiss alps according to this game . I 've been to the real battlefields and they bare no resemblance to anything in this game ! The union side is in gray uniforms -LRB- HuH ? , The confederates are in blue -LRB- Say what ? -RRB- Artillery is useless and does n't move ! The computer pretty much decides when a unit will attack so you have no control past a certain point , makes it a little hard to spring an ambush . Grant was n't even in charge of the Union forces in 3 of these battles so why the name Lee vs. Grant ? Overall a very poor game in design and historical accuracy , do n't waste you money !
 I am a German collector and I collectas much PC Games as I can about the Theme : `` The Southern War of Independence `` Now I will spend no money For this game.Thank you ...
 I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased the item . Naughty on me ! The game is awful . It crashes often , has no historical accuracy and is inoperable . Do not purchase this Rusky developed joke .
 Loaded just fine ... . But that was all ... Every time I tried to use it - it crashed my computer witha fatal error ... A real waste ... . DO NOT BUY ...
 I was shipped this guide on CD to use Elements 4.0 on my MAC and when I received it , It would NOT work on my Macbook Pro laptop and i find out it would ONLY work with Windows PC 's NO WHERE IN THIS SELLERS DESCRIPTION DOES IT SAY IT WILL ONLY WORK ON PC 'S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I AM VERY DISPLEASED TO RECEIVE a product that I have NO USE AT ALL FOR !!!! C. Hendrix , Atlanta , GA
 I bought the previous 2 versions of Spysweeper with no problems , but this thing is a headache . When it comes on suddenly -LRB- there is no warning -RRB- , it completely drains the computer -LRB- and mine has a huge amount of memory -RRB- , everything fades , and whatever you are doing gets locked up . It will not shut off , either , when `` stop scan '' is clicked . To do a full sweep it takes several hours , over 6 and still sweeping , and in the meantime the computer is locked up , and you ca n't do anything else . Either the computer crashes if other programs are open , or they sit there faded and locked up . The only way to stop it is to shut off the computer . I finally had to shut off the full sweep setting and just use the quick sweep which is an option .
 I foolishly bought this product based on outside reviews I had read . I liked that it was bundled with Child Safe as I have young children.First issue - deceptive packaging !!! Although the packaging claims this product works with Vista - IT DOES NOT WORK WITH VISTA-64 ! When I contacted Webroot about this issue , I was told that Webroot has ZERO PLANS to ever make the product compatible with Vista-64 , and that if I did not want the product , just to return it.Unfortunately , I had bought this product at the same time I ordered my laptop . It took 3 months before my laptop arrived , and it was only then that I discovered that this product would not work with Vista-64 . Amazon 's customer service told me that my timetable to return the product had expired , thus I 'm stuck with a product od ZERO use.For anyone who has Vista-64 , I recoomend ESET NOD32 AntiVirus . Never heard of the product until I went to a local PC shop to find an AntiVirus package that would work with Vista-64 . At the time , ESET made the only Vista-64 AntiVirus product . The ESET product uses very little system resources , plus can be updated daily , making it very useful for any Vista system .
 I had purchased this item for my grandmother , and I 'm glad I checked it out before wrapping it up and giving it to her . DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM . Horrible graphics , unimaginative features , and overall it looks like something written for Windows 95 . Their `` high quality images '' are 320-by-240 , 256-color bitmap files , their `` movie clips '' are a slide show of pictures , and I ca n't say enough bad things about it . Had I done my research , I would have realized there is a CD version of this software , which I 'm certain is identical to the DVD version other than the `` 7 hours of audio book '' . Absolute garbage.I do n't write a lot of reviews , but I had to do this . I really hope Amazon takes back software , because there is no way I 'm keeping this POS dvd .
 I bought this product with much confidence having read about the `` fantastic tools '' available for use . I also read other customer reviews which described the `` ease and efficiency '' with which the product worked . Sadly , everything that I had hoped for was not delivered . This product holds very little power , it has very few functions that go beyond even the most basic of video editing software such as Windows MovieMaker . The `` fantastic tools '' add negligible effect to the final product , but perhpas most frustrating is the illogical organization of the editing technology . For being so expensive , this software does n't allow for even the most basic effects . The sheer let-down of this product has angered me greatly , I strongly advise prospective buyers to re-consider thier options .
 Tried to install this program on my iBook and my PC - nothing . Program loads , screen goes white , everything stalls . Also , the company that made this is out of business and no tech support is availble , so you 've been warned .
 I bought this program for my daughter for Christmas to practice math facts . It would not even load on our either computer . Could not contact company because they no longer exsisted . Bummer !
 If you are a startup e-biz I would steer clear of this offering from Macmillan . The product licensure was sold to Macmillan from its original developer `` Boomerang Software '' over two years ago and Boomerang no longer provides support for the product . Its hosting requirements are rather strict , and I found much of it complicated , particularly for the beginner . Dynamic pages were also VERY difficult to adapt from their pre-set templates . Boomerang designed this product to be used in conjunction with merchant handler `` securepay.com '' . Once you design your e-commerce site using the software , a wizard directs you to apply for a merchant account setup with securepay which costs hundreds of dollars , leaving you with little or no choice to shop around for another , less costly payment gateway . I also found several curious programming errors in the product . The instructional documentation was frought with typos and poorly printed illustrations . My advice would be to save your money , and keep shopping .
 Do n't you wish they 'd provide at least some kind of productdescription on these things . Here 's the skinny , you have to pay -LSB- website -RSB- to host your site or it 's useless . Here 's what 's written on thebox
 i dont personaly own this , but i seen it at a store in york or something ... it looks stupid , the guy at the counter said something interesting about itso that i might buy it.but i knew better . you should stay with the other playstaion playable thingys ... or Bleem .
 this product is totally useless !! i have 4 laptops and 3 computer desktops ! having win .2000 , winn.Xp , and win.Vista - all were unable to even boot up this crapy program-waist of maney !!! DO N'T BUY THIS !! THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS PROGRAM NEVER MADE IT VERY FAR !!!!!
 We were very excited to try this program out . We used the same program for our first child back in the late 90 's and it was WONDERFUL . So we purchased this updated version to work for Windows XP . To our disappointment , it wouldnt work . We try on both computers and it did not work so we had to get a refund . If it worked , it would have been a great program . Maybe the product was defective , but 4 out of 5 we ordered did not work .
 I have used Guard Dog as bundeled in McAfee Office Utilites CD-Rom , -LRB- Disc Clean Up , Defragmenting Hard Drive and etc. -RRB- if you have these same utilites on your PC -LRB- as part of Windows -RRB- then do n't by this product , just get Guard Dog , as they can cuase conflicts with existing programs and take up a lot of space -LRB- if you only have 32mb of RAM -RRB- and if PC is Y2K Compliant/Ready and you do n't need E-Mail security -LRB- only works if the persons you send mail to have the same security program -RRB- then you do n't need McAfee Office . The version of Guard Dog that is in this suite of utilitys is 2.0 . I have used with some succes but do to some problems occuring in Windows I.E. causing me to have to reload my Ops system from the Mfg.Restore CD I have had to reinstall Guard Dog , because even when not reformating the hard drive I loose parts or all of the program . I have had Inavlid Page fault happen in Internet Explorer after an Illegal Operation occured when during the check up phase of Guard Dog wher you can clean up deleted programs so they ca n't be recovered , I got an Illegal Operation box on screen , I closed it out and went on with the rest of the check up and reboot of my PC , but when I went to go on the Internet after connecting I could surf do to an Invalid Page Fault occured requiring reloading of the Ops system and IE 5.0 and upgrade from MS web site . I contacted McAfee via thier web site and real time chat with a Tech ansd was sent instructions on to load Guard Dog in safe mode which I not done yet . If you have some other type of Virus Protection Program on Your PC such as Panda Anti Virus Platinum , do not select the virus protection during Setup/Interview portion the Installation process , you will save your self some trouble later on in not having to deal with program conflicts , also if you do n't want the GD Slpash Box at start up , uncheck the box for it you willsave time when you start your PC every time . Another thing to do when setting up Guard Dog is to have it do Auto Clean up when you go to shut down your PC intead of being promted to do it each time at shut down . -LRB- it will not touch BookMarked/Favorites web site cookies , unless you uncheck them in the cookies section of the program . -RRB- This program does do as it says but it does have some problems , and you can update your version by using the limited version of Oil Change that comes with it -LRB- volutary Install prompt -RRB- .
 This person is trying to trick you ... the software is obtained when you have an account on PTC University -LRB- actually this account is obtained when you work in a big company like Sony , Samsung , etc. . -RRB- So when you start your WEB training PTC allows you to use they `` Pro/Engineer Student Version '' Software , this software is free of charge -LRB- when you have the PTC University Account -RRB- . If think that this person will send you a package like showed in the photo `` is just a trick '' he/she will send you only a USB Memory with a copy of the software.Please do n't get tricked , Pro/Engineer does n't cost $ 100 Dlls ...
 I would love to give this a rating of less than one star , but Amazon.com wo n't allow it.Where to begin?It seems like PTC , losing customers to the vastly superior SolidWorks , has released a new program -LRB- WILDFIRE !!! pretty sweet name , if you 're 12 years old -RRB- . Or maybe they just dressed up their old Pro/E 2001 . They changed some colors to make it a little more hip , but unfortunately the new colors do n't contrast , making it difficult to see what the hell you 're drawing . I think pale orange on grey is a very nice color scheme , just not for a CAD program . What was wrong with white on dark blue?It still has its clunky , unintuitive interface , and it still wo n't ask if you want to save before you close it . I just accidentally opened up a window earlier this afternoon in the program . I hit the X in the corner a few times , and it stayed open . Selected File &#62; Close , and the window finally closed , along with the rest of the program . I lost about a half hour 's worth of work . My fault for not saving , but I guess I 'm just used to programs that give you the option to save before closing.They got rid of the little menu on the right hand side of the screen . That 's not really a problem for me , but maybe they should update the help file accordingly . The help file still refers to that menu from time to time . For instance , in order to change the units , you select &#34; Units &#34; from the Setup menu , but it does n't tell you how to open the setup menu . At one point while I was working , an error occurred while the program was trying to regenerate a part , and the Setup menu that I had been looking for earlier appeared . What this tells me is that they did n't rewrite the program without that menu , they just left the code in and suppressed it . That 's probably the best example of why this is a terrible program . They did n't spend any time trying to make it better . They just tried to make it appear more like SolidWorks.I also do n't know how to make holes . Pro/E 2001 had a great way to make and array holes in a part . From what I understand , people in Industry also have not been able to figure it out . They do what I do , and make a circular cut . What a waste of time compared to the way it used to be.I tried to email PTC to tell them all these problems , but you ca n't contact them unless you 're registered on the site . As far as I can tell , there 's no way to register . That 's why I came here.Don ' t buy this program . It 's horrendous . You are much better off with SolidWorks . I 'm graduating college this spring , and when I do I 'll miss just about everything about this school . With one huge exception . Pro/E Wildfire.Oh , and if you 're running Wildfire and you open up a file that you created using Pro/E 2001 , Wildfire corrupts the file so that you ca n't open it in 2001 anymore . You 're locked into using Wildfire , so essentially you ca n't get a refund for the program once you 've used it ... unless you 're OK with losing your work .
 I purchased this software for my two year old son . Before he could even try it I had to perform a system restore because it took down my system when trying to install it . I do n't know the stores return policy but it is going back . Next time I 'll check the reviews before I purchase any software .
 But I was not impressed at all and my 2 1/2 year old son was not interested .
 My toddler gets bored with this very quickly . In my opinion he does n't seem to learn very much . He learns a lot more from books , videos and of course his mommy ! It would n't be that bad if it would not jam up everytime he hits the wrong button . It only happens about every 2 minutes ... lol . Anyways very frustrating and not worth the price .
 This program was not compatible with my computer -LRB- Windows xp -RRB- , nor my laptop -LRB- Windows Vista -RRB- . I should have read the details more carefully or contacted the seller before purchasing . The program I was looking for had the same name , but was a slightly different version . It was not the seller 's fault , so I did n't return it .
 Had a quick delivery . Was not the program I thought it was but that 's okay . Excellent service ... thanks
 This software will not run on windows XP !! I even tried the Windows Compatability Wizard to no avail . Do not buy it unless you have an older system .
 I updated my Garmin Nuvi which had a 2008 NA map using the SD card version , no problems loading . However , I was disappointed to find this map has marginal updates . My home address in a subdivision that is 5 + years old is still not available on the map . Mapquest , Google , even Tomtom all have my street address but not Garmin.Likewise , points of interest that have been around 1 to 2 years were not always found . Again , I checked a 2010 Tomtom GPS and it had the hotels , restaurants I was looking for . With the price of GPS ' dropping fast and Garmins lack of most current updates , I probably avoid buying updates from Garmin again .
 There are better ways to get this map . I would not buy it . This map is just not worth the $ 60 dollars or so I think I paid for it . Like I said I think Garmin has been eating too much big dog cat food . They have gotten too fat off there customers . The very customers who paid for the GPS R&D .
 Advertising was great , that 's what prompted us to purchase it.But what they do n't tell you is that there are no instructions , this SD Card is not user friendly . We were expecting something totally different , something that would surpass a regular paper map . That 's not the case with this . This will probably fit the use for some people , but not us . Way to complicated to use while driving , even if you have a co-pilot . Glad we did n't toss out the paper map .
 I 'm sure this item performs admirably . BUT BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING . Amazon 's website can be misleading if you do n't read carefully . I accidentally ordered the item in the wrong format ... one incompatible with my GPS unit . Amazon 's website implied that it was compatible ; my fault ... I did n't read carefully enough ! I was unsuccessful trying to get satisfaction from the vendor so I am out $ 84 ; a bitter pill for retired fella to swallow . I have yet to try Amazon 's Money Back Guarantee ... but I will try it and I hope to recoup some of my loss .
 The item I received was a bootlegged copy of Garmin City Navigator North America NT -LRB- microSD Card -RRB- . If I wanted a bootlegged copy I would have ordered it off of ebay not amazon .
 I THOUGHT THIS WAS GON NA BE SOMETHING REAL SPECIAL BUT IT TURNED OUT TO NOT REALLY WORTH IT , EVEN THO IT DID N'T COST MUCH , I KINDA WISH I COULD HAVE VIEWED IT BEFORE BUYING IT , BUT OH WELL . IT 'LL GO IN MY BEATLE COLLECTION .
 This is a very Unclear step by step cd/cds . It will tell you how to use code but does not tell you what they are . The cd labels are very cheap . No disk 1 or disk to Just disks with labels.Instructions are enough to go to sleep withI would not recommend this product due to the unrealistic nature of the teaching , if you would like to call it that .
 Mastering PHP 5.0 -LRB- 5 Disc Value Pack -RRB- is the worst buy of my life . I thought this was the worst setup and e-learning course I have ever had . I have taken over 6 e-learning classes so I know what I 'm talking about ! 1 star !
 Although description clearly states this Mighty Math Cosmic Geometry version is for Windows XP , IT IS NOT . It is an old software version for Windows 95/98 or Windows 3.1 !!!
 My 5-year-old son plays this game in kindergarten , and he asked me to buy one for home too . The game itself is fun for him , but we have had a lot of trouble with its functioning on our computers . I have a the new Mac OS , and my husband 's PC is a few years old ... The game does not work at all on my computer , and shuts down frequently on his . I think MMH needs an update for newer operating systems !
 Do n't buy Vista -- any version , yet . MS released it WAY too early . Some examples why : * Too many hardware drivers not yet available , i.e. , Creative Audigy sound cards ; Nvidia graphics cards , and Linksys wireless network components , just to mention a few . When I contacted product manufacturers , I sensed a ho-hum attitude . Moreover , some peripherals are totally incompatible . Example
 I purchased this card for my Nuvy 265WT in hopes that it would save me from having to rent a GPS when in Germany . The map data is poor and directions are pitiful . Here 's my example : I flew into Frankfurt , rented a car and proceeded to `` navigate '' to Landstuhl , which is near Kaiserslautern . All major autobahns . From the get-go , the map data could n't even navigate from the Airport to the first major highway . In frankfurt , you must drive on a couple small access roads before getting to the major freeways . The GPS simply stated `` drive to the displayed route '' . I 'm so lucky I printed out a paper copy of the maps , or I would have been lost or possible gotten into an accident . Once I made it to the first autobahn -LRB- A67 -RRB- , the map would n't even place me on the highway . . in fact many times , it displayed
 Does n't work on a 64bit system and I do n't believe it will work on a 32 bit but I have n't tried it on my 32 bit machine .
 This software is really dated . Finally got it to work on Windows 7 but the graphics and displays are really bad .
 My daughter loved Orly on her old Windows 98 computer , but when we upgraded her to to a new computer using XP , the old program would n't work . So , I was so pleased to find a version that was advertised as XP compatible . The only problem -- IT WAS N'T . This is an even older version of Orly . I 've returned it to Amazon , but have not yet found out if I 'll be refunded the money spent . The whole thing was so disappointing for all of us . Bummer .
 I purchased this online almost 2 years ago and while it says it 's a talking dictionary for english < > slovak , it only talks in English and not Slovak . Great if your a Slovak !!!! The company promised me that I would be the first to get the revised version that talks in both directions but a recent email to them in early 2008 told me it does n't exist yet . However , they have a phrasebook that talks in both directions , which they gave me to calm me down . That was nice of them but if you are expecting to learn Slovak with this product , it 's not going to help .
 I purchased this for my 4 year old son after reading on the box that it 's compatible with Windows XP . My son picked it out himself and was very excited to get home and play it . He enjoyed the games very much , but my husband became so irritated having to fix the computer every time these games screwed it up that he banned them from the computer . I no longer had the receipt . What a waste of money . I even tried running them as compatible by changing the settings ... Windows XP was n't even LISTED . But they listed it on the box ?! Thanks a lot , Disney , for letting me and my son down horribly . I am now very leary when it comes to buying software from them .
 This game is okay as games go . It is a little advanced for my 3yo to play alone . We also had lots of trouble installing it . I finally learned that with these types of programs on XP I have to just run the play.exe file . There is not a lot of variety in the activities , but the pictures are cute , and My 3yo can answer most of the activities and we can play the game together until she learns better mouse skills .
 Both programs lack any variation within the games . There is one task and one way to do it . There is far too much explanation for each game on the Winnie the Pooh game . My grandson who will spent hours , if allowed , on the computer was bored in minutes .
 I ordered this item and the item that I was sent did not work on Mac OS X . An earlier version of the software that only runs on Mac OS9 and earlier was sent . Considering that there is a version of this software that runs natively on OSX , the seller should remove OS X from the description and state the correct information .
 Dont buy this . The product does not work . I guess that is the reason it is so cheap . Would cost more to ship it back .
 This product works only with my computer and not in any of my DVD players and moreso , it is very difficult to even set-up and you have to go thru a time-wasting registration process . I trashed it . I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT AT-ALL to anyone . There is better out there , that works with both computer or DVD players and requires no registration .
 I made the mistake of ordering this product along with a new Garmin Etrex Vista a week before a UK trip . Garmin does not sell it any more . It 's a WINDOWS 95 , 98 , NT 4.0 product . Not even NT 4.1 , not less Windows 2000 or XP . The packaging mentions only GPSes that Garmin used to sell , none that they currently sell . It 's a 1999 product , based on 1995 map data . ALL of the products with a European country name in them -LRB- France , Great Britain , etc -RRB- are OUTDATED ! DO NOT BUY ! See the Garmin site.Garmin will charge you ... plus shipping to upgrade to the current product , which Amazon does n't even appear to sell . Even this offer expires on August 31 , then you are completely stuck.In short , I trusted Amazon to know their stuff , and they cheated me . I guess they laid off their GPS guru . Very surprised and disappointed .
 Garmin do not make this any more . All the European maps have been combimed into a single CD package .

 When I ran OFFICE XP for the first time a message appeared telling me that I could run OFFICE XP only 49 more times without `` activating '' the software . Activating involves calling Microsoft and getting a code number to type on my PC . I called them and they explained that each time OFFICE XP is installed I will have to call for a new and different code number . If I replace my old PC and want to install OFFICE XP on my new one , I have to call for a code number . If I want to install it on my notebook as well as my desktop PC , I need 2 code numbers . And 2 code numbers is the limit ! After requesting 2 activation codes for the same OFFICE XP CD , you are directed to speak with someone at Microsoft who will hear your case and decide if you have a valid reason for requesting a third code ! Also note that OFFICE XP looks at your hardware each time you boot . If it detects a major change -LRB- new hard drive , new video board , etc. . . -RRB- it will disable itself and require you to call Microsoft for a new activation code . And remember , you only get two codes before you have to explain yourself.I worry that Microsoft will stop giving these codes out in three or four years telling their customers instead that OFFICE XP is no longer supported and that they should upgrade to OFFICE 2XXX if they want to continue using the product.I sent mine back to Microsoft for the 30 day money-back guarantee .
 So I decided to get the latest version of Office and here 's what I found : - I get too few improvements to justify the outrageous price . Everything works about the same , and there 's no single improvement that will make you much more productive or convince you that your money was well-spent . - I have to ask for Microsoft 's permission to install the software , move it to another computer when I upgrade , or reinstall the software if I have to reformat the hard drive . -LRB- And since I made the mistake of buying a computer with Windows ME , that is a real possibility . -RRB- - The system requirements seem designed to help MS 's buddies over at Intel move a whole bunch of Pentuim 4 systems that would otherwise gather dust in warehouses . Of course , if you have a lot of time on your hands , you can use your existing system and spend that time waiting for apps to load.-The software is still unstable . Sure , I 'm less likely to lose data after a crash with this version of the software , but am I the only one who thinks maybe the software should n't crash at all ? I have thought for a long time that instead of adding dozens of new features with each new release , maybe MS should do a release of Office without new features , but with all of the existing features functional.Don ' t waste your money on bug-filled software that does n't make you significantly more productive .
 It 's hard to justify the cost for the set of features it delivers . I 've waited a long time for this upgrade from Microsoft ; I expected more . If the price where more like a Windows Me upgrade , ... I 'd say it 's worth the money , but over twice as much for the standard edition upgrade , I 'd say wait as long as you can to upgrade.Perhaps Microsoft will realize it needs to add more funcationality or start offering large rebates . As much as Microsoft needs the revenue from Office , if it does n't sell as expected , Microsoft will need to do something .
 Office XP is not worth a looking at . Plain and simple . This overpriced program adds nothing really big over Office 2000 and also makes Windows 95 useless in the process . Now do n't get me started about that product activation bull . You can read an article on CNET on how much trouble that is.So the rule of thumb is this . . if you can get a copy of Office 2000 , go with it . XP is too much of a hassle , not worth an upgrade , and that activation stuff is a true invasion of privacy.One of the worst MS programs up there with Windows ME .
 I think using MS Office is like smoking ; OK , not deadly , but you do n't realize how much money you 're spending every day or year on stuff you do n't need . Put together all the money you 've spent on MS Office products in your lifetime , and it might be more than is in your 401k depending on how you did in the last couple years of the stock market.MS Office does work . Yes . Sometimes when I used it I would get the blue screen of death , sometimes not . It had its problems but we used it because we had to use it . Because everyone else used it and we had to , too.StarOffice does the same stuff , handles the same file formats , costs soooo much less money . OpenOffice.org , ditto , and free . The decision is n't really a hard one about whether MS Office is worth buying . You do n't need MS Office to make MS Office files -LRB- StarOffice opens and creates Word , Excel , and PowerPoint files -RRB- . Get StarOffice or OpenOffice.org and keep your money ; Microsoft has enough .
 Do you want to slow yoru systems down?Do you want more bugs?I upgraded this because I was looking for a better version of Outlook . I 've found the Office 95 or Office 97 suite to be more than adequate for my needs and are the best applications for speed and efficiency . I had to wipe my entire disk to get it working and reinstall my older applications to get it workig reliably again.The one feature hyped here is the way outlook can download email from WEB based HTML systems . Tht can be done with a free patch available from Microsoft for Outlook 2000 ... Microsoft creates software applications that crash your older microsoft applications and encourage you to upgrade . Installing a simple upgrade to Internet Explorer or Instant Messenger will -LSB- mess -RSB- up a beautifully running machine.My advice is do n't use MS Instant Messenger , because it forces you to upgrade or deal with a reoccuring suggestion to upgrade ... The net effect is they never really fix any software package to make it bug free . Each new version introduces new bugs and patches not fully tested , or perhaps deliberately -LSB- mess -RSB- something else up.The solution is to use software that has been tested together extensively , like Win95 and Office 95 . Win98 and Office 97 , etc.Never upgrade only one component of your OS and Office Applications or you will be sorry.One final point ...
 Coming from Office 97 , I was initially impressed with some of the features of Word and Excel that fixed some of the problems , added some of the features that I wished for in 97 . Words can not express my reaction when I got another computer for my one man office and called Microsoft on how to network the program to both computers . Not only could I not do THAT , I ca n't install the software on the other computer AT ALL . I was told that the program is installable on one desktop and one laptop . Those that work in small offices but have more than one computer or who want to be able to take work home and have a desktop instead of a laptop are out of luck.They do not state this out front so BE WARNED ...
 I installed this product on my Dell computer . It did not try to register itself , but I got the message that installation was complete . I can not access Word , Excel or PowerPoint . I was not able to uninstall it completely . Windows 98 and Explorer are hardly working . I can not access my Office 97 or even uninstall it and reinstall . Dell Computer is of absolutely no help.Office XP is dangerous garbage .
 It is an ok product for a very remidial user . I thought it would be a little more informative . Good for the price .
 My son is 6 years old and he hated the game . He played it for an hour and decided it was boring and not worth playing anymore .
 My Grandson , age 6 , did n't like the load time , nor the grapics , and the slow loading and game resonse.Beware this game claims to use 120 megabytes of your harddrive ... That is just to load the game . After you play it a couple times -LRB- 5x for my spawn -RRB- it creeps up exponentially ! I removed it when it hit 5,419 MB . That 's 5 gigabytes out of my 13 gig harddrive . Most games average 500 mb -LRB- ie spongebob , harry potter , etc. . I could fit 11 of those games on this computer . The graphics are sickly compared to tying up resources .
 We purchased this game for our children and tried to install this on our computer . Nowhere on the package was there any warning that a DVD reader was mandatory . So we tried to install the game through the CDRom and the system crashed . So we tried it again on the CD writer drive and it crashed again . So we uninstalled the game and guess what ? The entire path to both CDRoms were obliterated and the computer was useless for ANY CD rom game or application - or system restoration ! Even the computer manufacturer -LRB- HP -RRB- could n't fix the problem for me after several hours of attempted repairs . Fortunately there are tech people at my work who were able to restore the system -LRB- two hours later -RRB- so that the computer works the way before the SpyKids 3 Computer Over fiasco.Maybe the game works fine if you have the correct specifications , but we had absolutely no forewarning on this . At least Disney agreed to refund the money -LRB- the retailer wo n't -RRB- , but we are out the shipping , sales tax , and aggravation .
 If the site is telling the truth , Spy Kids 3
 i have been trying to play this game with my four year old , and it is very frustrating . erika moves oh-so-slooooooooooow , it takes forever to get her to walk across a room . then , you must do the activities in order -- if my little girl wants to `` find the kitten '' , she has to start the entire game over to do it . same for `` baking a cake '' , and all the other activities . you ca n't just click on something and do it.all in all , it 's very aggravating .
 As others have noted , the game is fun but can not be completed due to bugs . First is the `` lipmgr.play ... lip synch '' error . Also , Erica is unable to sing and therefore ca n't find the singers . We also called Tech Support and Customer Service numbers provided with the game . They only provide useless prerecorded messages that do not cover the above errors.Do NOT buy this game . Santa got it for my daughter and she is stuck with a half finished game .
 My 4 year old girl absolutely loves to play this game , but she is so frustrated , because every time it hits a specific point in the game - she designs a flag , sings to a man , the man sings back , she tries to give him flowers , and poof - it gives this error -LRB- LipMgr.play - > EzDlgNone has no loaded lip synch data ! -RRB- and closes . I tried to uninstall and reinstall . Then I exchanged it for a new disk . Same exact thing is happening with the new one . I am as frustrated as my daughter . What a disappointment . Do n't waste your money on this game that does n't work !
 My daughters -LRB- ages 3 and 5 -RRB- love this game and can mostly handle the quests/puzzles that the princess has to do however , as a parent I think they are a little mundane and I 'm not sure that I would call them educational as there are no academic puzzles at all . However , what really aggravates is that the game has fatal bugs in it that as far as I can tell , can not be worked around except by starting all over again . This happened once at the beginning where the princess got stuck in a state she could n't exit but it did not matter too much then but now that my 3 year old is near the end , -LRB- according to the cheat-sheet -RRB- she has hit another fatal limbo bug - the princess has to go around trying to find some singers ; To locate them , the princess has to sing notes to people she meets and if they reply in the correct way then she gives them some flowers so they will sing at the ball . Well , the little princess has decided to stop singing ! The interface is there , the buttons are there , the people are there and she keeps on telling us to sing notes but when you click on the note places , although the mouse pointer changes , no notes come out ! In addion , we 've come across 2 fatal bugs where if you speak to certain people , or ask the scroll to read out a certain item , you get a cryptic error message about missing elements and the whole program vanishes to the desktop!As far as I can tell there is no `` patch '' available on the web or even any kind of support site for the game , just fluffy advertising pages for the game itself . In addition , reinstalling the game completely did not help . I have the latest hardware and XP home so no there should be no excuses there.Unfortunately , as the game only ever saves the last position , there is no way to return back to a last-known-good point . So , although this game gets 4 strs for fun , it gets 1 star overall because it 's nothing more than a ticking time bomb of disappointment for your kids . Until Vivendi fix it or issue a patch AVOID !!
 I bought this game for my 5 yr old and thought that it was very hard to get to the next level . If you are thinking of buying this for your child , please think twice . The graphics are very nice and the game is in a nice setting . Just to hard to figure out for your typical Barbie lover !
 My daughter went head-over-heels for the `` Barbie in the Princess and the Pauper '' movie , so naturally , she just had to have the game for her computer . The game 's lovely graphics and professional vocals and audio effects do the movie great justice , as the player controls `` Erica , '' completing a variety of missions . The missions are stereotypical kinds of things that little girls go crazy for , such as growing flowers , decorating the castle , baking and decorating cakes , and so forth . There are a few more non-stereotypical missions , too , but they 're in the minority -LRB- which is fine for my daughter , being the `` princess '' that she is -RRB- . Sadly , as with other players , she can not actually finish the game and get to the coronation finale at the end . The same bug that has plagued so many others has hit her copy as well
 As happened to Cliff J on a PC , we 've experienced the singing bug on the Mac OS9 .2 version . After successfully recruiting a singer from the town , the note singing interface stopped working , and no one can be recruited to the choir . Now my daughter is stuck at this level and is very disappointed that she ca n't see Barbie 's coronation !
 I made the mistake of ordering this product along with a new Garmin Etrex Vista a week before a UK trip . Garmin does not sell it any more . It 's a WINDOWS 95 , 98 , NT 4.0 product . Not even NT 4.1 , not less Windows 2000 or XP . The packaging mentions only GPSes that Garmin used to sell , none that they currently sell . It 's a 1999 product , based on 1995 map data . ALL of the products with a European country name in them -LRB- France , Great Britain , etc -RRB- are OUTDATED ! DO NOT BUY ! See the Garmin site.Garmin will charge you ... plus shipping to upgrade to the current product , which Amazon does n't even appear to sell . Even this offer expires on August 31 , then you are completely stuck.In short , I trusted Amazon to know their stuff , and they cheated me . I guess they laid off their GPS guru . Very surprised and disappointed .
 Garmin do not make this any more . All the European maps have been combimed into a single CD package .
 Of course , Disney puts horses and princesses into one game in hopes of selling a successful game , but this one is terrible . Only a few activities are given , which basically amount to decorating your horse and running around the show ring . The decorating part is extremely generic and is basically limited to the saddle . The `` show '' part is running around the show ring in a first-person view . A bird chirps and you hit the space bar , but the window you have to time it is huge . The princesses themselves do n't do much except annoy you in the constant tutorials . Overall , this game is a complete waste of time for someone of any age .
 Okay the only reason this game was funny was because my nephew and I could n't stop laughing at how stupid this is . How dumb Snow White sounds . I mean come on Disney what the heck ? What is this ? Its garbage and you do n't get to really do anything . Where is Belle 's horse , what about Snows , Cinderellas , and Auroras . No we get generic looking horses.No matter how horrible we make them look the princess exclaims . HOW BEAUTIFUL ! And you give the generic ugly horses stupid names . I mean come on ! Make some effort.MichellePS If you have n't taken the hint do not buy it !
 This game does n't deliver on any of the promise of its packaging . It is perhaps the simplest game I have ever seen , with almost no content whatsoever . As mentioned in another review , the only options on this game are to go to one of four areas . The activities can be completely described here :1 . Decorate a horse - you see a view of the outside of a stables with six horses standing there . You select one horse and watch it walk into the stable . Then you are presented with a side view of the horse in the stable and you select different regions of the horse ; for each region , you are given a selection of one of 8 different decorations for that region of the horse -LRB- such as 8 different colored saddles -RRB- . You select it and it appears on the horse . There are 6 regions to decorate on the horse . That 's it . It takes all of a few minutes to completel exhaust any replayability of this screen . And this is the most complex part of the whole game ! 2 . Decorate the stables - you are presented with a view of the stables and can select one of four regions to change -LRB- banner , sash , flowers , and music -RRB- . Each one has 8 choices . That 's it , you ca n't do anything else except select a couple of things .3 . Ride the track - you see a first-person view of riding the horse around a track . The horse 's head is right in front of you and blocks most of the screen . When you approach one of the four jumps on the track , a bird chirps and you are supposed to press the down arrow to jump . But this part did n't work on my computer . No matter when I pressed down , or whether I held down pressed down for the whole time or just pressed and released it - the horse would never jump . There appear to be three tracks to choose from , but I think you have to complete one track to be able to select the next , and since the horse would never jump , I could never get past the first track .4 . Trophy room - there are some books and posters that presumably would hold records of your achievements ; but because of the problems I had with step 3 , nothing ever appeared here.This is the singular worst game I have ever seen . Of course I did not play this myself , I played it with my four year old daughter . It 's only her intense love of Disney Princesses that gave this game any appeal at all . And that is probably the one singular good part of this game - there are Disney princesses that are very well animated and voice-acted at every screen of the game giving introductory instructions and saying nice and encouraging things . Those are actually well done ; but the rest of the game , is complete and utter garbage . I am going to try to get my money back for this if at all possible and would recommend that you steer clear of this game .
 Do n't give your money to Disney for the Royal Horse Show . I 'd hardly call this a game , more precise it is a vehicle to promote Disney princess characters . And even the promotion gained from this was probably a waste for them as my daughter 's interest in the limited activities wained quickly.There are only 4 options to choose from.1-decorate your horse -LRB- this is probably the most engaging feature for my daughter but she lost interest quickly as there seem to be dead end options - you are told that you can show your horse in the ring but no path to do so is ever provided -RRB- 2-decorate the royal horse ring -LRB- my daughter had no interest in this -RRB- 3-ride your horse around the ring -LRB- the view is awkward - the top of the horse 's head blocks most of the picture -RRB- 4-in the craft cottage there are the most awkward features of all -LRB- an empty scrapbook which you fill with your escapades - this never caught on with my daughter , a growth chart -LSB- what this has to do with the game I have no idea and because her computer is not hooked up to a printer the option just caused the game to hang -RSB- , a box for horse cards to collect -LSB- we are still not sure what this is -RSB- and the value of any of this is lost on me -RRB- .
 This is a very bad game because when you ride your horse all you do is jump -LRB- a bird chirps when you have to jump -RRB- boooring i should have know better to have the pictures fool me . yes they are colorfull and sound fun but trust me there not . this is just a cute game no challeng involved ! i only love the part were you pick a horse and decorate her . i am obssesed over horses i guess thats why i bought it . you should get barbie mystery ride . that is a better game . see my review for it !!! you will know its me because my name is melisa.melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa
 Barbie Fashion Show will not work with my graphics card even though my card has 32mb memory , I have directX 9 , far exceed all the system requirements and have all the latest drivers . Vivendi Universal technical support was of no help either . Beware of the system requirements for this game , even then it still may not work .
 Great reinforcement of how a girl or woman should look . Recommend looking at challenging games based on math or science . Expect better from your kids and you just may get it .
 Ever since ` Barbie ' came out -LRB- no , im not an old lady who is nagging on little brat CDs -RRB- the world has changed . GOD FORBID STIRPPER BARBIE FROM COMING OUT , THEY ALREADY GOT THE MIDGE DOLLS -LRB- AKA PRETEEN PREGNANCY BARBIE IN SOME HOUSES , EASILY PUT ON OTHER DOLLS , HEH HEH -RRB- BUT ITS GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAYS IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS , UNLESS BARBIE GOES OUT OF BUISINESS BECAUSE OF BRATZ -LRB- BRAZ ? -RRB- This world has got to stop . Barbie is the leader and mayor of the Slap Happy Blonde Mental Institution -LRB- SHBM -RRB- and this needs to be stopped . God , if only ` barbie ' -LRB- she does n't deserve cap locks -RRB- would get some real sized boobs and lose the pink , this world might actually have half a chance .
 I could not install this game . There is no technical support . All phone numbers circle around to an automated voice system . Nothing on their website . Calls to the corporate office do not help . There is no help available . I have spent 15 hours trying to install this product . Nothing works . I have 20 years in the computer business . Very Aggravating .
 This game requires DirectX 9.0 and video card that supports 3D and 32mb -LRB- not 16 as stated above -RRB- of video RAM . I 've got a Sony VAIO 2.66 ghz P4 with all the latest drivers and updates . This system tests out as optimal on all sorts of web sites for evaluating your system . However , this game will not run on this system . Unless you 've got a system specifically set up for gaming , I think theres a pretty good chance it wo n't run on your system . Do n't disappoint your little girl with this software . Before buying , install the latest DirectX from the Microsoft website , then go START &#62; Run &#62; dxdiag , then run all the tests . If you do n't pass the Direct3D 9 test , do n't buy it .
 I bought this game for my 5 year old god-daughter , and unfortunatley , it does not work on her computer . We changed the resolution and downloaded the DirectX9 .0 and even have the 32MB memory , yet it still did n't work . Make sure you read the system requirements before you buy the product so you wo n't waste your money on it .
 I am unable to provide a review since the game was so outdated it could not be downloaded and the tech support no longer existed ! The game was useless and was thrown away just like my money . I believe the seller knew the game was outdated and useless . Shame on you ! My child was very upset and disappointed . My lesson ... buyer beware of internet sales !
 I bought this game thinking it would work like all the other Barbie games , but no , I have installed and uninstalled it on my computer three times to no avail . I 'm so mad that I wasted $ 20 on something that wo n't work , even after updating our DirectX from microsoft.com . I wish I could tell you how the game was ... if it even worked ...
 My daughter greatly enjoys the game but this software has steep requirements compared to other Barbie titles . The required 32MB of video memory is no exaggeration . Even if you get the software to install and run without meeting the requirements , you will run into miscellaneous problems during the game , including invisible or missing icons and illegal operations . Even new computers are susceptible to the problems because some use an onboard video with only 4-16MB of shared memory . I did not see any demos or an eval version for this title , but that is usually your best bet before purchasing any software -LRB- especially if your daughter will use her own money -RRB- . I have been putting together PC 's for over 15 years , even before VGA was the standard , and worked in the industry for over a decade as an engineer and developer . Unless you can troubleshoot and fix DirectX issues , please listen to me when I say that you should first verify if your computer meets this game 's minimum requirements.Victor T.MCDBA , MCSE+I , CCNA , CCDA , CET
 My daughter received this present from Santa and we can not get it to work on either of our computers . One computer runs off of Windows XP and the other Windows 98 . In calling the tech . support from Vivendi , they mentioned that they never tested this game on laptop computers . I tried this on my desk top and it still did n't work ! Would love to know what kind of computers people have that this game actually works !
 Buyer Beware
 I always knew something was wrong with Mattel websites since I was about 9 , my computer sent warnings that the websites were infested with Spyware . Now that I 'm older , I understand this . -LSB- ... -RSB- '' ... When I got home I did some more research and found that the DSSAgent program was running on every computer in my house . A quick search on the Web the next day revealed that Brderbund is owned by Mattel Interactive , so I called up the company 's public relations group and asked why its software had installed this program on my computer Why was it there , and what did it do?According to Debbie Galdin , a spokeswoman for Mattel Interactive , DSSAgent is part of a service that Mattel calls `` Brodcast . '' Says Galdin

 My 3yr old daughter loves the movie Brother Bear , so I bought the game . It is definitely geared more towards older children age 5 and up . Another drawback is the fact that you have to use the keyboard to maneuver the characters instead of the mouse . Obviously it is very difficult for a 3 year old to understand to push the space bar to jump , the contol button to move sideways , and the directional buttons to move , etc. . Also , the game became stuck with 30 minutes of playing with her . I uninstalled the game and then reinstalled it and it got stuck again in the same place .
 I purchased this one because it specifically said that it was supported by the Windows 2000 platform . It is NOT ! When you select the Systems Requirements , it does not list Windows 2000 but I took the platform listing as valid.Now , I have purchased software that will not work and had to watch my girls ' faces when their daddy -LRB- a network engineer -RRB- could not make it work .
 This 2001 version should not be offered in 2011 . It is not compatible with today 's hardware , obsoleted , outdated , no longer supported . If you want a good complete and fresh SUSE linux , getOpenSUSE 11.4 Linux , 4-disks DVD Installation and Reference Set
 Before you buy any Garmin maps for your GPS unit on Amazon , I suggest that you check the Garmin site for the latest version . Amazon has many outdated versions of Garmin software for sale , including this one , which was discontinued by Garmin over 2 years ago .

 First I 'd really like to say that Microsoft Small Business is a giant step from their older version of Microsoft Money Small Business -LRB- forgive me I do n't really remember the name -RRB- . InvoicingOne of the problems SBA has with invoices is that when you enter in invoices , SBA DOES NOT warn you of duplicate invoices . It will simply record the transaction as an entirely new invoice . Another annoyance is when you enter in manual invoices . When you enter in manual/skipped invoices , instead of going to the next consecutive number it will go to the newest invoice number . So if you enter in # 1566 and # 1567 has already been posted , it will go up to # 1788 -LRB- new invoice -RRB- . I would rather SBA inform me that # 1567 has been posted instead of going to the next new invoice number . -LRB- Personal Opinion -RRB- Applying PaymentsI have to admit the 2 stars I gave to SBA is mainly for this part only . Applying payments is very easy , and applying credits to invoices is great . Unlike Quickbooks , you just approve the invoice being paid . Click on the credits button , then apply open credits . Simple as cake : -RRB- General Journal EntriesI have grown to despise general journal entries in SBA . First all entries in general journal will be totaled as a single amount . So this would mean that if you enter in two separate transactions , it will be combined and posted as a single transaction anyways.Example of GJ PostingACCT DB CRBANK 100BANK 80SALES 180As you can see I want to post the transactions as two separate transactions . Instead of posting as two transactions SBA will post as one -LRB- 180 -RRB- transaction . This might work for most people but for me it is simply unacceptable . I usually need separate transactions for our daily cash and check deposits , due to the fact that both deposits never clear on the same day.Entering in GJ journals also has another problem , you can not enter in transactions for more than one vendor/customer . So you would have to enter multiple entries for one customer . Very time consuming for me to enter so many transactions just to finish one job.PayrollI have n't tried using the payroll feature on SBA yet , and do n't really intend to . -LRB- We outsource our payroll though our CPAs . -RRB- I have finally given up on SBA after a few days of trying to get the program to work the way I 'd like it to.A few things I have found quirky about SBA .1 . SBA will load and/or record transactions painfully slow . I have my data file on my local drive , instead of my server . I am running a P4 2.0 GHz with ~ 523k RAM .2 . I have left SBA running the entire night , only to come in the morning to find out it shut itself down . I have even experienced this on program loadup as well .3 . Sometimes SBA will give you an error message , only to give you three options . Each option seems to lead you to a text box asking you input your answer to the problem . Kinda like `` Only one customer or vendor can be associated with a journal entry '' , THEN it invites the user to submit the right answer . `` Ummm . . sure , 3.2.1 ... UNINSTALL ''
 As one of Microsoft 's long time Solution Provider partners , they send us lots of software to use and test each month . We use QuickBooks 2005 for our internal accounting , and since QuickBooks had a number of flaws or idiosyncrasies , we decided to convert to the networkable Small Business Accounting . After all , its free for us!The results were disastrous . We spotted three immediate issues before giving up on this software and will wait until Microsoft fixes it , probably within a year . I 'll limit my comments to the first three problems discovered ; I suspect that if we wasted our time on this product we would find many , many more.One , we confirmed with Microsoft that you can not edit the purchase orders . Although that does n't sound like a big deal , it is . Many of our customers drop ship product , for example . The fixed POs do not offer any way to do this as the selling company 's name is inserted in the drop ship field!Two , the fundamental accounting process is to issue a PO , receive goods and then invoice the customer and expect payment . We found that you could not carry forward the received goods into an invoice , but had to manually reenter the PO line items . Another fundamental flaw something akin to buying a bicycle and it being supplied without pedals.Three , The product uses a supplied SQL database engine . If you use it in multi user mode you have to install the program on a central server , and then install the accounting software on each client PC . We found , and Microsoft acknowledged , that this can be a very complex process . It 's hard to believe that the simple single database data file that QuickBooks uses , has been `` improved '' into a complex multi-file SQL series of files that can take hours to install and attention given to transport ports . I hope that the data files never corrupt . You may spend hours and hours fixing it.On balance , this product from my point of view , has been release in late Alpha form and developed by software engineers with minimum input from accountants , and no input from users.Stay clear of this product for a while . It has promise , but that promise is broken at the moment .
 I registered for the trial version and downloaded the 106MB file . It installed fine , but when I tried to start the program , it threw an exception right after the splash screen . I submitted the report so hopefully someone can fix it.I tried this on Windows 2000 , 1GB RAM , 2.6 Ghz P4 , Office 2003 Pro.I really do n't like going back to Quickbooks Pro 2006 , but I really do n't have any choice .
 I was rather unimpressed by the Microsoft SBA , and have decided to return it to MS. It does not allow shipping weights on items !? All of the Add-ins that people on here are raving about , are far more expensive than you can get elseware if you look around . It seems that MS needs to make a commitment to this software to make it better than the rest , or it is just another MS app for MS fans . Microsoft programmers will love it , as will people with a high level of MS office integration on hand , as the import/export to excel is nice . Retailers can find better solutions if they look for them . We have decided to go with sql-ledger instead , its 20 times faster on the same machine , integrates with our website with the same amount of programming , and free for unlimited users !
 I ca n't believe Microsoft released this software in its current form . It is barely alpha stage , not even beta stage and do n't think about release-ready . Microsoft has never learned their lesson with this -LRB- I shudder to think what will happen with Vista ! -RRB- . Do n't buy a Microsoft product until at least version 2.0 . They had such an opportunity to jump in and grab market share with a killer app . Instead , they are doing Quickbooks and Peachtree a favor by putting out a product that was not well thought through . Relying on third party add-ins -LRB- $ $ -RRB- is not the answer to making flawed software application work . There is a reason that as of 1/06 this software is selling for $ 39 after rebate . You are basically providing Microsoft with the user research information that they should have done a long time ago . Integration with other MS applications with other applications -LRB- BCM , Outlook -RRB- is nowhere near what it should be . Do n't rely on the information on the box or the website in regard to bank compatibility !! Call your bank first and do n't be surprised if the bank tells you that integration is n't a reality . Maybe MS will get it right with the 2.0 version . Wait at least until then .
 I ordered the Trial version directly from Microsoft . What a horrible piece of software . It was VERY slow and the ability to customize is nil . Online help was awful . I had to `` end task '' just to close out . Stay away !
 Does not have the flexibility -LRB- espicially with forms -RRB- that QB has . It also does not have a global mark-up option . Maybe next year .
 I purchased this application , and spent two weeks getting my business set up . During this time , SBA repeatedly hung , requiring shutdown from the Program Manager . After spending 10 hours downloading updates on a dial up connection , SBA hung up the computer so badly I had to shut down with the power switch . After removing the upgraded version , and re-installing the original SBA , I discovered that SBA had converted all my company data to an incompatible version . At this point , I trashed the CD in disgust , removed SBA , and spent the afternoon bringing my old version of Peachtree Complete back up to date . Save yourself this hassle , and do n't buy SBA . It 's cheap for a reason , but not cheap enough .
 I bought this software for $ 60 AR months ago , I thought it 's a great deal comparing to Quickbook Pro . But it 's a total disapointment , it 's not user friendly in most of the cases , I had no idea how it worked . So I had to buy QuickBook Pro for $ 150 instead from Costco , therefore I end up pay more by choosing a wrong product in the begining -LRB- trying to be cheap too -RRB- . I like Microsoft products in general , but this just does n't cut it , it 's a long way to go . I had little problem using Quickbook , maybe I 've used Turbotax for years . Just my $ 0.02 .
 Though I received two free copies with some hardware , I will not be using Microsoft SBA because it 's payroll services are really bad . If you want to get payroll taxes , etc. to do your employee 's checks , you can sign up for a service , but the service is an online company for which data is EXCHANGED with SBA . Internet always required , multiple levels of passwords , what data is going out ? To avoid this you can find the tax rates yourself and use Excel to calculate payrolls and then EXCHANGE DATA with SBA . This takes about 4-5 times as much effort as Quickbooks ' automatic DOWNLOADS and , if you go with the online company , costs three times as much as does Quickbooks ' equivalent service . Too bad that SBA has this fatal flaw because I really liked the layout and feel of the program .
 Doing simple activities , and integrating this product with Outlook , is proving to be a nightmare . For instance , there is no date automatically inserted for individual service items . This means that for each date work is done for a client , you have to add the date by hand to the description field -LRB- a field that does n't have enough space to add a complete description of the work performed before the date is added -RRB- . Timer functionality ? Do n't get excited . It 's not there and the work-arounds are less than charming.I had to get the update to get SBA and Business Contact Manager to `` play nice '' -- on a brand new product . And , the `` seamless integration '' is a misnomer . Just try to update one client 's information one time -- it wo n't automatically update in the other application . So you will end up with contact information in either your business contact manager or in your accounting program that is not up-to-date , unless you hand enter it in both places.I was searching for a one-stop solution that would allow me to do a journal entry from Outlook -LRB- with the handy timer -RRB- and then zip it over to the accounting program for an itemized invoice to send to my clients . What I got was a nightmare that 's taken me hours of installations , upgrades and online research -LRB- and the purchase of and hours of study with `` Outlook 2003 Inside Out '' and `` Step-by-Step Small Microsoft Office Business Accounting 2006 '' -RRB- to determine that what was advertised `` seamless integration '' is a lie.I 'm fairly computer savvy , so saying that I 've spent hours and hours trying to get this to work , is n't a small thing.And to think ... I left Quick Books products because they were too complex for the functionality I needed . I wanted a simpler , slicker way to handle my consultation business so I could spend more time working and less time wrestling with the financial details each month.I did n't get it.I do hope that this very expensive program set of Office 2003 with BCM and SBA -LRB- which should still be called ` beta ' -RRB- will be upgraded soon to include basic functionality for the small business owner and service provider -- and I hope that MS does n't charge me all over again to access it.What a disappointment .
 I was told it was the same as Quick books ! but for a fration of the price!Theres no such thing as a good deal!The only way to get this work right is to buy the rest of the software and then im sure it would be fine but then your paying more than Quick Books . . Its only a module !
 I just hate the way MS offers a viable alternative that does not cut the mustard out of the starting gate . No wonder Gates has billions . He keeps the money for himself rather then plowing back into key launches of product with a perfect track record out the gate.From the sounds of the comments here it is not worth my time to load this junk and deal with all the hastles possible.So I will wait till this product gets the needed attention it deserves from MS.
 I had sent for this item in August , and had moved from that address . Unfortunately , the postal service did not forward my package to my new address , therefore , I am unable to give a proper review of this item .
 This is one of the worst thought out small business accounting packages because transactions can not be imported . It is useless for anyone switching from another program . Forget it .
 The `` feature '' that makes me sorry I bought Microsoft SBA is the `` Spotlight '' -- a bulleted list of text ads that appear on every major screen , and that download new content on every one of those screens , every time you open the program . These text versions of pop-ups slow the application even more than its already-glacial pace -LRB- it 's a bigger memory hog than Photoshop or Dreamweaver -RRB- . You have the option to remove this `` content '' , but on only one of the five screens where it appears . It is beyond annoying -- it 's as if you brought a box of cereal , and were forced to listen to a commercial every time you wanted to eat some of it.SBA has its good points - it does a decent job of small business accounting , and it 's pretty to look at . The print and online documentation both lack very important basics , such as how to add a logo to an invoice ; you have to go to the user community for those . But in my opinion , none of the benefits outweigh the continual , inescapable intrusion of all those ads .
 I had high hopes for Microsoft 's SBA program , however , it does not stack up to QuickBooks.Cons : - Unable to open file using a file server . For some strange reason , it requires you to have Microsoft 's SQL -LRB- database -RRB- server installed in order to have it served through a file server . This serves as a limitation because it forces you to purchase another Microsoft license . In a small business environment , a user should be able to open their books through any file server . - Clunky . Another irritating aspect is that it opens a different program window on the task bar for each task that you open . If you multi-task , you will see many icons on your task bar , instead of managing your windows within the program under the menu bar . Navigation is also clunky where it feels like Outlook . - Reports are limited . It may be that I have not figured it out yet -LRB- see above `` clunky '' -RRB- , but I 'm unable to find a way to easily customize my reports . It forces you to print detailed reconciliation reports -LRB- with many pages -RRB- , instead of a summary . - CTRL-F -LRB- Find -RRB- . How hard is it to implement CTRL-F and be able to pull up a search box ? Transactions are hard to find with SBA . As your book grows , an easily accessible search box is needed to find a check , invoice , and other transactions.Pros
 I am writing to warn unsuspecting entrepreneurs that they should avoid making the same monumentally stupid mistake that I did by purchasing this horrible , unforgiving , inflexible and extraordinarily frustrating package.I think that this `` tool '' might be salvageable if it would allow you to correct mistaken entries -LRB- like an incorrect date -RRB- , instead of making you void it out and re-enter it . And if that is n't bad enough , you can not hide the voided entries . So there they are -- a constant , glaring reminder of why you decided not to become an accountant in the first place.There is a reason that they offer a full year of free technical support -- you 'll need it . Not that it does any good ; if you ask them a question that even remotely resembles an accounting question , they politely tell you that they are not accountants and therefore can not offer accounting advice . That 's just grand . I bought this piece of software so I would n't have to pay my accountant three figures an hour to straighten out my finances . Instead I can pay him three figures an hour to show me how to use this cr * ppy software.Thank you for allowing me to vent . As I write this , my accountant just called to offer me a free trial of Quickbooks . With that , I bid adieu to Microsoft SBA . Regrets ? I have but one -- that I was forced to give this junk a minimum rating of one star.Save your money , use ledger paper -- at least you can erase your mistakes .
 I bought this because I needed a new copy of Word . Since Word is always bundled with other programs I chose this one for the price . However , I did not know there would not be a Word 2006 in the pkg . I later learned that Word did not have a new and improved version in 2006 . However , this version was Word 2002 ! What a drag ! It is older than the version I had on my system which had become defective . Now I need to buy another version .
 I got the CD in the mail in a timely fashion . When I put it into my CD drive , nothing happened . I ended up called a Mircosoft suppport line for help which cost me another $ 50 . They informed me that the CD was probably bad . I went to Circuit City , purchased a new CD and it worked fine . I spend $ 100 between Amazon and the Microsoft support line and got nothing to show for it.Would I use Amazon again ? Yes but not to purchase software .
 We bought this software for my 4 year old because he loves the rescue heroes toys . There just is n't much to this game . It is extremely limited . There are five modules and once my son had done them once that was it . It took 20 minutes . There are no additional levels and no challenges . The toys are great but I do n't recommend this software game .
 Really not worth the money ! My 4 year old loves the rescue heroes but this made him frustrated . He finished the so called training exercises quickly and was then expecting to more on to other tasks after all the praise of now being a true `` junior hero '' . he was so disappointed when he discovered that was the end of the game .
 My 3-year-old is a huge fan of Rescue Heroes so we were excited to get him this game . However , the Rescue Heroes look different -LRB- my son is scared of Billy Blazes huge eyes , -RRB- and sound different than on his videos . Also the game is very limited . I expected a different level after he completed the first , but there was nothing more ...
 My five yeay old was completely finished in about 1/2 hour , except for printing out a bunch of stuff we did n't want .
 wont insall on my computer never buy this it sucks i have a newer computer it wont load to it so waste of money
 I was trying to buy blank checks but only got a few pages of blank checks . What I apparently paid for was a CD-Rom which I did n't need and was completely useless to me . I feel that what was promised and what I got was completely different . This was a complete waste of money .
 When I first heard of the idea for this game , i thought it would be interesting . What I did n't relize is there is no `` cross-bredding '' of ships . You ca n't have a Galaxy Saucer with an Akira body with Defiant Nacelles . Also , they have four presets for each part , and not a way for you to design a totally new saucer . As aforementioned , since there is no cross bredding , you can not make a new class . And , one of the true low points of the game is , since you are an admiral , not a captian , you just send the ship out and your `` capable '' crew does the rest . No Control , no nothing .
 This game is a stinking pile of crap . The best part about this game is the name it does n't deserve - Starship Creator Deluxe . And the fun pretty much ends there . This CD features what Simon and Schuster call customisation options -LRB- an add-on disk that is a re-rendering of ships that you would n't care to see anyway -RRB- , which also wastes your time creating variations of 10 ships that are not that much different -LRB- or any more fun -RRB- than what 's already in the game . While you can supposedly interact with your customisable crew -LRB- um ... well by selecting them from a list -RRB- , and design the most heavily armed ship in starfleet -LRB- keep in mind , you choose all of this from a very limited list of parts and it is more like an interactive encyclopedia than anything creative -RRB- , your choices are controlled by a budget -LRB- which completely ignores the ST universe -RRB- . Then participate in missions with your new ship to see what it feels like to pay good money just to find out you 're an idiot for buying this game . It begins with an insult to the name `` Star Trek '' featuring a graphic display that is NOT 3D , NOT 2D , NOT REALTIME , NOT CONTROLLED , AND NOT FUN !!! I urge any and all individuals who have possession of this game to burn it at their first opportunity . On a scale of 1 to 10 , I give it a -1 . If you are a gaming masochist , then by all means , be my guest and observe what has to be the worst ST game/simulator I have ever seen . I 've downloaded free ST games that were better than this worthless piece of trash . Please heed my words , `` SAVE YOUR MONEY !!! '' I would rate this game with `` 0 '' Stars but the rating system does n't allow that . This game sucks .
 This game is BAAAAD . I gave it one star because it is somewhat entertaining building your ship , but after that what do you really do with it ? The missions are a joke , they look like a really crappy Flash website .
 Truth be told , this game is terrible . It might sound interesting to design your own star trek ships , but this game does n't the worst job . There is no action after you design your ships -- that is , you ca n't really do anything with them . To shorten this up
 Jeez , I could n't even get the pictures to show after i had created the ship . The computer lets the ship run through and see how many problems it can run into . No interaction . A few bugs , no fun . Do n't buy it guys .
 When I first heard about this I thought it would be the best ST software out there . We could make our own ships ? Create crews and even go on missions . I thought that would kick a $ $ . I had grown board of the relativley dull games that do n't let you actually eperience trek.I put it on my wish list for my birthday which was a few days after it first came out.I got it and installed it and thought it was great . two hours later I was surfing the web . It 's boring . That simple , BOOOORING . The designers came up with a great concept , but the configurations are not interesting and the mission mode is just stupid.If you have money to throw away , you could get it . It might be better with 3 more classes of ships , but not that much better .
 I bought this game thinking it would be cool , Design your own ships and take em out for a spin , Not the case ! I could do a better job using MS Paint , Major Dispointment ! Dont waste your money here , If you looking for a Star Trek game try Starfleet Command , It rocks .
 = Not the fun it claims to be!Reviewer
 I 'm 8 years old and I love Star Trek . It 's one of my favorite movies . But this game is REALLY bad . All you do is chose the crew , add onto the ship ... then sit around and watch the computer do the rest . To have any fun , I guess you have to know computers really well , and be a programer . But for me , this was a waste of -LRB- hard earned -RRB- money .
 I purchased this item for $ 10 from Comp USA . There was a problem with some of the files so when I finished installing it , my computer was a mess.I lost all my desk top icons and my computer was extremely slow to respond to anything else . It took me a while to get the program removed and I eventually ended up doing a system restore . When the screensaver came up it did look awesome . I wish I could have used it but I am not going to try and install it again .
 BUYER BEWARE !!!! I ordered this program/screensaver to give as a gift - specifically because it was supposed to be VISTA compatible -LRB- unlike other programs . -RRB- Unfortunately , the box I received -LRB- unlike the product described on line -RRB- did NOT list VISTA as one of the supported systems . As a result , I did not actually test out the program but am , instead , returning it . The same thing happened with the one other program I purchased from Amazon at the same time . I am very disappointed and must now try to find two replacement gifts very , very quickly . On a positive note , Amazon 's customer service was excellent . They are refunding my rush shipping .
 This Borland C++ 5.0 Starter Kit -LRB- actually C++ 5.02 -RRB- contains modules which were first written in 1988 to run under DOS . I tried to get it to run under NT 4.0 -LRB- which it is supposed to do -RRB- and it took my system down.After trying everything I could think of -- I do systems programming for a living - I finally resorted to the Sam 's textbook which accompanied the kit . I was much gratified to find an entry in the index for `` Borland C++ Development Suite 5.0 '' which pointed me to page 444 . Unfortunately this textbook ends on page 427 -- there is no page 444 ... Somewhere `` out there '' is a page 444 which might contain helpful information but it is n't in this book . Nevertheless a small voice inside my head did supply the appropriate information
 Feral Interactive does list that Bionicle will not work on the Core Duo / Core 2 Duo . It was a little harder to `` find '' than I had hoped . But even with 2gb Ram and 256mb Video Ram , the game is unplayable.I am sure it 's fun and works well on Power PC Mac 's .
 This product did n't seem like original packaging and I could not get it to install -LRB- only play music -RRB- even after trying on three different computer ... the replacement I purchased from the store installed just fine . You get what you pay for
 Since I do n't want Quicktime on my computer this was a waste of money . Quicktime has a habit of taking over your computer whether you want it to or not . Last JumpStart game I buy . Wish Amazon had listed Quicktime in the spec requirements .
 My new laptop would n't run this program . I think it is my fault for buying it without checking the details , but before you look at this before ordering it .
 The technical description announces that your purchase entitles you to a one-year free updates , should you be thinking you 've got a bargain ? I thought I had when I bought mine , until I realized the other side of it -- what happens after one year ? You have to pay another year 's subscription to updates , silly ! That 's what the technical description forgot to tell you . How much ? Half the price you paid for the program . `` But I have the option not to renew my subscription to updates , have n't I ? '' `` Well , you sounded like you 've made up your mind already , go ahead . `` What more ! Wait a little while , Farstone comes up with what it considers a major improvement . It wo n't be an update anymore , but an upgrade , and you pay for an entirely new program . What is consoling is that you will get one year free updates .
 Do n't buy this or anything from this company -LRB- Macware -RRB- , you will never get any support or update.They just cheat people with old version , and you ca n't get any support.We have profs about what we are saying , it 's bad and sad that some company dos work like this.Just find the original author , there you will get update and support .
 I 've worked with various Pinnacle Studio versions since last decade , and they 've all had two things in common :1 . When the program works , it 's superb .2 . The other 50 % of the time , it crashes frequently , and hard!For years , Pinnacle had designed the market 's top , novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms , but for some frustrating reason , they just ca n't seem to keep the bugs out . This verson is no exception.Lately , the competition in this market has mushroomed , and there are better alternatives available for the same price . At last , others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice ? Shop around . Google the competition . But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle .
 WORST ... SOFTWARE ... EVER ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME LIKE MYSELF AND SO MANY OTHER POOR SOULS DID ! Read the reviews , cnet also . Go to the Pinnacle Support User Forum Site -LRB- pinnaclesys dot com -RRB- and read the countless people who ca n't get it to work.This software just does n't work , end of story . You will be more upset about your time wasted than your money , buy anything but this . Render error , render error , render error ... you will have nightmares about crashes and render errors , no wait , they are real . The only person who should buy this is the smart lawyer who is going to start the class action lawsuit against Pinnacle for selling us something that is not even beta quality , it is pure crapware , try to make anything longer than 20 minutes with many transitions and it does not work , period .
 I bought this version of Studio to update my video editing capabilities . I have n't been able to complete the install yet . I have an e-mail in to support but they only work certain hours . Further , when I get to the point where I get a failure , cleaning up and starting over is virtually impossible due to some files being impossible to delete . And , the product never appears in the Add/Remove function of the control panel . Further comments will be tempered by how well the support folks address my problem .
 In 2 days it has crashed my system 20 times . Products like this should not be sold in Amazon or anywhere else . This is a fraud
 While the sound of the instruments in this product are generally very good , they are not suitable for any serious musician to use . Samples are short and the ability for a competent user to lengthen them as needed is very restricted . Then try to get support from the company !! I waited 14 days for a response to a simple question and had to threaten them with stopping payment before I got any kind of answer . Then , the answer was that they could n't help me and that they would not accept a return of the product for a refund . BUYER BEWARE !!! When I complained , all they did was send me a copy of the end-user license . I called AMEX and filed a claim against them . I 'm going back to Vienna Instruments which sound better , work better and have EXCELLENT Customer Support ! At least you can call Vienna and get a real person on the line . EastWest does n't even have a support phone number . STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT !!!
 You will be able to find demos showcasing the instruments in this library , and they will sound very good , and they really do . But this review is about telling prospective buyers what they DO N'T tell you.MOST of the instruments in this library have NOTE RANGE LIMITATIONS ! For example , their solo violin sounds awesome , but it has about a 3-octave limitation . How does that translate negatively ? I had a cadenza in my music that somehow fell short about three notes in the lower range ! When you exceed their note-range limitations , you hear silence ! I ended up having to create a separate track and selecting a similar sounding instrument -LRB- in this case a viola -RRB- to compensate for the three notes that the solo violin could not provide!I do understand why they did it this way though , and it 's to preserve the fidelity of the sampled instruments . But it is in my humble opinion that they should 've provided the full range anyway , even if they had to synthesize the remaining notes , and leave it to the judgement of the musician whether or not they would use those synthesized compensations.These note-range limitations could turn your arrangement from being simple and organized to becoming a convoluted and messy fragmented arrangement . Musicians should not be restricted in this way.Also , I found their installation documentation highly convoluted . If you think your installation will be a simple and smooth `` Insert the DVD and sit back and wait '' , think again . When you receive the package , it comes with a sheet of instructions telling you that the DVDs are OUTDATED , and that you should download the latest version from their web site . What they did n't say was that you still had to use the outdated DVDs anyway or the instrument libraries wo n't get installed . But this will be just the beginning of your ordeal . In the interest of time and space in this review , I 'm not going to enumerate all the steps you have to go through , but just be prepared for an unorthodox , convoluted process of installation.I was tempted to give this product a one-star , but the quality of their sampled instruments were excellent . I also liked how they provided different articulations for some of the key instruments like strings . For example , Violins would have a long/legato version , a staccato version , a tremolo version , an accented version , etc. . Most instruments do not come with this level of refinement , but they are very good -LRB- as long as you do not exceed the note-range limitations ! -RRB- Buy this orchestral library if you want , but you have been forewarned !
 ... says it burns DVDs on the outside of the box . But after you open the box and install the software you find it 's only data DVDs.If you want to burn video DVDs -LRB- e.g. for a DVD player -RRB- , you need UDF . This program does n't support it , and acts like there 's no such thing by not documenting it.Everything this thing does is already part of OS X -LRB- e.g. burn data DVDs , audio CDs , erase CD-RWs & create disc images -RRB- . If you teach yourself how to use the features of OS X to do the same tasks , then you 've saved $ 30 . Dragon Burn may be worth a try . It 's only $ 15 more , and it is n't a $ 100 feature-overkilled piece of software like Toast . Plus they have a trial version.This MacBurn software adds no value , I think . If you still like MacBurn , good for you. : -LRB-
 MacBurn has bugs and they provided no support direct or through their forums . Check out the MacBurn Forum on the MacXWare site for yourself . You wo n't see answers from support . You can find better shareware than this product . I received no value as I am unable to use the product .
 This product is n't nearly as good as Toast , and barely better than the burning provided by the OS for free.If you want to do more than what the OS provides , spend the extra $ 50 for Toast .
 Do n't buy this or anything from this company -LRB- Macware -RRB- , you will never get any support or update.They just cheat people with old version , and you ca n't get any support.We have profs about what we are saying , it 's bad and sad that some company dos work like this.Just find the original author , there you will get update and support .
 I have 10.5 plus have downloaded the patch to make it 10.6 and it still does n't work properly . I have had nothing but problems with this software . I find it disturbing that I paid 100 plus dollars for this software and I 've had nothing but problems with it . Capturing the video was no problem . Editing it was slow and it kept locking up or shutting down completely . after spending hours trying to get the video editied I finally was able to complete an abridged version of the video . I made a movie and now it keeps locking up . I 'll burn the movie and put it in my DVD and it 'll lock up somewhere along the way so I burn another one and it locks up somewhere else when playing . I have burned about 12 DVD 's and not one has worked from beginning to end without problems . The tech support is useless . My advice is to stay away from this video editing software . I have bought a competitor 's software and now will start the entire process over .
 Because you will undoubtedly crash . Hard.If you like wasting time , acid stomach , and throwing money away , then go right ahead and pick this little baby up . But if you 're trying to actually make videos with your computer , then avoid Pinnacle at all costs.Pinnacle Studio is appealing in its scope of features . This software would be a very decent product if it worked as advertised . But its inordinate amount of crashes have given the Pinnacle name a reputation it will likely suffer for years to come . The folks at Pinnacle have earned a reputation as producers of the world 's most bug-laden video authoring software.There are at least five better alternatives , at equally affordable prices . Avoid Pinnacle at all costs .
 I 've worked with various Pinnacle Studio versions since last decade , and they 've all had two things in common :1 . When the program works , it 's superb .2 .

 If you are upgrading from an earlier version to this one I would suggest NOT . Unless you want to purchase the transitions that you had in the previous version that will not work in the new version.I purchased Studio 9 before then decided I 'd upgrade to Version 10 . After nearly completing my first production , I realized one of my transitions folders was missing -LRB- one that I had intended to use -RRB- . I contacted Pinnacle Support , it is like they do n't read what I am saying . I sent screen shots as well , but they continued to tell me the same thing over and over again . Telling me what to do to make the transitions work . I am pretty computer savvy , so this is not OE -LRB- operator error -RRB- . After numerous emails I contacted their live chat support , where they tell me that some transitions I had in 9 will not work in 10 . Funny that the other emails were telling me how to make it work and nothing about them not working . I feel like I downgraded , I spent $ 90 for a downgrade to something that does n't have the same things that my previous version has . I would suggest you do not purchase this , much less anything from Pinnacle , unless you know 100 % that you will never need to talk to their customer service for anything.So I can purchase the effects that I had if I want them to work in my new software . That sounds right ... NOT .
 I owned Studio 8 which was loaded with bugs and annoying glitches and instead of supporting it they simply dropped version 8 and began selling version 9 . Thinking they might have the bugs worked out for v10 .5 -LRB- now up to 10.7 -RRB- , I purchased it . Not only is it a piece of cr * p , but it 's a resource hog as well ... unless you have a dedicated graphics card and 1g + ram , you 'll be subject to endless delays every time you click . Would suggest trying another brand .
 I 've been using this program at work for over a year . It is a extremely frustrating program to use as it always crashes , is very buggy and all the extras are locked . I 've had numerous gray hairs and heartache from using this program . I would n't even use it if it was free . Stay away from it at all costs !
 I have had the same problems as a lot of other posts . I bought a cheaper limited version . That just adds to my problems . I have an older version of Roxio that was simple but at least it worked . I upgraded to a more `` modern '' version to have more features and creativity.What I found is similar to other posts . It tends to crash a lot . It is not intuitive and really bogs down my computer . My computer is relatively new with 1 GB of ram and a video card but it still is painfully slow . I have given up and am looking at other options at this point .

 Actually - > 0 Stars ! - I bought this item hoping to transfer all my old VHS tapes to DVD , I could not even get it to load on my computer and it 's NEW ! It froze up many many times . I tried customer service ... . quite a joke , they asked if my product was registered ... . What !? I could not even get that far . So much for the help , no more of my email 's were answered : -LRB- The only reason I bought this item was because I knew how to use studio 8 -LRB- which will not work for DVD + burners -RRB- already , so I hoped I would be one of the lucky one 's it worked for ... very stupid of me . I just bought Adobe and it works beautiful but I spent a LOT more than I wanted too after 2 products .
 Pinnacle is known to have crappy products . All of the studio products are glitchy , and have countless bugs . just type in pinnacle studio 10.5 in google . You will see that almost every one who bought this piece of crap hates it . It made me so frustrated I bought a new computer , more ram , a video card . all useless in pinnacle . Get Adobe premiere elements 3 , not this .
 I knew about all the warts going into the purchase . I had worked with a friend on his version 9 . He said there was a long learning curve to really learn how to use it to its fullest capability . I bought it because it was a cheap way to get into converting my 8mm camcorder movies to DVD . Their USB capture device -LRB- MovieBox , sold separately -RRB- takes my 2-hour 8mm tape -LRB- VHS or any other analog input using composite/RCA jack connections -RRB- and loads it up to a 5 gb file . -LRB- approximate size ; you can see this will quickly fill up your hard drive . -RRB- The software will take that file and parse it into scenes -LRB- VERY slow -RRB- or you can tell it to create chapters every xxx seconds -LRB- VERY FAST -RRB- . The MovieBox hardware and software is flawless -LRB- I have version 8 -RRB- . I 've never had a problem with it . Set it , start it , go to bed or cut the grass and it does its thing . -LRB- Your camcorder will be on ` play ' so a two hour movie takes 2 hours to import . -RRB- After the import you use Pinnacle Studio 10 to create the DVD movie.Pinnacle Studio is a completely different animal from MovieBox . I do n't mind not knowing how to use all the nice features , but this product is really a nightmare . I started with 512 meg of memory and an 80 gig hard drive . The program would thrash and thrash , hard drive lit up constantly . I learned to let it take the input file and work on it overnight . Once it had ` processed ' it , the response was better . Later on I upgraded to 2.5 gig of memory . It did n't help much . It 's doing more in memory than before , but the end result is about the same . It has to process the input file for quite some time before your response time improves.It crashes or freezes the computer without warning . Even with XP you have to reboot to reclaim memory . When the software is restarted it asks if you want to continue , using the backup it takes automatically . It creates a rendering file , that unless you specifically tell it to start from scratch , will continue to use it . The result is that it will either crash or something else will happen , like the sound will be out of sync with the video . The free upgrade to 10.7 stabilizes the product , but if you are running Internet Explorer 7 you will have to download a small patch before the install will run to completion . There are several 3rd party software programs that get installed along with the Pinnacle product . Some are needed and some are just ` teasers ' that you need to upgrade to if you want to remove a visible logo.During rendering the software liberally sprinkles files all over your hard drive . Some of this can be reclaimed using the built in ` purge ' process , but some of the files are buried deep inside the shared profile folder . Your hard drive begins to ` shrink ' . You can be working and then suddenly the software will just freeze . Sometimes it will be doing something for up to 10 minutes , then go on like nothing happened . Other times I 've let it sit for over an hour and it is still frozen . I use Task Manager and kill it , reboot the PC and restart Pinnacle Studio . It asks me if I want to continue what I was doing and I may go the rest of the day without any problems.The good news is that this software is capable of making some truely remarkable DVDs . You can move chapters around , add transitions and titles , menus and many many other special effects . The more you work with it the more you learn and the better it gets . I have created movies with multiple menus -LRB- multiple travel shows with chapter selection menus etc. . You can add voice over commentary , add music , create animated menus and many other things . There is a generous supply of all types of chapter transitions and menus.I have learned to deal with the frustrations and how to avoid some of the problems . I 'd like for them to fix all of these irritations . If they did , I think they would corner the market . They really need to get their hands around the quality control issue .1 star for a poor product , 1 star for its potential to be a great one . Do n't buy this unless you need a computer hobby and have a LOT of patience .
 This software took forever to download and once I got it installed , it was n't two minutes before it starting locking up my computer . Some additional surprises you get once inside the product box and program ; you find in the license agreement that you must pay extra to use some of the more special features although the features are already in the program , but not usable until you pay additional monies . Another ugly surprise is you only get one free customer support phone call but you still have to pay the long distance minutes . You need more help ? It 'll cost you long distance plus additional $ 25.00 charge per call . I would n't call that customer support , I 'd call it customer gouge . Do n't think the additional money is worth the initial investment . Will go elsewhere for a better product .
 I tried the silver edition I paid $ 350 for . I was not impressed with the quality of the strings that was on the level of a typical string synthesizer . When I went to sell the software , the company disallowed resale and transference.Don ' t believe a word they right about how true this software is to real instruments . You instantly can know they 're lying because nothing compares to the real thing . You ca n't compare these kind of programs to REAL instruments , only to other similar fake instrument programs .
 What EastWest will not tell you , and you have to look for on their site in small print , is the dongle called `` iLok '' . They make you buy it for about $ 40 , or your software wont work.I have not gotten around to actually review the software for quality - got the Silver version for Christmas.It just bugs me that they can not tell you about the `` iLok '' . Other software , like Cubase , include their dongle . So why ca n't EastWest manage that ? Sad that they have to treat their customers like that.And what the other reviewer said about not being able to sell your songs if you like ? That just sucks big time too . They all go too far with the copyright laws . What ever happened to the times , when you could just record your own music on your instrument and sell it?Shame on you , EastWest !
 As a graphic designer , I bought this software for use with my freelance work . This software boasts 750 fonts . Nowhere on the box does it happen to mention that the fonts can ONLY be used for personal use . I had to open the box first , after I had purchased the program . Now , all 750 fonts in the software are completely useless to me . Heck , they could offer 10 million fonts in their software packages if they want , but what good is it if I ca n't use them for my freelance work ? Aside from being deceived about the fonts , the FontManager software they boast about requires the CD be inserted into your computer for it to work . That means that if you 're designing something -LRB- as you would presumably be doing with this font software -RRB- you could n't insert other CDs , like for instance , stock art CDs -- all because this inferior piece of junk software must use that CD drive in order to work . I wasted $ 30 on this useless piece of junk . Please do n't make the same mistake .
 PhotoImpact 8 has been patched , but my issues -LRB- see my earlier review `` Wait for the patch release '' -RRB- have not been corrected . I found no change in the performance or behavior -LRB- inability to echo keystrokes -RRB- in Unsharp Mask . And I was looking for one of two responses to the pressing Enter to activate a crop issue -LRB- the word Enter is missing in my earlier review because I naively surrounded it with angle brackets -RRB-
 When I was deciding between Jasc and Photo Impact when selecting image editing software , I read the reviews about how Photo Impact caused system trouble for several users . I bought Photo Impact 8 anyway becuase I wanted their web page publishing features and I thought the other users might have simply had inadequate resources for a demanding application type . But I should have heeded the warnings of others . I had a brand new , bullet-proof 3 GHz Windows XP system , but after I installed Photo Impact , the system crashed once and ground to a crawl often -- even when the application was n't open ! Not a problem of resources , just a badly programmed application `` back-end . '' Luckily , when I uninstalled it , the system recovered.As far as features go , well , they might have been the best for the money , but it 's a moot point . Definately not worth the probliems the application caused to my system and the $ 89 lost .
 After installing Photo Impact 8 on my home computer on January 6 , 2003 the product would not work with my EPSON scanner . I repeatedly emailed , telephoned and faxed their technical support group asking for assistance . I received several emails from their Taiwan -LRB- corporate location -RRB- technical support people and at their request I reinstalled both the device driver for the scanner and the software but neither solution worked . I telephoned their customer service number on January 13 , 2003 per Taiwan 's request and talked to one of their US customer service representatives who promised to relay my message to the technical support people in their Torrance , CA office ; he also suggested I fax my issues/problems to them which I did . I never received any assistance via telephone , fax or email from their office in the USA . I will never buy anything Ulead sells ever again !
 Read all the reviews before buying PhotoImpact 8.0 . Was a Jasc user prior . Would love to say that the product was great , but I ca n't get it to work . Totally freezes my system . Re-installed 3 times . Start the program , computer totally crashes . Finally I 've had to uninstall it again , put it on the shelf and be glad it works for others . Contacted Ulead by fax & email , no response , 3 days later . Not mad , just disappointed .
 As a happy PhotoImpact 7 user , I was excited to hear about the release of version 8 . It included several of the features that I would have picked to add were anyone to ask , including
 Software does n't work it had a money back guarantee I mailed the software back to them -LRB- Ulead -RRB- and had proof they received it I no longer had the software and never received a penny from them . Rotten software even worse dishonest company will never buy any products from this company .
 I upgraded to Photimpact 8 from version 6 - only it was actually a downgrade . Even after downloading the patch there are still to many bugs . After you chose a printer for one picture it does n't remember which one or the printer setup for the next picture , even if you never leave the program . The The backspace key will not back up the lasso tool to a previous point as it did in PI6 . About half the time the print command refuses to print unless you reset the resolution . But when you just click OK , the complaint goes away and it prints any way . The ruler keeps coming back to the print preview page no matter how many times you click it off , etc. I admit I have n't tried contacting Ulead . Their reputation for lousy customer service tells me it would just be asking for more frustration.Ron
 I bought this because people on this site and CNET gave it such a good review . I installed it on my W98 . -LRB- the specs say it will work -RRB- It said it needed a minimum of 64MB of RAM , but it really needs more , and if I did n't shut down just about everything I had loaded on my computer it would n't load , or lock on loading . I am pretty savvy when it comes to computers and I find this program very complicated . It took me several tries just to get out red-eye ! I put it on my laptop which has more RAM and XP OS and it works fine , but it still is very complicated to use . I do not recommend it for the inexperienced , and those who are you might want to upgrade to a more user friendly program-it would be worth the money !
 Poor customer service , poor tech support , and no support attempting to obtain online training classes . At least one can obtain Photoshop training almost everywhere , including highly recommended training CDs/DVDs , etc. . I 'm going with that .
 About five years ago I purchased Laplink Technical to move my files from my old laptop to my new Dell desktop computer . It worked perfectly the first time . This time I purchased PCMover to move my files from my old Dell -LRB- running ME -RRB- to my new Dell -LRB- running XP -RRB- . After several days of struggles I did manage to get my files transferred , but not without a LOT of problems.First of all , the software refused to recognize my Home Network linking my two Dell computers . I happily moved files back and forth between the computers using copy and paste so the network works perfectly . PCMover would not , under any circumstances , recognize the link , so I was forced touse the enclosed USB cable - a slower way to transfer the files.PCMover compressed the files before transfer but it is a resource HOG . I have a small program running that monitors my memory and PCMover drained the memory all the way down fast , then slowed the computer , then eventually crashed my old computer over , and over , and over again . I had to transfer 26gb of data and I had about 10-15 computer lockups and it took several days to move all the data.Laplink ... how can you let this product out the door like this ? Eventually , I used my Home Network to move most of my files from the old computer to the new one so PCMover would n't have to do much work , and still it crashed my old computer . In the wee hours of the morning this morning I finally got PCMover to finished its task and now my new computer is running fine . I would have tried to use my old copy of Laplink Tech but I could n't find the old software box , so that was why I bought PCMover thinking it would be an improvement over Laplink Tech and would be compatible with XP.If I could have turned compression off I suspect the transfer would have gone well without crashing my old computer but this was NOT an option . Also , the sofware tries to be `` cute '' by referring to its operations in `` moving van '' terms . When the files are being transferred it 's called `` unloading the van '' . This is NOT funny when the process is crashing the computer.My suggestions to Laplink - fix the bug that prevents the software from using the network connection , have the compression be an option , and do n't try to be cute by using `` moving van '' terms . If you get the software it will eventually work and I hope your experience with it goes better than my experience .
 Having used LapLink products in the -LRB- distant -RRB- past , I bought PCMover without a second thought . Wasted $ 40 and a LOT of time . This `` utility '' managed to move a grand total of 99MB in 15.5 HOURS before I killed the process . This is over a 100MB ethernet crossover connection . The same connection moved 5GB in about 10 minutes using Total Commander . Calls to LapLink resulted in a variety of suggestions , none of which improved performance . PCMover is n't a viable solution for Windows XP . By the way , this is exactly the same software sold by SpearIt as `` MoveMe '' , so avoid that one as well .
 I am currently the System Administrator for 4 companies and have been in the IT industry for 20 + years . Over those years I have used LapLink products since their introduction . I puchcased MCMover when my wife decided to upgrade her laptop . I was also looking for a good way to upgrade computers at work . I picked up a copy of PCMover , installed and tested it at work . I had to do the dreaded `` online validation '' . The test worked as advertised although it was slow averaging about 5 Gig/hr . Once the `` test '' was completed I uninstalled it from both test machines feeling pretty confident that it would work for the wife 's computer and thinking that it would be a good addition to my work utilities.Fast forward 4 days . Sunday morning the wife and I get up and head to our local BestBuy and purchase her a new laptop . She heads out for the afternoon and I am left to move her data . I installed the software , entered my serial number and `` no go '' . Got the lovely message `` You have exceeded your validations for this product '' . I logged on to laplinks web site thinking I can either call someone at tech support or do an online chat . Ca n't do this either because they are only available during `` business hours '' M-F . The only option , purchase yet another serial number to the tune of $ 39.95.2 of the companies that I am the Sys. . Admin for are software companies and I understand the need to prevent piracy but if you are going to have an online validation you should also be able to remove the validation when you remove the software so you can reinstall on another machince if necessary . MS has the same problem with Office 2003 . It can be done because Adobe has this option with Photoshop CS and CS2.While it does work as advertised I can not recommend it because of this horrible policy . If you need to use it more than once then stay away from this one .
 I tried all morning with their tech support trying to get network transfer to work but still no dice . They escalated the issue and got back to me 3 days later asking me to check the timezone and time . Of course that did n't fix anything . I have since sold my old computer . Laplink has a no-refund policy . You bet I 'll be disputing charges with my CC company !
 NO REFUNDS BY THIS COMPANY , PERIOD . I spent HOURS trying to get this to work . It messed up my old computer . Did not transfer anything . When I contacted their tech support , they said Oh , we know those programs wo n't transfer , sorry . They have false advertising which states that it `` transfers all your programs . '' What a lie ! I have a very high level of computer expertise . My advice
 I bought this to make a transfer easy . I teach programming in college . 12 hours later of clean up , I am just about to erase everything and do a clean build . Good luck it either works or it does not work . I would be extra careful going between xp and vista
 Do not waste your money on this software , much less your valuable time !!! If you expect to transfer your data using the included Laplink USB 1.1 cable , forget it ! There is a technical glitch with the drivers for this cable that requires a repair `` process '' that is not clearly explained and I could never get to work -LRB- if it works at all ! -RRB- - even after searching support , FAQs , LiveChats , multiple uninstalls/reinstalls , etc. . There are also manual changes to your computer 's registry that can supposedly be made to fix the problem , but I was not comfortable doing them in the first place , and especially not after seeing how poorly the repair process `` worked '' . You will not know if you have this problem until AFTER you have a clean installation , and go to select USB as your Method of Transfer and find it is greyed out - this problem is NOT picked up while checking for software updates during installation.LiveChat support is only available days and early evenings EST ; phone support is only available on a scheduled basis - their schedule . If you do run into any problems , you may be able to get through them if you have lots of time and can work through them at their convenience . After 10 hours over 2 days and STILL no clean installation and no phone support , I gave up !
 I bought this program along with a new Dell Laptop . I thought it would simplify things . After 13 hours of data transfer I find it installed all the Office 2003 stuff from the old computer on top of the Office 2007 stuff on my new computer . I 'll get it fixed eventually , but I would have saved a lot of time and effort if I had done things the old fashioned way.Don ' t waste your money .
 I order PCmover when I was buying a new desktop from Dell . I saw the program when I was in the ordering process and thought it looked likea good idea . I recieved the computer as promised from Dell . The PC mover was back ordered . 3 times Dell call and emailed me that it would take another week to ship . I finally canceled . After reading these reviews I am glad I did n't get the program .
 PLEASE do n't buy any edition of PC Mover . -LRB- I bought an early version and downloaded to the latest version on both computers . Even that process caused errors . -RRB- It comes with no instructions , and using it is NOT self-explanatory . It is complicated . I am very computer savvy so if I ca n't use it , you wo n't be able to either . It took me fifty tries , and several hours in online chats with their help support , and at least one nervous breakdown , before I got it to work . And THEN , the one piece of software that PCMover transferred for me did n't work . -LRB- Do n't know why . Completely gave up at that point . -RRB- They have a help button you can push every step of the way , but it just tells you `` This is what 's happening now . '' If something 's going wrong , and it 's NOT happening , the help button offers no troubleshooting whatsoever . Useless . I seriously did become a stress mess . Also , you should know that they pay people to advertize on their sites .
 The software uses interview approach to gather information and then generate the document . If your situation is not one of the choices , you ca n't really change it . For legal software , it is way too limited to be of good use . I ended up using it as a reference and re-write my own . I am trying to form my own company and the Article of Incorporation is missing from the software . It turns out that you can file the Article of Incorporation online for some States . It would be nice if the software can link you to the State directly for filing .
 You 'd expect a piece of software with this title to really present you with a lot of options when building such a document . I found the documents produced by this software -LRB- e.g. corporate bylaws -RRB- to be rather simplistic when compared to some samples I had in some books on starting/running a small business.The documents , aside from not being that many , are written in what you could call plain English . While some people might find that good , when drafting legally binding documents I 'd expect hardcore lawyer English with clear and precise clauses.Do yourself a favor , hire a lawyer or buy such documents from a law firm.Anybody wan na buy a slightly used Quicken Lawyer 2003 ? : -RRB- R.
 Photosuite 4 Platinum is rather different from other Roxio products like CD Creator . Other products tend to be top notch . But Photosuite 4 is , in my opinion , very average in the digital photo software world . It is better than some others that are generally trash in my book , but far inferior to others . This is not to say the program is worthless - it is n't . But it has a pretty disorganized interface that is difficult to work through . If you are looking for a really fine program that does n't require a second mortgage on your house to purchase , I highly recommend Photoshop Elements 2 . It is far superior to Photosuite 4 and costs only a little more . Nearly all the features work and Adobe is the best . As a side note , Roxio rejected my rebate even though I used the rebate slip attached to the box and included the only UPC code on the box . They said it was the wrong UPC code , the typical gimmick . I wo n't mess with them , but I will be reluctant to do business with them again . I still use Photosuite 4 for some things , but only in conjunction with Photoshop Elements .
 You better be able to comprehend every thing that is in their user 's guide because they have virtually ZERO customer/technical support even though they advertise such . They have a discussions group where you post questions but they do n't answer them . They have email they they do not respond to . And if you want to talk to someone on the phone they charge $ ... per call even if you bought the software.They also do not give you all that they advertise . For example
 This is just the same software as MGI Photosuite in a different box ! If you do n't have it already , there are some cool features like photo tapestry , but it 's hard to learn how to use this product . I do n't like using this software for scanning - it does n't open the picture for me . Instead it saves it to the hard drive .
 The software that comes with Platinum Edition PhotoSuite is very easy to use . Editing a photo is very easy , but the cababilities are limited . The real problem is the ease of use makes the software addictive than you run into a problem . The only way to get customer service is to pay -LSB- money -RSB- + to just be able to speak to a person . Of course there is no garantee they will be able to fix the problem or even do anything about it . I bought the software a year ago . Now it will not load photos even if you re-install it . The company will not do anything about it . Except advise me to BUY another copy . I do n't think so ! AVOID this company at all cost .
 This software would be overpriced even if it were free . It 's not worth the effort of installing it . Photo album capabilities are a joke . Does n't read Exif data from photos . Very limited editing features . The installation CDs can be easily converted into coasters or Christmas tree ornaments , but are n't useful for much else .
 I order this product based on all the great reviews from others and now I really regret it . I was unable to get the product to work and so I went to their website to see if I could get it resolved . I was told that I would have to pay $ $ $ dollars for a technical assistant to help me . I was then put on hold for 45 minutes and no one ever came back to help me . SInce I was also paying for the call I finally hung up . I tried to contact the company via email and they have none . I 'm very unhappy with this product and this company . DO NOT BUY !!!!!
 I got this free after rebate last year and finally installed it a few weeks ago . it 's horrible . I uninstalled it after about 3 uses.the software does n't have many features and those it does have are anti-intuitive . Save yourself a headache and get something better - adobe photoshop elements or paint shop pro .
 This is the worst product I have ever bought . I thought that it would be so great because of some of the reviews I had read and it turned out to be a nightmare . I installed the product and it would n't work so I called tech support . I was told that I would have to pay $ 35 to get help after spending almost an hour on hold for which I had to pay for . I feel this is a low rate product designed by lazy people . It is not worth the money or the hassel . FInd something better to spend your money on .
 I am an owner of Quicken Lawyer 2002 Personal Deluxe . I had to reinstall the software when my computer quit . I bought a new one and installed QLP2002 . When I went to use the automatic web update of the software , I was informed that `` This version is no longer supported , and Web Update is not available ... we recommend that you upgrade ... for only $ 29.99 . It is an outrage that Nolo has revoked patches they had previously made available . The lack of any support is the reason I will NEVER purchase another Quicken Lawyer product .
 I bought this software a few months ago but did n't get around installing it until today . When I tried to register the software I got the message that the software is no longer supported ! I was asked to call an 800 number to get a discount on an upgrade . This is the first time I ever ran across a name-brand software package that discontinues support before the software is even one year old ! While I may still use the software I found it appalling that the publisher of this software dares to force customers to pay for an `` upgrade '' immediately upon installation of software that they just purchased .
 ... The Good
 I downloaded the full version of DVD Complete from Dazzle 's website -LRB- $ $ $ $ $ -RRB- . After numerous feeze-ups as I tried to add small clips to this movie making/burning software , I finally called tech support -LRB- several times -RRB- . Nice people , but they admitted this is a new product and not really fully de-bugged , and I 've never been able to get it to work . I dont know what other software can do the job better , but this one is definitely not the one , at least with this user -LRB- Windows XP user -RRB- . It seems this whole family of software generally is where CD burning software was a few years ago -- lots of headaches . So the problem may be systemic , and not confined to DVD Complete alone .
 WARNING
 Dazzle was purchased by Pinnacle Systems , Inc. . Although the contents will indicate that 24/7 phone support and online support is available , Pinnacle offers no support for Dazzle software . If you have any problems , you 're out of luck . However , they will try to sell you their own software .
 Please , please do not buy this software . You may wonder why the company that made it went broke . Well , it 's because of how utterly horrible this thing is . I finally was able to get my video onto my computer . Whenever I opened it , it crashed after 6 minutes . Video randomly merges with images . This is the worst program ever written . A paraplegic gorilla randomly flailing about on the ground in some god-forsaken rainforest has most likely written a better program than this one . Please , for my sake and especially for yours , do not buy this .
 Dazzle DVD Complete will not capture video with the Dazzle DVC II
 Initially I thought the editing process was easy to use with the drag and drop timeline and individual picture advancement setting . It also made the addition of audio easy to coordinate with pictures . Preview process always looked great but I could never get the final slideshow to advance on DVD player . It was a waste of time and countless CDs just to try to get a slideshow to work . As far as tech support , the company is non-existent . Get it if you want to be frustrated .
 His review was dated December of 2002 . The exact same situation still exists in July 2003 . I got the original bare-bones software with my card reader . I wanted to be able to sort albums easier and according to the info on the box , it was what I wanted . Loaded it and it was the same bare-bones program . In fact , I started looking and found the part number on my old disk matches the part number on the new disk . I do not understand how they can get away with advertising one thing and inserting another . The example screens promised on the box are not the ones on the disk . The instruction manual is the right one for the box but not for the disk they put in the box.And Stephen is correct again about customer support . Worse than non-existent . They promise the world and deliver nothing.I will never by any product with this company 's name again .
 My wife got this for me last Christmas . I was expecting more and got less . I did get it to work and I did create a VCD format CDR but I would recommend a more powerful program . Some of the drawbacks I found1 -RRB- Music can only be MP3 -LRB- I had to find a program to convert my WMA 's and other formats to MP3 -RRB- 2 -RRB- Limit of 200 pictures is actually 100 unless you do some crazy workaround , I do n't remember how I FINALLY got it up to 200 -LRB- which is n't nearly enough for me to do a year 's worth of picrues -RRB- 3 -RRB- The preview mode is cheesy . In order to view the pictures and music together you have to play from the beginning every time , you can not preview from 1/2 way though the presentation .4 -RRB- No way to sort and store photos5 -RRB- Not everyone 's DVD supports the VCD format that this program burns to.My advice
 I received the WRONG CD in the box -- apparantly an earlier edition that did not allow for drop and drag editing or adding of audio , as specified in advertising and on the box . The manual included did not match the screens and options which appeared when I loaded my software.You would think this problem would be rather simple to solve . But it 's not . Simply can not contact Dazzle about it ! Called their non-toll free help line , and was on hold for an hour before I gave up . Dazzle did not respond to my e-mail . Too bad they do n't care more about their customers . Product has promise , but when you ca n't even get an answer to a simple question , that promise remains unfulfilled .
 I had read an article on DVD slide shows in Popular Photography andthought it would be fun to try . I had picked OnDVD because of the price , if I did n't like it it would n't be a loss . The program was easy to use and fun , untill I tried to burn the cd.I had problems burning it on a cd , I tried to call the tech support , which is not toll free and stayed on hold for 20 minutes then gave up . I faxed Dazzle and had no responce . They have a chat forum which others had the same problems I did . I will probably go with something like `` DVD PICTURE SHOW '' next time which seems to have a good reviews . I guess I got what I paid for .
 GARBAGE SOFTWARE & NONEXISTANT SERVICECongratulation to those of you who got this ... to work . I 'd certainly like to know how you did it . I 've tried it on two relatively new and up to date computers and could not get it to function properly on either one . The software appeared to function OK until it came time to actually write to the CD and then , nothing . I 've wasted countless hours and CDs trying to get this stuff to work . And I know there is nothing wrong with my computers or CD writers because they both work with Easy CD Creator.As for the service , what a joke . NONEXISTANT , a huge amount of time wasted.SAVE YOUR MONEY ... BUY ROXIO -LRB- or something else -RRB- ! It may not be as easy tp use but it DOES work .
 After purchasing OnDVD , I expected great performance based on the great advertising on the box . However , I was quickly dismayed since the program plays the audio track great , but fails to change the slides as adveritised . Although they have a tech web site , with methods of e-mailing them for tech support , they never answer back . In reviewing their public discussion groups , I noticed -LRB- unfortunately after purchasing the product -RRB- that others have the same problem with the product , and are still awaiting 3 months later for any resolution by Dazzle .
 I installed this software and when launched it did n't even get past the splash screen before `` encountering a problem and needing to close '' . I 'm really glad I bought this through Marketplace and only paid a penny for it . I guess you get what you pay for .
 I found that this product does not work with VISTA operating software , therefore I ca n't use it .
 We have been Mac users since 1985 , and Quickbooks users since 1996 . I carefully read the reviews before purchasing , and Intuit 's corporate declaration of their commitment to the Mac platform . We really wanted to believe they meant it -LRB- this time -RRB- and because we were to lazy to switch programs , we purchased 2006 . Well the only thing Intuit is interested in and committed to , is sucking what ever last few dollars they can from trusting Mac users.The software is pathetic and woefully inadequate ... they should have called it MacPro 1984 . DO NOT WALK - RUN from this blatant attempt to fleece money from Mac users.We will NEVER let Intuit steal from us again ... there are much better accounting programs out there for the Mac , and we can only be angry with ourselves for being to lazy to change.If you are just starting out ... . DO NOT but this software.If you are upgrading ... . Keep what you have until you 're ready to switch.Read MacWorld reviews . -LRB- and they were being nice IMHO -RRB- You can ignore the other reviewers like we did ... but YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !
 Unlike the PC version of quickbooks pro which has built in software to handle payroll , the mac version has nothing , and you only have 2 choices that are online access only and overpriced.The interface is incredibly confusing , with hundreds of floating windows that overlap each other and get lost like a messy stack of papers . Simple functions like `` print checks '' or `` edit transaction '' are in the worst possible locations , so even the simplest tasks take forever to complete.After using this for over 2 months and seeing how much better designed the PC version is , I 'm buying a cheap PC laptop just so I can use the PC version . I recommend the same for anyone else .
 I 've used the OS 9 version for years , making do with manually adjusted tax rates for unemployment and California taxes , etc. as needed . Year-to-date info always worked , and Pay Liabilities always worked , and so long as I entered the tax amount correctly for each paycheck I was OK.Since 2006 , however , the OS 9 version stopped updating the year-to-date info , though the Pay Liabilities still has the total correct . This made it harder to ensure getting the taxes correct as the gross pay total reached the $ 7000 -LRB- and other -RRB- limits , so I decided to upgrade to the latest OS X version.The Amazon.COM product info makes it sound like OS X versions still support Payroll functions , but it turns out this requires a SUBSCRIPTION to an Outside Vendor ! The OS 9 menu items for Payroll are missing!Worse , when I returned the product to Amazon.COM , they withheld half the cost as a restocking fee , because it was my fault I did n't catch this subtlety in their easy to misunderstand product information.Most every longstanding product enhances functionality with upgrades , so how was I to expect moving from OS 9 to X would lose such an important Business function as Payroll ? Amazon.COM does a disservice to us customers to let Intuit get away with making it sound like QuickBooks does Payroll when it does not do so natively .
 This software is filled with all sorts of glitches . In order to fix the glitches , you must pay for `` support '' , which is basically a group of esl students with tabbed notebooks . I spent hours on the phone trying to solve several problems with the program . None of them were solved , and I was still charged . I now take my laptop to the accoutant every week and struggle without it for several days while she does my books since the transfer to PC function does NOT work . Aatrix is even worse . Together , these programs have made running my business miserable .
 I have been using quickbooks pro for windows for about ten years now and love it . I just bought a MacBook Pro and wanted to change/upgrade to Quickbooks Pro for Mac 2006 . I am an artist and my proposals need one to two pages of details per line item . The Mac permits only 50 characters . Also there are many details missing , reports , etc which make the program a huge BURDEN to work with so I have switched back to QB for Windows and put a partition in my MacBook Pro . I would certainly not recommend the program until they fix these problems which they say should be by 2008 version . They agreed that they have received several complaints . I shipped my program back .
 I waited several years for QuickBooks for the Mac.Until it could download transactions ... Well where to start describing this unfortunate experience?Oh Yes ... For starters forget about downloading transactions . . Importing the popular QIF files ? Sorry Not Available.Quick Books Mac 2006 only imports QBO and IIF format files , and then not automaticly.Yes you can get a third party QIF to IIF Converter -LRB- Simply ConvertIIF Converter -RRB- But Quickbooks Mac 2006 will not import all converted files correctly.It does n't like negative numbers ... Or so the Error message says.Paying bills online with QB2006 ? Sorry Not Available.Print checks and snailmail in 2006 . Accurate Transactions . Well ... Do n't even think about editing the vendor list to fix duplicate entries or misspellings . Unless you want to find and then manually re-enter the missing payee descriptions on ALL of those transactions . Of course they do n't bother to mention that detail.It should at least have good Reporting capabilities . . Right ?? After all how basic can one get . Printing columns of numbers is easy right ?? ... WRONG!Shrinking Reports to One Page Wide ? Sorry Not Available.Its almost impossible to adjust Report Column widths without inadvertently sorting them . Then I dare you to get them to print on one page . The best solution for printing reports is to Email the report as a PDF to Yourself and then print the PDF . Hows that for lack of elegance and inefficiency.Tech Support ??? Here 's my experience ... First call . On Hold for 20 Minutes . Then told `` I do n't know anything about the Mac Version '' Call Atrix . -LRB- The Payroll Provider -RRB- Second Call , I waited on hold for 64 minutes.After another 15 minutes explaining that my imported data from Quicken was coming through corrupted . And asking for ideas . I finally asked if QuickBooks could import QIF files . He said he had never heard of a QIF file type ! -LRB- QIF was developed by Intuit makers of QuickBooks -RRB- He ultimately said to Call Quicken Tech support for QuickBooks importing help . I spent another couple of hours solving the problem myself through a repeated trial and error process.Unfortunately there are plenty more deficiencies to write about , but the worst part is that the User Interface is inconsistent and buggy . Try dialog boxes where clicking cancel enters the transaction ... Lovely.After spending Dozens of hours with this stinker . I 'd recommend that you buy something else . Anything else . . Save yourself hours of time and irritation . This is a candidate for a class action lawsuit . Maybe it will be ready in a few more years ... Maybe NOT .
 I was forced to purchase this program , since I had used the trial version and there was no way to save the information back to the previous version . Additionally , Intuit informed me they would n't be supporting the previous version ! And on top of that , there 's no longer an upgrade price , and I was charged full price after years of using QuickBooks . Wish I could transfer everything to another accounting program ...
 I have been a long-term user of QuickBooks for the Mac . The most recent version of this had been QuickBooks Pro 5 . Upon the release of QuickBooks Pro 2006 , I was excited to see that the product had online banking capability -LRB- finally -RRB- . The marketing materials were unclear about whether you could write online checks , so I called Intuit -LRB- developer of QuickBooks -RRB- to see if it works . They assured me that it would so I ordered the product.Upon arrival and upon reading the documentation , no mention at all about online check writing although it does have capability to download transactions from financial instituitions -LRB- a three step process and not exactly elegant -RRB- . Back to Intuit . This time the tech support said , no , check writing only available in Windows product.Bottom line -- if you have QB 5 , do n't bother upgrading . If you are looking for an online check writing application , keep looking or use Quicken if your business will allow it.Come on , Intuit ! How about getting a really GOOD product out for the Mac !
 Intuit has short-changed Mac users with the all new 2006 version of quickbooks . The windows version has so many more features , and for the same price it leaves you wondering why those features were left out of the mac edition . The invoices it creates look like a joke and there 's no way to change it - the boxes and text are grossly misaligned and the line items butt right up against the border of the columns . The windows version however , comes with a complete `` layout designer '' built right in . As a small business owner and graphic designer I need my invoices to look professional . There are many alternatives for Mac users in terms of accounting software - try looking at MYOB for the mac or if you are in the creative industry check out Studiometry .
 QuickBooks Pro 2006 for Mac is a dreadful option . Simply
 Intuit 's historic QB 4.0 program featured an additional `` Pro '' component for payroll , so years ago we bought the QB `` Pro '' 4.0 for those additional payroll features . Then QB discontinued support for us Mac users altogether in 2000 , but our own shop persisted , auto-entering payroll data until this year , when we thougtht we could upgrade to 2006 OSX for Mac . Hah ! We 've learned that QB Pro now only supports payroll online , at an additional charge -LRB- $ 25/mo ! -RRB- Ok , for half that additional cost each year , CheckMark Payroll -LRB- also available at Amazon -RRB- will now do that part of our accounting . We appreciate QB features overall , but when we upgraded to Pro 2006 , we were not ready to be sent , unprepared , into payroll accounting Neverland . Intuit 's continued use of `` Pro '' for 2006 is darn-near bait & switch , we think . Shoppers , consider carefully ! MYOB and Peachtree are strong alternatives for Mac users .
 Purchased dQB Pro 2006 earlier this year . Worked fine until recently when it suddenly started having problems with the `` Enter Sales receipts '' function . Program announces fatal error and crashes . No other problems ; however , Intuit wants $ 75.00 to discuss the issue . I used the previous version with no difficulty , but Intuit 's excessive support fees for correcting QuickBooks Pro 2006 for Mac bugs now have me looking for alternatives .
 I used quickbooks last year for PC , and it was OK . I upgraded to 2006 thinking I 'd get a bunch of new features , and I 'd be able to use it on my mac laptop instead of just my desktop PC.What a turd . This program was ' t ready for prime time , it is n't easy to use , it has a bunch of horrible user interface ` features ' , it was patently written without the involvement of an accountant , and there are tons of user restrictions that just do n't make sense.The payroll service is probably the worst . I 've been unable to get the payroll transactions from the online service into quickbooks for the past week because they 're having some software bug issues that they ca n't identify.If I can find something else that is n't too expensive and that lets me input transactions easily enough , I 'm switching tomorrow . Quickbooks is useless . Do n't buy it .
 Sad that such a user friendly program is blackballed from potential clients . This was the second QB I purchased for my 07 Mac and neither was a usable product . Shame on QB . They can not even offer an older version to be purchased for perfectly running older computers . The product is awesome , they just have a capitalistic business philosophy . I have been blessed over the last couple weeks to find businesses that actually want the small guy to succeed , not keep us down .
 I 've used Quickbooks in 1999 , then upgraded in 2000 , then QBPro in 2001 then upgraded in 2003 . I also tried this Mac version on a friends computer.Intuit Quickbooks , in all its iterations , is a poorly supported money grab . It 's highly restrictive and not worth your money . The Mac version is missing key features that they 're just too LAZY to incorporate . They are greedy and they just do n't care about the customer.When they decided to `` sunset '' my version and no longer support it , I emailed them and told them to shove it . Here 's why.Please note
 I had purchase the simple start a year ago and it was easy to use , this version does not come with the flow chart system and has a lot of stuff that I do n't need or want . Plus the banking does n't work with Wells Fargo so that leave the 10 million of us banking with Wells fargo in the dark .
 The QuickBooks for Mac version is a watered down version of the Windows version . It 's little better than using an Excel spreadsheet . Also , despite claims by Intuit that it 's compatible with the Windows version , it 's not . Any feature in QB Windows database that is not in the Mac version needs to be stripped out before a company 's file can be transferred . Along with the truly awful Intuit technical support , this version is just a waste of money .
 It wont run off a file share ! You ca n't have 1 user access it over a file share or it crashes . I just wanted it to sit on my server and it was not possible . I spoke with support and they said thats the way it is with no explanation why .
 I am a new quickbooks user and would probably be happy with the Mac version of this if I was not using the PC version at a different job . The PC version is so much better and although Intuit claims they care about the Mac consumer , clearly this is not the case , think twice about purchasing this version.Very disappointing .
 There is a lot wrong with this software . Online banking is all but impossible , even after downloading statements in the exact format required by the software . Importing ... forget about it ! So , I now have all of these lovely online data files on my desktop and QuickBooks ca n't / wo n't read them.No worries , I 'll just call the tech support line , since we have a free 30 days of support with purchase . Nope . The info at QuickBooks.com / callme lets us all know that support is not currently available for our product on our platform and we ca n't even fill out the form to get `` in line '' for a callback tomorrow , when tech support is available.What 's with all of the hoops we get to jump through , after spending nearly $ 200 on this software?I was the office manager for a small business that used QuickBooks Pro on Windows back in ' 99 . I was eager to try out QuickBooks for the Mac with the financial records of MY small business -LRB- which has recently become not-so-small , hence the need to automate , rather than doing everything `` by hand '' this fiscal year -RRB- and the whole experience has been a big fat downer.I 'm still giving the software two stars because I guess I figure the cute ledger sheets and invoice generators are somewhat more robust than Microsoft Excel . * sigh *
 When converting my 2005 data over to 2006 version it lost all of my time data . I have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now . Also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer . I 've had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones.Intuit 's support sucks and can not seem to resolve my problems . I have two copies on two different computers and am having the same problems with my data file on each computer . My recommendation is if you are using the 2005 version , and do n't need tax tables , do n't mess with 2006 version . It has literally cost me thousands of dollars of my time trying to work out the bugs on my own .
 From my experience just about all support calls are routed off shore.Most of the tech support staff just take your question and type it into their work station . They say `` May I put you on hold while I check my resources '' . Then they read answers off their screen . Several times I had to say to the tech - I ca n't understand your English . If you buy the package I 'd find a local QB certified accountant and pay him/her for their time .
 In the year 2006 it is INSANE that we as IT pros still have to hack registry hives to get this software to run as a limited privilege account to better secure our computers.QuickBooks Community - Running QuickBooks 2005 as a Restricted User -LRB- Admin Rights FIX -RRB- : http://www.quickbooksgroup.com/webx?14@@.eeb323b/9When will quickbooks begin to code in a secure manner ? Peachtree does . Microsoft Small Business Accounting does.Why does Intuit require updates every few years and acts like we are still all running Windows 98 machines?Security is important these days . How about stepping up to the plate Intuit and getting with the other vendors ?
 I tried to install this product on my desktop running Windows Vista and got a message saying there is a know compatibility issue . I tried to install it on my laptop running Windows 7 and got the same message . Neither Microsoft nor Intuit were any help and the seller wo n't return my emails.Terrible experience all around .
 The title pretty much says it all.The on-line update feature never worked . Intuit 's technical support could n't figure out why and gave up . The on-line payroll update feature failed for the same reason.After 7 months of use , the E-mail Forms function quit working . The technical support representative did n't know what the PDF files were , and repeatedly had to ask for help . The final `` resolution '' was to blame my computer instead of explaining the Amyuni 1796 error.All of this has cost more than 5 hours of being on the phone with Intuit 's technical support and no resolution of the software problems.I will not recommend any of Intuit 's products based on their non-resolution of these software problems .
 The program kept referring to a book ? The book was not included , and not to be found . I got this as a gift years ago FULL PRICE higher than shows now .
 This is a piece of junk , it teachs nothing . Do not waste your money !
 While this program is a good start for a simple CRM it still has a long way to go.It has two major flaws and several minor ones that I have found so far . The first major flaw is that it 's data is not being shared real time with Quickbooks . I suppose they did this so that it can be used standalone , but who would really do that ? If you 're going to use a standalone product would n't you go out and find something else ? The real reason you 're using this product is because it 's Quickbooks and you want tight integration with your Quickbooks DB.The second major flaw is that it wo n't sync it 's tasks with MS Outlook . This is HUGE for me . I use a PDA that keeps all of my tasks and it 's where I enter all my new tasks while on the road -LRB- Which is 90 % of the time -RRB- . So if I wanted to use this application , I 'd have to keep 2 separate task lists . Not a viable option . Their KB says that there is no way to sync tasks with MS Outlook , but many other products are out there that do.It advertises itself as being this great interface between your Quickbooks and Outlook but it just does n't hold up.The minor flaws I 've found so far -LRB- and I 've just been using the app for 1 day -RRB- are :1 . Outlook emails are supposed to show up in your CM records , but they do n't -LRB- at least for me -RRB- . I have searched their KB for an answer to this .2 . If you select a record on your homepage under `` recent names '' and select remove , it actually deletes the entire record and does n't just remove it from the `` recent names '' list . This ends up giving you a huge unmanageable list of items that you just do n't use because you ca n't clean up the list -LRB- like you can with Windows start button recently used programs list '' -RRB- .3 . Even though I followed the instructions that were given for syncing Quickbooks with Customer Manager without manually opening QB it does n't work . I have to open it up every time manually every time I sync.I think the application has a lot of potential , but needs a good bit of work before it becomes a viable option for most in the Small Business world .
 This did n't satisfy my needs . I did n't like the setup , not very `` user friendly '' . I got my money back from Intuit within 30 days .
 I am an advanced computer user who sells on eBay . This program seemed like a great time saver . Create auctions and upload nicely laid out pages with multiple pictures and save money too ! Sounds great ! Do n't think so . Every auction I 've uploaded requires revisions thru eBay 's site with pretty deep HTML editing . I give it 2 stars because it has nice templates which can be edited , you can insert multiple pictures at no charge -LRB- you better have an moderate understanding of HTML though -RRB- and it has improved my HTML skills -LRB- that was never my mission here -RRB- . You 'd be better off buying HTML for Dummies if that is your interest.The users manual leaves a bit to be desired and the requirement for an ftp site to upload your auctions will be a problem for all but the more knowledgeable internet users . There are not many free ftp sites out there any longer.Tried to get support from the Data Becker site on the problems . It 's been 2 weeks and multiple emails . Still no reply . Oh well live and learn .
 At first glance it seems like a impressive product , but using it quickly identified that it was n't ready for release to consumers .1 . Many error messages are in German ! .2 . No guidance on how to set up the folder structure for uploading images , and the only way to figure it out is by trial and error , which brings up the third problem ... 3 . You can not test upload , each upload is a complete auction -LRB- which by the way costs to do -RRB- , so plan on having the first 5 or so auctions without any pictures .4 . When I was able to figure out the imbedded pictures , I discovered that the ebay images still were blank , pointing instead to an empty placeholder .5 . Frequently the example templates included had text run beyond the screen width .6 . Web site support is non-existant . When I attempted to register the product it was not even listed on the company website ! Further the links to contact the company were all circles back to the place you started from.I deal with integrating new applictions in a network environment frequently , and this is one of the most dissapointing purchases I have made in some time . If you are considering this product , I recommend you look for an alternative product , or at the least download the demo and try it first .
 I was using -LSB- Andale -RSB- and also tried auctionworks to post and manage my auctions , they were great and very simple to use , but you have to pay a monthly fee , so I decided to switch to this program . The features seem great , but I ca n't make it work . You have to have your own web site , free or paid , to upload the auction you create with this software , to -LSB- an auction website -RSB- . To this moment , I have checked the manual several times , and do n't understand how to do it . The website is useless . I 'm going to try with email support , but it is not the way it should work . The software assumes that the user knows how to set a website , and how to do a lot of things before making this thing work . In the end , I think that the program could be great if it were more easy to setup.UPDATE TO DECEMBER 11th 2003I downgraded my rating , because , three weeks has passed , and still I ca n't make it work . I returned to the paying auction utilities site .
 I bought Music Creator Pro to create sound tracks for the video projects I 've been putting together , and it 's a very capable set of tools . The MIDI and recorded sound mixing , effects , and automation would be perfect for my application - if they worked . The description of the product on Cakewalk 's web site is accurate , and the user interface is not very difficult to understand.I installed the software on a fast Windows XP machine , and soon discovered that it would crash when the drum pattern paint tool was used . Cakewalk 's tech support has been very slow in their responses , taking at least one day and sometimes more than four to respond . I still have n't received any help other than advice to reinstall the product -LRB- I did -RRB- , make sure I have the latest drivers -LRB- I do -RRB- , and delete a couple of configuration files -LRB- I did -RRB- . The drum pattern tool still crashes the application , and in the course of working through the tutorials -LRB- the ones I can use -RRB- I have also discovered some features that appear to be globally disabled.Two weeks after installing the product , I 'm simultaneously very impressed with the features and capabilities , and very disappointed with the responsiveness of Cakewalk 's tech support . If everything worked the way it was supposed to , I would probably rate Music Creator Pro with five stars . -LSB- update -RSB- It 's now a month since purchase , and the software still does not work correctly . Cakewalk will not support this product by telephone . If you call their -LRB- non-toll-free -RRB- support number , you are told that they only support Music Creator Pro by email . They have failed to respond to either of my last two email messages , the first of which was sent two weeks ago .
 I purchased this product becaused it advertised on the box that it had ` self-paced lessons ' - ` the best tutorials ' - ' a visual journey ' among other wonderful marketing terms . When I installed it , I thougt a disk was missing - all I found were practice sessions of sets of 10 questions that tell you if you guessed right or wrong , with an explaination of the correct answer.My email to them : I purchased middle school success because the package advertises - self-paced tutorials - key concepts to work with - tutorials and activities - self paced lessons - and visual tours.My box contains 4 disks . Am I missing something ??? Where do I find the lessons , tutorials etc for Math , Science , English etc ???? Their email to me : Solution : The Middle School Success disc has practice sessions . Those practice sessions look like tests but every answer is explained -LRB- sometimes with visual aids -RRB- .
 Not even worth one star , there are no `` lessons '' as advertised . Just random questions for each subject that you can only hope are being taught in a middle school class . It 's a little like taking tests without ever being taught the subject.The worst software buy , please save your money and look elsewhere for educational software . ~
 This software proved to be worthless . There are no lessons as mentioned on the box . It is nothing but 10 question quizzes . Giving it 1 star is generous . More time went into creating the lies on the box than into the software . Can not believe they have '' # 1 best selling educational suite '' on the box .
 Zero stars if possible . I concur with the other reviewers . I 've been in education for over 20 years , and have taught university courses on educational technology . This product is beyond horrible . It 's just a collection of multiple choice quiz items . Even the interface to select those is stupid.Basic pedagogy dictates that first you teach students something , and then you assess them to see if they learned it . This skips the teaching part all together . The loud buzzer for incorrect answers announces to all within earshot that the student is dumb , and just adds injury to insult.The claims on the box about `` lessons '' and `` tutorials '' are a complete lie . I 'd sue for false advertising to get my $ 10 bucks I paid at second-hand bookstore , but why bother.Run , do n't walk , away from this horrible , horrible , program .
 The newest version of Zone Alarm Internet Security Suite 2007 is absolute crap . I only wish I could give it 0 stars . Trust me ... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!! The version I got is the latest build , and I had nothing but problems from the day I installed . System -LRB- actually I have it loaded on 2 laptops -RRB- takes up to 20 minutes to shutdown , and XP user switching , which should take less than a minute can take up to 5 minutes . And I thought my Norton product slowed things down.Today , though , was the topper . I scheduled the virus scan to run every day at 2:00 AM . On one machine it did n't run , and the ZA control panel said it was in the process of downloading updates . I waited ... and waited ; a full half hour , and updates were still being unloaded ??? Clearly something was wrong , so I had to shutdown.On my other computer the system said the virus scan was still running . Now since I checked my computer at 6 AM , that means it had been running for 4 hours . Again ... ???? Worse yet , though it indicated it was running , under files scanned it showed zero . Again , I shut my system down , since obviously something was very wrong.I contacted ZA , and their answer re my slow shutdown problem was as follows : < ------- WHEN REPLYING , PLEASE TYPE YOUR TEXT ABOVE THIS LINE -------- > `` Hello Frank , Thank you for your inquiry . This is a known issue . At this time there is nothing else I can recommend other than to revert to 7.0.337.000 . Please download this version of the Zone Alarm Security Suite by clicking on the following link : http://www.zonealarm.com/zasuitedownload `` In other words , our new product does n't work , so just go back and use a prior version . Talk about bad business !!!! Needless to say , I wo n't bother downloading this earlier version . In my mind this suite is total garbage , and now I need to see if my computer acts up post-removal . I hope not , since I `` think '' I cleaned all remnants using CCleaner.Finally , I 'm contacting Amazon about this problem . I guess it should have been obvious to me when the price of the new release was less than the older release that there was a problem.Again , save yourselves money and LOTS of headaches ... avoid this product like you would a rabid dog !
 I replaced Norton Internet Security 2007 with Zonealarm . My previous experience with Zonealarm about three years had been favorable , and the lower price made the decision easier.After using this product for two months I have to say this doesnt even seem fit for commercial sale . This product suffers from some huge drawbacks - My PC performance has taken a major hit compared to when I was using Norton . The start up time especially has suffered . Sometimes my PC will literally freeze up due to the CPU resources Zonealarm takes . - Internet access speeds have become very slow . If I shut down Zonealarm internet access becomes instantly faster . - For some reason Zonealarm will not allow me to open many very popular web sites . If I reduce the security level from internet-level to `` low '' , those web sites become accessible . - Inspite of suffering through all the above problems , the zonealarm PC scan ALWAYS turns up spyware on my PC . I hardly ever saw this happen with Norton Internet Security . This is especially discouraging and raises questions on how effective the spyware protection really is.I intend to go back to Norton Internet Security .
 ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite was once a good product before version 7 . However , with the new version came unexplained crashes of important modules so that the computer was apparently left unprotected . A subsequent update to version 7.0.362 left the computer so slow as to be unusable . The `` Instant Support '' option at the ZoneAlarm website instructs users to turn off the `` on-access '' scanning to solve the problem with sluggishness , but this makes the computer vulnerable to malware.Also , some installations of this version of ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite seem to suffer frequent corruption of the spyware database , and solving this problem requires following a series of tedious steps . All this troubleshooting can take up hours of your time . You may want to enjoy your weekend , but ZoneAlarm will have you uninstalling and reinstalling instead .
 We have been using ZoneAlarm happily for several years , but the latest version -LRB- 7 I think -RRB- takes over the CPU for long periods of time , making the computer unusably slow . Very disappointing .
 Wish I could have given it zero stars . This program froze up both of my computers -LRB- the laptop and the desktop -RRB- . I configured and reconfigured again and again , but to no avail . As far as scanning goes , it scanned the laptop -LRB- before freezing -RRB- but it would not complete a scan on the desktop -LRB- then it froze -RRB- . I did a hard shut down on both computers and then booted them up again , only to freeze after the first ten minutes . This was a waist of my money -LRB- and time -RRB- . Oh , and when I tried to contact ZoneAlarm -LRB- they have this funky ` live chat that is n't live chat ' thing and then it told me to email them -RRB- . So , I emailed them and wait , no response . I emailed them a second time and waited 3 maybe 4 days . They gave me a list of things to do and undo and do again . FORGET ABOUT IT !!! Done , done , and done . Just give me my money back and I 'll forget I ever met them . ** but I forgot , I ca n't get my money back , what a trip ** . Good Luck to anyone who is BRAVE .
 I went to Zone Alarm because I was unhappy with another product . That was a big mistake . I run VER 8 it has caused loss of internet connectivity . This is very similar to the problem that occured in July when they put out an update that conflicted with a MS XP update . I lost many hours on that fiasco . This tim it did n't take me as long to try turning ZA off . Sure enough after turning ZA off I was able to connect . I run ZA on two computers one still has Ver 7 , no connection proble with this one . The one updated to VER 8 is the one that would n't connect.A second issue is I am constantly bothered with warnings about suspicious program activity . ZA says that it does n't know what to do about this but yet I am supposed to . I bought the program to do this for me.What a piece of junk.At least the other vendor would talk to me and did finally offer me a free upgrade . Unfortunately I had already bought ZA by that time . What a mistake .
 I have used Zone Alarm since it was freeware and until very recently , did n't have a complaint . I ended up with a virus on my network , even with ZA on all four computers . I thought this was nearly impossible with all of the security installed and running 24/7 . I switched to full system checks , hoping that it wo n't happen again . However , this has intensified my dislike for ZA , since running the virus checker took over 9 hours on one computer and is still running on this one , 23:07 hours after I started it . I do not have * that * much info on this computer , it has only scanned 36,000 files in that time!Everything takes much , much longer than it should . Simply booting the system takes 5-8 minutes to complete , from pushing the button to the desktop loading . Opening IE takes around 30-45 seconds and then you have to wait for the home page to load , which takes a few more seconds , if it does n't crash first . You never know if a program is loading , you just click and walk away , hoping it will load by the time you grab some water , check the mail , answer the phone and get back to the computer chair.I 'm not exaggerating in the least on any of this , it 's utterly ridiculous .
 DO N'T BUY IT - POWER HUNGRY - LOCK UPS - MAKES YOUR COMPUTER WORTHLESS - I USED IT ONE DAY AND COULD N'T UNINSTALL IT FAST ENOUGH - I CA N'T SAY ENOUGH BAD THINGS ABOUT IT - WHAT A WASTE OF $ 50JAMES
 I just recently purchased ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite version 7.0 to replace Norton Internet Security 2007 and have found it to be unacceptably unstable . Norton was slow , but it was never unstable.ZoneAlarm seems to have multiple memory leaks that consume massive amounts of memory without returning it to the system . For example , the Outlook Express spam filter will consume all available memory if you leave e-mail open . Many times the entire internet suite consumed so much memory and CPU , I had to reboot my computer . It seems they 've known about these memory leaks for some time , but have n't done anything to address them.Checkpoint Systems , the author of ZoneAlarm refuses to provide a refund . They offer refunds on only certain boxed versions of their product even though the base version 7.0 is the same revision I purchased . This is an inconsist refund policy.ZoneAlarm used to be a good product once upon a time ago . It is n't now and I wo n't be purchasing ZoneAlarm ever again in the future.Avoid ZoneAlarm at all costs .
 Let me say first that I wanted to give this ZERO stars but Amazon would n't let me.I bought this because I always thought the Symantec product I had been using was slower then it needed to be . So when my license expired I read all the reviews and decided to try ZASS . BIG , BIG MISTAKE . In short , DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.It is worse than the worst virus you have ever had or can imagine.startup / Login will take 3 to 5 minutes . shutdown can take up to 1/2 HOUR.Switching users can take 10 minutes . Support is non-existant unless you want to spend $ 2.95 a MINUTE to talk to someone . Otherwise you have to rely on a user 's group forum . When I called sales to complain they took all the particulars about one of my problems and said tech support would contact me . Still waiting.Installing and updating can be a nightmare . Steven King could n't have writen a more horrifying script . To give you some idea , the `` New , easier , uninstall instructions '' have you re-booting 3 times , editing the registry , searching for and deleting 19 file/directory names and maybe re-booting in SAFE mode . If this does n't scare you , you must be the type who likes to climb the Empire State building on the outside . And if you think , well I wo n't ever have to remove it , wait till you till youtry to update the version in the box with the new improved version that will `` fix all your problems '' -LRB- quoting the sales person -RRB- . After the update you do n't have much of a machine left . The update fails by going into an infinite loop that you have to use task manager to kill . Then you ca n't get on the internet to look at the user 's forum so you have to call support , CACHINK , CACHINK.Their solution to fix your now hosed system is to use the `` new , easier unistall instructions '' and install the update as a new install . This also hangs in an infinite loop . Tried this several times to no avail . And by the way , many other people had reported this problem.And like I said above , all that install , update , uninstall , install , etc. etc. was all to try to fix just ONE of the problems . Another nice bug is that all the other user ID 's -LRB- not the admin that installed ZASS -RRB- have to go through the configuration wizard every time they logon . Tried all the `` fixes '' in the user 's group forum I could find and nothing fixed it.If this has n't convinced you to not buy this product , go to their web site then to their customer support page to technical support and then enter into the user 's group forum and search for SAFE MODE . I got 317 PAGES of hits . They seem to think SAFE MODE is normal . Just for kicks I searched for REGEDIT . 29 PAGES of hits.And , BTW , I finally solved all my problems by doing their uninstall process 3 times and installing the new Norton Internet Security 2008 . Night -LRB- mare -RRB- and Day .
 I purchased Zone Alarm and it crashed my computer ! I wrote to the company right away and they refused to offer me a refund . After everything I had to go out and spend more money on Norton which works beautifully . Do n't buy this product it works terrible and the company wont stand behind its product !
 I purchased the three user license , downloaded the latest release from ZA 's website , and installed on three fairly new XP PC 's . All have from 512 - 1 GB RAM and processors at least 3 GHz . This program killed ALL THREE . The other reviews were totally accurate , boot and shutdown take forever , the computer slows to a crawl , everything just dies . Click to open a browser and wait five minutes , click ctrl + alt + del for task manager and cross your fingers because even that is hosed . And if you see the icon indicating a scan is in progress , you might as well go find something else to do for an hour or two . The scan takes forever and it completely freezes your PC for the most part . You have a better chance of hitting the lottery than successfully deactivating the scan -LRB- or active updates -RRB- . I tried everything , tweaked all the settings , checked for updates , tried all the suggestions from the ZA forums and support boards . Nothing worked . And I 'm not a computer newbie . After finally getting fed up , I tried several times to uninstall but I keep encountering an error that the `` truevector '' service can not be stopped . So I 'm basically stuck with it unless I go in and rip it out manually . I just activated my license at the beginiing of the summer but I am so disgusted with this product I plan to uninstall it from all three PC 's and go with something different . I hate wasting the money on this program , but I honestly do n't know what happened to Zonealarm . This version of ZAIS is easily the worst AV product I have ever used ... . EVER .
 DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT !!! Foolishly , I did n't listen to the other reviewers on this site . Nothing but problems . The first thing ZoneAlarm did to my computer when I tried to install it was give me the Blue Screen of Death and crash my notebook computer . I rebooted and ZoneAlarm crashed it again . So I rebooted in Safe Mode , uninstalled ZoneAlarm , deleted the folder , and rebooted again . Problem solved . Then I snapped the disk in half . I was n't even going to ask for a refund or try any of the workarounds - downloading updates , installing in safe mode , etcetera . I 'll just buy something else . If I could give this product - negative five stars , I would . This is a terrible , awful , dangerous software product . Maybe they 'll fix the problem in a later version , but right now ZoneAlarm is not ready for Vista . DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT !!! STAY AWAY !!! I hope this review helps you .
 PS - for some reason the url to the Zone Alarm download page for older versions in my original postig was deleted by Amazon . Probably a filter to prevent spam . In any event , go to Frankie from PA 's 8-28-07 review here for the link -LRB- somehow he got it past the Amazon filter -RRB- . xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI was very happy with the 6.0 to 6.5 versions of the security suite I used on several computers . Then I upgraded when prompted to 7.0.337 . Things ran a bit slower but still acceptable . Then I saw this great price here at Amazon on a three computer license and jumped on it . I downloaded this latest version of ZA 2007 from the CD sent and watched my computers die . It took for ever to boot up and start all the start-up programs but turning the machine off was even worse . Seemed like it took forever ... at least 5 minutes or more.The solution ? I went to :[ ... -RSB- I downloaded 6.5.737.000 and then used the new license number and everything is just fine . Sad that such a good company as ZA would put such garbage out . You think they would have enough sense to stick with what works and wait till they had it right before releasing it.My experience also makes me wonder about all the PC zines like PC mag and ZDnet which raved about the 2007 version and said little or nothing about the problems the vast majority of us writing reviews have had . ZA must have thrown one great party to get them to write what they did !
 I lost trust if a company failed me twice.As many users found out update version 7.0.047 is a piece of junk , I must roll back to version 7.0.462 to make the software work again.This is the second time ZoneAlarm did to their customers or at least , me.My side job needs me to try out many different -LRB- security -RRB- software and recommend to my clients , so sorry ZoneAlarm is currently out of my list.Also , I need to call and follow up the rebate or they just think it 's their money.Although Norton is a bit bulky , their software is as good as ZoneAlarm and rebate check arrived within a month and worry free -LRB- big improvement compare with past history -RRB- .
 There really is in my opinion the only thing that I liked above other security software is the email checking.On the negative side the software is constantly updating itself which on my PC slowed it down or stopped other use . When doing a virus check with only 25G in use it would completely stop all other use for over an hour -LRB- I could play solitare if I did n't change games -RRB- .
 Yikes , I had read some great reviews on this product and as it was time to renew McAfee I figured go with a higher reviewed product . Bad idea . I do n't know if deleting McAfee screwed up my laptop or if Zone Alarm is just poorly written , but I had nothing but problems . And to make sure they drove me nuts their Tech department does n't speak to the customer they send random emails ... how 's 24 + hours strike you for response time . Stick with your current internet security suite , Zone Alarm may work for you , but then again it may not . . but happily , and kind of oddly , their customer service department moves QUICKLY when asking for a refund .
 I had been a Norton Security user for years and years . However , when my 2005 version was up for renewal on both my desktop and labtop , I balked at paying Norton 's higher renewal rates or purchasing a whole new version of Norton . So after some research I switched to Zone Alarm 6 - 3 user license . It worked wonderfully . I could actually still work on my computer as it was scanning for both spyware and antivirus unlike the Norton . The firewall worked very well . It was easy to install , easy to configure and had very little impact on system performance . It seemed I had found a better solution to the somewhat bloated and system hungry Norton . Thus , I was quite happy to renew my Zone Alarm subscription for this year . However , I 'm not sure what happened with the build 7 of Zone Alarm . It first caused problems with me receiving emails through POP3 account via Outlook 2003 , my computer did n't always shut down , I could no longer use the InCD burning capabilities of Nero 6 -LRB- even after updating the Nero 6 -RRB- and the final straw was that the antivirus hung up on a small system file on my spare SATA drive called tracking.log . Excluding this file or even the entire drive was n't an option given how aggressive spyware , viruses and other nasties could be out there . The problem with the email actually was not an uncommon problem and the forum gurus at Zone Alarm did n't have much of solution which was to use the 6.5 build of Zone Alarm -LRB- 2006 version -RRB- or just wait . I have switched back to Norton which has a very affordable 3 computer license , much less of a system impact than the 2005 and apparently the 2006 and is a well established company . I will simply have to write off my expense of Zone Alarm . I did fill out their survey notifying them of my problems and hopefully they will fix them .
 March 15 , 2009
 ZoneAlarm Security Suite 7.x has been the single worst piece of software I have used in 20 years of computer programming . ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 6.x is somewhat better , but still not ideal for my system . Below describes why I feel this way : It crashes fequently , which takes down the internet -- sometimes within one minute of using the internet . The only way to bring it back is to reboot the computer . A less than ideal solution . When I searched the Web about the crash , it seems to be a well known problem , even to the ZoneAlarm folks , but they do n't seem to have fixed in it subsequent releases.Also it takes over 100 megabytes of RAM , and the computer runs * MUCH * slower with Zone Alarm running . It takes many times longer to boot and log onto the computer with it installed than with out it.Constant crashes , and a much slower computer . I am going to replace it with another firewall as soon as possible , and consider the money I spent on ZoneAlarm Internet Security to be wasted .
 I purchased this product to replace Norton Internet Security 2005 as my subscription was expiring . I felt it was time for an update , but NIS 2007 was poorly rated . I was n't familiar with Zone Alarm before researching , but high ratings from PC mags and early reviews here convinced me to give it a try.ZA might be a good product , but it most certainly hated my Dell with XP . ZA caused more anomalies on my PC than I 'll try to list , but some included the complete failure of some web pages to load , page-loading-scroll bars that never went away -LRB- as if the page never completely loaded -RRB- , repeated requirement to constantly log-in to sites over and over -LRB- i.e. ebay and others -RRB- where one log-in normally covered an entire session . Automatic scans -LRB- virus ; spyware -RRB- seemed to run ok , but scans that I initiated manually nearly always resulted in PC lock-ups . As I said , too many anomalies to list . I tried virtually every security level setting on every feature of the program to no avail.After a couple of months I dumped ZA in favor of the new Norton Internet Security 2008 , and I am thrilled .
 Up until last year we 'd used Norton , from the dark ages of computers , where Norton had its start , until 2006 . Under the influence of the multi-national behemouth Digital River , who 'd acquired it , it went downhill and became a royal pain in the arse , awful , more problems than solutions and non-existent to useless support . We started looking for options as the time came to try and expurgate all the Norton junk gumming up our computer . Someone suggested ZoneAlarm Security Suite and after reading a few reviews we decided to give it a spin , and purchased the 2007 edition.ZoneAlarm has a lot of the same frustrations built into it that Norton had , with possibly a few bonus ones . I have had to uninstall and reinstall it several times , but that never solves all its problems . I found that when offline and this program was no longer present , everything worked fine , but when back online and using ZoneAlarm for security 's sake , all the problems return ~ slow start up , slow everything , and this damned memory hog is constantly scanning and using as much as a third to a half of the CPU or more . It causes continual freezes and I suspect as also being responsible for some unexpected shutdowns ~ and when it 's running either of its scans , like the weekly ones for viruses or spyware , well , you just have to leave the computer alone with it , as the computer ceases to be able to do anything else ... The constant alarms thrown up , once it ` learns your computer ' , are uninformed of what they are throwing an alarm up for , making them mostly useless , including being ignorant of basic stuff , like the Mircrosoft Windows Operating System , XP in our case , not seeming to know what is and is n't acceptable or the norm . Most of the alarms fail to give a clear explanation of what it 's on about , so deciding whether or not or which button to push ~ you are n't given enough to know what to do . They do n't seem to have a clue so how can you be expected to ? If , as it also does , it throws something like that up without an explanation and you decide one way or the other , out of ignorance of knowing exactly what the effect will be , and you push a button ~ YOU , or ME , WE suffer the consequences of ZoneAlarm 's lack of detail.I urge us all to vote with our wallets , something we ca n't do over the government 's protected pet Microsoft . Please stop supporting businesses that ca n't produce a product that really is useful , helpful , intuitive and kind to the user . As this program currently stands it fails on all counts , and holding back a few viruses and hackers just is n't enough if it makes the rest of your computer aswamp with frustrations and raises ones blood pressure and ire.Is there anything to be trusted to run without these infestations of bugs ? I live in hope , but , I promise you , these two , Norton and ZoneAlarm , in their current state , are awful , pains in the backside , causing as many problems and frustrations as they profess to prevent , seeming as bad as the viruses , spyware and hackers they claim to protect us from.When ZoneAlarm Security Suite 2007 expires we 'll be looking again for an alternative . Who knows , maybe even Norton or ZoneAlarm may have awoke and done some serious reconsidering and work and made a program that can be depended on without all the endless other hassles ... I 'm not expecting that , but would be pleasantly surprised if they did . I hope someone does or has ...
 I am not sure what happened with ZoneAlarm Security Suite 7 but It is the worst ZoneAlarm I ever used.It is a Resource Hog and will bring your PC to its knees . Every Time , I tried to kill the ZoneAlarm , It was updating the virus definations all the time -LRB- 24 hours a day -RRB- !! . You ca n't kill it , no matter what you do . It will frequently lock your pc and it get to the point , you just ca n't handle the freeze of PC.I wasted my money on this and went with Trend Micro and much happy with it since then.I am not going to use ZoneAlarm until I read 4 Star reviews or it improves and even then I will put it on my test PC to confirm.Till then , Bye ZoneAlarm for now . . I strongly think they should refund the money and do some Quality testing on this product . I used to love the ZoneAlarm Suites so hated to write bad review but ca n't help with this release.Once you install ZoneAlarm on a PC , you will surely know what ` Frustration ' feels like . Worst ...
 I am running Windows Vista Home Premium . Every time I try to install Zonealarm Internet Security Suite , it shuts down my computer . The only way I got the program to install was in safe mode . But , after restarting the computer it would immediately shut down once zone alarm began to run . I liked the previous versions , but this one is a big disappointment . I am now trying the trial version ofKaspersky Internet Security 6.0 Internet Security Suite . So far no problems and it appears to have awesome protection features that work very well .
 Well , I have had this software installed on an old Dell Windows 2000 machine and on a new home-built Win XP machine based on an Intel motherboard for less than a year . I can not say that I have been too happy with the overall performance of this product , but it seems to be working well now that it has the latest patches.By the way , they do n't tell you that their version 8 and higher software does not work with Windows 2000 . So if you want to run an old Win 2K matchine , do n't go for this software unless you can get the last of the Version 7 software - version 7.0.483.000 . I had the same negative experiences that the above reviewers had , but again , they are now corrected . My XP machine does run the latest version 8 software and it seems to be working great . My Win 2K machine has to run version 7.0.483.000 . and it does OK . Ca n't really complain about the Win2K machine as it is so slow anyway and is no longer supported by Microsoft anyway.Regarding the reviewers that gave this software a 5 star rating . I find it hard to believe that these are legitimate reviews . I would actually suspect these reviews as being sales pitches from the Zone Alarm folks . I find that this company is a little questionable in how they deal with their customers and their customer service . I have seen them delete negative comments on their software from their user forums . They have never lied -LRB- that I am aware of -RRB- , but I simply felt that they do their best to put a rosey picture on their product . As one reviewer above noted , their Tech Support put the blame on my other programs when ZA practically brought my XP machine to its knees . I also was told to disable my other programs until I found `` the culprit '' . Well I did n't do that . I have those programs on my computer because I want them there . Better that ZA should fix their product , which they eventually did . However , they never simply came out and took the blame for a defective product update.I used to love their free firewall and this was why I decided to try their full service product . Hopefully these bad experiences were just growing pains that ZA is getting past , but they have damaged their reputation by failing to be completely forthcoming with their customers.The unwritten rule of bad publicity
 I would give this a ZERO RATING if possible . NOT COMPATIBLE with Spyware Doctor -LRB- A totally excellent program ! -RRB- . ZONE ALARM customer service is below terrible . Never had these problems with NORTON INTERNET SECURITY . Also - Zone Alarm Customer Service said there were OTHER SERIOUS problems with Zone Alarm 8 .
 ZoneAlarm used to be an outstanding product now it 's just horrible . Boot/shutdown times can hit the 7-10 minute range if you have certain other software installed on your computer . What other software - every day software like Nero Burning ROM and a variety of others.Spend some time searching the ZoneAlarm user forums reading about the boot/shutdown issues and will find that many other applications you may already have on your computer do n't sit well with ZoneAlarm causing ZA to be extremely slow.Normal every day software causes ZoneAlarm to be slow ? Does n't sound right but it 's not a joke . This formerly great product is now completely down the tubes . The ZoneAlarm forum moderators post their canned responses to this issue and Tech Support recommends you uninstall the offending normal every day software or make registry tweaks to improve performance.Bottom line
 Having used Zone Alarm since it was owned by a small company in San Francisco over 4 years ago I have seen the product decrease in it 's ability to function severely over the years . Apparently ever since an Israeli corporation took over things started to change . Even for free I would run , not walk away from Zone Alarm ! I switched to Kapersky . Hope my input helps
 I installed this on three computers , my desktop , my laptop , and my wife 's desktop . It slowed my desktop to the point that I could n't use it . Slowed the others quite a bit . Emailed customer service , they suggested that I clear all start up programs to determine if one had a conflict with Zone Alarm . Hey I already knew what the conflict was it was zone alarm , so I un-installed it and everything worked fine . I have used their firewall for years and loved it . Apparently they have overloaded this suite with to much stuff . Do n't take the chance to waste your $ s on this
 I had this on my Windows Vista Ultimate and it makes everything slow on my dual core processor . Not only this it made my computer not able too connect to the internet ! DO NOT USE Zone Alarm for Windows Vista at all!There are other Free Programs much better than Zone Alarm . I Use AVG 8.0 now and its Much better !
 I have been a long time customer of ZoneLAbs and have ALWAYS depended on the quality and intuitive UI of the firewall.Unfortunately , the version 7 . xxx 3-license security suite has let me down and moved me away from the product -LRB- I hate paying for bad software -RRB- . My experience reflects an easy install and configuration , just as in previous versions . I installed a license on Windows 2000 Workstation , on XP Media Center Edition , and Vista Business.The Windows 2000 had been with ZA for YEARS . After a couple of months , I was suddenly unable to get email from my ISP . I shut down ZA and no problem . I un-installed and cleaned out the ZA per tech . support help and re-installed . Everything worked well for about 2 weeks and then it began blocking applications randomly -LRB- except ping ! -RRB- . I replaced it with Symantec and it seems to be doing well.The Vista worked as expected and had no problems , however I wiped it out and installed the 64-bit SP1 version -LRB- so I could actually USE the 4GB RAM installed -RRB- . ZA has dropped the ball with the 64-bit world . It seems they are getting out of the business -LRB- after all , all CPUs are 64-bit now , the system vendors will catch up soon and install the 64 bit OS 's -RRB- . I replaced ZA with Norton -LRB- granted , a 32-bit version -RRB- and I have no problems.The media center IS a nightmare . Yesterday , it suddenly stopped letting ANY traffic through -LRB- except ping ! -RRB- . No email , no Internet , no web-enabled applications ! I dutifully un-installed and tried to re-install , got the infamous -LRB- and quite common -RRB- `` You do not have access to make the required system configuration '' . This has been around for several versions and they have not bothered to fix it -LRB- I tried logged in AS administrator , and as an account in the Admiinistrator group -RRB- . I wiped the registry and the file system , and it just wo n't let me re-install . Now I am shopping for virus scanning software!An interesting side note
 I bought a new Dell desktop PC in 2006 that came with Norton Internet Security 2006 . I found the suite to require too many firewall alerts . Sometimes I could n't make its popups go away for more than a few minutes , no matter which option I selected . When my subscription ran out I switched to Zone Alarm Internet Security 2007 . I had used the free ZA firewall on another PC for several years with little trouble except in some terminology . I immediately found that there was less drag on my system , but still there were lots of firewall alerts if I chose a fairly secure mode . The alerts were confusing in that ZA would say that it did n't have any information to help me decide whether the site wanting in or out was ok , and often these involved the Windows system components ' attempts to make contacts or to make system changes . The terminology with respect to the handling of the `` zones '' was also most confusing . I invested many hours reading help files and online forums with little satisfaction to show for it . I had put Microsoft Windows One Care version 1.5 on my wife 's laptop about the same time that I installed ZA on mine . I could n't help but notice that she seemed to have almost no problems with using her computer . I uninstalled Zone Alarm Internet Security 2007 and installed Microsoft Windows One Care on mine . I noticed an immediate and dramatic increase in the speed of my computer . I do n't get the firewall alerts with the impossible choices that I got every day with Zone Alarm . I have never been a Microsoft fan . Most of their stuff is too complicated and buggy , but Windows One Care is simple and effective so long as you do n't get tangled up in the mess Microsoft calls `` Help '' . Zone Alarm Internet Security 2007 offers lots of options , but I believe for the typical PC user , even one with some experience and patience , it 's not worth the trouble that it causes .
 My search continues for an antivirus program that does n't behave like a malicious virus itself . I have time to write this review because Outlook is auto-archiving the folders that were damaged while ZoneAlarm was at work . This program slows my computer down to a crawl , often having me wait for 10 or 15 minutes while the PC is frozen . Is there ANY antivirus program out there that does n't behave like a virus ?! ZoneAlarm IS N'T it !!! Help !!!
 I just want to reinforce what other people are saying about ZA being a resource hog . YES , IT IS A RESOURCE HOG . I just installed it on my mom 's Dell P4 -LRB- XP -RRB- , and the computer instantaneously went from having a 20-second startup to having a 5-minute start-up . Everything has slowed down . My God . It 's not worth it . Why do they feel they can release software this bad ? It 's obscene .
 Based on reviews and recommendations , I tried ZoneAlarm for the last two years . Upgrades have almost always had problems . These are well documented in the ZoneAlarm forums . They seem to push out updates , sometimes automatically , before they are well tested . Specifically , I 've had to continually workaround a known conflict with the Cisco VPN software that I use . The performance for the ZoneAlarm software has gotten increasingly worse . I have since switched to the latest Norton Internet Security 2009 , which appears to be a HUGE performance improvement . The system now boots in under a minute instead of 3-4 minutes .
 This product works reasonably well on XP , but on Vista it 's a WHOLE different story . I have never used a product that has caused me so much grief and frustration . What 's wrong ? 1 . Frequently shuts down all HTTP traffic for no reason . Happens every so often , randomly .2 . Every once in a while it denies access to all programs , so clicking on any icon results in a message saying you 're not authorized . Only cure is to reboot .3 . When updating itself from the internet -LRB- often -RRB- , everything else on your computer grinds to a halt - for a long time .4 . Restarting the computer with Zone Alarm turned off results in being unable to access the internet at all . I 'm not even sure I can get rid of this thing , which has been much worse than any real virus.It was bad enough that I installed this on my own computer and have had to deal with hours of grief , but putting it on my wife 's computer has almost caused a divorce.I strongly recommend against using this product on Vista in its current form .
 The 2007 ZA ISS -LRB- 3 seat license -RRB- is causing my computers -LRB- XP , Pentium 4 , 2 gig RAM -RRB- to start much slower , perhaps by another minute or two . What 's worse is that my computers now take over 10 minutes to shut down -LRB- and sometimes does n't shut down at all -RRB- !!!!! It used to take about 20-30 sec before with the 2006 version . I now regret buying this POS .
 I see I 'm not alone in my frustration with this product . I bought ZASS after seeing that it scored highly in several ` reputable ' publications and websites -LRB- which I 'll now take with a hefty grain of salt from now on -RRB- . Seemed like a good deal until I installed it . The constant warnings and alerts were annoying but expected . What was n't expected is the way ZASS totally takes over my pc on startup . I have to wait anywhere from 1 minute to over 5 minutes for ZASS to finish loading up , initializing , scanning ... whatever it is . Even after the initial startup I experience lock ups lasting a minute or so . A minute might sound like a minor annoyance but when you 're on the internet or running a program having your pc lock up a half dozen times over a period of a couple of hours it becomes more than a ` minor ' problem . For a supposed finished , non-beta product that you paid for it 's inexcusable . No renewal from me .
 An absolute failure ! NO accessability to graphics , ie , photos , stored in the hard drive . Minimum , hard to manipulate program . If you can compare to version 6 , Broderbund has not produced a program since that has equalled it , and all print shop programs do not allow a standard photo image size of 8x10 inches .
 I have bought Print Shop in the past and they were great , but this one is horrible ! There are so many glitches in the program . I would definatly NOT recommend this to others .
 The review from Jim Havranek of San Francisco is from a guy who works at Broderbund . I used to work there , and I remember him . He 's a sales guy , and is clearly just trying to pump up sales . Be careful who you trust on these reviews , because I 'm sure their marketing people are told to post favorable reviews .
 The most useless and unfriendly program ever . Why did they release this bummer ? Do n't spend your money on this turkey ! It does not rate one star
 Very in happy with print shop 12.0 it dose not work right and this is my second one . I love all my past print shops very much And so sad that is new one dose not work the way I want it too . I just do not know what to do .
 I bought this product because in the front page of the box it anounced that it was a Virtual Makeover 2002 version . After installing the product I realized that it was a boundle of Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover 3 and the Fashion Makeover Deluxe , -LRB- both products from year 2000 -RRB- that information did not appear in the offering of Amazone nor in the description of the software . After searching if there it was a mistake from the Company I realized that in the back of the box with very tyny letters it was something written about the boundle -LRB- Amazone does n't provide information about the back of the box -RRB- . I recommend that in the future you could be more careful and make the advice to customers saying that `` IF ... you have ... such product . . is the same version '' . I ` m very dissapointed and I feel they took my money .
 I bought this to pulish a small book with a home business . It may say `` pro '' in the title , but even an amateur user would find this software a nightmare . I might as well have thrown my money in the street for the good this software did me . There are numerous , frustrating bugs . It would appear that this software was not very well tested before it 's release . Even the download patch solves none of the problems with this poor piece of software . I have migrated to Adobe , and advise all potential buyers to beware of this software . In my opinion , this software is n't worth the plastic disc it comes on .
 My 8 year old son was so looking forward to this game , and likes to play it because he likes answering the questions to see how high he can get , but he 's wound up in tears over the nasty comments made by Regis -LRB- paraphrase - `` It 's OBVIOUS the correct answer is ` c ' - DUH ! '' -RRB- , and is frustrated when tricks not found on the show like the phone a friend person not being home fouls up the game . Perhaps older children or ones that are less sensitive may find this funny , but if your child is sensitive at all or you are trying to teach your child good sportsmanship , I would definitely not recommend this game .
 This Who wants to be a millionaire kids edition is the weakest version in the bestselling game series other than millionaire sports editon . I was actually able to win the million three times but then things started to change . Regis orders you around three times then calls you a cheater when you try to enter your provided cheat code sometimes given to you when you win the million . Second Regis if you do n't enter any name becomes a lifeline thief and steals your lifelines . Now how is that supposed to help you win the million ? I was very discouraged when Regis said no lifelines . Regis needs to sound more nice ... . And yes Regis that is my final answer
 It should be zero stars . Immediately on the Live OneCare download , Microsoft shot itself in both feet
 Despite generally good experiences with Microsoft products , Windows Live OneCare seems to have resulted in very poor performance on a brand new Lenovo PC running Windows XP . I removed it and performance has improved back to where it was , now running McAfee for virus scanning etc. .
 Microsoft selling OneCare anti-virus ? It has decided to make money off selling a fix to a problem in its original product -LRB- Windows -RRB- . That 's just offensive .
 I just bought a new laptop with OneCare 2.0 preinstalled . My system is much faster than when I used Norton and -LRB- so far - 1 month ! -RRB- I have been mostly happy with it . However , I noticed that the weekly tune-up kept coming back with a message saying `` C : / Defragmentation partially completed * . Because of high levels of disk fragmentation , starred volumes could not be completed in this Tune-Up and are marked for defragmentation in later Tune-Ups '' . I presumed this was because my computer was new and I had recently installed lots of new programs so I ran the defragmenter included in the Vista operating system which took a few hours but did the job . I then immediately ran a tune-up through OneCare and the defragmentation came back as being successful . However , 2 days later -LRB- during which time I only used the computer to check my email -RRB- , the automatic tune-up returned the same message of `` Partially completed ... High levels of disk fragmentation ... '' . After connecting with a OneCare representative via chat , I was told that the defragmenter would never complete the defragmentation process . To quote directly from the chat
 My 90 days is nearly up , Live One has never found anything wrong with my system . Curious about perfection , I ran another spyware program and found 9 TAC5 spyware , hmmm ! Live One does everything else it says it does , backups , de-frags etc - as for protection , I 'm quite concerned . In 90 days this program has missed an average of 7 risks per day , I do n't expect every program to catch everything , 1 would have given me some comfort!Thumbs Down !
 Summary : I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work , and I eventually went back to other products.In theory , integrating virus checker , firewall , spyware , and data backup into a unified suite -LRB- like MS Office with Word , Excel , & PowerPoint -RRB- makes sense . However , this software package seems poorly made ; it did not work very well for me.Hardware , OS , & primary software used :1 . Dell Lattitude D620 Laptop with 2GB RAM , Windows XP , MS Office2 . Dell X1 Laptop -LRB- thin/lightweight -RRB- with 2GB RAM , Windows XP , MS Office3 . Dell Dimension Desktop with 4 GB RAM , Windows XP , children 's gamesPrior virus/spyware products : Lattitude & X1
 There are much better anti-virus programs than this . Stay away . After scanning my computer , the program found a virus but the `` Quarantine Failed '' . That can happen with certain files , BUT incredibly the program will not tell you which file is infected ! This is a known issue mentioned on Microsoft website.Not only that , review sites state OneCare is not able to identify as many viruses as other programs . Finally , scanning your computer is much slower than competing programs if you have compressed files.On the positive side , program comes with backup/tuneup features and license for 3 computers . But software acts like BETA .
 I suppose I have myself to blame for not doing enough research , but I made the unpleasant discovery that OneCare will NOT work on Vista 64 -LRB- or xp64 -RRB- . This is totally absurd to me . The package calls it the ultimate companion for vista . It says NOTHING about 64 bit . To me , that is false advertising . It is stunning that Microsoft does not even support its own OS.Bottom line
 Microsoft has discontinued this product . `` If you have purchased a Windows Live OneCare fully packaged product in a retail store or have purchased a Windows Live OneCare activation token -LRB- product key -RRB- but have not installed it on or before October 15 , 2009 , you will not be able to use Windows Live OneCare . '' Why is Amazon still selling this ?
 Well , this might not allpy to you if you are on broadband , but if you are like me on a dialup connection , avoid this product and run the other way . As another reviewer mentions , installation took over two hours and was a nightmere . I was ready to take my losses then and there.This product requires so much time for maintenance that you might have to take time off work just to do it . I could n't do automatic updates , so each update took hours to download and install.The solution ? Do what I just did ... put it -LRB- sorry Al Gore -RRB- in a landfill and look at alternatives .
 Used one care for over a year . Problem is that it will consume all of your computers resources when you come out of standby . For example on a laptop that is in stanby and you want to check something quick , maybe a price on Amazon . When you open the lid on the laptop and the machine comes out of standby , one care essentially stops you from opening a browser or doing anything else for a few minutes . No way to stop this behavior , and no way to tell what one care is doing.Went to PC-cillin , it gives an option to stop what it is doing anytime , so you can avoid the delays caused by one care .
 Product is slow -LRB- mainly when doing a tune-up -RRB- , and somewhat buggy . I 'm waiting until my subscription expires to switch to their competitors .
 I liked the idea of having an all in one security software so I went ahead and installed this product . What a mistake !!! . I had been using AVG antivirus for a while without any problems but I wanted to have the firewall and backup feature . Everything went OK till I tried to shut down the computer , I got a blue screen -LRB- and you know what that means -RRB- and waited 10 minutes , finally I had to turn it of using the power switch . I rebooted the computer and it worked ok , I tried to do a system restore and guest what , the computer did not restart , yes ; the blue screen again . After spending several hours trying to make my computer work normally again I gave up and went to bed at about 6:00 am , later that day I had to reinstall windows XP again and lost all my data , lucky for me I had a backup and recovered most of it . Now my computer is working and I switch back to AVG after spending three days and lots of Tylenol for the headaches , so that was my experience with Live Onecare . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!! .
 I installed the product but it did not allow me to activate despite my having paid for the thing . The software apparently is not on the CD that they send you since a three hours download is required if using a modem or at least 1/2 hour with broadband . I am not sure why they even bothered with the CD since all you really get is a trial download . No phone number or any means of support or contacting Microsoft for help is provided anywhere in the product documentation . Since Microsoft does not support this product and will not let me activate a paid product , I guess I paid Amazon for a free 90 day trial . I have a dozen Microsoft products installed on my computers at home and at work but this is my first failure to activate experience . I do not recommend buying this product simply for the activation issues . I am not sure how it rates for virus protection , etc. . I did not get that far . I have nothing against Microsoft , but this product does not work for me .
 One the surface it appears to be user friendly and relatively hands-free maintenance-wise . Here 's what I have experienced :1 . Started having problems with XP shutting down and/or rebooting . -LRB- The cause as it turned out was that the services were not releasing the registry upon shutdown-determined by checking error messageas in the event viewer -RRB- When I told their support team about the problem -LRB- it occurs on all my computers running the software -RRB- I got someone who seemed to be able to `` barely spell computer '' .2 . The backup feature is almost pointless-you can do better with XP 's built in NTBackup program ALREADY installed . Also , you can not back up to another hard drive in your system .3 . The user interface is sparse and slightly cumbersome to get to when changing options . Just try to stop a virus scan in progress and you 'll see what I mean .4 . The virus scanning although thorough is quite slow .5 . The firewall is rudimentary at best compared to the full featured programs out there on the market.On the good side , you will be able to put it on three computers at a reasonable price . Just do n't expect a lot of bells and whistles with this program . And remember , Microsoft is -LRB- once again -RRB- relatively new to the antivirus market . -LRB- So take your chances -RRB-
 I have been using One Care now for 6 months and it has been nothing but trouble . At least once every week or two it will turn red and say that my pc is at high risk . When I open One Care , it says that my anti-virus and anti-spyware are out of date but it will not let me update them . I have repeatedly contacted customer service which is a total joke . If you try calling , you will sit on hold forever and if you do finally get someone , it is usually someone who hardly speaks english and does n't have a clue what to do . I have spoken to several different people and received a different answer from each person . Trying to chat is not any better . Many times I have opened up the chat window to have it say that my wait time was 3 minutes and sat online for over 30 minutes and still no one helps me . I have gone to the website and downloaded a tool that fixes the problem , but only temporarily . It will work correctly for about a week or two , then its back to the high risk status . One of the customer service reps said that it was because I was using dial-up . They said that if it ca n't update in a certain period of time , it will turn red and stop trying to update . They said that since broadband stays connected all the time , it works much better on broadband . If this is true , Microsoft should say that it is only for broadband . I do n't know if this is the true reason , but I know that I am sick and tired of this terrible product . I had McAfee previously and had no problems . I am certainly going to switch back . You would think that a genuine Microsoft product running on Vista would work better than this ! I would not recommed this product to any dial-up user . Maybe broadband users have more luck ????
 I have used LiveOneCare for eight months now , and I like the theory of its performing a complete checkup with also a backup , all in the background . In practice , however , I can not trust it to do the job I bought it for . About half the time I boot up it does not start by itself but only shows a warning that it `` can not continue '' . Microsoft 's tech support tried for a while to solve the problem but then simply gave up and stopped answering my continued email reports about the faulty starts . So now I have to click Start , Run , type in `` Services.msc '' , wait for that window to appear , scroll it all the way down to select Windows LiveOneCare , then click `` start '' in the left pane , wait about a minute for a blue progress bar to reach its end , close the services window , then wait another several minutes for the green OneCare icon to appear in my task bar , often with a pop-up bubble saying that Windows LiveOneCare is up to date . Hardly what you 'd expect from an allegedly `` set it and forget it '' utility program.The OneCare system is set to restart automatically if it encounters any problem but that feature works only sporadically and randomly about half of the time . Sometimes , my PocoMail email client can not access the ISP server until OneCare is running , and then only at the second attempt , but at other times it starts as programmed at bootup and fetches my email even though OneCare is still asleep . I have therefore to rely on Verizon 's virus filters to protect me from infected emails . That defeats of course the reason for having OneCare in the first place.Moreover , the virus scan is extremely slow and takes sometimes more than eight hours , longer than anything I ever experienced on the same computer over the years with Norton , MacAfee , Trend Micro , and ZoneAlarm.The concept of this software is good , but the execution and support are so far execrable .
 If you 're in your teens or early twenties go ahead and buy because it will have finished scanning for viruses and spyware by the time you hit your forties . I , unfortunately , will not live to see the results of my scan because it has only been running for 6 months and I 'm no kid .
 I 've been using Microsoft products since the early days , and have put up with their flaws in the past , but I just purchased this product as the box said it supported Vista , but had no mention of the 64 bit version not being supported , should have checked reviews under Amazon before buying : - -LRB- So you do n't fall into the same issue I and others have , if you really want this product and are using Vista , go to Control Panel , select `` System '' , and if it says `` System type
 We have been using Live OneCare since version 1.0 . 1.5 is a marginal improvement and it is not a very good product . We have several computers using it and plan to remove it . Currently a few computers have competitors products -LRB- evaluation stage -RRB- . All of our computers are pretty new and have powerful CPUs -LRB- Dual and Quad core -RRB- and 1 to 4 Gb of RAM . If you scan the forums on the internet you will see there are a lot of complaints about OneCare . First there are features you can not configure or turn off . We have had problems with the tune up which auto runs and you can not turn it off completly . The defragmenter has been the biggest problem . Next we have had several problems with the Firewall under Vista and had to disable it . When we replaced OneCare with a competitors product they had no problems . The back up feature is a joke . Sometimes the update feature does not work for days . -LRB- yet our other computers running competitors products update about 99 % of the time -RRB- . The virus scanner is slow . Finally it is a Microsoft product and as of August 25 , 2007 it does not support Vista 64bit or Windows XP 64 bit !! If you have a small , medium , or home based business - stay away from this product . For home use on a kids computer it may be OK but there are many other products that are 10 times better . This is currently one of Microsoft 's worst product offerings .
 I expect more from Disney , and certainly from Pixar . The opening video sequence is of the quality I expect . The game itself looks like it should come on a floppy disk and be played in a DOS window . Graphics are truly Atari style and the game is so hopelessly out of date , that I ca n't imaine any kid wanting to play it more than five minutes . My seven year old was thrilled when he unwrapped this Monsters , Inc game for his birthday gift . I 'm afraid he will be in tears when he actually tries it this morning .
 I thought my 6 year old grandaughter would like this game since she loves computer games and she also loved the movie `` Monsters , Inc '' . Wrong ... She was n't able to play it , was completely bored , and even her dad found it to be a real `` dud '' . Do n't waste your money when there 's games available like Freddie Fish or Putt-Putt which cost the same and are really great to play !!
 One of the best movies ever , gets one of the worst games ever . This game will ruin bowling for anyone . The game is frustrating because the ball will run into objects in the alley , unless you guide the ball with the arrow keys . Guiding the ball is tough , because it only moves a little , not enough to get around an obstical . If you try to move it faster it will go into the gutter . Do n't buy this game ! In short , this disc is one expensive coaster .
 I got this to play with my sons on the computer because I am terrible at computer games expect for easy games like bowling , etc. . My kids are great at games and even they had trouble with this one . It is very difficult to guide the ball around the objects in the alley and the scoring is hard to follow . My kids hate it and want me to throw it out ! I wanted to give this a `` no star '' rating but you have to put in at least one .
 I bought if for my 4 year old , and she lost intrest in less than 5 minutes . When an adult has a rough time playing it - it has to be bad ! Keep looking for something else to play .
 After you take the time to enter in all of your information you will wish that you did n't bother ! The invitation list is not forgiving to change and the information can not be sorted to show up to best suit what you need . I do not recomend this software to anyone ... unless you want your headache even bigger !
 Make sure you are running Win 95/98 , as the software wo n't even install on Win2000 . It starts up , but then complains that you have n't accepted the license agreement , which it has n't presented , and then presents a series of message boxes which can only lead to abandoning the installation.Basically , this product is unusable on Win2K .
 THe program is too old and is not user friendly .
 Repeat
 If you are looking for an ephemeris for daily transits , you will not find it here . The daily scope on the disc that I have does n't properly match day and date , for instance , Tuesday September 4 , 2000 -LRB- actual date was Monday , September 4 , 2000 -RRB- .
 This product is not user friendly . In many cases the exact longitude and latitude of the city must be entered . If you were born at 12 a.m. or 12 p.m. ; the program frequently will set your chart ahead or behind 12 hours . To give an example , I was born shortly after midnight and quite close to the Pacific Time Zone -LRB- but , still in the Mountain Time Zone -RRB- . My chart had me born after high noon and the moon in the next sign . I was able to somewhat remedy this by setting the birth time by one hour using daylight savings time . The Ascendant is still off by at least 8 degrees . A chart wheel is not with this program . The interpretations are `` cookbook '' -LRB- Sun Conjunct Moon in Aquarius will be different than Sun Conjunct Moon in Scorpio , yet the printout interpretation will be the same -RRB- . Planet / House interpretations are only given for planets in the First House . However , yet again , Saturn in Capricorn in the First House will be interpreted exactly like Saturn in Gemini in the First House . I could not in good conscience charge a paying client for printouts because of the weaknesses of this package . I bought this software package at a bricks and mortar store at a `` fire sale '' price -LRB- $ ... -RRB- . This was still too much for the product . Are there any good points ? The chart can be set to three different House Systems -LRB- Placidus , Koch , and Equal House -RRB- . Aspect Orbs can be set to your liking -LRB- 0.0-9 .9 Degrees -RRB- . If this is the best mass market astrological software package available ; wait a few years for a more acceptable package .
 I like to give perfunctory astrology charts to the newborns and their families in my life in a little bound booklet with a chart and some text showing an interpretation of the natal chart . This program can not produce a wheel ! What a waste . Furthermore , it also does not perform compatibility charts , which are fun , even if they are wrong ...
 The software has a glitch . If you were born in the evening , it comes up time of birth A.M. , no matter what you do . Also , it does n't come with any instructions .
 For really awesome software get in touch with microcycles ... Solarfire is a very good program ... do not waste your time on cheap software ... microcycles will talk to you about what your software needs are ... get programs that you can build upon and grow with ... I am an astrologer ... I have gone the path of cheap programs only to be disappointed ... microcycles has great support and prices ...
 I was deceived into believing this to be a re-issue of the 1993 Multicom publishing 's comprehensive software version of the book THE ONLY ASTROLOGY BOOK YOU 'LL EVER NEED by Joanna Martine Woolfolk that is also entitled Astrology Source . What I found was computer errors that default times and latitude/longitude settings . I contacted the company to make them aware of this , but received no reply . Caveat emptor .
 I have n't heard back from either the seller of this CD nor the actual software developer , but , I just received the CD in the mail today and I 'm angry that it 's advertised as MAC OS compatible ... . it is NOT ! I ca n't open any of the files and there 's no `` install '' file . Just a lot of files that my MAC G4 on OS 9.2 ca n't open . What a hoax !
 this cd would not work on my apple computer , I did n't know that until I had my son tray to install it for me . I 'm not very good on the computer and did n't contact the seller afterwards .
 If you are looking for a fun game to play with your kids , keep looking . My 8 year old and I could not navigate through the game even after reading the instructions several times . The play is not in 3D animation.We 're not quitters , so we read the same `` book '' in the story and wandered around the ship trying to pick up objects , but there is no place to keep an inventory and no way to `` grab '' the objects.This game is not like Harry Potter or even Nancy Drew , where you can go different places or follow a path . Its based on a 2D drawing that does n't `` do '' anything ! It is frustrating , useless and not entertaining . Save your money , even if it 's only $ !
 I bought this game for my 10 year old , and both she and I were really disappointed by it . Basically , it is a journal of Robinson Crusoe 's life on the island , with some oppoutruinities to `` try out '' some of his tasks as you read along . It is not a game , really , in that you are not required to accomplish anything before moving on ... all you can do is add color to pictures in the journal if you have successfully accomplished something described therein . Since it is never really clear just what you can try to do , and where you have to go on the island map to do it , it is very confusing.I do n't think we ever bothered to try out everything . It was too dull .
 I bought this from amazon.com . Once I received it I installed it on my mac powerbook 3400c running os 9 . It ran horribly , the quicktime images overan half of the screen window of the program so it was impossible to use on my mac . Because it also has a windows version of itself on the cd I then installed it on my husband 's pc . It ran much better on his pc -LRB- which upset me even more since it is supposed to be able to run on a mac -RRB- , however the screen was still very small , the quicktime images choppy and the viewing area incredibly small . After trying to see if I could tweak it on both the pc and mac I have had dismal success with it . Knowing what I know now I would not have bought it . The software that runs this program from the cd is achingly old as well .
 This software does not work properly on Macs . I have alerted m2k 's technical support , and they are supposed to be working on a fix . If they ever get a working fix , I will update this review . Until then , Mac users should not purchase this product .
 I bought this software to help me familiarize with basic fingerspelling . I 'm going to college in 4 months to be an interpreter , and this would n't even work on my computer -LRB- Hewlett Packard Pavillion M50 -RRB- I have windows 98 , it kept saying their was a default something and to contact the vendor . Or it would say , that it had performed an illegal operation ! It was a waste of money , I 'll never know if this could have helped me .
 This product has many problems :1 -RRB- It does n't come with a manual , this makes using it and installing it a guessing game .2 -RRB- This was written for Win 3.1 -LRB- 16-bit -RRB- , so it 's clunky in Win 95/98/Me -LRB- 32-bit -RRB- 3 -RRB- It requires that you DOWNGRADE your QuickTime to an old 16-bit version . This means you can no longer view QuickTime movies on the web ! 4 -RRB- The installer prompts you if you want to install the 16-bit or 32-bit version of QuickTime . Yet according to technical support , only the 16-bit version is compatible with this software . So why does the installer do that ?!?
 Might just be me , but I find the software to be `` dead '' on my computer . I can access the dictionary , but the video does not come up at all . Perhaps my system is too new -LRB- Windows 98 -RRB- . I really want to learn to sign , but find this product to be tedious -LRB- and out of date ?? -RRB- .
 If you have a Macintosh , do n't bother buying this product . I just got version 2.1 running on MacOS 9.0.4 , and it is just awful . The engine for the product is a FIVE YEAR old version of Macromedia Director , and has serious problems running on current MacOS and QuickTime software . The video clips get shown in the main window before getting properly positioned in the video frame , which obscures text and buttons . The operation is so slow -LRB- even on a fast G4 -RRB- that it would be effectively unusable even if it worked correctly . I 'm returning my copy.Michigan State University 's `` Personal Communicator '' works much better , though the video clips are too small to see finger positions . For a great BOOK , try Lou Fant 's `` American Sign Language Phrase Book '' .
 I have a G4 with ample memory and storage space ... This software was slow and trying to make it work was painful . The images would merge with the text . The software was clearly written for WinTel machines . I 'll rely on my human instructor for my ASL needs .
 WinFax Pro is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 2000 , according to my experience and that of many others . It crashes the computer when it attempts to install . Tech support is no help ; Symantec either does not realize their software has a problem or will not admit it . -LRB- My system
 I made numerous attempts to install WinFax Pro and it did not work . The help screens took me in endless loops back to the starting point . I use Windows 98 and Office 2000 .
 If you buy this product , be prepared to go it ALONE ! The technical support is not very supportive and I have a program that does everything advertised except send faxes . There seems to be a problem with the dialer that does not add the 1 prefix when dialing a long distance number . I got it to work by adding a 1 manually and asking it to dial the number as read but this precludes using my pim as a number source .
 I received my Winfax 4.0 for Christmas . I have uploaded it and to this day I have not been able to fax . Is there anyone out there who can help me ? I have not been able to reach any tech support . All phone #s , which are available to me are no longer in service . I have not been able to get any help searching on line .
 I started with Winfax Pro v4 .0 for Networks . It was hard to install , configure and manage . But it worked for me once the hard part was over . I have a customer who I upgraded to v10 .0 . We went from Win98 , Winfax Pro 4.1 and a Celeron 400 to Win2K , Winfax Pro v10 .0 in a P4-2 .0 Ghz machine . Everything on the machine pretty much works as expected ... EXCEPT WINFAX PRO 10 ! People that have been sending without problems for years can not send to this machine now . I have tried everything except trashing WinFax and nothing seems to make a difference no matter what I change . I have reinstalled the program . I have modified almost every setting -LRB- and changed them back when they did not solve problem -RRB- . I got the best results when I hard set the program to receive faxes only at 4800 baud -LRB- should run 14400 -RRB- . Somehow it seems to try to negotiate , then it falls back to the next slowest speed , negotiates again , falls back , etc until it either dies or receives inconsistently at 4800 . I have changed phone lines , running a cable direct to telco network interface , etc. etc. etc and still no reliable reception or sending . Not to/from a fax machine or to/from a computer . I must have 12-15 hours in working on this and still no success . It still could be one of the few things I have left to try like another computer , hard setting the COM ports in CMOS , or anything else I can think of . One thing that has not helped me is the Symantec web site .
 This product was advertised as being compatible with windows 7 , but it was not . I through it in the garbage can .
 No wonder Symantec Norton stopped making this product!Even with the upgrades to Winfax Pro 10.04 , this thing crashes my Does n't work with Windows XP or Vista Or Windows 7 computers !
 Initial comment when using Motorola SM56 Modem : Try as I might , this software does not do what its advertised to do . Send a fax . I have no problems using my system with other -LRB- cheaper -RRB- software , I bought Winfax Pro to be able to mass fax . It wont send a single one . UInable to negotiate . Receives fine . No free support either . Not even by email . Even though Ive only just bought the software . Anyway , Im a programmer , so Ive tried most things a sensible user would do to make this work . I think the software is simply buggy . Dont recoomend it at this point.Update : Winfax pro now works just fine ! Using US Robotics modems . Its fussy that way . Has some integration capabilities with Office 2000 contact list , however it is inadequate in this respect when it comes to merging contact data into the body of your MS Word Document message in order to do a bulk fax quickly.A work around is to create a Word Document with merge data contained , display each record on the screen one at a time and click on `` print to fax '' Select the recipeint from the contact list and go on to the next record . That way you can send as many personalized faxes as you like while integrating with Microsft office applications including Word and Outlook . -LRB- We use Microsoft Office 2000 Premium -RRB- Anyway , its still the best software available for mass faxing given our total experience with it now . We 've sent 14,000 faxes using Winfax Pro this year . And by the waym email support is now available free although we didnt make too much use of this . The online faqs are quite informative . In the end realize that you have to use hardware that is completely compatible even though the modem might work with some other software .
 Struggle to install , struggle to keep working , some nice features if they will work when you want them.If you can find another program to meet your needs , try it .
 Immediately upon putting the installation CD into the CD bay , I got the immediate message `` Welcome ... . The program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down . '' This happened over and over again , so I tried to do the installation manually from the Run Command Line . Still no luck . Next step was to call Tech Support for help with the installation but lo and behold there is NO FREE TECH SUPPORT OFFERED . So my choice was to try to stay on-line for Customer Service but the wait was over 45 minutes and I could n't bear to hold for that long , especially with the terrible music they subjected me to while on-hold . So I took the last option which was a $ 2.95 per minute Tech Support line that informed me that I would be charged for hold time as well as talk time . Well , considering how few choices I had , I hung out for three minutes but then the line went dead and I got that awful `` if you 'd like to make a call , please hang up and try your call again . `` I think I 've just about given up and will return the program to the retailer ... too bad , the promotional material sounded so good.Bottom line , I was forced to give this program 1 to 5 stars with this review . If it were up to me , I 'd rate WinFax PRO a big fat ZERO .
 We have used several versions of WinFax Pro and have for the most part been happy . However , version 10 and 9 have created several problems and resolving them has been a great deal of work . We are still unable to reliably receive faxes . I also learned that Symantec no longer will offer phone based support on WinFax , web site support is all that is available , and as an employee informed me today they are gearing up for internet security as there main focus . I bet WinFax will be sold off soon ?
 I originally bought WinFax many years ago , and was perfectly happy with it up through version 9.0 . Unfortunately , Symantec appears to have overreached itself with version 10.0 . Other reviewers mention the potential conflicts with newer versions of Windows and Outlook 2000 . As far as I can tell from reviewing FAQs at Symantec 's support website , the problem is incompatibility with Outlook 2000 , specifically relating to WinFax 's promised ability to send faxes by e-mail . Like me , you might decide that you do n't need that feature and skip installing it , but it still seems to trash the program itself . And , since WinFax automatically integrates with SystemWorks and other Symantec programs , it ends up trashing them as well . So what , you say , I 'll just uninstall all of them and start over . Good luck ! Symantec programs never full uninstall , so the problem 's still there when you reinstall . I finally uninstalled WinFax and replaced it with a shareware program that costs -LSB- price -RSB- , is simpler and more intuitive in its operation , and actually works . In summary , wait for version 11 .
 I purchased WinFax Pro 10 . and installed it on my PC . The nexttime I tried connecting to the internet , I got an error message thatmy modem was tied up by another device -LRB- obviously WinFax -RRB- . They have no free customer support ; their support is very expensive . I solved the modem problem by uninstalling WinFax Pro . I will not install it again , as access to the internet is a million times more important to me than using WinFax . A waste of money . Several years ago I used software called QL2FAX and had no problems with it .
 I am sitting on hold with Symantech tech services as I write this . I installed Winfax Pro yesterday on a new computer with an 866 processor and 256 of RAM . Problems . 1 . The thing runs slow as molasses . 2 . The `` send fax as e-mail feature '' does n't work at all . There are tons of people on their on-line question board plaintively calling for the same help I am seeking now . 3 . The cover page editor is a joke . There is n't one convenience built-in . Creating your own cover page is a tedious and annoying process . 4 . You ca n't stop the phonebook from inserting the name of your recipient in Last Name , First Name format . Thus , you ca n't stop from being rude to your recipients
 We installed an upgrade to our Mac operating system and it would not handle the old appleworks which had all our information from years past . Unfortunately , our new system would not handle 6.0 so we were dead in the water . We have not retrieved the information we had in the old appleworks program . The short of it is , since the program did not load , we have not used it .
 if you do n't have a reason beyond `` it 's new '' to upgrade my advice is `` for the love of God - DO N'T '' .
 There are still multiple issues within this version of the OS . I recently upgraded from Tiger and after 1 week of use I have decided to go back . Since using Leopard my productively has drop to nearly nothing because I spend most of my time trying to fix patches , or trying to figure out a work-around since I have so many problems with certain programs . Among many smaller problems I have run into the most serious issues I have with Leopard are the ones below.Mail
 Only ONE single DVD install disc comes in the family pack -LRB- for 5 users -RRB- . You can not create duplicate install discs for each user - any copies created look/verify as perfect but are not bootable , so can not be used for emergencies . Not good a good buy for families with busy , independent teens who need their own install disc !
 Apparently the folks at Apple have decided to follow the lead of Microsoft - release a product that is not quite ready for prime time . Leopard is full of new features and updates , Safari 3 , Time Machine and Stacks just to name a few . Some are very good -LRB- Safari 3 and Time Machine -RRB- some are just OK -LRB- Stacks -RRB- . Over 300 new goodies according to Apple.But there is one problem - wireless connectivity . Upgrade now and enjoy the plethora of new features , just be prepared to lose your wireless connection every 5-10 minutes . Thats right , there is a major bug in Leopard . At first I thought I was doing something wrong , but within a week of the release message boards were flooded with people experiencing the same problem . Thankfully I limited Leopard to my PowerBook G4 only , but unfortunately that is the main Internet PC in our family.A few weeks have passed and we are still waiting for a much needed fix . Until then , I have to warn anyone that uses a wireless connection as their exclusive connection to the Internet to avoid Leopard.NOTE - Nov 17 - Installed 10.5.1 this morning . 12 hours later and no problems with the wifi ! Unfortunately I can not increase the star rating .
 Multiple crashes , lost calendars , frequent network connectivity drops . 10.5.1 update did n't fix much for me . My recommendation would be to wait until 10.5.5 +
 The Leopard `` improvement '' should not have been sold or recommended by Amazon untill the interface with AOL was fixed . One can not attach documents and if one is responding to an Aol Tech Support Email , the program crashes . Apple should have done better than to put this on the market with what is for many of us some woeful glitches .
 Amazon really messed up this order . I accidentally gave them the wrong delivery address in Del Mar , CA instead of Corona Del Mar , CA , but I sent them emails immediately to make a correction . Got no response , so I sent a msg asking them to call me immediately , which they did -- 3 times . On one phone call , I got a lady on the phone , gave her the correct address , and she put me on hold for 15 minutes , then I got disconnected . I gave up because I was told repeatedly -LRB- and it says this also on the website -RRB- that if it is delivered to the wrong address , do n't worry , it will be returned . I just have the inconvenience of ordering again . No big deal . But this did n't happen . They delivered it to the wrong address -- it was not returned , and now I have informed my credit card company that I will not pay the bill . Huge mess that could 've been avoided . I really tried.Apple Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard -LSB- 5-User Family Pack -RSB-
 It 's premature to judge the value of many of 10.5 's new features . I 'm pleased with the improvements to Mail , iCal , and iChat . There are , however , some serious problems that should give a buyer pause . Apple has changed the Finder menus so that they are translucent . The lettering is no longer black-on-white unless you choose white as your wallpaper , which is hardly pleasing . I 've compromised by choosing a solid light blue , but for the sake of efficiency and clarity nice designs and pictures are out . There is no corrective for the translucent pull-down menu
 Nothing to blame except my own cluelessness . I bought this upgrade without realizing that once I installed it I could not run any OS9 applications . I run a printing company and have to call up files dating back 10 years -LRB- Pagemaker/Typestyler -RRB- , plus I have to be able to open any old files my customers bring in . Guess I 'll stick with OSX .4.11 for the time being and sell this upgrade on eBay or something .
 OS X is a twin of tiger with a new black apple in place of the mighty blue apple in the upper left corner of the screen . Tiger w. coverflow is what you get and yes it still has the same level of functionality as an IPOD touch/classic . mac 's / OSX Still ca n't run games , or even 1/3 of what Vista/7/XP / 8 can , but hey it is capatable with anything from the over priced Apple store , same goes for applications and programs . Get a PC w. windows so much easier and you can rest easy knowing that you can use anything you want program wise , hardware wise or otherwise with ease and wont have to fight with your mac or download watered down mac ports of great windows programs to try and get by . Appleheads stop making excuses for Apple 's over priced short commings , lies about being the most advances OS -LRB- marketing BS -RRB- and use what you want when you want on Windows . There is no excuse for using a broken , garbled , limited OS like OSX . OS X has been the same since it was released for god 's sake with a different color Apple ... wow.VISTA / Windows7/XP/Windows8 >> >> >> >> >> >> OSX cat -LRB- insert version here -RRB- .
 I pre-ordered 10.5 Leopard . The disc was here before the general availability . The disc was damaged . It would read on my old PowerMac , but as it 's so big and dual layer , the intel portion would not work . I had to call apple , wait 55 minutes on the phone and then drive to the nearest apple store to get a new DVD . Upon arriving , I was hassled by the employees about not having a receipt . I could n't print it since my Mac would n't boot . The printer was not connected to the other system . 10.5 disabled booting my Mac . I could only get into single user mode which is a shell prompt -LRB- unix command line -RRB- . After getting a new disc , I could do a fresh install . I spent several hours reinstalling and/or copying files around to get everything back together.Time Machine is nice . It does require several hours of syncing and when doing a lot of things , it will cause slowdowns using your Mac . You have good backups though.Spotlight has to re-index everything which takes some time.Mail.app now now has check box for INCOMING SSL/TLS certificate acceptance . This has been an issue for a long time . IF the certificate is self signed on your mail server , you had to go through a lot of hoops before . Those hoops are still required for OUTGOING mail . I had to set this up again.Safari 3 has some rendering issues on some sites compared to the old version . It is much better than the betas though.The transparency and new dock are ugly and harder to read . I have trouble telling if a program is open sometimes . -LRB- I use my dock on the left side -RRB- Transparency is disabled on old G4 PowerMacs , but enabled on newer Macs with beefy video cards.My wacom tablet randomly stops working in Leopard . No driver yet -LRB- other than beta -RRB- . Everything else works fine . Adobe has not updated many of their applications yet and wo n't until January 2008 . Test drive this before you buy it .
 Defective CD caused my fiance to lose contents of his hard drive with no hope of recovery . Apple Tech support suggested a re-install of prior OS X version . We knew to back up the contents , however , so many friends had no trouble , he did n't bother . What a mess ! Apple has offered to replace CD , however , they wo n't mail to APO address ... which is why we ordered from amazon to begin with . BACK UP YOUR FILES prior to an install ! Where is quality control ? I gave it one star because the system wo n't allow 0 stars .
 This OS is nice and well enough designed for Intel processor machines , but for `` Power-PC '' processor Macs , it 's a debacle . I have one of the last of the G5 iMacs -LRB- 20 '' -RRB- and it never crashed at all with Mac OS 10.4 . But with 10.5 , IT WILL CRASH EVERY SINGLE TIME I use iTunes . Sometimes it crashes when I 'm using iTunes , and sometimes it will crash after I use that program and quit the application . It does n't seem to matter what I do . And yes , this is a legal , registered version of the OS . And yes , I have re-installed it twice , all to no effect . Apple has some serious work to do to make this latest OS viable for their not-too-distant machines . I hear they are completely giving up on their G-Series machines with OS 10.6 , so if you have 10.4 , hold on to it and do n't let go . Until Apple figures it out -LRB- IF they even try -RRB- , users should avoid this OS.Thanks for reading,-CL
 April 30 , 2010 -LRB- REVISED May 5 -RRB- . So I buy a brand new MacMini from the Apple store . I have n't made ANY changes to the software at all-NO new applications installed , NO devices connected other than a brand new firewire drive . Every once in awhile it crashes . I upgrade the software -LRB- buying it from Amazon -RRB- . It still crashes . I finally trace it to Front Row , the fancy-schmancy multimedia program . I go on the web looking for solutions . It has been a KNOWN PROBLEM FOR YEARS . I email Apple customer support-NO RESPONSE.I thought I had the problem solved on Apr 30 . Nope . I spent several more days trying other supposed solutions that folks have tried and claimed to work -LRB- including shortening up titles in my nearly 5000 song collection so they wo n't scroll -RRB- . I finally gave up on front row-it 's garbage . I used to be an Apple fan -LRB- five computers in seven years -RRB- . I 'm not so sure anymore.June 13 , 2009 : Before I get too critical I want to say that I have always been impressed by Apple . Over the last seven or eight years I have owned an eMac , an iMac , two Mac Minis -LRB- two different generations -RRB- , and a Mac Notebook.I started the switch to Macs -LRB- from PCs -RRB- because they had a reputation for reliability
 Apple Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard -LSB- 5-User Family Pack -RSB- This may work well for Intel based Macs but is close to a disaster for Power PCs or at least for the PowerBook G4s we use in our company -LRB- 1.5 ghz and 1GB SDRAM -RRB- . Speed has slowed to a crawl . E.g. , to restart takes 10-15 minutes even after deducting for numerous timeouts . There is a pronounced delay when saving , opening files when changing applications etc. . Stay with the old OS or trash the hardware and buy a new Intel based Mac .
 There are a lot of gushing reviews on this new OS , and why not ? Leopard is the smartest OS I 've ever used , and the prettiest . But if you 're wondering how much this OS is really going to cost you , take a deep breath . The upgrades I need to get my essential software running on this OS total more than $ 2000 , and that 's more than I can afford -LRB- and more than the price of the most expensive iMac -RRB- . For example , my older Adobe package wo n't run on 10.5 , and the upgrade is over $ 1300 . In fact , the only older software I 've found that does run on Leopard is Appleworks 6 and a few shareware programs . Now how is it that an old Claris software program can still work without a hitch and nothing else does ? Apple and its software providers need to rethink their marketing strategy . I , for one , am not made of money .
 Using Business Plan Pro 2002 to write my business planhas to be one of the most frustrating experiencesI 've ever had.I 'm not an accountant , so I did appreciate its abilityto deal with issues like accounts payable vs. receivableand handle cash flow.Other than that , this software blows!I would have been better off struggling through creatinga business plan using a combination of MS Excel & Word.The way this software reformats spreadsheets when I tryto print my plan is driving me so nuts that I 'm willingto take the time to write this review . -LRB- I 've never written a review before -RRB- The documentation is weak at best.I thought when I bought it that the spreadsheets werejust like in excel , well that 's only partly true , theformulas are similar but the documentation , formating , printing , and ability to trace formulas out is all missing.I do n't care for this software at all , and I 'm suprised thatit 's as popular as it is.I ca n't believe that the other business plan writing softwarepackages on the market are this bad.I wish I would have known how frustrating this software wasgoing to be before I bought it and invested so much timetrying to make it work.I advise you to steer clear !
 I am not satisfied with PaloAlto 's Business Plan Pro or customer support . I am using Business Plan Pro in a Windows environment . I am running into many bugs . I list some of the problems here so that you can carefully consider if PaloAlto is the software for you.a . Charts formats change without rhyme or reason and there is no way to correct the changes.b . The later versions of Business Plan Pro are not backwards compatible . This means that version 5.0 can not read my 3.0 plans . PaloAlto charges $ 29.50 to make 3.0 plans compatible with version 5.0 ! c. PaloAlto will not support version 3.0 even though it is copyrighted as recently as 1998 and was sold up until late 1999 . How long will 2002 be supported ?
 I have a Dell laptop just purchased in 2000 so it 's not my computer system but this software has MANY bugs ! It shut down while in the middle of typing TWICE . I lost a days worth of input once and several hours a second time . It also is not a Word . doc making it MORE work to export into a Word document for others to view and read if I do n't print it out instead .
 I originally purchased Business Plan Pro and in November upgraded to Business Plan Pro 2002 as I was interested in reviewing the business plans on the web . I went out and purchased a computer for the sole purpose of the Business Plan work as I am a MAC and the software will not run on a MAC . I purchased a computer and had Windows XP home installed . I can not download the business plans from the Internet . Tech Support does not respond except to tell me things to do if I have other Windows version installed and I am not allowed to call them . Then they just quit responding . It is very frustrating and I really feel like I have wasted my money and my time . I do not recommend this software if you expect to download it .
 If you 're a beginner then this is your product although a very slow-running product with some bugs . It gets your thoughts together and coaches you through each section.There are a number of compatibility issues with their charts and Word export . Formating is locked and you are forced to reformat your complete document with new styles . Do n't even think that you can use any templates like the Word standards . Charts allow some row to be added but that crashes occationally . Certain rows are locked and data that feeds cells is not clear about where it comes from.The other Research Data they provide is bogus . Industry insight information is horrible and not even close . When I called to get an explanation , the companay passed me onto the research company which in turn got me in touch with a newbie that had no idea and made up a description of the data .
 I began using this product , glad to see that careful thought and utility of the product . But then there were bugs that caused the program to crash , and then I was saving often , and still crashing . Then I updated the software from the website , and that did n't do it . Then I contact customer support . They suggested another update , and that one I have never been able to recover from . The program will not open or run . I dare you to see if you have better luck ...
 To start a business , you DO need a business plan . You DO N'T need this software.I bought the boxed version Business Plan Pro and found it to be a waste of money . The best thing about it was the outline of the plan itself , which was a checklist of the elements that make up a good plan . The software , however , was difficult to use , and seemed oriented toward manufacturing businesses rather than service businesses . The book that came with the package was ok , but similar books can be found at the library . Save the bucks and put them into your start-up fund .
 This program promises a lot of power ... and if you can keep it running , it delivers.The interface is intuitive and easy to use . It 's loaded with predefined phrases and action-words that make the process of creating a resume really helpful . It also includes job descriptions for nearly every job you can think of . This is an especially nice touch if you 're considering changing careers and you want to fine-tune your resume with all the right buzzwords.I 've been keeping my resume up to date in MS Word , but I decided to use Resume Maker Deluxe to update it . It 's easy to paste your existing resume into Resume Maker and use that as a starting point . I added some action words and some new phrasing and had a nicely updated resume.The problem is , the program CRASHES A LOT !! I 'm running Windows XP . I have a powerful and stable computer . Resume Maker Deluxe is my only program that routinely crashes , or quits with no warning . If you 're patient and willing to put up with lousy stability this program is worth considering .
 This software is horrible ! do not order , or download it . I work in a IT dept. I am around PC 's all day . This software is buggy , and it does n't really do much . I could make a better resume in Microsoft Word much easier and faster , do n't waste your time .
 This is probably the buggiest piece of software I 've ever used . It has taken me about 2 to 3 times longer to get a resume I can actually use than it would have taken if I bought a decent book and typed it by hand in a word processor . There are plenty of suggested phrases and some of them are pretty good , but it looks like they just gleaned them all from existing resumes -LRB- they have an online posting service -RRB- rather than actually wrote them specifically -LRB- some have spelling and punctuation mistakes , and some are just awful -RRB- . The bugs in this program are unforgivable though : - Some fields in the `` wizard '' do n't transfer through to the actual resume . You end up with placholder text like , '' -LSB- Enter your description of responsibilities . -RSB- '' - If you change the section style -LRB- for example try a different layout for the jobs in your experience section -RRB- , you will lose everything you type into the old layout !!!! The pre-fab phrases will transfer to a `` scratch pad '' so you can cut and paste , but any custom edits to those phrases get tossed -LRB- changing back will wipe out your scratch pad entries , so you lose everything -RRB- I used to work in the software industry -LRB- hence the need for such a program -RRB- , and the number of tech resumes and phrases is appalling sparse , especially given the current job market . At any place I 've worked , if we released a product to the public with bugs like these , we 'd be fired on the spot.Once again , I 'm learning there are no shortcuts in life worth taking . Since I downloaded it , I doubt I can get my $ 40 back . You , on the other hand have a chance not to waste yours . If you do decide to buy it , you should eliminate applying for any accounting or finance positions ;--RRB- .
 I bought this program to take advantage of the `` Job Finder '' feature . I thought it would be nice to have a one-click meta search engine . Guess what , after 3 phone calls and a week of ownership , Job Finder still does not work properly -- only a few sites can be searched . Most site searches error out . I am told by technical support that the search program `` indexing '' falters from time to time , but they stay on top of it . A week has passed and the indexing is still off for a number of sites . A working `` Job Finder '' function is clearly not a priority . On top of this , the application is `` buggy '' and freezes frequently . Buyer beware !
 If I could get this software to do what it says on the box , I 'd undoubtedly be giving a much higher rating . Unfortunately , the bugs in the program are preventing me from making any progress . Sometimes the program shuts off with no warning , but usually it freezes up , closes on a `` division-by-zero '' error , or I simply get frustrated when the hyperlinks in the job-search window simply stop working.Yes , I 'm working in a -LRB- supposedly -RRB- compatible environment -LRB- Windows ME , latest version of IE -RRB- ... I 've never had a situation like this , where such a potentially great piece of software is rendered so useless .
 I bought the download version last week from individual software 's official site . After using it , have the following feelings :1 . whenever i click the salary finder fuction , this program crashes . Also , there are only few salary reports in this program . Much of the salary trend charts are empty .2 . Users or buyers are not properly informed that the download version is without the video function which is available in the Cd version -LRB- I was not informed about this term until i bought the download and saw the Help file in the prgram . The retail and download version both charges the same price . Why does n't I have the video function too !? 3 . I wrote an email to the company asking them to explain this issue to me and have never heard from them . Bad support .4 . it does not have even popular occupation resume sample like flight attendant , ticket service agent.In conclusion , mediocre + not as advertised + bad customer support . - > wasted 40 bucks
 Running this program has caused me nothing but problems . Running under ME , I could write my resume , but could n't use the post resume online feature . When I upgraded to Windows 2000 , I did a fresh install hoping to cure the problem I had running it on ME . It refuses to even run beyond the menu screen , all choices causes it to crash back to desktop . Even after installing a patch for this program , I ca n't get it to work under 2K . I ca n't recommend this software to anyone as it is too buggy to work properly .
 My daughter bought this . Unfortunately , the only thing it taught her is that you do n't always get what you pay for.The software does not run correctly on a top of the line Vista Home Premium system with a great video card.The company offered no assistance . The patch does not work .
 This game is a good starter computer game for children under 7 . It 's a simple game , where you feed the kitty , play a game with the kitty -LRB- move a toy mouse around and the kitty tries to catch it - if the kitty fails to catch it , you get money -RRB- , buy things for your kitty like food , water , and accessories like collars . It 's an easy game . You pick the breed of your kitty , the gender , and you type a name for your kitty . It 's not attention-grabbing , like some other games . You 'd have more fun with Dogz 5 for the computer , or Nintendogs for DS , if you 're older than 7 . They are attention-grabbing , and they have more activities for you to do . Or , even try Puppy Luv
 All of the Luv games are BORING !!! I have downloaded and played all the games thinking each one would be better than the last . You buy stuff and train then NOTHING ! There is not much to do after that . It 's also hard to make them do tricks .
 This game does not work . Period . We 've downloaded patches , upgraded to a nicer video card . Nothing works . The game stalls before it ever loads . We have one disappointed little girl and are out about 80 bucks due to the cost of the non functioning game and the upgraded video card . Do n't waste your money on this one ! It will have you pulling out your hair and your wallet again and again .
 TAKE MY ADVISE LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS THIS GAME GOT VERY BAD ONES SO DO ME AND YOURSELF A FAVOR - DONT TRY YOUR LUCK JUST FORGET ABOUT IT . HEY IF I DIDNT CARE I WOULDNT BE WASTEING MY TIME WRITING THIS SO I HOPE YOU THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING THIS , RENT IT FIRST IF YOU CAN , BUT DONT BUY IT .
 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I should have checked the other reviews here before I let my kids waste their allowance on a completely worthless game.I loaded this worthless game onto two different , new , fully updated computers and could not get the game to run properly , if at all , even after several hours of work . On one machine it would not run at all , on the other it ran extremely poorly so I downloaded the patch which only made things worse , now it will not run at all.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY !!! I am an advanced computer user with 29 years of experience with software , hardware and programming and use computers all day everyday and I could not make it work and gave up.I do not know how this company lives with itself taking money from little kids and reducing them to tears as my kids were -LRB- which explains the hours spent trying to get it to run -RRB- and I see from other postings here many other were as well.I do not think I can really say enough bad about this worthless disk - OK , almost worthless as I guess one could play Frisbee with it.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!
 I bought the game for my daughter . I have been unable to even get the game running although I meet and or exceed the requirements . I downloaded the patches e.t.c that were available but still all I get is a message saying can not initialize video mode . Daughter is very diappointed and hurt as to she was looking forward to being able to play this . Even though game does not work can not even get refund since it has been opened . Not worth the hassle . -LRB- Update -RRB- - Have written the company for about the 6th time since buying , first 2 responses were to simply download the patches -LRB- which I had informed then I had already done -RRB- now I get no response at all .
 The game crashes when you start it most of the time . It always crashes when you change rooms . The patch makes it worse . Tried on Nvidia , ATI and Intel graphics machines with full updates . Crashes no matter what .
 Got this for my daughter . First it wouldnt work at all . It was missing drivers that I had to download off thier website . Then when I finally got the program `` working '' It was very bizarre . The cat ended up absorbed into a wall - strange . None of the activities worked the way you 'd think they should . I ended up with my daughter in tears and throwing the program in the trash .
 Today is January 6th , 2007 . I bought this game today at Target . Came home installed . Our computers are the latest and greatest . We installed the game . It crashed . The kitty never meowed . So , we went off to the website to get the update/patch . Installed it . The patch fixed a few things but overall this is not a game , and would n't keep the interest of my five year old . So the question is , who is this game for ? Well , it would be for a younger person BUT you need the skills to read so if Mom/Dad is willing to sit with child while trying to navigate through the screens then I 'd recommend this game only for a 2 or 3 year old . I am a software engineer and my husband is also a programmer for over 15 years with a degree in Computer Science . Our professional opinion is do n't buy this game . We called Target and they will not take it back even after I explained that every game on their shelf -LRB- Kitty Luv that is -RRB- is defective . We lost $ 19.99 plus tax at the Loveland , CO Target . Even after explaining to the manager that the software is defective , she stuck to her guns and would not take it back unless I wanted the exact same thing . Why would I want the exact same defective piece of software ? She did n't understand computer programming and thinks a different disk would be better . Ugggg . All the disks are bad I explained . The software is exactly the same on all disks!So , for anyone reading this , you will be sorry if you purchase this game even if you get it cheaper than $ 20 . I 'm so mad . Where was the testers in this piece of software ? How could you release such a game to the public without testing ? The software developers on this game should be ashamed , rather not so much the developers but whomever the release team manager was . He should be fired . You have made the public mad . And I 'm just one that has the taken time to write . I 'm sure there are others who are not even aware of this forum .
 To all the people who bought this `` game '' and were frustrated and disappointed that it does n't play correctly , even with the patch
 Could n't get it to stop crashing on either my maxed out gaming platform or my regular Dell home computer . The `` patch '' did n't have any effect .
 As all the other reviewers say , this software is junk . The so-called upgrade to version 1.6 is an abomination.The following is the text of a message I sent to Lost Sock , who is supposedly responsible for this trash getting into the marketplace . I doubt I will hear back : Folks : You have managed to sell software that is a complete abomination , in the name of Kitty Luv . My daughter has succeeded in wasting her own hard earned money on this piece of utter trash.The first version spontaneously crashed -LRB- running on Window XP Pro with a high end Navidia video card . -RRB- Your so-called patch apparently changed the interface , and stopped the crashing , only because most of the options available to click on simply do not invoke anything . The only activity this `` kitty '' does autonomously is pee in its litter box and scratch the post . The mouse arrow does not change to a `` hand '' in order to facilitate any interaction with the virtual kitty . No ability to change location as well.Whatever nitwit within your organization allowed this garbage into the market place should be summarily canned.Corporately , you should be embarrassed . Take a look at various website reviews where this trash is up for sale , and you will get an eyeful of how much of a failure this product you are ripping people off with is . A pitiful example of `` software '' that does nothing but disappoint.Have a nice Christmas ...
 I work with computers for a living and this is the worst piece of software that I have seen . It did not work out of the box at all . I looked up and found that there was a patch -LRB- the web site says version 1.6 , but the patch itself says 1.8 when installing -RRB- . I have tried this on three systems with no luck . On the HP 7955 , it just locks up - no mouse to control it . On the other two systems , we could not change locations -LRB- as reported by others -RRB- and could only do two of the activities . I would expect this of alpha/beta software , but not of released software , especially after 8 published patches.The web site is less than helpful - some of the pages are blank -LRB- like the support page -RRB- .
 My daughter and I came across this at walmart yesterday and were very excited about it , only to come home and have it crash on us everytime we try to play it . We can not change rooms and the patch doesnt work . I am very dissapointed in this game . I should have come here first . Do not waste your money on this game .
 I ca n't actually comment in the quality of gameplay , since it was bought by my daughter . But I can speak to the problems people are having : SIMPLE RULE -LRB- for those who do n't know much about their computers -RRB- : THIS GAME WILL NOT PLAY ON MOST LAPTOPS , regardless of whether you have the right version of Windows . It checks for two specific families of video card - which mostly are for desktop computers.MORE COMPLEX RULE
 I bought this for my daughter for her birthday . She was so happy , just to be let down as it didnt work . Since I have dial up , was going to take me over 2 hours to download the patch . Forget this one . Good idea but how can you possible market something like this that doesnt work . Dont they try out thier items before the put them on the market . I 'm one very angry mom .
 I came across this game in wal-mart and thought ` Awwww ! A new cat game I can play ! ' and guess what.I could n't play it ! I installed it on my brand new computer and nothing!Half the time the game screen would freeze or turn black.The stupid cat kept geting stuck in the wall when it ran by it and it would even let me choose if I wanted a male or female , it MADE me pick male and the game totally sucked!DO NOT WASTE PERFECTLY GOOD MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE !
 This game is a piece of junk !!! It does n't work even on a computer with 256 meg video .1.2 Pentium processor 512 meg ram.It freezes up all the time and re-boots the computer.Lost s * ck games website is down and you ca n't contact themabout their piece of crap software
 This is a TERRIBLE game , it 's not even a game . All the `` kitty '' does is follow the mouse around . Sounds do not work properly , graphics are complete garbage and the game has bugs galore . If only I had seen the review here I would have saved $ 20 . This game does not function and is worthless to you and your children .
 We had the misfortune to purchase Kitty Luv through our daughter 's school - the Scholastic Lucky Book Club flyer . It would not install or run on Windows XP or Windows 2000 machines . It would not run on a high-end workstation . It would not run on an ordinary modern PC . The installer reports problems with out of date video drivers - this is an out and out lie . The company responsible for this defective software is GameMill Publishing . Their `` support '' consists of telling you to update your video drivers , and they do not answer email sent to their customer support address . Scholastic has a guarantee that allows buyers to return merchandise for any reason , so it will be Scholastic 's problem next . Kitty Luv is not functional software .
 This game is a waste of money . Do not buy it ! It deletes items or says you do n't have things you purchased . It will get `` stuck '' on one kitty and refuse to allow you to make a new one . It gets stuck on letters so you ca n't type . It 's awful , do n't buy it .3 disappointed daughters around here .
 My 5 yo daughter bought this game with her own money because she loves cats and the box was pink -LRB- her favorite color -RRB- . It was a complete waste of money , unfortunately . The game frequently froze and it required way too many steps to do the simplest thing . Because I felt sorry for my dd , I eventually bought her the petz
 This is the worst game ever sold . It did not work from the beginning on a system that was triple the system requirements . The average play time untill crash was 3-5 minutes , unless you wanted to change rooms and then it was instant . The patch from the website causes even more problems . It gives -LRB- 4 -RRB- seperate error messages including one about unloading the world . I think a programmer was trying to mess with people and Game Mill let it go . The company does not answer emails and provides no address or phone number . It seems like they are taking the money , leaving kids upset and then hiding from the responsibility . I wish I had read the reviews before we spent the money . An internet search has not provided evidence for one single person getting this game to work . I 'll go as far as saying the company is nothing but a bunch of thieves and liars.We got ours at the local Walmart which has a no return policy . I want everybody to know that the store manager has the authority to override this policy and give you another game of a DIFFERENT title . It took me a half hour talking/arguing to the manager , but my little girl got a great new game called Fetch from Valusoft that installed and worked great with more to do and better graphics . Their website actually has contact information and useful technical advice.Once again , do not under any circumstances purchase this game . In fact , I would recomend that you stay away from anything that Game Mill , Lost Sock , or any of their related companies have anything to do with . Quality and customer service do not exist in their vocabulay unless preceded by a negative adjective . I agree with the reviews that say that one star is more than this game deserves . I 'll go with a negative five on this one .
 Gamemill Publishing is worthless they should have called this game `` Kitty Mill '' . This game was a spur of the moment purchase we had no idea there was such a dark cloud hanging over it . My daughter loves cats and when she saw this game on the shelf she was so excited and could not wait to play it . Needless to say she was frustrated and disappointed.If Gamemill Publishing had any ethics at all they would recall this pile of Kitty you-how-what and replace or refund customers money . They do not answer email and there is no phone number that I can find . How very convienient . Cowards.We got the same error message about the video mode . On another computer it played for all of two minutes before it crashed . I am with the person who said if they could have given it a zero they would have I am giving it a - 5 . Just to be clear how dispicable the makers of this game are . Shame on you GameMill I will never purchase anything from this company again and you guys owe me $ 20.00 .
 I bought this game for my niece to play while she was here . After installing it in my brand new Gateway , all that comes up is a box stating that it can not initialize video mode.Take the $ 20.00 and donate it to your local animal shelter . You 'll get a whole lot more satisfaction .
 I would have given this zero stars if the program had that as an option . A really , really awful game . The graphic are awful , the game does not respond to the mouse . The hot spots to click on are vague and frustrating and often full areas of the graphics are missing and there is just a black square where the picture should go . I have written tech support clearly explaing the difficulites and have received no reply , not even and form email.I too am running this on a computer that exceeds the minimun requirements . Do n't waste your money and until things improve I will not be purchasing any of Game Mills products , they are really poor quality . Find something else for your 20 bucks !!
 I bought this for my daughter for her birthday . It was a real disappointment from the beginning . Ok , so the graphics are not very good but she is seven and just wanted to feed and play with her new computer kitty . Everytime she changed rooms an error would pop up . So I went to the company website , downloaded and installed the needed patch and guess what . Now she can take her cat from one room to another but anytime she trys to play with the cat using one of the toys the cat immediately goes to the right of the screen , partially disappears in to the wall , and there is no way to get out of this glitch unless you quit and restart the game . If you are a parent looking for a cute game for you child this is not the one for you . The only thing this game has been good for so far is disappointing my daughter on her birthday !!!!
 I can not beleive this company even released this game . Someone must had to meet a deadline before it was complete . It does n't work . There was no quality testing because it is riddled with bugs . And quite simply , it just does not work . You cant use the things you buy . It 's just all very very odd . My daughter used a gift card to buy this - and I feel she got severely ripped off .
 My son was so excited about this game and was entirely let down ! Could n't get through more than about 2 minutes before the game crashed again and again ! How can software as flawed as this be available for sale ! Absolutely a tease for children - do not purchase this game .
 I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing . I have a very high-end computer and it would not work for anything , even with the patch . Do n't waste your money and please report this company to the FTC like the other reviewer recommended .
 I got this game for my nephews for Christmas . I 've read various problems other reviwers had . I too had the same crashing problem out of the box . I also had the same problem with the patches . After I used patch 1.8 labeled as 1.6 on their site the game did n't seem to crash but activities such as petting and brushing no longer worked for me either . We have three computers in the house with different specs and video cards and all three had the same problems . It is just not playable . Since the brushing and petting did n't work the kitty happiness bar kept going down and my nephews got very upset that they could not interact with Cooler their kitten to make it happy and are still upset that the game just does n't work . DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ! Bad release and the patches have yet to fix it .
 Do n't waste your money on this game . It would not function for us either . I wish I had checked the reviews before spending our money on it . It is worthless garbage to us now , we ca n't even return it because of our store 's policy on computer games that have been opened . Sorry kids .
 My daughter got this game for Christmas . It does not work . It even slowed down my computer until deleted it off . Should have read the reviews . : -LRB-
 Whoever put this together should be ashamed of themselves . My daughter spent birthday money to buy this at a retail store . -LRB- I should have gone online and looked at the reviews , first . -RRB- I spent an hour trying to get it to work and installing patches . The game just simply does not work . What I could get to work did not look very interesting or fun . DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!
 I bought this game at wal-mart . It is n't their fault it does n't work . All they do is sell it , not manufacture it . I have never had this problem from any game I bought at wal-mart . I get the error ` unable to initialize video mode ' . I have a brand new laptop that exceeds any requirements . I have also emailed the manufacturers and no reply . Even if the manufacture fixes this screw up , I will never buy another one of their games just for the principle of it . They recieved their money and we all got the shaft . What a way to run a business . If this review had a way to put zero stars in it I would have checked it , 1 star is way too good for this game .
 My 7 year old daughter bought this game with her birthday money . I have brand new Dell computer that exceeds the minimum requirements for the game , but it does n't work at all ! The cat does absolutely nothing , just stands there , and when you try to use any of the toys you buy for it , you get an error message and the game shuts down . Horrible . My 7yo is in tears . There is NO tech support on the website , and I 've emailed them twice and they do not respond at all . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 this game is terrible . i had the same problems as everyone else . you should opt for and of the catz 1-5 . they have very few problems and the graphics are way better .
 My daughter bought this game at Walmart with money she had saved up . The `` game '' is absolutely junk !! It freezes up constantly and gives error messages . She got so frustrated she was crying , and was extremely disappointed that she wasted her $ 20 on this game . We wish we had checked here for reviews first !! Hopefully we 'll save someone else from wasting their money . Walmart of course would not refund the money , and contacts to the manufacturer only elicited an email with a link to the `` patch '' . I think that this company should make good on their junky game by reimbursing all of us who have wasted money on such a poorly-made game . Did they not check it out first before putting it on store shelves ?!
 My son purchased this game at Target with his birthday money and we got an error message.I have n't tried downloading the patches yet - and Target only allows replacement , not a refund.I wish we had come here first to check the reviews .
 I recently bought a 3-pack of computer games . The games included The Land Before Time
 Kitty Luv does not work for my higher-end system either -LRB- workstation class dual core 3GHz , 2GB RAM , NVidia Quadro FX1400 128MB video -RRB- even after installing the newest video driver and latest DirectX controls.The game crashes randomly . Patch v1 .6 -LRB- actually installed as v1 .8 -RRB- takes away all functionality of the original . You ca n't even feed the cat ! I quit before the cat died of starvation.Gamemill has released other unusable software in the past -LRB- Big Rigs
 From a extreme computer user I would not recommend this product for anyone that wants to get into Linux . Linux can be a little difficult when you have been a long time windows user . To get the most out of linux you have use linux the way it was meant to be used . There is plently of info on the net , than go download Mandrake Linux for free . It makes it easy to partition your hard drive or install onto a seperate one .
 Very easy to install , assuming you have a bootable CDROM system . If not , your problems are just beginning . Mine installed in 10-15 minutes . However , the system would not boot up . I spent many hours online searching for help and downloading over 40 pages of info . To date , my linux OS still does n't run ! I suggest that if you are serious about using linux as an OS , ask around to see if anyone near you has any experience with it . Then , see if their version of linux works on your machine before purchasing it . There are many different distributors and versions of linux and most new users have problems ! TEST THE WATERS BEFORE DIVING IN !
 This is very frustrating . I love UNIX and I wanted to get a little taste for it on my home computer since I only have access to it at work . Unfortunately , I can not get this darn thing to load on my home computer . The OS is Windows XP . It starts to seem like it is going to load but I can not use my mouse and a little bit into the loading process it starts to ask you about erasing your hard disk and without a mouse ... it gets a little scarey . At least that is what I am dealing with .
 Not only was there a number of inconsistencies between the installation manual and the actual installation process , making you feel like you might be doing something wrong throughout the entire things , but if you install it on any drive except for your C drive -LRB- Or first partition , whichever -RRB- the bootloader ca n't find windows . I suppose if you wanted to use a boot disk for Windows it would be okay , but that 's not quite what I had in mind when I bought it . I do n't recommend this product at all .
 Having read the editorial review I realized this is it , I want to buy this Linux for Windows thing to give Linux a try and still have my windows up and running . It turned out to be a mistake .1 st of all , I faced a very nasty problem . The computer hangs for no reason during OS loading , after the `` calibrating delay loop '' message followed by some information about memory and hash tables . I had no idea what can be wrong and spent a day trying different settings in the BIOS , trying to reinstall the system from GUI and text interface and nothing came out of this . A bit later I realized that the problem may have to do with the way memory is used in my computer . My computer is a cheap eMachines eTower 566i2 with Celeron CPU and video is a so-called `` intel 3D AGP '' thing which is inside a memory controller on the motherboard of the computer and it uses the same base RAM for video unlike a usual video card . Of currently installed 160MBs , last MB is always allocated by that chip for video . So I thought I might try to specify Linux less amount of memory than it thinks . It thinks 160 , I tried to install the damn thing in text interface and supplied ther a parameter `` mem = 128M '' and it worked . The kernel no longer hangs up the computer during loading . I bet this is the 1st problem to face for all users of cheap computers based on intel 810 chipset -LRB- e.g. that intel 3D AGP thing -RRB- . But that is not the end of the story ... After that I immediately founf yet another problem . 2nd problem ... The kernel reports 3 error messages and stops . The mesasges appear altogether as follows
 Problems since the very beginning . . the installation was about 1 hour long because problems with the activation software not mentioned in the product manual , after spent days trying to find how to solve it , i installed the sw , but it could not run because it does not work with my Behringer BCA2000 ASIO driver . . i even tried with an AUDIGY sound card but it did n't work either . . i am totally dissapointed with this program . . i 've installed many music sw in my DAW -LRB- DELL DIMENSION 8600 , XP PRO SP2 , 1GB RAM , PIV 3.0 HT , 1GB RAM , 2 X 80GB SATA HD -RRB- and NEVER , NEVER i had seen something so complicated to start as SEQUEL -- My recommendation
 I bought this product because I was looking for a program that would do drive images and file backups . It even got a PC magazine editor 's choice . I has read a couple of negative reviews here and elsewhere , but decided to buy it anyhow.I wish I had n't . While waiting for my Amazon order , I downloaded the demo , it had a couple of problems , but I thought the full version would fix it . Nope . I have yet to successfully make any sort of backup with this program . I tried to create a drive image several times , each time it crashes on the 3rd or 4th disk . Last night I tried just backing up important files and it crashed on the 2nd disk . The crashed come in the form of a cryptic error message and the job stops , no chance for recovery.Their tech support leaves a lot to be desired . It 's a treacherous journey just trying to figure out where to ask a question , then they will usually blame it on poor media , or just suggest that you try things you told them you 've already tried .
 Maybe impossible to restore . I bought this product and did a backup to my CD drive . Tried to restore several times , but the program can not read the data it wrote . It does the backup quick and easy , but could not restore one single file .
 The APPEND FEATURE , which allows backing-up more than 1 file to a CD such as small Incremental and Differential backups , is not supported for SANYO and IOMEGA 12x drives . That may make using this product in large company invironments unacceptable . A seperate CD must be used for each and every Incremental and Differential backup . Also , product support is so stealth and insulated from the user as to be virtually non existent .
 I bought this software and just can not get it to run on my computer with Win2k . Althought the computer is very new and teh CDRW is supposed ot be compatible , the backups just do n't work . Moreover , the software ruins the CD-RWs so that you can not reformet them again.Tech support only tells you to buy better CDRWs and does not reply any more when you tell them that you use already the CDRWs they recommend.For me it was a big waste of money !
 I will try to make a long story short.I ordered the trial version of this product and it had dual engines . I then purchased the full product , after being told by Andrew a marketing manager that it could only be purchased legally , from the company itself.First , I was sent a CD in a generic jewel case without even a registration number . I had trouble with the company even to get a response ! Later I found out that I was not even sent the dual engine version but the cheaper single engine version!After more delays and aggravation Robert , another Boomerange rep , promised to send me the latest 2005 version -LRB- this is what I was lead to believe I was buying in the first place -RRB- , within two weeks , to supposedly make up for all the frustrations and to show good faith . This was months ago and I still have not received a damn thing!These people are running a scam or are guilty of fraud , pay for the full version and get the single engine version . To add insult to injury , Tech Support is horrible!You 've been warned!Manuel A. Calcagno
 This product refused to install on Windows 7 at all . It 's the first program I 've encountered that would not run at all , in any compatiblity mode .
 I spent more than 50 hours trying to learn how to use this product and learning how to work around its bugs . I gave up and bought Sony Screenblast , which is working quite well for me . Here are some problems I had with the Ulead product : The user interface is wildly non-intuitive . Absolutely baffling . Even after 50 hours of intensive effort , I could n't figure out its behaviors . Also , the help system was clearly tacked on as an afterthought ; it 's in Adobe PDF format , so you ca n't search it , it 's hard to read , and the index is laughable . The text is completely inadequate . If you buy this product you will have to use the online web boards -LRB- which are actually quite good -RRB- to figure out how to use it.They say you can import media and edit it , but this is not actually true . It will edit mpegs captured by other tools , but when you try to burn a DVD it crashes with no diagnostics . A phone call to tech support established that you can not render a file unless it was captured by VS -LRB- Video Studio -RRB- . -LRB- There is a workaround , but the tech support guy did n't know about it . -RRB- The output audio is bad , with occasional clicks and pops inserted.On a larger project , it gets horrendously slow . -LRB- Other programs , like Screenblast , are slow to load but are quite quick once loaded . -RRB- I had one crash , after which VS was no longer able to start . I tried to uninstall so I could re-install , but that caused system errors . Fortunately the original installsheild . exe could uninstall . But this one crash cost me half a day of experimentation just to find the way to re-install . The feature set is not very rich compared to Screenblast at about the same price . I 've also used ArcSoft ShowBiz , which has a lovely interface but can not render acceptable output . And I 've also used a few really low-end tools.Overall , the money I spent on VS was money flushed down the toilet . And my weeks of work were wasted -- I should have quit earlier.BTW , I have a degree in Computer Science from U.C. Berkeley and have been in the software development business for 20 years , so I 'm not easily intimidated by software .
 This software , unlike the many titles out there will not crash your system ! That 's about the only benefit I can think of . This program is not user friendly -- in fact it appears to do everything in its power to exasperate , exhaust , annoy , enrage , and otherwise destroy the weary , bleary eyed user whose humble goal is to produce a watchable DVD of home videos.It might be a humble goal , but as I 've found it is n't for the faint of heart . Videostudio is supposed to take you from capture to burn with nary a hassle , BUT after about three days of wrestling with the program the DVD I did burn was mysteriously missing half the tape filmed , and was terribly glitchy.I would like to have searched the help file for a little instruction , but the help file was in a cumbersome PDF formula and frankly it was n't much help . Overlaying titles was a HUGE pain . I could find no way to standardize the font and effects across the board , so for every title I had to re-enter the information . The same goes for the chapter headings . Also , inserting bookmarks for chapters was more torture than any human , aside from Saddam Hussien , should be subjected to . Instead of allowing you to pick scenes from the scene changes you 've already established you had to use a slide bar that was so sensitive the slightest touch catapults you 15 minutes past your target scene ! There are many other problems with this program -- it 's very cumbersome , not easy to figure out , and involves for to many steps for most tasks . Pinnacle is much easier to use , but it 's so glitchy you ca n't run it for more than five minutes without crashing your system . I 'm still looking for a servicable program to burn my video to DVD that wo n't land me in some sort of asylum .
 well since I have never bought a used item I am disappointed that the detail was missing , like this product does not work with the new mac systemthat would have been helpful . I wasted $ 200.00 on a product that I can not use . I can not return it and again maybe my fault for not reading more aboutreturns but I assumed because i was buying via amazon that i would not have to be concerned with that . So not happy at all .
 I AM A FREELANCE PHOTOG , 90 % 0F MY STUFF IS WITH REUTERS . IN PHOTOSHOP 7.0 WHICH I OWN , THERE IS A PROBLEM IN THE CATAGORY SECTION IN FILE INFO . THE SUPPLMENTIAL CATS .

NOW I HAVE TO SPEND $ 119.00 TO BUY 6.0 TO GET RID OF THE PROBLEM . HAVE YOU HEARD OF ANY GLITCHES ON 7.0 ? H E L P , JON WAY
 This is a very good program in the hands of a photography expert and software guru who has the resources of a company behind him . For the average consumer ? I do n't think so . For example , try to print a picture from your digital camera . The documentation is inpenetrable and the messages from the program are undocumented and useless . If you want telephone help with this $ 299 program , that will be another $ 299 thank you . There is no e-mail support of which I am aware.If you need the ultimate photographic software and you do n't care how many dollars you spend or how much time you spend trying to figure out the documention , this is a good program for you .
 9/13/06While on assignment I was hit by a car and am 100 % disabled . Standard darkroom work is next-to-impossible for me so I saved Social Security Disability money to purchase Photoshop 7 for my computer and Epson printer . For some reason when using Photoshp 7 and I go to `` Print With Preview '' for an image I have on the screen not only does it disappear completely off the screen , but the black triangle in the dock under the Photoshop 7 symbol also disappears . Called Adobe , but because there is now a print system replacing Photoshop 7 Adobe refuses to answer any question I ask about solving my problem.Yes , Adobe is a business and profit is the game , but to not continue to offer technical support for an Adobe product purchased by anyone and in this case a customer who is handicapped is immoral.Wat 's the problem ? No profit in giving tech . support for lder Adobe products meaning the customer with the problem will be forced to buy the new product ? Richard Byrd -LSB- ... -RSB-
 When I try to instill I try to all a serial # the warning informed me that this software can not instill bacause of too hits . I recived on 3/16/05 . what to do .
 For those of you who had version 4.0 or 5.0 , it took a little time to get the hang of it , but , it is a good photo/video tool . This version 7.0 is so huge and so technical , and soooooo different from the earlier versions that unless you want to become a professional , or have tons of time on your hands to relearn everything you figured out already , but without additional benefits -LRB- that i could discern -RRB- i advise you to stay away from this monstrousity . In a way , it 's like the new MS Office , you do n't get any expanded functionality , but must re-learn a different way to do what you have already been doing for years . My Photoshop 7.0 is in the trash . It belongs there .
 Amazon should not sell pirated copys of anything . I bought this in good faith from you and could not access it after installing . called Adobe and they said it was pirated and I could not use it . Spent $ 189.00 . The seller did not respond to my request for my money back through Amazon and Amazon did not help me any also . I called American Express and they said they would ask for a refund . have not heard from them yet but have sent the pirated copy back to the owner with those words written in a sharpie on the disc so he can not sell it to anyone else . I think that Amazon should be sure that anything sold through them is legal to sell .
 HORRIBLE ! DO NOT ORDER !!! They took the money out of my account and I never received the product ! Can not get into contact with anyone . Bad experience !!!
 Ok so i bought this product after being enthralled with v. 6 but some thing else caught my eye . Fireworks MX , the wonderful interface of Fireworks MX has me only usig photoshop to export as . pdf , the ability to download `` extentions '' as they are called is amazing it adds new features galore . So if youre considering photoshop go with Firewoks MX its much better
 I have used two versions of the product , 6 and 7 , on both with different PC 's and Operating Systems my database which contains all of my inputted information became corrupted . After contacting tech support and forwarding them my database file he replied back within 30 minutes I would have to re-enter my entire collection and start over for the third time . With thousands of cards to enter you can imagine my frustration . Needless to say I can not recommend this product . ...
 Do n't waste your money on this program . For a program that looked like it had great potential , I was very disappointed . There is a very extensive plant glossary , but you better know Latin to use it . All the plants are listed by the Latin name . Also , in order to put plants into your garden layout , there must be a 3-D view of that particular plant/flower . You 'd think you would be able to do that from the name of the program . Well , there is such a small percentage of plants with 3-D views , that I just gave up trying to use the program . One good thing about the plant glossary if you can figure out all the Latin , is that you can choose plants by color , height , blooming time , etc. . That 's about the only good thing about the program . I 'm sure there are better programs out there . I would not recommend this to anyone .
 Definitely do not buy . The tool tips all came up in German ! None of it worked correctly . The wizard options for getting started were very limited . It was very hard to even get a basic house plan in . Did not work to define plant/plot area . Words/headings all spelled wrong . Looked a group of 3rd graders developed this program .
 Very difficult to load totally . Not user friendly , manual not found although referenced on CD . Only good thing was the pair of gardening gloves accompanying set , and they were size SMALL to fit my wife ! A waste of good money .
 Bet you did n't know that a MAC can be infected by a PC virus . Neither did I , nor did I realize upon purchasing this product that PC viruses are not supported at all . Granted a pc virus can not damage your MAC but you can be infected and spread that virus to other people -LRB- PC USERS -RRB- in your email lists . Now on a daily basis I receive warnings that I have automatically transmitted viruses to people I have not emailed in months . Support for this problem from Symantec you ask ??? Zip nada zilch ! Find an alternate product . Very dissapointed and worried .
 If you are thinking about buying norton software simply because they are free after rebates , then reconsider it . Although it 's well known Symantec makes reliable softwares , When we talk about their rebates , they are liars . Yes , liars Cthey really deserve this . Based on my personal experience , I even think theirs are worse than the notorious I/O Magic 's -LRB- aka , Hi-Val , Digital research -RRB- . I bought several Norton softwares during last December , and submitted the upgrade rebates right away with required items , Guess what , until today I got only one of them , and it has been almost 6 months . I guess they are testing my memory but unfortunately I kept a good record of every rebate I submitted . That 's what we should do if we are going to buy Symantec softwares with rebates involved , although the best thing I would recommend is to avoid as long as you can .
 The primary feature distinguishing Jam from Toast or from any of the other vanilla disk burners is its long-standing ability to meld professional split-stereo files into the track list , i.e. a left and right pair of mono files with . L and . R suffixes . This is the main reason that Jam existed , since it otherwise duplicates practically all the features of Toast . Roxio prominently advertises this feature , and provides directions for implementing it in their documentation . It simply does not work . I now see from a previous message posted here and dated last March that this is not an isolated incident . It is clear that for at least 9 months after this gentleman 's review was posted that Roxio has not corrected the problem , nor corrected their claims for the product , nor have they posted any warnings on their site indicating that this key feature is not yet implemented . Instead they lead customers into purchasing the software on the basis of this feature , with total disregard for the responsibility to provide the actual product they advertise . This is called lying.If it were a matter of a shipment that got out with a small problem that contradicted the manual that would be understandable . But to forgo amending their advertising or website or online manual going on close to a year now is unconscionable . Parlaying misinformation for that long is clearly negligent and deceptive practice.I would recommend against buying this product , sheerly on principle . There are alternatives that do exactly what it does equally well , and these people do n't deserve to be rewarded for bad behaviour . Unfortunately there is no other product that provides this missing feature , at least not in an OS-X compatible version .
 BACKGROUND
 Shopping for something to buy . Site does not give enough information as to what the program does .
 As the treasurer for a church with six employees , I have used QuickBooks for the accounting and payroll for the church for more than a decade.I just upgraded the software used by the church to QuickBooks Basic 2005 this year and found that we can not use QuickBooks to compute the payroll tax withholdings unless we subscribe to one of Intuit 's payroll services . This is a change in the way payroll is handled by the software from previous additions of QuickBooks Basic.This additional subscription makes the cost of upgrading to QuickBooks Basic 2005 more than triple the published software price -LRB- ... -RRB- because the least expensive of the subscriptions is $ 199 per year.In response , I have developed a an Excel spreadsheet that can do the computations for our organization and I will not be subscribing to Intuit 's payroll service.The rest of the package seems to work as intended .
 Just do one thing . Try to create an invoice with British Sterling Pound symbol or Japanese Yen symbol.It does n't take many problems for a software to be obsolete . Just one problem that can not be fixed.If you have a global dream for your small business , this software is n't it.What a junk . I am going back to Microsoft Money .
 I bought this software in Cosco . One interesting thing I found immediately in the first use is that some of the stores that have been closed for a long time still appear on the maps as valid locations . After that , new shopping malls that opened after 2001 can not be found on the maps . Also zip codes are not accurate . So I go to the maps directory of this software and looked at the creation date of the maps . It turns out that all the maps were created on August 31 , 2000 , which means they have never been updated after that date !!! Even though they claimed this software as the newest version.One interesting thing is that for the locations not being able to find by the software , you can find all of them on Rand Macnally website . It is perhaps their lousy attitude towards the customers that make these almost 4yr old maps as newest version . I feel cheated . However I still politely asked their support people for help . Guess what ? They just kicked me to Tele Atlas North America for update , which I find out to be a business level map service company that wo n't even listen to what I said.All in all , this is a bad bad bad software with worse worse worse service . DO N'T BUY or you just waste your money
 Well first let me say this software came with my Deluo USB GPS as part of the package . The GPS is great and worth every penny I paid , but the Street Finder software is not worth the CD it was burned on !! The maps are old and out dated , the user interface was written by someone who obviously really could care less about easy of use , and the trip routing was the worst I have ever had the displeasure of using . Please save yourself the brain aneurism that this will cause you while trying to configure and use for your next vacation or trip and get Microsoft Streets & Trips 04 . I ca n't stress enough how utterly horrible Rand McNally Street Finder is . Amazon has a great price on Microsoft Streets and Trips 04 and there 's a $ 10.00 MIR to boot .
 I expected more from Rand McNally . This product had potential but did n't make the grade . The maps are nicer to look at than MS Streets & Trips or DeLorme Street Atlas but they 're out of date . The interface is quirky and tedious to use . The search function wo n't look for ZIP codes and fails to find places that are on the map . This application does n't have much going for it . What a disappointment , I 'm sorry I wasted my money .
 I have been using streets & trips 2001 for a few years , but found it getting incresingly out of date , with the new construction going on around my locale , so I went out and bought this product . Unbelievably , though I bought it at least three years after microsoft streets & trips , it was even MORE out of date -- and the interface looks more dated . Worst of all , the very street I live on -- which has been here at least 10 years now , probably more -- was shown incorrectly , it is a through street , this program shows it as a dead end!In short - a way out of date competitors product you can buy on ebay for $ 3 is better than this piece of #### . It is n't even worth the time spent installing it -LRB- I had to swap the same CD in and out at least 5 times -- what 's with THAT ? -RRB- , let alone what3ever money you pay . I 'm deleting it off my drive & going back to S&T ; 2001 for now .
 Can find a lot of places . Ca n't find my work , school -LRB- University of North Florida ! -RRB- . Although GPS capabilities were okay . But what can I do with GPS if it ca n't find where I want to go !!!
 I had been using Microsoft Streets & Trips 2002 and wanted to upgrade to something more current . After hearing that streets & trips 2004 was not an improvement over 2002 , I decided to give Steetfinder & Tripmaker a try . What a waste ! I ca n't believe that Rand Mcnally would allow their name to be put on this thing . terriable interface , ca n't find streets that are shown on the programs map , map is cartoonish compared to the Microsoft product . In fairness I do n't use the gps feature so it could have some redeeming value in that area .
 i bought this program after the salesman told me it was the best one he had . What a joke . The search engine is the worst ! When you print out a map , it prints it in a color that does n't allow you to see the streets . b What good is that . I emailed the company and they said you can not change the default color of the map in this version . What a screw up that is ! I am so disappointed that I uninstalled it and just use mapquest now . I ca n't belive Rand McNally allowed a program this bad to be released . Someone must have been snoozin '
 Where do I start . . Hmm the fact that this program is the biggest waste of $ 45 i have ever spent on something in a long time.I purchased this program before heading out on a cross-country road trip this summer , in hopes of using it as a supplemental program for finding points of interest , dining , and lodging . Well , the Rand McNally CD 's made good coasters at the hotels we found using another program . . The GPS interface would not even work no matter what , and I currently own a new Garmin Vista Unit , so using this program for on the spot navigation was out of the question . Searching for local attractions to familiarize myself with the program only turned up places that have been closed for the past ten years , or a very limited listing.Worst of all , the store will not take this prog back because it has been opened , yada yada yada . So , now I am stuck with a $ 45 P.O.S. I would have more fun wasting the $ 45 in the slots in Vegas.DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM ! DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM ! .
 I do n't understand why this got so many good reviews because it 's awful . It does n't actually teach you how to do anything . It just gives you all these complicated examples and they start out with the hardest verbs . When you 're trying to learn Spanish verbs , you must know how to conjugate each verb . It does n't even explain how to do this at all . The vocabulary flash card section is about the only thing I 've been able to use but I even noticed a few errors with that . I already learned quite a bit of Spanish in school so I only bought this to brush up on what I already knew . But if you 're a beginner then do n't buy this because you will not be able to learn the language .
 I purchased this for my 7 yr . old . It is not easy to navigate , and it does not start off with the basics . I also purchased Kids Spanish which is a much better program for kids .
 This software has the worst way to teach a foreign language I have ever seen . They do not start you off on the basics , instead they start you on the most complicated verbs . They also never even tell you how to conjugate verbs in general , they only teach you by using examples .
 It was truly worthless . The CD was blank . Although it had a label on it that indicated it was what I ordered and was in a plastic case that was dressed up to look like it was legitimate , the CD was soundless . I even tried to play it on the flip side and then inserted CDs I previously listened to on this player . The latter played fine but nothing from `` I Can Speak Spanish . `` The 1 star rating is given because it is the lowest possible rating , which is higher than this product deserves .
 If you now have a clean system which runs efficiently and effectively manages to connect to various mail servers , internet connections , high speed connections , play games , et al and you have no problems you 're in good shape . Do n't install this product . Effective immediately you will encounter various memory resident `` trap '' processes which reconfigure continuously in real time all your settings . You must completely terminate all processes if you want to run those demanding games -LRB- eg Madden 2004 -RRB- you previously enjoyed . You 'll also want to have your password list handy and instructions from your web hosts to get those POP mail accounts back . The firewall will do little besides tell you about `` attacks '' which are effectively your own handshakes . I 'm shocked and awed at how much damage this `` preventive medicine '' inflicted . If you 're running a simple system and do n't use anything beyond basic word processing and web based e-mail it is probably just the thing . Otherwise ... regret is a six letter word .
 I am a finance profesional and found this product difficult to use , there is a lot of double entry and many simple task that are done the hard way , like entering deposits which unlike quicken is not done in the registar but in a deposit window , and then it is way to easy to get a deposit entered twice which in my short ownership has already occured at least five times . There are some excellent principals at work throughout the program and the ability to prepare invoices , and statments is essential for a business owner however their could be even greater ability to custimize reports . All in all I have been very unimpressed with this otherwise highly rated product .
 This is very difficult to use if you are not selling wiggetts but a service . Hard to see the big picture or delete invoices . A problem at every turn . I am disappointed as I thought this was going to be great . I ended up getting an accountant .
 I have been using QB for 7 years and every year or so they force you to upgrade -LRB- buy a new copy -RRB- becuase they stop supporting online banking.I have recently purchased Microsoft Small Business 2006 which I am going to migrate my cursed QB files to it and I will finaly have some decent software.Problems with QBIt will not install sometimes - depending on the Windows installation it the install will crash.The Updates will crash periodically.It does not allow you to export reports to excel unless you have a Pro edition -LRB- Thanks -RRB- Also the interface online integration is circa 1990 ` sI have recently upgraded to MS Money 2006 which rocks !!! GOOD RIDDENCE QUICK BOOKS !!!!! 1
 My accountant said I should use quickbooks for my business . It turned out to be a very bad choice because the software does the manual tasks of paying bills etc. but gives you little useful information . I have a service business in a very competitive market and I could not get critical information that I needed to run my business.I had to go to the accountant and his staff to get the business information required to stay competitive . In the final analysis , I quess this is why the accountant recommended the product .
 I have no idea how this program works , because it will not load on Windows 7 . Further research shows it may work on Windows 7 Pro , but that is not what I have . My previous version of Quickbook was great , and exactly what I need .
 I 've been a QuickBooks fan since starting up my company and realizing how much of a tremendous help QuickBooks was . I started out with QuickBooks 2003 and just a little while ago , I thought it was the time to upgrade to the latest and greatest . Well , I have to warn you that the latest , is n't the greatest . I still like QuickBooks 2003 much better , and in fact I sold my copy of 2005 on eBay and am continuing to use 2003 . A lot of really handy features were removed from 2005 , and many of them were the best features , like the E-Filing and E-Pay . I think I 'm just going to stick with my current version of QuickBooks until Intuit gets on the ball again and puts these features back when they release 2006 .
 I have used QB since 2000 when I started my business . The application is fine in many respects . But if you buy this , you should also factor in that upgrading the product is necessary if you want certain features to continue to work.I did my first upgrade in 2002 when I learned you could email invoices directly from the program . This was a very useful feature that they introduced in the 2001 upgrade . In the 2002 upgrade , they also enabled emailing statements , also a feature I 've found very useful . I am convinced that Intuit rolls out upgrades in such a way as to strongly encourage their customers to upgrade each year . Being able to e-mail invoices and statements should have occurred in one upgrade , not two.Not only that , my 2002 version emailing feature stopped working earlier this year as the 2002 version is no longer officially supported . I have never heard of a product that disabled functionality in this way . When I initially upgraded , I had no idea that there was a built-in time bomb . But again , this is a way of `` encouraging '' you to upgrade . So if you want to use this program , be prepared to purchase upgrades indefinitely or else you may find you ca n't use some feature a few years from now.When the email feature was disabled , I called Intuit and the gal that I talked to did n't believe me at first , but after checking , she acknowledged that yes that feature is disabled and the solution is to upgrade.I have no particular problems with the software , but I do have problems with the policies of Intuit . If you buy it , expect you may have to upgrade . Intuit is very interested in revenue , which is fine and necessary for a company to survive . But they are interested in it to a degree which can alienate customers and which I suspect will cost them quite a bit of money in the long run , especially as Microsoft is just about to roll out their Small Business Accounting program - perhaps the first worthy competitor to QB .
 I agree with the above users , there are better software out there . Please look around and be more futuristic . QuickBooks is for very small companies only . It slows down when the size of your database goes up . I tested some software and found some really good , with reasonable price
 extremely poor technical support . I had to contact sales to get the answer because , Alex , Andrew , Adam all living in India could not answer the question and appeared not to really understand the question.I asked them why they use american names they said the company thought we the buyer might be more receptive if they use good old USA names . The program it self is fine I have been using it since 2002 but when a problem arises there is no support to count on .
 Stay far , far away from QuickBooks.The `` literally every year forever '' charge for `` tax table updates '' is completely unethical - based on very simple numerical updates available in IRS Circular E , Intuit charges you -LRB- currently , and increasing every year -RRB- $ 214 per year for these updates - which happen about once every few months.Problem is , if you discontinue your `` tax table update '' service , ALL tax tables are removed from your program and your are essentially unable to do payroll based on the free tax table data which you can enter yourself . There is no `` internal '' , empty tax table into which you can plug the percentages/calculations . It is inexcusable that Intuit does not provide the facility for manually entering the very simple tax table data yourself and continuing to process payroll - especially for small businesses with less than 10 employees . Note that you can continue to manually calculate each of the deductions and enter them yourself on each paycheck screen - and thus trod through payroll . A site such as -LSB- ... -RSB- The above site will calculate an entire paycheck and all deductions , all you need is W-4 -LRB- withholding allowance -RRB- info for each employeeIntuit is engaged in extortion - declaring themselves a non-government institution levying a tax on all businesses . Once you buy -LRB- and keep using QuickBooks -RRB- , you MUST subsidize Intuit every month - FOREVER!In addition to their famed unreachable and unusable support , this company , which was once a fantastic provider of wonderful software and essential business tools has taken the downturn into corporate greed and unethical business practices.Expect to see many class action lawsuits coming soon towards Intuit for the way they are holding their customers hostage and disabling the ability to REALLY do `` Do-It-Yourself '' payroll , organized calls for FTC and Justice Department intervention , organized boycotts , major magazine articles , action by CPA groups , state constitutional amendment petitions and legislative action.Intuit , according to their published data , controls 85 % of the market -LRB- which is more than Microsoft in its market -RRB- and has a profit margin in excess of 75 % . They make tons of money off their software and ancillary services . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 Do n't run your business with this software if you are careful with your money - as most small businesspeople are.Every few years you have to upgrade in order to maintain the ridiculously expensive payroll tax update . I wish I had never upgraded from the early 1990 's version.You used to be able to manually enter the federal and state withholding infomation in the earlier versions , which makes sense for a very small business like ours . But you ca n't do that anymore . In order to even OPEN the payroll window , you MUST subscribe to the payroll update service ! I seem to recall that it 's almost $ 200 per year now , and increases annually!It is now May , 2005 , and I just received a notice that Intuit will no longer be providing tax tables for the 2003 version . I dread opening mail from Quickbooks , because notices like this are not uncommon.I am looking for a different software program for 2006 .
 If you have used Quicken , you probably take automated downloads of your bank , credit card , and brokerage transactions for granted . You would expect that QuickBooks , a more expensive product positioned as an upgrade by Intuit , would have at least comparable capability.Wrong.Using Quickbooks with any bank , credit card , or brokerage is truly miserable . If your financial institution is one of the few that supports downloads of transactions to QuickBooks , the interface is so miserable you may go back to typing in transactions by hand . -LRB- You have to individually approve each transaction , often answering three or more questions for each . -RRB- And , if you think , you will just use QIF files , or Excel files , or even text files that your bank produces to get your transactions into QuickBooks , you are out of luck.The only type of import files QuickBooks accepts are IIF or `` Web Connect '' -LRB- QBO -RRB- files . Intuit craftily does not let you import transactions from Excel files and does not let you export transactions in any form . I bought a third party converter to produce IIF files from QIF files , but it is hard to use and does not always work . The only Excel to IIF converter I could find did not work at all . I could n't find any utility that made a QBO file.Bottom line
 I have been using QB Pro 2004 for over a year now . My main complaint is that online banking has been broken since installing -LRB- It 's a credit card and a checking account ... fairly simple , but ca n't get both to work at the same time . My QB-certified accountant ca n't get it to work either ... if you want boring details , email me ! -RRB- You 've already read about how bad the phone support is ... my experience was no different , and they want to charge you for everything.Hey Intuit , why not make sure the software that your customers purchase WORKS at least ONCE before charging for support?I ca n't believe after all these years that some other software giant ca n't crush these guys with something basic and workable . After reading reviews of all the accounting packages , it still appears that QB is the `` least worst '' . ; - -RRB-
 When you look at the sales site for Quick Book Pro you will see the promise of a `` rebate '' . Unfortunately , they fail to mention -LRB- at least where it is obvious -RRB- that you must be a former owner of the product to get the promised rebate . I would have waited for it to go on sale somewhere if I had suspected deception . I did not find out that I was excluded from the rebate until I tried to file online for it . When I called QuickBooks to complain , there only offer was for me to return it for a refund . I told them I felt they had been deceptive and did not respect them as a company . I also ask why their new customers were discreminated against by being excluded in such a fashion . I did not get an answer . So beware of promised rebates , there may be hidden qualifications to meet .
 I 'm still trying to understand why Intuit is trying to sell a new version of QB with key featurs of prior versions removed . The removal of E-File and E-Pay is the final straw and for that I 've rid myself of QB and switched to Small Business Manager -LRB- Microsoft -RRB- . And let 's face it folks , software you buy today is for both the functionality it provides and the support which backs it up . You would n't buy a new car if there was no way of having it serviced and you do n't want to do the same with a critical piece of software used to operate your business . So when my requests for help fall on the ears of some guy in India who takes over 45 minutes to try and resolve my problem by putting me on hold and never even offers a work-around , let alone a solution , I have to wonder why I 'm even bothering with fighting this losing battle . For me it was easier to simply move on to something else .
 ... I just installed quickbooks 2005 , and have attempted to transfer my Quicken 2003 to Quickbooks 2005 . The transfer will not copy beyond March 7 , 2005 . I called Customer Service and waited in excess of 20 minutes the first two times , only to be cut off ... the third time I spoke to a rep after 17 minutes who told me I would need to purchase support for this problem ... I think not ! I may have wasted $ 229 , but I will not waste any more money , or time with the so-called ` customer service ' . More like ` customer rip-off ' !
 QuickBooks is getting worse and worse ; I agree with J. Enzinna `` JonnyFunFun '' . QuickBooks is also adding more and more adds in the software , so it is more frustrating.I wish Intuit would think of creating a better QuickBooks.Good Luck . Look for something else .
 Like many Intuit Products , this is full of bugs . High priced Customer support plans promise 10 minute max wait time . The wait time is never under 2 hours . The support personnel are off shore and ill equipped to deal with many questions . You can request a call back from an American Tech which is supposed to occur within 4 hours but too often never takes place .
 I just started a new business . About 10 years ago , I bought Quicken for a business I started then . A year later they offered me an upgrade ... for MORE than I paid for the original version . Their customer service person gave me a lecture in the software business , and since then I swore I 'd never buy another Intuit product.I was give a trial copy by my new accountant , and it seems to work well , but I need payroll . So , I logged on and was going to buy QuickBooks Pro 2005 here at Amazon ... UNTIL I read the reviews of the HORRIBLE customer support , obviously outsourced to India.No thanks Intuit . I 'd rather use a paper ledger than buy your product.Get some customer service and I 'll consider you .
 When I tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 I ran into a problem because I did n't have Flash 7.0 installed . Actually I had a later version of Flash -LRB- 9.04 -RRB- but of course Quickbooks could n't handle that . Here 's the fix
 I used the Quickbooks product to do basic bookkeeping and financial reporting for some of my clients . I do not use their payroll reporting at all because the program will not do all the state reports that I need . Before 2005 I could get the one time update and add the additional companies to my subscription so I could track their payroll and payroll liabilities . Now they want me to pay for a subscription in order to just keep track of the payroll for a few bookkeeping clients . I do n't even do their payroll and I have to pay for a subscription to track data ! I called customer support for both the P/R features and Intuit and that 's the response they gave me . For $ 199.00 their payroll does n't even do all the forms . I would n't mind it so much if I did n't have to pay to have another reporting program that exported the Quickbooks data to do ALL the forms necessary . What a waste ...
 I 've used QuickBooks for 11 or 12 years . I ca n't wait until there is a reasonable alternative that will allow me to import my QuickBooks data and stop using QuickBooks.The QuickBooks software is generally user friendly and does a reasonably good job of simplifying small business accounting transactions . However , Intuit has a very poor attitude toward its customers as demonstrated by their business practices . With every upgrade , they force the customer to buy the next version by making it impossible to productively use the old software . They make a lot of money on upgrades.With every new version , they extract more money out of the customer through other means as well . For example , QuickBooks originally allowed manual payroll accounting , but with every new release it became more difficult to do manual payroll . Now , there is NO manual payroll accounting . There are instead a few options for their payroll accounting services , which start at $ 200 per year for a company with one employee . That cost has increased steadily , so check for the actual cost to process payroll . The charge seems steep for downloading publicly available payroll tax tables . Intuit obviously sees their customers as captives and they are doing everything they can to squeeze money out of them.Your accounting data in the proprietary QuickBooks data format is used to keep you upgrading as they shake you down for more money each year . Remember when you 'd purchase software ? Now you lease software , and it costs more each year . It feels like the software owns me.Here 's another aspect of leased software . I tried to buy a used copy of QuickBooks . This was n't some pirate deal where you get a CD and nothing else . I purchased the original CD with the user manual , packaging and authorization code . It would n't register . I called Intuit and they told me it was already registered . I told them I bought the software from the original owner . They said I could n't do that , and I needed to buy the $ 250 shrink wrapped version . QuickBooks is tightly integrated to their online services and wo n't work without their official approval . Can you think of any other item you purchase that ca n't be sold as a used item ? What would you think if Toyota told you that you could n't sell your car , or you could n't buy someone else 's car , and the only way to buy a Toyota was to buy a new one from the dealer ? You can buy and sell other intellectual property such as books , CDs , and DVDs . Why not QuickBooks ? Even after spending a lot of money , you do n't own QuickBooks . It 's a $ 250 annual software lease , with other attached leases for payroll services , multiple user licenses , etc.The large amounts of money paid to Intuit on a yearly basis are bad enough , but you 'd at least think that you 'd get some customer service . Nope . Their customer service call center is in India . You deal with the language barrier , and generally have people with no direct understanding of western accounting , payroll or taxes . You get the usual call center `` support '' deal , with a person reading from a troubleshooting sheet that never seems to have anticipated your problem . If it is n't in the manual , it probably is n't going to be answered by the overseas call center either.If you are just starting out , find another small business accounting solution . I do n't have any experience with the others so I ca n't recommend any of them , but they must be better than QuickBooks , because Intuit believes they own their customers . They essentially act as a non-government agency levying a tax on small businesses . Avoid the QuickBooks tax .
 Intuit designed its TurboTax for Business so that it would refuse to bring data across from Quickbooks Pro 2002 . In fact this same trick forced me to upgrade from QB Pro 1999 to 2002 . So I did upgrade to 2005 , and now I ca n't enter payroll on my own , as I was able to before the upgrade . Now to do the payroll process , I need to order a one year subscription for Intuit 's QuickBooks Standard Payroll service at $ 199/year . I can no longer do it manually , with this `` upgrade '' . If you are a business with just a few employees , this is sort of expensive . Intuit designs their software to extract the most money it can from its users , not to serve the interests of the users of their products.So , if you buy Quickbooks , you are forcing yourself to buy their Standard Payroll service , and you are forcing yourself to buy a new Quickbooks version every three years , or you wo n't be able to use their TurboTax . And who knows what `` features '' they will add in the future so that you have to pay out more money in order to not jettison Quickbooks . Maybe they will disable other parts of their program so that you will have to subscribe to another service.If you have another option , seriously take a look at it .
 I just purchased this product to upgrade my Quickbooks Pro 2003 . Unfortunately , this will be my last purchase of an Intuit product after having been a loyal customer for 12 years . Why ? Because I 'm being forced to upgrade by Intuit or lose my ability to run the payroll feature -LRB- which I already have to pay a $ 200/year subscription fee to use -RRB- . I have enjoyed using both Quickbooks and Quicken , but forcing me to upgrade at gunpoint is not something that sits well with me . Sorry Intuit , but time for us to go our separate ways . BTW
 The data received from my Financial Institution had savings data combined with checking data.I only wanted checking data , but the program will not let me delete savings data from the file , or reassign it to my savings register.Tech support disconnected me twice , spent over two hours on the phone and this issue was not resolved.Intuit customer support is very poor & verrry slow .
 After I installed and converted my file to the 2005 format I was informed that the E-File and E-Pay features were removed in version 2005 . The support folk in India could not tell me if this was temporary or permanent . The only option to continue E-File and E-Pay was to remove version 2005 and reinstall version 2004 . What a way to treat customers ! How about some up front disclosure Intuit ? I 've been using Quickbooks for 7 years . This may be my last upgrade !
 QuickBooks is not bad if you think that your business will not grow ! The application will get slower if your business grow or the size of your file increased . Other reviewers are correct about other things they have mentioned it , and so I will not write it about them.I would personally recommend Small Business Manager -LRB- SBM -RRB- from Microsoft http://www.microosft.com or another alternative and less expensive is Quick Business Manager -LRB- QBM -RRB- from Business Aim http://www.bisaim.com . There are other accounting applications I could recommend but it seems that these two are really using great technologies such as Microsoft . Net and SQL Server.Both of these applications can be downloaded for trial uses.Good Luck .
 This is probably one of the best examples of the worst kind of company ! They got where they are because they gave small business an accounting program , and in return , small businesses gave their loyalty and their dollars , and now Intuit abuses those same customers by forcing upgrades they do n't need and often ca n't afford in light of the skyrocking cost increases . The real kicker is , if you do n't upgrade , they TAKE AWAY PROGRAM FUNCTIONALITY from the version you 've already bought and paid for -LRB- tax tables , email capabilities , to name two -RRB- . I despise this company and their product , and after 14 yrs. , we 've bent over enough and we 're DONE ! They expect our 5 person company to upgrade to the next version , which would require an upgrade of our operating systems in order to be compatible , PLUS the cost of another payroll subscription , costing us hundreds and hundreds of dollars we ca n't afford and do n't need to spend ! I 've already found a shareware program that will restore the function that allows for emailing invoices to customers -LRB- STOLEN by Intuit when we did n't upgrade -RRB- and am currently searching for some way to import a tax table -LRB- also STOLEN by Intuit when we did n't upgrade -RRB- . If I can find that , we can keep the version we 're using for years as it suits our needs just fine . We should have the right to make that decision and not have it result in the crippling of a program we 've already bought . Intuit makes Microsoft look like warm , fuzzy teddy bears , and I think it 's time we all get together and raise a big enough fuss that their business practices will finally come under the same kind of scrutiny Microsoft has been subject to for years . I dare say we 'd see some changes ... at the very least , an end to the theft of our property !!
 We upgraded our software from the 2003 version on Friday evening . The upgrade was fine and easy to follow . We started using the new program right away with minimal confusion . We did n't close the company file until last night , when we shut the computer down before going home for the night . Today , the new version no longer recognizes our password . Intuit technicians are mystified by this happening and I 've been switched from service number to service number trying to get it resolved . Most recently , I spent an HOUR AND A HALF on hold , only to get a recorded survey asking me to rate my satisfaction with a customer service rep that never answered the phone , and then the survey hung up on me . An entire day of work has been stopped , and an entire day of being on the phone waiting for someone to help us has typified the experience we 've always had working with Intuit any time we 've had questions . I am now sitting on speakerphone again , hoping to get an answer . 25 minutes and counting ... I may prefer to go back to the good old fashioned ledger and pen method .
 In my life I have used a variety of scientific and other software . I have never come across something as cumbersome and difficult as Quickbooks . The help menu is completely useless and the `` technical support '' is an absolute joke . I actually got some poor woman in India whose idea of help was to say `` UM '' for 3 minutes . So far I have figured out what I can on my own , the only thing they seem to be good at is putting you in a position where you have to spend more money .
 I bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant . Well , after trying to use it for two years now , I 'm ready to burn it . It 's a great software for people who do their business by the projects , but it 's not good for retail sales . Everything has been a hassel , especially trying to set up the daily sales so I can record detailed inventory of my daily sales . Yes , I noticed they did come out w/a new version for specifically for retail sales . After I already invested in $ 300 in software and $ 100 in books just trying to learn this system . What a waste !
 WHAT A BUNCH OF MONEY GRABBING IDIOTS ! IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING QUICKBOOKS , DO N'T !!!!!!! I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH A PRODUCT . THEY TAKE FEATURES AWAY , ESPECIALLY WITH PAYROLL , IF YOU DO NOT BUY THEIR PRODUCTS . THEN WHEN YOU CALL TO ASK WHAT IS GOING ON , THEY TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE NOT PURCHASED THEIR SUPPORT PROGRAM AND THAT THEY CAN NOT HELP YOU !! I HATE QUICK BOOKS . THEIR IS NOTHING QUICK ABOUT IT AND THE SO CALLED SUPPORT STAFF ARE A BUNCH OF LIARS !!!
 although quickbooks is a good program , when i ran into a problem and needed guidance , Intuit informed me i would have to pay to get the assistance i needed . I had only purchased the software 2 days ago.Do not expect any technical assistance from Intuit . I would not purchase this again if i had known how little assistance was available . I could do everything i needed to do with microsoft money and get a lot more free assistance with problems . faith paton
 Recently having switched to Quickbooks 2005 , I wanted to add my impressions of setting up a new company in Quickbooks ... First , loading the software is easy and the initial configuration went extremely smoothly . At least until I tried to setup inventory . I created a list of all our inventory items in Excel and then following the directions in Quickbooks configured that file for an import into Quickbooks items . It worked like a champ . Except ... all my inventory valuations were at 0 . Quickbooks had set the Average Cost to 0 . I checked over the import , any item that had any quantity on hand was set to an average cost of 0 . So I decided to use my support account.Here I entered into Hell . After three calls to support , two of which took well over the supposed 10 minute maximum , I finally found someone who could speak english . Thank heavens I have the `` Ultimate Support Flex Plan '' . I wonder what people with lesser support plans find?Unfortunately , the answer I got , while understandable , was wrong . So back to the support queue I went . And I got lucky , in only 8 minutes , I got through to a support rep who spoke English again . Unfortunately , he would only tell me that they do n't support the import of data from Excel to Quickbooks . Again , I have to wonder , what do people who have n't paid for the `` Ultimate Support Flex Plan '' do?Anyway , I did finally come up with a work-around to the inventory import issue . And everything went great until I had to print out my reports ... I wo n't bore you with the details , but after waiting for technical support for 25 minutes today on this issue , I just hung up and decided to get a beer .
 Even when Intuit 's customer service was located in the United States , I received conflicting information and instructions which caused our company to lose $ 214.35 with no refund in sight . One representative said we had to purchase another copy of the program in order to have an additional license . Then a different representative said this was incorrect and to send the copy back without opening it . I did this and they refunded the shipping . That 's it . No one ever told me that Intuit does not refund extra license fees , they just kept taking my information and promising a refund . Then they changed their customer service to India who have no idea who these people were that I spoke with , but also promised a refund which never arrived . Warning -- do not purchase an extra license just on their say-so .
 Having used QuickBooks in my retail business for 7 years , I was `` gung-ho '' to upgrade to QB 2005 . After doing so -LRB- easily -RRB- , I used the product for one week when it stopped responding . It turns out that my data files had been corrupted . The 2005 format is not compatible with previous versions , so I had to recreate a week 's worth of checks , payments , payroll , and desposits - a task that took the better part of a day . I pity a larger business that could easily spend much more time than I.After waiting on hold for 2 HOURS , I was instructed to e-mail some files to QB so that they could fix the errors and mail them back to me in a usuable format . . guess what - it 's been 2 months and no one has responded to that , or several subsequent , e-mails ... I 'm glad I rolled back to 2004 on my own ... now , if I can get someone on the phone to get a refund ...
 Intuit has shut down my payroll calculating and tax form prep functions . How can they do this ? You must purchase Intuit 's expensive payroll subscription for the software to work as advertised . My five month old software no longer does payroll.I have entered the current tax rates and all should be well but ... Intuit demands that I manually enter every single deduction on every single check . Is n't that great ?
 I purchased quickbooks 2005 ; 4th upgrade in 10 years.Unlike earlier versions , this one is confusing and painful to use.Simple things like making deposits has to do through contraptions.One of the reasons I upraded was to use Online banking ; it 's a complete disaster . It does n't download the complete trasaction details , reconcilliations are very difficult.You will be doing twice the work to use it.Once my transfer to the bank was aborted by a message saying you are low on memory and though Quickbooks sent the transaction to the bank , it did n't mark it internally , so on the next login , it sent the payment again !!! It has cost me $ 1509 of double payment that I am still trying to get back!How you pay a bill is totally messed up , There is no way for you to mark that a bill was paid online unless it was done through quickbooks online connection . -LRB- Bank 's billpay ca n't be used !! -RRB- It 's very poor in organization , you ca n't have 2 accounts # 's with a vendor -LRB- still in 2005 !!! -RRB- . It has introduced obscure concepts as items and classes , which have no real definition and no `` default '' use and stop every transaction.One of the biggest thing Quickbooks has done to hurt their customers is the payroll . Technically you can do it yourself , but they hide that information and scare you in every step that you should -LRB- must -RRB- buy the $ 299/year payroll service -LRB- old tax-tables -RRB- . In all the documenation , not once do they mention that you can do the payroll directly and this is how.Compared to the earlier products , this is a huge cost . By that reckoning I would have paid ~ $ 2000 for the previous version of quickbooks !! It 's definitely cheaper to buy a basic version of the software and use an accountant to do the other work and you will be betteroff . Do n't waste money on Quicken services or premium products , they will bleed you to death on your way to a mental asylum .
 Nutshell
 Purchased this software because I got a deal with a special price break . I have a very small business , so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly.The set up took a lot longer than I had anticipated.The customer service was no help - could n't answer my questions . I ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted.I 've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since I 've spent the money , but I 'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime . If this is `` Quick Books , '' I need to find `` Lightning Fast '' Books somewhere .
 I have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money . Every other page is a sales page and after paying $ 300 plus for the application and another $ 200 for the payroll , now I have to pay if I want their help . It is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money , no longer has anything to do with their customers.And this customer will not be one next year .
 I 've just started a small consulting business . Accounting software has to be QuickBooks , right ? My tax accountant recommended it . It must be what I need.It 's impossible for me to tell you the frustration I have experienced with this program . I 'm not a computer or software novice . I 've used both Quicken and MS Money for many years with success . Obviously , QuickBooks is designed to be a more robust program , providing more support to the small business person than the home financial programs do . And maybe that 's the problem.This program looks good graphically . It has a lot of high quality instructional videos . So what 's the problem ? Well , even with the graphics and the videos it 's nearly impossible to figure out how to do even the simplest task . Reconcile a bank account ? Print an invoice ? I ca n't do either after a week of fiddling . I pump information into this beast and it just sits there . It produces nothing . Am I just incompetent ? Well , maybe . But here 's a clue for you to consider that I should have picked up on myself . Go to the QuickBooks site and look for registered QB ` experts ' in your area . If it 's like my medium sized city , there are dozens in your area . Does the fact that there is a cottage industry devoted to helping people make QB work give you pause ? It should.Life is way too short for this program . I do n't need any of the exotic features that QB offers , even if I could make it work . There are some good ` home and small business ' programs that will do the simple income and expense reporting that my accountant and I need , and will reconcile my bank account too . I wish I could get my $ 230 back through QB 's 60 day money back guarantee , but I have to confess , I do n't have much faith that it will work either .
 I was very excited to get this product . It scans well , files well , is very sexy and promising . Then I decided to Search for a few files based on my Keywords . Oooops ! It wo n't search !! If you do n't know already , PaperPort offers you only one free tech support call . After that it 's $ 20 a pop . The rather surly technician I reached had me re-install my program . Okay , but it still would n't search . Then he told me to un-install Windows Service Pack 2 . Uh uh , no way . Nada . That 's when I asked for a refund.I bought MyCab for $ 40 . Tech support is marvelous , within one hour over the Internet . The only thing it does n't do is scan within the program , but then I can do that , ca n't I?AKNapa , CA
 Worked okay until I installed XP Service Pack 2 . Now I can no longer scan using my Brother MFC-9700 and Paperport 9 . It has been a long time since Service Pack 2 was released , and Scansoft has left everyone who bought Paperport 9 in the cold . I could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with SP2 . This kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business . Do n't take my word for it . Google the issue , and you 'll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers . From now on , I 'll avoid Scansoft .
 Great scanner , terrible software . Unfortunately , after the acnner works great for 6 months , the software stumbles and then errors and closes every time it is accessed . Visioneer is well aware of this and provides zero support for `` older models '' and requires customers to purchase new software . From what I have read on the web sites about Visioneer , the upgrades and new software fairs no better . Beware .
 PaprePort is a good application . Starting from PaperPort 9.0 , it handles MAX and PDF files . However , it can not let you hyperlink MAX files from MS Office -LRB- 97 , 2000 , 2003 -RRB- application . MAX files hyperlinked from MS Office documents will not be opened . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I purchased this product with great excitement , as I had been using Pagis Pro and was looking forward to converting all files to pdf format for easy file sharing . However this product is a huge disappointment . First , it is extremely slow to load , and even slower printing last night it took me 8 minutes to print a 10 page pdf . I opened the same file in Acrobat and it printed in 30 seconds . -LRB- BTW the printer I used was a new HP 3330 with the latest drivers ! -RRB- It is one of the few programs that I have ever used that can lock up windows 2000 , an amazing feat in and of itself . Then , for more added excitement many of the features dont work . They advertise a scan to email feature - great if you can get it to work , I never could and there is not support in manual or online for this feature . Then when printing to pdf the option to allow you to view your work after saving it - will not work - ever . What a pain to create a pdf doc then to have to navigate via explorere to open it and make sure you actually created it ! Another huge annoyance is that you must use the My Documents directory on your c drive as the default to save your docs ! You can not change this !! Your only other option is to save to the last directory used . Well if you dont remember the last directory you used and you use the `` send to bar '' have fun on your scavenger hunt . In short its horribly slow , locks up , and many of the features flat out dont work and there is no support . I give up they win . What a shame . I think this product was rushed to market to beat the new Adobe Acrobat 6 to market . I plan to take this product back to Staple -LRB- hopefully they will let me -RRB- do get Adobe . This product is clearly a full iteration away from being useful . Wait for version 10 . Hope this helps
 I was using Paperport 8.0 on Windows XP with a Visoneer scanner.I installed 9.0 , and it is full of bugs : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Scan Settings does not work , and requires a patch from thetheir website . -LRB- 2 -RRB- The restore Defaults button does not work -LRB- 3 -RRB- The scanner freezes mid-scanetc ...
 I needed a document management system . After looking for software , there only appeared to be Paperport.I had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files . I guessed a large number meant 2500 + at least.This concerned me , so I called pre-sales at ScanSoft , and asked if it was slow with a large number of files . He was not sure ! So he told me to call technical . I called technical , and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me . I asked if he was reading the ScanSoft website and he said yes , so I hung up . Obviously I read their site for an answer , and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it.I got the software . Basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software . It worked well , and I thought OK , expensive for what it is , when Windows Explorer and scanning software -LRB- usually free -RRB- would nearly do most of it , but THEN after around 560 PDFs , it started running VERY slow.I thought it was my machine so installed it and the PDFs on a new Vaio 1.7 Mhz , 1 gig laptop . Same problem . If you click to view the PDF then hit the return back , it takes 12 seconds ! So if you view a document , it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the Paperport Desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds !!! Completely unusuable!If you have less than 500 files , it is maybe expensive software , but for more than 500 do not waste you money . It runs so slow you can not use it . I wonder how ScanSoft get away with it - surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files .
 . I first went the -LSB- Scansoft -RSB- Pagis route , putting thousands of business docs in their format , hoping to get better at using it and all the supposed features . I was dutifully getting each new version , adding the scarce patches , hoping that the next would fix some of it 's many problems ... but it never got much better.I am coming to believe that after ScanSoft dumped all of the Pagis users to the wolves , they re-bagged it and called it PaperPort.I say this because all the program problems are there , and the same poor customer support is back with it - problems are sometimes acknowledged but never really fixed . If all you do is store and search , it might be ok , but if you try to use other more advanced features , they often do n't work.Just enough is done to make it work , kind of , and that seems to be where it stands . If you look back at the horror stories of those who trusted Pagis , you might want to be careful that this situation , looking a lot like the one we Pagis users went through , does n't turn out the same way.I have a clean , modern system and a powerful machine , and it had problems with printing , scanning and keyword scans . Also , data was lost.Deja Vue all over again ... ; - -LRB- With my last experience with Scansoft , I ca n't take that chance again , can you ?? Ed Judge
 I have used both Paperport 8 and Paperport 9 Deluxe for over a year so I am qualified to report.Both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with Windows XP Pro.I can not really get version 9 to operate . Everytime I try its like cold molasses . Click ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... and then lock up.I 'm very experienced . I 've been working with PCs since 1991 . Every other piece of software I 've loaded works very well ... except for Paperport 8 and 9 . In theory Paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to PDF which is more or less a universal file format . However theory is a lot better than reality.Support is nonexistent from ScanSoft . If you pay the $ 19.95 per incident , you still do not get a solution.The ScanSoft forum is always either not working -LRB- another bad sign -RRB- or it 's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support.Unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives , but doQments looks promising.Avoid Paperport unless you have money and time to waste .
 Being a long time user of PaperPort since version 1 , I 'm profoundly disappointed by Paperport 9.0 Pro Office , top of the line of the Paperport series . When it was released ... it contained a huge number of anomalies . As of today , Scansoft , publisher of Paperport , have already releaesd two service packs . Nonetheless , it 's still buggy . For example , after scanning a page such as your normal electrical bills , you will `` straighten '' the image to correct some minor rotation when placing the paper on the scanner . All lines are distorted after straightening , a bug never found in any of previous versions . When scanning color page in 8-bit color , it will inflat the file size by automatically converting the image to 24-bit colors without your knowledge ... The most stable version is Version 8 . If you have one , do n't upgrade . If you have already bought the porduct , please try it immediately . Once you discover any bugs , do n't hesitate to return it for refund.The only selling point of Paperport 9 is the support of Acrobat document 5 . Whether it support Acrobat 6 is another question mark .
 Whatever we read All that Manufacturer 's describtion On this SOFTWARE as an advertisement , does not work fully . It just like a bait . I was using Paperport 8 Deluxe which was almost thousand percent good enough in compare to PaperPort Pro 9 Office . So after I upgraded Paperport Pro 9 Office from Paperport 8 Deluxe , I feel myself a very stupid .
 I also have used PaperPort since version 1 . I have almost 10 years -LRB- 2 gigs -RRB- of files and documents in PaperPort . It is a critical necessity to my business and my computer `` life '' -- I upgraded to version 9.0 in March ; later installed each of the two service packs . I can no longer print to PaperPort from the Internet . System locks up frequently , requiring hard boots . I paid ... for technical assistance -- no response from Scansoft.I give up ! I had downloaded my old version 8 . I stupidly erased that copy when version 9.0 seemed to be working OK -LRB- before the service packs -RRB- . ... I agree , stick with PaperPort version 8 .

 I am comparing Paperport 9 to Paperport 8 . My major use is to store documents for future viewing and to maintain a record of my trading cards . I have no use for scanning into Adobe for later editing so I use the . max format . I own two scanners - a SCSII A4 scanner and a Parallell port A3 Scanner . Scanning documents is easy , especially with the ability to keep on scanning pages which are automatically stacked into a single file . However saving the document is very slow . Loading documents appears to take far too long . Loading a 200 dpi A4 page takes about 3 seconds with Paperport 8 and about 10 seconds with Paperport 9 . Loading a 600 dpi trading card -LRB- 6cm by 10 cm approx -RRB- - in Paperport 8 the picture starts to appear after 3 seconds and completes in steps in about 10 seconds - in Paperport 9 nothing happens for about 30 seconds and then suddenly the whole image appears.Editing the document in Paperport 9 - enhancing , rotating , straightening - is fast about 2 or 3 times as fast as in 8 . But after straightening , all straight lines become jagged - something that did n't happen in Paperport 8 . Saving is again very slow taking about 20 seconds to save a trading card . However try loading an A4 document at 600 dpi . My system hung 3 times -LRB- which is n't bad in XP -RRB- . I gave up .

All they did is to assign me a PIN number on June 20 , 2003 . Above all , they refuse to refund the non-performing product on the ground that my request exceeded their 60-day policy . Bear in mind , for the 60 days I continued to write to them and waited for their reply in vain.The most stable version is Version 8 . If you have one , do n't upgrade .

 It 's difficult to rate software that wo n't install ... I purchased this with a Sony ICD-MS voice recorder -LRB- at a premium -RRB- , and when going through the setup -LRB- Win2000 on a Dell with plenty of headroom -RRB- encountered an undocumented glitch in the sample text recognition section . If you need this software , keep your fingers crossed that you 're one of those lucky enough to have it configure correctly out of the box.Turns out if you purchase the software in a hardware bundle , tech support is $ 40 per incident . Even if you purchase the software on its own , you get one `` free '' incident , then YOU 'RE on your own.I 'd give a zero , but 1 is as low as the rating scale goes .
 ScanSoft says Dragon is `` fully integrated '' into Excel . NOT ! It does n't know about named-ranges or sheet names . It 's difficult to select blocks of cells , and damn-near impossible to enter your own formulas . Docs say you can use `` compute < formula > end formula . '' Absolute , pure BS!In Outlook , docs say the command `` Open Mail '' and `` close mail '' . Dragon hears `` Open Male '' and `` close male . '' Sorry , the message does n't open ! Docs
 After installation , the product would n't even launch - says dns files not found . I tried calling them and looked into their website - NO USE . I spent 3 hours for NOTHING.This is a worst product with NO Support . I will return this DAMN product and demand my money back .
 Dont expect any help from Scan Soft if you have any problems with this program . This is a huge and buggy program that will conflict with a bunch of different software since it has to integrate itself into anyh program that accepts text entry . Scan soft limits tech support to one phone call , $ 19.95 per call after that , even if your issue is ongoing . I was told to uninstall and reinstall -LRB- how creative -RRB- and on the reinstall found that the CD was corrupt . Replacement CD 's are only $ 25 + $ 5 S/H . How nice.Scan Soft will not back up their products , and probably make more money on tech support and replacement for buggy and defective products.Looks good on the description , but good luck if you are not up and running right out of the box .
 ScanSoft tech support and customer service is the worst , very very frustrating . The product I bought -LRB- Naturally Speaking v7 -RRB- disables Internet Explorer and makes your whole system buggy if you 're using WinXP . This is a known bug , and executing the fix they recommend online did n't work for me . Not only does my IE not work , but every time I click anything that activates IE my system hangs , slows to a crawl and I have to reboot . And this is a brand new computer . Trying to get tech support on the phone was impossible . I spent 45 minutes on hold . A nightmare . This company does not respect or value its customers . Do n't buy their products .
 I loved my Naturally Speaking ver 4 , when it was owned by Dragon Systems . Now , apparently , Scansoft has taken it over . I have n't yet been able to upgrade , because the program crashes before I can get it going . There is NO free technical support available other than canned `` Knowledge Base '' and FAQ and a user forum . If I want to ask Scansoft why my program wo n't install properly , I can pay ... for an email question to that effect . The Knowledge Base does say that you CAN NOT preserve your old speech files when upgrading from ver 4 to 6 or 7 . So if you have accumulated a few years worth of training and specialized vocabulary , as I have , you 'll lose it all . -LRB- Oh yes , you can use a convoluted process to export all that vocab from ver 4 , import it into ver 6 or 7 , then train all the words again , but of course not in context etc. -RRB- Scansoft -- get lost !
 Dragon Naturally Speaking 7.0 preferred is an example of the worst of software . There are two major service packs that are needed for it , these are huge and take overnight to download on a modem line . 7.0 was obviously not ready for customers but was shipped anyway and the company continued work on the product to make it usable . The user be damned . The company shows its contempt for the customer by providing essentially no customer support . Sure , you can pay for it at 20 bucks a call.The installation of the original product is filled with false error messages and the installation of the service pack is also deadly . After all is done my Internet Explorer was adversely affected . Find another product or wait for ScanSoft to realize that the customer is important .
 I have been a user of voice recognition for years . I use -LRB- or attempt to use -RRB- voice recognition in my law practice due to the amount of writing I do . I also do a considerable amount of computing , having some expertise with networking , operating systems and a working knowledge of programming . My environment for speech recognition is carefully controlled , quiet and the microphone settings carefully and properly adjusted.I am using this product on a Sony VAIO slim-line with XP `` Home '' version and a USB microphone.Having recently upgraded from Naturally Speaking 5 Essentials to Naturally Speaking 7 Preferred , I am sorely disappointed . My disappointment is with regard to compatibility and a complete lack of customer support.Customer support
 badly in need of some voice recognition software after a disability , I tried this product and was reasonably impressed at first . The software is excellent in terms of being able to translate human voice . however , the following problems ensued in the months to follow :1 . the software took a long time to start and initialize each time .2 . the pause after each sentence was about two seconds , which became tedious .3 . sometimes the software would lock up or stop dictating . I would have to turn the software microphone off , which sometimes took a half a minute .4 . each time I turned the microphone on , it would miss the first couple of sentences and take a long time to translate them -LRB- incorrectly -RRB- .5 . I found that I had to sometimes talk like a robot , in order for the machine to really pick up my articulation . This could be just my own personal thing , but it 's worth mentioning .6 . there were a lot of problems I had with browsing , related to one bug in particular . If you were dictating into a text area , such as a `` Give us your feedback '' box , on Amazon.com , it would often mistake words for links on the page . It would take the links , instead of writing the text , deleting all of the information you had just voiced in!As soon as the novelty wore off , I realized this product truly did not help me.I switched to IBM Via Voice , and I do not have any of the above problems -- in fact , I look forward to using it each time . I can I assure you that I gave Dragon its fair chance , by reinstalling it , and referring to the appropriate technical advisory information . The Via Voice is a much better product , so much that I can only rate this product two stars simply because I was able to actually use it to some degree .
 Well , guess what ? I 'm dictating this review . Version 7 of the long-running dragon series is probably the best version . Accuracy has been proved , and integration with Microsoft programs is also better than ever . However , I still can not recommend this product to most casual users . In command mode , it still makes a lot of mistakes , and the funny thing is , training it does not seem to make a difference . Placement of the microphone is very important . Incidentally , in the included microphone headset is very cheap . If you get a headset from Plantronics , you 're likely to get better results.Also , talking to the computer for an extended period of time can be very tiring , and your accuracy will go down the more you talk and become frustrated . Once it starts making frequent mistakes , you 'll want to shut it down.Now , can you spot the dictation mistakes in this view ?
 I thought this would be good for my students until I tried it out myself . First I tried the Italian . When I discovered that they translated `` potato chips '' as `` microchips '' , I was surprised . In telling time , they expressed the correct feminine plural but displayed the incorrect masculine singular `` il due '' for 2:00 . Now for the French ... I learned that `` potato chips '' were `` eclats '' as in `` paint chips '' . Wrong chips both times folks - and good luck in a restaurant ! I stopped there . It 's a shame they never got a native speaker to check it before releasing this as an educational item . They did get native speakers to read aloud the vocab lists however . That 's the one-star part .
 The program did migrate some of microsoft programs , and data files but very little else . It would have been easier to reinstall with the original discs . I would not recomend it . AlohaBob Ultra Plus , although costing more , is a much better program
 Someone ought to be fired for bringing this thing to market ! Does not even come close to doing what they claim . They also claim `` Free Support '' . This support consists of email support that did n't respond for 72 hours and even then did n't answer the question ! I Had to hire an IT guy for three hours to straighten out what this software screwed up , and I still havent regained the look and feel of my old PC . Save your money and look elsewhere . This product is a disaster .
 It may look like something totally great , but in actuality it 's not even worth a penny in my eyes . For one thing , everytime you speak into the microphone it dose n't recognize practically any of the words you say , even numorously repeated . And plus it brings up weird error messages , maybe because I have XP , but as the benevolent forwarner that I am , spend your $ 100 dollars on something more decent .
 When I bought this product a month ago , I was excited about the idea of sitting back and dictating my research essays . For the most part the software recognizes your voice pretty well and even though it does make mistakes , it gets better as you train it . Using it with your mouse and keyboard together works the best.However , I would have to say from my experience and reading many reviews of this product is that its company Scansoft has terrible technical support . The software has many compatibility issues -LRB- eg . Visual Studio , etc to name one -RRB- where you get alot of pop up error messages . When you want to talk to someone about it or at least send an e-mail to Scansoft , they want you to pay a hefty fee of $ 9.95 for each e-mail question or $ 19.95 for phone support . It seems this company wants to sell you a product but give you no guidance as to any of its quirks . This is almost criminal in my mind.Because of this , I recommend that people stay away from this company until they realize that charging someone for their product 's shortcomings is not RIGHT ! I also learned that a voice version of this technology comes with Office Xp and tried it out and works well with a half-decent microphone I have . So , what I am saying is that I would not buy this product due to the fact that if something goes wrong , they do not care ! Poor business ethics !
 Okay , how did you people get this thing to be in the least bit accurate ? I am now typing this review in dragon pad to see how it fares . I just finished transcribing to interviews , and got the most ridiculous results . Oddly enough , this is coming-out far more accurate , then , the interviews granted it is making grammar mistakes . But that 's to be expected . It seemed that he ca n't keep up with me when I talked very fast see , like that . I speak very clearly and actually have been a public speaker . So I know that it 's not that I mumble , or I 'm not articulating enough . I think that if all one wanted to do with this was to tie thousand e-mails and perhaps right out letters were speech is that might be fine . But using it to transcribe quickly has been a nightmare . I and purposely not going back and correcting any of this . So you can see what it really looks like tie thousand should have been typed in some . Type in some . Off yes , if I speak like a robot sometimes it works , but not always . Off yes , should have been to ah I give up . See what I mean?Let us try some nursery rhymes , Thomas Moffett sat on her topic heating or credited way . Oh , God , that was perfect . The tell Mace Moffett sat on her toughest eating her currents and way . One more try late told Mace Moffett sat on her tough it eating her curtains and way . -LRB- If you could n't tell , that was Dragon 's version of Little Miss Muffett . Just stepping in here to type , because I ca n't get it to even come vaguely close . -RRB- But in case you think that 's not fair , let 's try the back of my Sausalito cookies bad
 It often writes absolute nonsense -- a decent grammar check of the kind that Microsoft Word has had for years would eliminate about half of that , and it pathetic that Dragon has not included this already . -LRB- Example
 This is the first speech recognition software I 've ever bought or used and if this is the best out there , well , the industry has a LONG way to go.The program has a function to teach it when it makes mistakes and to tell it what you are actually trying to say . Sounds like a good idea , except that it does n't learn and just keeps on making the same mistakes again . Very frustrating . I 've gone so far to actually delete words from its own database just so it wo n't pick that same word again and again and again when it 's not the word I want it to pick -LRB- after teaching it 20 times , of course -RRB- . Customer service ? ha ! There is no online support and there is no toll free number . That 's right , apparently they want you to PAY to call them ! What nerve.If anyone wants a free copy of this software and hardware you can come by my place and pick it out of my garbage on Tuesday morning .
 I received my software with much anticipation after reading the reviews . I needed a `` Before you get started '' version just to help explain the `` Getting Started '' section . I all wanted was images , the Italian and English translations , and a pronunciation guide . It 's taking an in depth study just to learn how to effectively use the software . I am very disappointed .
 I ca n't get this program to run with Nero installed , I just get an errorbox about a debugger . The game runs fine when Nero is uninstalled , but after re-installing Nero it refuses again.Tried this on various computers -LRB- XP Pro and Home , English and Norwegian version , Nero OEM and Full -RRB- but got the same results everywhere . Customer support does n't get further than advising to uninstall Nero.Don ' t buy this program if you need Nero .
 After playing some other Scooby games my daughter -LRB- 8 -RRB- and I decided to pick up this one . Unfortunately it was not as good as the previous one we played -LRB- Some Egypt location game -RRB- . This one was more annoying than anything else . She finished it really quickly and basically put it away for good shortly after . The previous game has a high replay value - not so with this one . It might be fun for younger ones though ...
 This works fine with Palm OS but I bought it to get email attachments with Pocket PC . The only way it seems to work is to run a complete sync everytime , very slow and tedious , and that just duplicates the same message from ActiveSync . Here 's the zero rating
 The program does n't work , and neither does the support telephone number .
 This version is VERY OLD ! The maps are from 1985 and do NOT include trail data . Get the Trails Illustrated maps instead , you 'll be MUCH better off !
 My high school age son was interested in learning German . I purchased `` I Can Speak German '' based on the five very positive reviews listed on Amazon . After trying this program , I now think the reviews must have been written by the company.A language learning program should be close to intuitive to use . This cd rom was nigh unto impossible to figure out . Neither my very computer savy son nor I could figure out how to use it . I printed out fourteen pages from the Help section , made notes , but still found the program useless.Don ' t waste your money .
 Do not buy this product , i urge you ! Trust me this product is hard to actually use and i am very educated in computers . I should have listened to some of the other reviews , this one is definatly horrible . Not much on it and the German before you know it , program is missing a file to run it . Please save yourself the head ache and dont buy this .
 10 minutes after view this set up , all I could think was I want my money back !! 7 CDS of JUNK !!! And I am not kidding . There were a dozen photos of Scotland , for an example , and all of them were so horrible poor , if I did not know what Kilchurn Castle looked like I would not not I was looking at it in the photo !! That a respected organisation puts REJECTS in this shoddy product is beyond belief.The set installs with a webbrowser - only way to view the GARBAGE , it spend more time trying to sell you images from their collection on the net.This is a TOTAL RIP OFF and they should be a shamed they dared put this out .
 So many discs to juggle , store and keep track of , but I guess until they put the clip art on the cloud , this is the only way to do it . And buying old programs is a cheap way to stockpile clipart . But I think if you 've bought Hemera once , there 's no point buying a newer version . It 's all the same photos .
 It is what they said - clip art . I wanted actual full photos , these are lower quality photos of something and it is cut out of the actual picture instead of a full picture . Do n't waste your money and time unless you actually want clip art retro looking graphics .
 The images are all low resolution and are not a high enough quality for print . Too bad it was n't listed that the images are only for the web .
 The package states and shows that you can use this art in print - report covers , menus , cards , presentations , invitations , etc. . . but it is difficult at best to figure out how to even extract a photo and when you do you realize that they are about 1.5-2inches at 300 dpi.The package and online description are very misleading . If you need web photos , it is agood deal , tho some of the content is a little strange .
 When I asked the customer service rep -LRB- CSR -RRB- when they were going to attempt feature parity with the PC version , he told me they put so much effort into getting it to look right that there was no room for
 As an Intuit user since 1988 -LRB- that 's right , 16 years -RRB- I simply ca n't imagine a company that could do a better job of managing an outstanding product into abject failure.Whether Quicken or QuickBooks , Windows or Mac , these products have drifted steadily downhill since 2000 . They code is more bloated and bug filled with every new `` release '' . QuickBooks 2005 for Mac ? Let 's see ... no Online Banking function ; No Payroll Integration . I 'll go no further ... it 's as useful as an Excel program without the ability to calculate cell formulas.Save your money .
 I just got a new mac . Very pleased with its performance ! I have been using Quickbooks 4 on Windows . While the mac version of quick books had some nice features -LRB- lack of Quick books ads , not so many navigation buttons that go to the same place -RRB- I did not like the fact that I had to manually type in the customers information all over again if the ship to address was different than my company . Might sound trivial , but when you create purchase orders all day long it adds alot of time . Also , no shipping feature . Have to manually type in your shipping addresses somewhere else because Quick books for mac does not have it ! Custom invoices and purchase orders are not that custom . You have to use their form , ca n't change the size of the columns , You can insert a logo but have to put it where they put it ! You can change the fields . The text is so small that you have to sit about a foot away from the puter to see it . With my other programs for mac I can go in and change the font size in that program . With Quickbooks I have to change my whole screen resolution . I called Quickbooks and was told that I could pay 100.00 for a month support or I could pay 350.00 for a year of support . I asked if this support would make the drop ship auto fill work and she said no . I said for 700.00 shirley I can find another program that works properly to start with ! She said I could exchange the program for Quickbooks 5 for windows and just use my old PC for Quickbooks , and maybe by next year they would have better features of quickbooks for mac . I asked for a refund . She said I could send it back in 60 days if I wanted . Probably so I would forget about it and not return it . Seems like I read a 30 day money back garautee somewhere!Overall , I am not pleased with my 300.00 investment . If I could rate this program with NO stars I would !
 If you are planning on round-tripping between your Mac and a Windows version -LRB- i.e. between your accountant or bookeeper 's PC using a windows version of Quickbooks Pro- DO NOT PURCHASE this product ! Unfortunately , there are two major flaws with Quickbooks 2005 7.0 . The first and most dangerous is that the more you round trip the more corrupt your data will become . Secondly , if you have memorized reports you will have to errase them before round tripping and they will not be saved.Unfortunately Quickbooks does not tell you this before purchasing - infact they advertise this easy conversion between Mac and PC as a selling feature for their product.If you do not need to have your accountant or CPA manipulate your data on their PC , then the program is a good attempt to make a Windows style program into a MAC-like product .
 Because we have recently become totally Mac-based , we transferred our Quickbooks from an older PC to our new Mac G5 . While Quickbooks is pretty effortless on the PC - allowing payroll to be processed directly from the single software - the Mac system requires other complimentary software - Aatrix Top Pay - to accomplish that simple task . This awkward and Byzantine requirement makes the investment pretty useless to us and something we regret spending the money on and taking the time to incorporate . It is really disappointing.Bernie Krause , PhDPresidentWild Sanctuary , Inc. .
 Do n't buy it . If you 're on Mac , spend your money on PC emulator and use the PC version of QuickBooks . The Mac version does n't seem to be designed to be used as a bookkeeping system for a business . You ca n't print deposit slips . You can print a deposit summary , but the bank is funny about requiring an account number and a routing number.QuickBooks wo n't do payroll updates for the Mac version , so you have to jump through more hoops to get signed up with yet another vendor , then you get the software vs. software argument
 This new version is a complete joke if you need an accountant to check things over and make changes . Unlike the windows version , the mac version can not create an accountants copy . This means that you ca n't make any changes to the file -LRB- like add new entries -RRB- until you get the revised file back from your account . In contrast , the windows version has had the ability to do accountants copies for years . This alone makes the program borderline useless in my opinion .
 I use QuickBooks for Windows and really want to get rid of myWindows machine . I purchased Quickbooks for the Mac andwas STUNNED by the LACK of functionality of the product.Intuit continues to treat the Mac as the ugly step child.Quickbooks for the Mac without any online functionality such as internet banking is a joke . I am stuck with Quickbooks for Windows for now .
 The terms of the rebate are n't listed here but once you get the pakage you will see in the fine print that it is only for people who are UPGRADING from a previous version of QuickBooks .
 If you are only upgrading from Quickbooks 4 for Mac because of printer problems running under classic in OS X , I suggest you live with constantly having to reselect the printer . An upgrade to 2005 will fix the printer problems , but it 's not worth it.We `` upgraded '' from Quickbooks 4 for Mac and were not too excited . QB4 felt like a MAC application , 2005 feels like a PC port . I knew from the advertising that there were really no new features that made it worth the money , but running QB4 under OS 9 -LRB- in the classic environment -RRB- was a problem for us , since it would loose track of the assigned and available printers.The menu organization is less intuitive . For example , Inventory Activities is in the Vendors menu , and GL Journal Entries is in the Banking menu . Graphs are buried in amongst the reports , rather than a top level graph menu.The names for things you put on the company toolbar are now limited to 9 characters.The top menu crowds out the standard Apple items normally on the right.We can get used to all that . The main complaint is QB 2005 expects you to have a large screen . All the fonts and window displays are much larger . Needlessly so , in my opinion . This would n't be so bad except the window resizing is limited and columns in the windows can not be resized.For example , the Items window does n't fit on our screen and we ca n't see the item numbers and the scroll bar at the same time . You ca n't resize the width to make it fit -LRB- like every other mac application , except some games -RRB- , nor can you reduce the 2 inch column for quantity on hand -LRB- which looks like it would allow about 40 digits -RRB- . Being able to customize the columns displayed in the items window would do it , but that is n't available .
 I had problems setting up the windows version of this program . When I called support , all the guy wanted to do was sell me an extra support plan . He was n't even interested in hearing my question.The program is easy to use , but is very limited in functions . Also , no multiple currencies
 Do not get taken with this lousy product . the payroll portion of this is made by a different company and will cost you 19.99 a month after the 3 month trial period is up . but then it will not open unless you have file-vault turned off ! I would own a PC instead of a Mac if I wanted to operate without file-vault !! the devil is in the details ... it would be nice if all the advertising that they do to sell this , that they would be honest and upfront about it not working on MAC .
 The games are good . My daugter who is 6 loves them . But after she finishes Unit 1 , she keeps getting `` here at jump start camp , we have a few more things to do before we start the next adventure , why do n't you quit the game and start over ? '' . We could not get rid of this no matter what we tried . Unit 2 never enables for us . Called their customer support , emailed them ... so far we were asked to send some files off our hard disk to them and no response after that ... We have been trying to get them to resolve this issue for weeks now .
 I had a problem with the installation.I started the installer and successfully registered online , but the installer later had a disk read problem . I canceled the install and tried again , but now the installer insisted on my registering again.I successfully logged into the web site with my newly created account from the first install , but the installer would n't recognize that I had previously registered . It continued to insist I register before proceeding , which I could n't do since my email account was already tied to the first registration.Turns out the integration between the web registration and the program install is sloppy and cheap . It 's not transactional and it 's handled by a VB Script -LRB- cheesy ! -RRB- . Luckily , I happen to be a programmer , and I wound up copying the CD to a hard drive , tweaking the . vbs to skip the registration check , installing the application , then modifying an.ini file to fool it into thinking I installed from the CD drive . If this makes sense to you , and you 're willing to do the same if your initial install fails , then have fun.Apparently , you also need an internet connection to start up the game as well , which may make this game unusable when traveling , unless you have wi-fi access or a cellular modem.That being said , my son seems to enjoy the game .
 This is the lousiest children 's software I 've ever seen . I think the previous reviews must be that of an earlier version . I am returning it to Amazon . Save yourself the trouble -- do n't purchase it.What are the issues ? -LRB- 1 -RRB- My kids use my old laptop -- a machine with 512 MB of RAM , Pentium-III 500 MHz CPU and 32 MB of video RAM . Not the greatest machine , granted ... but the software is slow as molasses on it . -LRB- 2 -RRB- The game will not work unless the CD is the drive * AND * themachine is connected to the internet . I 'd rather not connect my5-year old 's machine to the internet . Thank you very much . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Navigation in the game is not with a mouse but with arrow keys.And if a kid presses an arrow key in a `` disallowed '' direction , thereis no beep or anything . So , the kid keeps pressing the key and getsfrustrated . -LRB- 4 -RRB- Every 10 minutes or so , the software freezes with a `` loading '' message . Looks like the CD is not complete . It actually downloadscontent from the internet each time . I suppose this is to preventpiracy . But do you really want to support a company that does n't trustits customers and is willing them to let them endure long waits?If I could give this game 0 stars , I would give it .
 I wish the product description was more upfront . My daughter has been trying to get to the next unit but I 'm now afraid you have to pay for the membership . I am not willing to do so when there are plenty of free educational games on the internet . The educational value was too easy for my five year old and there were too many `` fluff '' activities .
 When the software works , I think it is great . It combines the fun of playing a game with educational activities in reading and math . However , buying the CD is just the beginning , you have to really sign up for the monthly subscription for it to go to other levels . The program is poorly written and if you do n't exit it properly you are completely messed up and have to uninstall and re-install the software and you child has to go over everything again . This has happened to my son 3 times and it is very frustrating . I think they just do n't want to fix this as it keeps the usage/subscription going for a longer time . I wish there was a better competing product on the market as I really do n't like what they are doing .
 Just got off the phone with Charles at Jump Start support , turns out they do not support any of the disked products and just want you to pay to join the online version . Even though HE KNEW HOW TO HELP , he refused to do so . Definitely stuck in a job he obviously hates , I feel sorry for him . My child 's user name was accidentally deleted and he refused to help us get it back , saying they offer no support for the disked versions . In addition , we purchased this full disk version after buying these smaller disk versions wheere at least HALF the areas on the disk are untouchable and the kids ca n't click on those areas since they al ; say `` under construction . '' Do n't waste your money !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I 've used QuickBooks for 11 or 12 years . I ca n't wait until there is a reasonable alternative that will allow me to import my QuickBooks data and stop using QuickBooks.The QuickBooks software is generally user friendly and does a reasonably good job of simplifying small business accounting transactions . However , Intuit has a very poor attitude toward its customers as demonstrated by their business practices . With every upgrade , they force the customer to buy the next version by making it impossible to productively use the old software . They make a lot of money on upgrades.With every new version , they extract more money out of the customer through other means as well . For example , QuickBooks originally allowed manual payroll accounting , but with every new release it became more difficult to do manual payroll . Now , there is NO manual payroll accounting . There are instead a few options for their payroll accounting services , which start at $ 200 per year for a company with one employee . That cost has increased steadily , so check for the actual cost to process payroll . The charge seems steep for downloading publicly available payroll tax tables . Intuit obviously sees their customers as captives and they are doing everything they can to squeeze money out of them.Your accounting data in the proprietary QuickBooks data format is used to keep you upgrading as they shake you down for more money each year . Remember when you 'd purchase software ? Now you lease software , and it costs more each year . It feels like the software owns me.Here 's another aspect of leased software . I tried to buy a used copy of QuickBooks . This was n't some pirate deal where you get a CD and nothing else . I purchased the original CD with the user manual , packaging and authorization code . It would n't register . I called Intuit and they told me it was already registered . I told them I bought the software from the original owner . They said I could n't do that , and I needed to buy the $ 499 shrink wrapped version . QuickBooks is tightly integrated to their online services and wo n't work without their official approval . Can you think of any other item you purchase that ca n't be sold as a used item ? What would you think if Toyota told you that you could n't sell your car , or you could n't buy someone else 's car , and the only way to buy a Toyota was to buy a new one from the dealer ? You can buy and sell other intellectual property such as books , CDs , and DVDs . Why not QuickBooks ? Even after spending a lot of money , you do n't own QuickBooks . It 's a $ 500 annual software lease , with other attached leases for payroll services , multiple user licenses , etc.The large amounts of money paid to Intuit on a yearly basis are bad enough , but you 'd at least think that you 'd get some customer service . Nope . Their customer service call center is in India . You deal with the language barrier , and generally have people with no direct understanding of western accounting , payroll or taxes . You get the usual call center `` support '' deal , with a person reading from a troubleshooting sheet that never seems to have anticipated your problem . If it is n't in the manual , it probably is n't going to be answered by the overseas call center either.If you are just starting out , find another small business accounting solution . I do n't have any experience with the others so I ca n't recommend any of them , but they must be better than QuickBooks , because Intuit believes they own their customers . They essentially act as a non-government agency levying a tax on small businesses . Avoid the QuickBooks tax .
 After I installed and converted my file to the 2005 format I was informed that the E-File and E-Pay features were removed in version 2005 . The support folk in India could not tell me if this was temporary or permanent . The only option to continue E-File and E-Pay was to remove version 2005 and reinstall version 2004 . What a way to treat customers ! How about some up front disclosure Intuit ? I 've been using Quickbooks for 7 years . This may be my last upgrade !
 I agree with the above users , there are better software out there . Please look around and be more futuristic . QuickBooks is for very small companies only . It slows down when the size of your database goes up . I tested some software and found some really good , with reasonable price
 the product works just fine but it hard to believe that max size for the data card is 512mb for 120 + dollars and you can buy a 2g sd card for 7 to 20 dollars figured you might get more bang for your buck since the data card is twice the size of a sd card
 It is unbelievable to sell a 512 Mb Memory Card for US$ 125 . I have no other option and I have to buy it for my Garmin but I consider them thieves .
 When advertised by amazon it stated that this data card works with all Garmin GPS units . This statement is false . It does not work with the Garmin Street Pilot III Deluxe model . I tried to load it 4 times with maps with no success . The 256 MB data card works OK .
 I used this version of the software several years ago and it was not bad , but I would not recomend it today . This version is just too old and is certainly not worth the $ 750 which it is currently priced at.-Mike
 This is the second or third business plan builder I have used , and it may be the best I 've seen for putting together a plan in a logical , cohesive process . But it is by far the WORST piece of software I have ever used for formatting output and ending up with a polished , professional-looking finished product . This application is diseased with problems in spacing , indentation , tabs , bullets , numbering , and anything else that may be imported from Word or applied within this program . The MS Word export function flat-out CRASHED my MSWord XP Professional , and anything imported from Word ended up with a mind of its own once it hit Business Plan Pro . So here I am with a nice , tidy little business plan -- but I have to completely re-do it in Word and Excel or look like an idiot when I hand it out in presentations.As much as I appreciate this product 's ability to walk one through a business plan , what good is the plan if it is irreversibly locked into an ugly , inconsistent , un-fixable format for printing ?
 I too have been having problems with this program . Like state above the program would just shut down -LRB- sometimes with several error messages -RRB- but unlike stated above , this crash happens everytime I start the program up . At first it was working fine but then a week or so after installment it started shutting done for no reason and I ca n't get it to stay running for more then a few seconds at a time . this program has given me nothing but problems since i got it .
 I am currently using this product to create a business plan . After using it for 2 months , suddenly it crashes whenever I touch any graph in the outline view . Tech support is mediocre at best , simply sending me longer and longer test scripts to install on my machine . I still can not get a graph to display ... BP PRO crashes every time . I would not recommend this software because I can not keep it running !
 This product could probably be good for some people . I did not find it helpful for my situation .
 DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS XP OR NEWER MAC , SINCE I WO N'T BE BUYING AN OLDER COMPUTER I 'VE BEEN UNABLE TO USE IT .
 My sister bought this game for my 4yo daughter this Christmas , and she enjoys playing it -LRB- granting it a second star . -RRB- That being said , I found this title the fall way short of the sort of work that Henson and Activision are capable of.The graphics they were weak and blocky . I think the title plays in standard VGA mode . As mentioned by a previous reviewers , all of the between play content consists of still images and text , rather than actually being animated and spoken by the characters . All together I was so unimpressed that I had to check the back of the box to assure myself that it was in fact a new release and not something put out 10-15 years ago.The gameplay is alright for the younger crowd their aimed at , but the controls are completely keyboard-based . It would have been much simpler for the kids -LRB- and everyone else , for that matter -RRB- to have had all of the games controlled by the mouse , or perhaps even both to give people the option . None of the games needed keyboard control , and I think all of them were hindered by it.Would I buy this title having seen it ? Well , it is only ten bucks ... but I 'd probably hold off until it got clearanced at half off .
 The install was awful . It installed 600mb of stuff onto my hard drive and it still needed an internet connection to install . Just to launch the thing requires an internet connection . So forget this if you want to travel with it on a laptop . Why do they do this ? I think it 's so they can sell you more modules . Turns out what you buy only contains two modules , the other 10 you can purchase . Once installed it would constantly hang as soon as we went into the arcade . I ended up returning it . I also think , but ca n't verify because it did n't work right , that they show you the other 10 modules as places you can go , but are roped off inside the game . So your kids see these other 10 modules dangling in front of them . Meaning your kid will see these and put pressure on you to buy the other 10 so they can go there . Honestly , I think the game you buy is a ploy to get you to buy more .
 This product allows the child to only access a very small percentage of what displays in the game as being available . For about 80 % of it , when they click to do that part of the game , it gives them a message that their parents need to become members for them to have access to the additional games . Membership is $ 7.99 per month or $ 149 one time fee ! I do n't recommend this at all , because I think it is bait and switch . My daughter is extremely upset because we can not buy the membership , so she ca n't play most of the game . She has really enjoyed the parts available to her , but the company should make it CLEAR on the packaging that a membership subscription for an additional fee is required in order to access most of the game .
 I could n't install this on my PC which had less than 420MB on the C drive . I had lot 's of space elsewhere but this program does n't allow you to choose which drive to install it on . So if you have that problem do n't buy this software . I 'm sorry if this is not exactly a review but if I ca n't install it for this simple reason , I believe people should be aware about it .
 This software is piece of junk . Originally bought couple years back and struggled at that time installing it -LRB- since it required internet connection to activate the product -RRB- . JS would send `` progress report '' emails every time kids go through a level -LRB- with marketing stuff in it ofcourse ! -RRB- but I thought it was acceptable since I get 100s of junk emails everyday anyway.Then I rebuilt my machine and forgot about this . Kids found this CD again today and wanted to play . I went through the installation once again today and no wonder it took me through same registration process . Their website is still crappy I would not give 1 out of 10 stars per any enterprise s/w development standards . I continued to struggle activating the product . First , they still want ALL information about you ... Your name , how many kids you have at home , your mailing address , everything ! On a website that sounds like a 10th grader work I was not comfortable giving my personal information but kids wanted to play so I was forced to enter data and then boom ! Website has started throwing Page 404 -LRB- not found -RRB- error ... I have paid for a product but I am not able to use it because they have done a poor job ... No I am doing all steps right since I am an IT professional with 15 + years of professional experience ... Software can not get uglier than this folks ...
 The game would not finish installing . When we choose `` No thanks '' to purchase the additional online modules then the install quit .
 I installed this piece of crap on my HP machine . After installing when the kids try to run this from their non admin account this wo n't even start . Errors out with ` Error setting up channels ' . So this crap requie admin privliege to pry on your accounts !?! And the contact # published on the inset paper was disconnected and the number on their website goes to a dead end voicemail . No replies for my emails even after 48 hours . I also would strongly agree with other people 's comment about the online -LRB- not just online but a broadband online -RRB- scam ! Never buy this product and I would even say never buy anyother product from such a seller even if that product is really good !
 My son is entering 2nd grade , and has enjoyed the Jumpstart K & 1st grade products . I had thought this was another standalone program , like the previous versions . It 's not!The box has a section on the bottom , with requirements , and mentions that you need a broadband connection , but does n't say why.When I installed , I could not continue without creating an account on Jumpstart 's web site . I never register software products , and dislike giving out my personal information , as it usually results in more junk in my inbox or mailbox . Needless to say , I used a fake e-mail address and got past that.Next thing you get is a pitch to sign up for monthly subscription at -LSB- ... -RSB- / month . If I had n't paid for the software in the first place , this might seem more reasonable . Having to subscribe to a service that charges whether your child plays or not is n't what I bought the product for.I declined , and my son did enjoy the games once he was in . The load-up time was very long , however.Now that it 's installed , it wants my e-mail/password each time the program starts . And it 's now not playing nicely on my laptop . About 30 % of the time the program gets to a screen that says UPDATING and hangs . Other times , I get an error that Application Starter has had a problem and needs to exit . Usually I have to reboot clean , just to get it to run . This is XP Pro on a Dell laptop that usually has no issues with any software ... . not sure what 's making it unhappy.Overall , I 'm not satisfied with this program . I 'll give it a few more days , but if my son 's not playing it much , I will replace it with something from another company . This subscription thing feels like a bait-and-switch , so my next purchase of this sort of software will be from another company .
 From the get go this was trouble
 This game locked up and froze on a recent Gateway computer with the Vista OS . I tried various work-arounds , including giving the software administrator priviledges and attempting to run it in `` XP Service Pack 2 '' compatibility mode . These attempts were unsuccessful . I did install on an XP SP2 machine , and at least initially , the game appears to work.Also , I was surprised/disappointed to discover the game requires online registration . Thankfully , it did not require a correct mailing address to work.Also , be aware , the game attempts to `` sell you '' additional modules of gameplay .
 My daugher really enjoys this game , however , she called to me after she had discovered two out of the 10 or so `` worlds '' . Apparently I have to pay a monthly fee for her to access the additional worlds . What 's particularly disappointing to me is that it 's a monthly fee . As a parent that limits `` screen time '' I 'll have to pay a lot for her to complete the game . Very disappointed that there are additional costs associated with the game . I 'm toying with the idea of seeking out a new game for her rather than pay the monthly charges for this one . It 's unfortunate as she really does enjoy the game ...
 This software is not very compatible with any operating system . First thing I had to do is delete my current version of QuickTime . Then I deleted the Disney software and re-installed it . I tried installing on my Windows 7 laptop it would n't work so I finally installed it 2X on my desktop with XP . It 's great learning software it just needs to be more compatible to and not bug up .
 I ordered this with the excitement of a 10 year old on Christmas - I 've been desperately looking for the Where in The World is Carmen Sandiego that I played when I was a litle girl . I ordered this one because the picture of the item showed the version I 've been looking for-the 1996 version , however , when I got the CD , I got the 2001 version , which is A -RRB- not the one I want , and B -RRB- not the one in the picture . I wish they would 've specified to me that they were going to send me the 2001 version instead of having me order it thinking that I was purchasing the 1996 version -LRB- which again , is the version pictured -RRB- . The only good thing about my experience is that I got the shipment really fast-about 3 days after I placed the order .
 I just received this software to help me prepare my son and niece for the SAT exam . In the first 30 minutes we used it , there were 4 spelling errors and 1 serious content error . I am pursuing a refund .
 The manufacturer has since come out with a newer version ofthis product -LRB- version 2.0 -RRB- but both versions are spotty andclunky . There are strengths to be sure , but it is hard torecommend this product . Permissions issues , installationdifficulties , problems in multiple user environments , youget the idea . Some of the problems are solved with the patchesavailable on their website , http://support.daemonnews.org/macoffice/ - I have not tried version 2.5
 I purchased Clickart 400,000 and have never felt more taken advantage of by a software company . You see only 150,00 of the images are actually in the box Ibought . The rest I have to sit on my stinking 56K modem and wait for them to download . I could not believe this when I realized it . I went and looked at the box andsaw there was a tiny asterick saying that only some of the images are actually in the box and that you needed to go online for the rest . If I wanted to buy an internetsubscription I would have done that . I will never buy another Broderbund or Clickart product again . There are plenty of reputable clip art products out there that do nottry to fool their customers .
 I bought this for my job where we do n't have internet but wanted to be able to make simple signs . This does not work unless you have an internet connection .
 I purchased this product to use whilst I am working away from home - to develop learning materials.After installing the product without the internet connected I found out majority of the clip art is online!You would obviously think that when it is on a DVD ROM and the box states 400,000 clip art `` An entire library of creative images and fonts '' that is what you would get - WRONG!Of the 459,847 items in the search window 410,911 are online!That leaves 48,936 items on the DVD ROMI will never purchase another Broderbund product again .
 Although Ulead has accomplished a great deal for both the casual and the serious web developer , the JavaRazor package is not one of them . The functions found in these programs are identical to those available in lower cost -LRB- or free -RRB- programs ... The programs attempt to make the insertion of the applet code easier by generating the code in a manner that inevitably requires you to go back and manually re-edit them . The applets themselves are larger than is desireable and after a while you find they are not worth the download time to have on your site . The applet code itself is unnecessarily bloated for the current stage of Java developement and does more to give a bad impression of the Java language than to encourage it 's use . If you do decide to purchase this product for use on a publicly accessible site you will inevitably cease using it and add it to your pile of abandoned software and chalk it up as a wasted expense . Hopefully the applets will be trimmed and the functionality improved in future versions but for now we can only wait and see .
 If you 're considering purchase of this for a younger student -LRB- say elementary school through maybe 8th grade tops -RRB- this might be a worthwhile choice . Otherwise , I would stay away from this . The content is strictly entry level . The art is done on the cheap . There are no references , and no in-depth coverage of anything . I was hoping for good coverage of major Gods & Goddesses with perhaps classical art depictions of same . None of that here . If you 're looking for an electronic reference on the subject of classical mythology , this is not it . Save you money and buy a book unless you want something stricly juvenile in its orientation . I give it two stars -LRB- being generous -RRB- because it might be a decent introduction for some kid who is book-averse .
 My daughter and I love to study about animals together but we find this cd a little boring . However , it will come in handy for looking up specific information about birds , for school projects , or home study . It is worth $ -LSB- money -RSB- .
 My 4 year old son loves Thomas . He has some difficulty understanding railway adventures but he liked playing ... however , my husband & I were disappointed in the quality of this program ... During play , the game has frozen up & also is choppy when the characters are speaking ... I do n't feel it is worth ...
 My 5 year old son is a Thomas fanatic . We had purchased the Great Festival Adventure , which he really enjoyed , and so decided to try this game . The plastic keyboard topper did not fit our HP keyboard properly , -LRB- unlike Tonka Dig N Rigs and Workshop -RRB- , and as a result often times the controls would not work at all , causing my son great frustration . Until they can rework the key top to be truly universal , this is a definite DO N'T BUY .
 We bought this for my five year old last year , and it was just a miserable experience from the beginning . The playset that straps onto the keyboard is not always cooperative , and once that issue is addressed , the software itself is difficult to follow for my son or for me ! He became extremely frustrated after a few tries and it wound up being a very costly mistake . Avoid this one !
 OK , so it 's the day after Christmas and I sit down to play this game with my 5 year old son . He plays for awhile , but keeps getting stuck - so I try . I had a horrible time with it too . We could n't get the track to move where we wanted it to go , could n't get to the other games , etc. . Although my son is 5 , he 's been playing on a computer for 2 1/2 years already and I 'm no computer slouch myself.I found the game poorly programmed with marginal graphics compared to other products . If I had to do it over again , I 'd pass on the fancy set-up for the keyboard and software to purchase another Jump Start or Rescue Hero game.Just one moms thoughts ...
 The CD loaded fine . I strapped the plastic device to the keyboard as indicated and although the `` pegs '' that come down from the device to activate the keys did come down , for some reason did either not match up or did not protrude far enough to activate . When I removed the device and pushed the keys individually , the game would run . Maybe it was just this one and does not happen to others . I had also purchased the Tonka Dig N Rigs Playset which offers the same concept and it works fine ...
 BEWARE ! I am very disappointed . My son loves trains and Thomas , and when I ordered this I thought he would love it . Everything is properly installed , but the playset will not work . I see on the Infogrames website that the FAQs say to use the keyboard if the playset wo n't work , but what fun is that for a 4 year old - he wants to drive the train ! I know it is not the configuration of my keyboards - I have tried it on 2 keyboards . Both times , the playset will press the keys enough to type the characters when I have it in Microsoft Word , but it will not respond when it is in the Thomas program.Do NOT show this to your child until you are sure it will work ! I 'm sure glad we tried it before Christmas ! I sent an email to Infogrames -LRB- mfgr -RRB- on 12/22/01 - as of 1/19/02 still no response.And once you 've opened the software , no refund !!
 My 3 year old son enjoyed `` Thomas & Friends
 This is nothing but a redistribution of Anonymizer . The first lie you are told is that this program will protect your privacy on the web . In order to protect your privacy on the web and supposedly surf the web anonymously -LRB- another lie -RRB- you have to type in your personal information ; name , address , phone , e-mail , etc. ; if you do not do this , the program will not run . This is a violation of the privacy the program was said to protect . Cosmi , unfortunately , has been selling as of late quite a few programs that are nothing more than disguised spyware . This is quite a contrast to the Cosmi -LRB- Starshine , Swift -RRB- that used to make very good programs available at a budget price . Apparently Cosmi has joined eGames among the list of software publishers to avoid ; this is truly a shame . It is just plainly inexcuseable to disguise spyware as a program intended to protect your privacy.-Bob
 God knows how much I love NSYNC , but this phone is not worth the current asking price , trust me ! I bought it for my 5 and 12 year old daughters , one each , so they would n't fight over them , and they were excited to the max to see them in the package . That was the first and last day -LRB- the only day -RRB- that those phones have gotten any of their attention . With the guys repeating the SAME answers OVER and OVER again , it gets old VERY fast ! And the CD games ? Those are a JOKE ! Stupid , just totally stupid ! A VERY remedial bowling game , where the guys heads are the top part of the pins ??? Even my 5 year old said , `` Mommy , this game is dumb '' ! I still can not believe that NSYNC would endorse such junk!As much as I love them ... Shame on them !
 I could n't wait to buy this product for my NSync crazy 10-yr-old daughter . What a disappointment ! The directions are difficult to follow . The phone is terribly annoying and tough to operate . And can anyone tell me how to get the NSync guys to `` call '' us on the phone ? When do you use the mouse ? When do you use the buttons on the phone ? No one in my house is quite sure how to use this game -LRB- and my husband is a Senior IT Analyst ! -RRB- Needless to say , since it was opened and installed on our home computer around Christmas time , this one is a major dust collector . No one plays with this.As stated by my 10-year-old daughter , `` This is DUMB ! '' .
 Do n't get this game there is realy no point to the game I gave it a star because I felt sorry for the bad game .
 The advertising on the package says that you can use the product for Karoke or duetThe microphone records just fine in about 10second intervals ... The voices of my children do not get broadcast through the speakers as in a Karoke machine . The poor kids are singing away and they do n't even get recorded ... just one word when the program stops and goes into `` record '' mode . . What 's worse is you ca n't hear my children sing ... just the characters - the microphone does not broadcast through the speakers ... The Microphone is only active during short spurts during the songsIf you advertise Karoke you should deliver it ... and the voice recordings ca n't even be played backwards ...
 I purchased the nicktoons microphone and cd-rom , but I could not connect the microphone cord to our Dell tower . The connection at the end of the microphone cord has a larger prong than the connectors at the back of the tower . Is there an adapter that I can buy so that I can connect the cord to the back of the tower ? If so , what is the adapter called and where and how much is it ?
 I 'm having a problem with the RECORDING staying on . The Customer support for this product is terrible . In this day and age in my opinion they should have developed and on-line chat support team . However you first have to locate the e-mail , and they do n't make it easy . So far I 'm not please with this product . I 'm still working with customer support to resolve my issues and each time you request information via e-mail you have to wait 24 hours . for your response . This really sucks to be perfectly honest.Acoustica Spin It Again Vinyl RestorationOh , must Iforget the software tells you the label maker is included in this purchase , it pretends its downloading then you find out its not you need to purchase the actual acoustica label maker . This is not a great product . I 'm very disappointed .
 An ardent oenophile -LRB- what an elderly friend of mine playfully calls a dedicated wino -RRB- with a newly purchased PDA , my discovery of this program in a Wine Enthusiast catalog conjured expactations of mountains of reviews at my fingertips . I also expected to be able to organize my own collection and record my impressions of wines I had drunk , as well as any notes and recommendations from others for wines I might like to try in the future . While , in all honesty , this program does this , it does n't do it as well or as smoothly as I had expected.Take for instance the reviews section . A surprising number of the listed wines carry only a breif description but no review . -LRB- Piedmontese wine lovers beware - the objects of your affection are sorely under-represented and even if listed are rarely reviewed . -RRB- The cellar inventory aspect in good but not great . The autotext completion features that save one having to write `` Bordeaux '' one hundred times or that fill in appelation names from the first few letters lack many names that would be expected in a program such as this.Perhaps most distressing is that Bordeaux wines are startlingly under-represented in the review section . Many premier chateau are not cited at all.Am I being a bit too demanding of a $ ... program ? Perhaps . Nevertheless , I was a bit less than satisfied with the program . Were it possible to return software programs , I suspect I would . Alas , such things are not allowed . I am left with it to make of it what I can .
 My company forces us to use this horrible program . It 's easily the least user friendly program I have ever used and constantly does crazy -LRB- bug -RRB- things . Save your money and look into Microsoft for your scheduling !!!!!!!
 I bought the Primvera Suretrak Project Manager , after I bought it we had it installed and found that it would not work with todays computers , we tried to return it and was told we could not.This is my first and last purchase from Amazon , bad merchandise and bad customer service.Jack Jackson
 I saw this software in a Mac store and based upon the features listed on the box , I bought it . The limitations for this version of the software are extreme
 Finale -- the maker of this software -- has a free , downloadable notation software program you can download . Their other products , including this one , are all fancier versions . My son wanted a version that was too expensive for us , but had marching band percussion sounds . Then this year MakeMusic added percussion sounds to Finale PrintMusic 2006 . I bought it immediately -LRB- at a university bookstore , actually -RRB- , as it had many amazing features at a good price -LRB- one can input notes through a microphone , by scanning sheet music that the program will then read , by MIDI from a keyboard , etc. -RRB- . But I ca n't get any of those features to work . When I scan in black and white , it says it thinks I scanned in color and it wo n't read it . My son played his trumpet into the microphone , and what showed up onscreen was largely unrelated to what he played . Most frustrating , I ca n't get my keyboard and the software to work together to input notes effectively . I borrowed a different keyboard -- a Yamaha Clavinova -- and it did actually input notes to the software , so I thought maybe my Yamaha PSR keyboard was the problem , although I read that the UNO interface I was using has problems with some Yamaha keyboards . But even though I was able to get notes to the software with the Clavinova instead of the PSR keyboard , the software did n't notate them especially well . Upon switching to a Yamaha MIDI interface , my PSR does enter a note every time I push a key -LRB- instead of once every several seconds -RRB- , but again the software does n't notate it accurately . It has also skipped measures when I input lyrics . I 'm sure others have had great experiences with this software , but I wish I 'd stayed with the free Notepad software and just kludged along .
 Not what I was hoping for , sorry I did n't like this program it is confusing to use and does n't do what I thought it would do am just glad I did n't pay allot ofr it .
 I bought version 2 -LRB- that I did n't use a lot -RRB- and upgraded it to version 3 because I got a new DV Camcorder and thought I would finally use it . It did n't capture well with my 1394 card nor did I find it intuitive . I hate the fact that I do n't know how long my video is and that I ca n't cut my videos where I want to the first time . I heard that Ulead VideoStudio works great ... I 'll be buying that .
 Put nicely , Videosuite 3.0 is terrible . It took me a couple days to figure out how to bring in video -LRB- MGI is so smart that they do n't include an instruction manual with the software -RRB- . After I finally had to have a computer-expert friend come over and make the thing work , it made me want to cry . The process of puting clips together is basically impossible , and adding music ... forget about it . All I wanted was a little program to help me get started in making skate videos . Usually , when software falls short , the effort itself is worth some praise , but Videowave III ... holy crap . I repeat
 I bought this for my little one who loves Pooh . The program does n't do a whole lot and it is n't too intuitive for a toddler . We have Reader Rabbit Baby/Toddler and she can do a lot more in it .
 I brought this CD for my 3 year old who has got a hang of the computer . He has been using Barney interactive earlier on , which I highly recommend to every parent . My son was trying with the mouse and its really not as good as expected . He got frustrated with it pretty fast . I suggest Disney takes a look at the Barney Interactive CD 's .
 My 10-month old baby sees me typing at the computer so much , it 's only natural that her little hands reach for the keyboard at every opportunity . I was thrilled when I found this computer software , specifically aimed towards her age group -LRB- 9-24 months -RRB- . In description it sounds great , but in use , it 's very disappointing . The graphics are beautiful , and the opening and closing sequences caught my baby 's attention . But aside from that , there is so little to do . I ca n't imagine it being entertaining for very long for any child.I was hoping that each keystroke would cause an immediate reaction on the screen , accompanied by sound , but most of the movements and sounds are too subtle to be interesting to a baby . Even worse , sometimes a keystroke does n't result in any action at all . For the most part , my baby ignores what 's going on on screen.Also , the most poorly planned part of this software is that it does not have a feature to deactivate the Control , Windows , and function keys on the keyboard . This means that if you let your baby loose to push whatever keys she wants , you end up with problems like the Start menu popping up , and once that is activated , pushing any other keys can cause all kinds of things to happen which you do n't want ! Even with you sitting right there holding your baby , in just seconds your baby can do stuff you did n't know was possible to your computer . Now , whenever I let her play with this software , I try to keep her hands away from the off-limits keys . This frustrates her , and is tiresome to me.Software for babies is a great idea , but this one falls far short of what it could be . I definitely would n't recommend it , aside from the cuteness factor .
 not worth buying unless your baby is crazy about pooh , and I do n't think any 9 month old would be so decided in preference . My son actually played with it since 7 mo old , and we found that the response times are so awful that even we could not see the correlation between key strokes and activities on screen , this was with a then year old laptop . Its slow but barely tolerable with our now 3 yr old computer . Further , all of the keys are not captured , so your son can shut down , change the display , or otherwise lock up the computer while playing by slecting random things from the start or windows menus . its hard -LRB- NOT POSSIBLE -RRB- to tell an excited 7 mo old to press only the spacebar or some other one key ! At 17 months he is finally calmer and gentler to the keyboard , and knows to hit one key at a time but definitely not earlier.He loves jump start baby , and sesame street baby just as much , and those are much nicer on your nerves , as you do n't need to calm a baby upset because his game has disappeared , and keep him soothed while rebooting yet again ! The mickey toddler is better built
 My 15 month old son absolutely adores Reader Rabbit Toddler , but still has difficulty remembering to slide the mouse around as opposed to slamming it down on the desk . When I found this software , created specifically for babies , I was thrilled to see that keystrokes would create responses on screen and that my son was n't expected to use the mouse at all . I just had to have it ! After all , it was a Disney product so it had to be good , right ? Hmmm ... The opening scene was really great - my son was instantly captivated , but from there on out it was astonishingly bad . The premise is that very young children learn `` cause and effect '' by pushing the keys to create some kind of feedback on screen . What happens instead is that there is a pause - of up to 4 seconds , somtimes - before anything happens , and often it seems as though on screen movement occurs independently of the keystrokes . There is only the most intermitent feedback . My son lost interest within minutes and , after trying it a few more times , would begin to squirm and fuss whenever I pulled Winnie the Pooh Baby up on the screen . -LRB- Nothing against Pooh , either . He loves the whole cast of characters and especially adores Tigger . -RRB- What a shame that Disney scrimped on test-marketing and focus groups with this one . It makes me very leary of purchasing any other Disney software . I complained enough to the computer store where I purchased this , that they ended up letting me trade it in . I got another title by The Learning Company -LRB- Reader Rabbit -RRB- , whose interactive software I highly recommend . Do n't waste your money or your time on this one .
 For my 14 month old duaghter , I purchased this software as well as Reader Rabbit Baby/Toddler and JumpStart Toddler . She lost interest in the Disney software after approximately 5 minutes . It is not as interactive as the others and is not particularly engaging . She 's nuts about the Reader Rabbit software and has learned to use both the keyboard and mouse with the Reader Rabbit games .
 Photo Draw is considerably more useful than Microsoft Image Composer , which it should replace . Ideal solution for building graphics on the web .
 Short and sweet . Do not buy this product or any other Click Art offering.Long story :1 . There are n't 400k images included in the box , you get quite a bit of clip art but for the rest you have to go online , navigate through a confusing interface , and eventually try to download an image that 's way too large of a file size for the resolution .2 . The quality of imagery and the styles are a mid-90 's sort of retro . Absolutely useless .3 . Speaking of useless , you ca n't really use these images for much . Sure , you can send a birthday card to a friend showing you care about them just enough to copy and paste an image you 'll print out ... but the EULA restricts you from using these images online , for business , etc. 4 . Navigating the images is a task which will require some form of sedative . The prone-to-crash interface will slowly show you a handful of pictures in a preview mode that is just small enough to render the image as an unrecognizable bunch of pixels . I 'm serious .
 My kids got this for Christmas . While they enjoy it for very short periods of time , they also get frustrated easily and call for help especially my 6 year old . The comments made by the movie characters are cute the first couple times but after that they are annoying and you ca n't avoid them or stop them . As you progress through the game 's higher levels the game changes so little it 's boring . The longest they play is about 15 minutes maybe once a week and that 's pushing it .
 Being in the computer business , it is very seldom I ca n't something to run . Well this is one program I warn you to stay away from . After spending 2 hours , I went to the Disney website and found out , it has problems with many 3d graphics card . Read this carefully , if you have a Savage card this product does not work , if you have a SIS -LRB- most Compaq 's -RRB- it does not work . I have 5 computers in my home and this worked on one . In addition the one computer that the graphics will work on , the game freezes . If we would have kept the box I would have returned this product for sure . We have purchased most of the Fisher Price games and we also have allot of Disney and this one is not worth the money .
 I bought Tigger 's Honey Hunt for my five-year-old son . I was quite disappointed in the game . The main part of the game , the Honey Hunt , really ca n't be classified as an adventure game -LRB- at least at the level at which we have been able to play it -RRB- . There is no reasoning and no learning going on here . You bounce Tigger around a landscape and catch floating honey pots . I 'll admit , the landscape animation and the way Tigger bounces are pretty cool -LRB- thus the two star rating -RRB- . But it is quite frustrating to get to the end of a round and have Owl tell you that you did not collect enough honey pots , even though you thought you got them all!The Mini Games are simultaneously too hard and too easy . The interface to them requires that you consult the manual , which I think is asking a bit much of a five-year-old . -LRB- Left is the X key , Down is C , Enter is F , etc. !?! -RRB- The games are designed to accommodate multiple players using only a keyboard , but I do n't think most people would use these as multi-player games anyway . Once you figure out which keys to use , the games are too simplistic to be interesting . And even using the correct keys , it sometimes seems that the game does not respond to your keystrokes when it should . And it seems to have no mouse interface!The animation is cool , but overall , a big disappointment .
 If you do n't have a steering wheel attached to your computer you might want to think twice about getting this game . It is way too hard to steer it . I 've played any number of driving games in the past and have never had any trouble steering with the keyboard ... but this game is just poorly set up . The controls are not even remotely intuitive . I was hoping that I could get my 6 year old playing this game before we went to DisneyWorld ... did n't happen.Then there 's the problem with getting the game started . My kid is normally a genius with computer games and does n't need any help at all . But this game takes about 20 different keyboard entries to get started ... and I swear , you never hit the same key twice . And do n't get me started on how difficult it is to exit the game . Seriously , how hard could it be ? Some menus you have to hit the escape to get out of , some you need to hit the back , others you need to hit the letter `` n '' , others you need to wait for some silly animation to play , then hit the down arrow and then enter ... I 'm sure it was easier to program the game than it is to play it.Now , finally , the driving courses ... They 're OK , I guess . I was n't too impressed . It appears to be rendered using some older technology , so there are a lot of visual anomolies and 3-D items that become 2-D or disappear then reappear in a jarring fashion . The courses only vaguely resemble the rides they purport to represent.Overall , the idea is good , but I 'd recommend waiting until the next version comes out . This one simply is n't worth the money or trouble .
 Based upon my experience with the original Complete National Geographic 108 Years DVD set , the new set will be completely amazing and stunning . However nothing like a spurned customer to give an overall bad review.Both National Geographic and Mindscape have been nothing less than negligient in supporting the original DVD set . A few months ago , I tried to install the browser program again . The install program failed due to `` Y2K '' failures.Since I bought the original DVD set in November 1998 for $ 199 , and the version of the software tool used to create the install program was known be defective in late 1998 , the product was defective at time of purchase.As far as I can tell , neither National Geographic nor Mindscape issued a new browser install to work for the year 2000 and beyond . In addition neither National Geographic nor Mindscape has responded to my emails . I can find no evidence of a replacement program for the defective DVD set.Lest anyone doubt what I say , I have been a computer professional for 21 years including 2.5 years full time developing install programs prior to `` Y2K '' . For the technically minded , National Geographic and Mindscape used the software tool InstallShield version 3.00.082.0 to create the browser install program . Among computer install professionals in late 1998 it was well known that InstallShield versions 3.x were riddled with `` Y2K '' defects . Therefore at time of purchase in Novemeber 1998 the product was defective.Since the product was defective , National Geographic and Mindscape should have issued a new browser install program in early 1999 when InstallShield 5.5 became available . InstallShield 5.5 was guaranteed to be `` Y2K '' compliant with no `` Y2K '' defects . That National Geographic and Mindscape never did as far as I can tell speaks volumes of how little value they place on supporting customers .
 When I received this item none of the discs would download the games completely and one game even said the entire game was not completely on the disc . I was extemely upset because I bought it as a xmas gift for my 6 year old and he was disappointed . So am I.
 StuffIt was the premiere archiving utililty for the Macintosh . The Windows version is just an adequate product . It serves it 's purpose well , but . SIT files are rather rare on the Windows platform . If you need interchangeability , look for WinZIP or WinRAR . Both . ZIP and . RAR files are much , much more common in Windows than are . SIT files .
 I purchased this for my 3 3/4 year old daughter after reading other reviews . I have found only a few software programs that are good and this one is not . She has experience with computers but this one she has had trouble with . If I could , I would return it in a minute . I agree with another review , the carrying case is terrible . I have since put it in a jewel case and have hidden it .
 This program has lots of potential however it is lacking in several areas . The first is that there are clitches and if an area is clicked on erroneously then the program freezes . I had to shut down the computer each time and reboot . Also the instructions and some of the games are too complicated for my soon to be 5 year old . Others were really fun for her . The most frustrating however is that I never did figure out what I had to do in Belle 's Writing Room to complete this section in preparation for the Surprise Ball -LRB- and I have a medical degree -RRB- . If anyone knows please email me so we can at least see the dress we picked out and the music and dance we created .
 My wife got this for our daughter ; first , there are places in the game where you -LRB- our daughter -RRB- have very little room for error in clicking ; there is a game in which you click on a tiny triangle to turn a page in a book , or click on the book page to be given a clue . You have 6 clues ; missing that little triangle is EASY for a little one , and even if you 've received a clue for a page you 've already clicked on , it takes away another one of your guesses . POOR PROGRAMMING.A major glitch in sound occurs ; often , when the characters are speaking , there is an echo - a strong one - which is very distracting , and makes the already hard-to-understand and long-winded instructions unbearable . Often it 's critical that you understand what needs to be done ... Last - and this is what prompted me to jump on here and give this program a big thumbs-down - is that printing does n't work for us . We have no problem printing from any other application , or the internet ... this program ca n't do it for us.Stay away . There 's a reason it 's $ 5 , and it 's not because the distributor is in a generous mood .
 First I bought Roxio 's video editor , and it had problems . The projects that I burned would n't play in any DVD player that I owned , so I did some research . I read as many reviews as I could and Sony Vegas seemed to be a very reliable alternative , so I bought it.First I made a small project with some pictures and video from my digital camera . Well it would n't show my video because the codec does n't come standard . I had to buy a third party codec . After that my movie turned out pretty cool . It was easy to use and my family was impressed.Then I wanted to make a video slideshow with some scanned pictures . It was going to be about a half an hour . None of the pictures were very large -LRB- all under 1 MB -RRB- but frequently the program would crash . I looked at the task manager and it was taking close to 1 Gig of RAM ! I tried the render my project but the same thing would happen . This program is useless to me if I ca n't even render my video . There is no free support on this product . Sony wants to charge me for that . I 'm going to have to invest in another product if I want to make that video . Very Frustating !!!
 After having my computer corrupted by a virus , I was forced to purchase DVD burning software because I could not recover that which came with my computer 's DVD burner . To be safe , I purchased the Sony Vegas Platinum model based on outstanding reviews on Amazon . I picked the higher level -LRB- Platinum -RRB- model in the event I wanted later to learn more sophisticated tasks , but my current need is merely to transfer family camcorder videos to DVD without editing . Just tape to DVD , that 's all.After several weeks and numerous e-mails to Sony tech support I still do n't have a single finished product , though I feel I 'm close . I would gladly pay the fee for Sony 's telephone tech support , except for the fact that Sony 's hours for this are - get this - 9 to 5 , M-F . For those of us who work a day job and do n't want to take a vacation day off to sit next to the home computer and speak to Sony tech support , these hours are worthless.I suppose my mesage is this
 This is a very poorly designed product . It provides a large array of options and editing capabilities that are not organized very logically . What 's more , with so many choices , you are very prone to making mistakes that could waste a lot of your time . Perhaps the most annoying aspect is that they do n't have free technical support . If you are stuck on something , it will cost you at leat $ 14.95 to get telephone support . I ended up using Apple iLife . The combination of iMovie and iDVD is a much better package , particularly for editing HD movies .
 The program is not simple and easy . It is not bug free . I 've found two errors which caused hours of frustration . It can not even do a simple photo compilation with more than one music track -LRB- 15 minutes of photos and 4 minutes of music -RRB- . My friend has a competitor 's product . I tried it and I 'm buying that one . Too bad I wasted almost $ 100 .
 This thing is not intuitive and am yet to burn a working dvd . I have tried Sony , Magix , Adobe and Pinnacle . In my opinion , Pinnacle is the easiest to use and most feature rich . Do n't waste your time with this product . Sony should stay away from the Software market .
 I received this last week and I 'm still trying to get it to work . Must addmit I need a lot more exrerience in video editing and downloading music and how to put in text into this program . I guess it 's a good program I do n't know as of yet . This is not for a beginer by far . I will not give up thoe . I plan to ge to the grade school and get one of the kids to come over and show me what to do . But till then I 'm still looking for a program that will let me make slide showes with all that I want to put in it , something more friendly user .
 I bought this to replace my niece 's garbled-sounding copy . But , surprise , surprise , the new one sounded the exact same garbling ! I returned it right away .
 I looked at a number of PDF creation products for my company . Due to the exorbitantly high cost of Acrobat , even through their volume buying program , we decided it was best to go with another company 's tool . There are many adequate PDF creation products on the market today . This product is not one of them . We had a lot of difficulty installing and activating the trial version . We were unable to get any type of support , even through email . To make matters worse , when we finally did get the software activated , it kept freezing and crashing the workstations where it was installed . It seemed to work on about 1/2 of the files we threw at it and crashed on the other half . It seems like a number of people have had this same experience with it . What a disapointment ! 1 star for the rating is generous .
 I agree with the other reviews here . This product is bad . I got a demo version , had difficulty installing it and then it finally crashed my system . When I rebooted , it appeared to be installed , but would n't create or convert PDF files at all . I 'm glad they offered a demo - it prevented me from wasting my money.If you are looking for a PDF creation/conversion program get ScanSoft PDF Converter Pro instead . It 's only $ 100 and it actually works !
 I was leery of this product when I found out it was from a republisher , which is always a bad sign . But for $ 50 bucks I figured the worst that could happen would be I would be out a tank of gas . Boy was I wrong . This software hosed up my entire system . The install kept aborting and then when it finally finished , my other Windows apps worked strangely . I emailed the company repeatedly but never heard back from them about my problems . When I uninstalled it , my computer went back to normal . After this experience , I 'll never buy software again from a republisher .
 What a complete waste of money . If you are using Vista , you are wasting your time . It appears they began distributing this version before programming was completed . It outputs to oblivion , wo n't work with Internet Explorer 7 and simply does n't do anything -LRB- scanning -RRB- when you 'd expect it to . I used a freeware version to create PDFs prior to buying this version I thought would be solid . What a waste of time and money . Shame on Nitro PDF for selling such junk . Still not convinced ? Just log onto their own knowledge base site and type in
 Bottom line
 I am going to return the product to Nitropdf . I might consider it in the future if they can fix flaws in the program that are absolutely necessary and a few features that need to be addressed . I do n't mean to rant so I 'll keep my comments to a minimum.The program will not read any file created by Adobe Acrobat files - a major nuisance . I had to install Acrobat Reader to view my old files.No spell check and none planned - a major headache . Tech support recommended that I `` cut and paste '' the copy into MS Word to check spelling.The program `` crashes '' from time to time.When I insert a stamp on a document , the box around the stamp displays a red line if you click on it . This happens even if I lock the stamp . It does n't look professional.There are several levels of conversion quality but table boxes in Word 2003 were of varying thicknesses in medium quality mode.Conversion to Word 2003 is not good . Every line is in a text box.No index to search the in the manual.To find out it 's for you , I suggest you get the trial version and try it out . Also , check the support forum on their web site for other useful insights on the product .
 I bought this software to convert PDF files into Word documents and I am very unhappy with it 's performance . It just does not work ! It falied at every single PDF file I tried ! When I contacted their `` support '' I was informed that it does not work on `` image '' PDF files . I told them that there was no mention of that or any disclaimer BEFORE I bought the product that it would n't work on all PDF files - they said `` Too bad '' . Horrible product and horrible company .
 I already own Adobe Acrobat Professional but decided to try this software . It is bad . The interface is not clean and it has great difficulties printing PDF documents downloaded from the web . On a 40 page document it would only print 20 pages and hang everytime . I became so discouraged with it today trying to download a users manual for a household product that I removed it from my system and reinstalled Adobe Acrobat and was able to download and print the documenty in question faster and with no problems handling the 40 pages.As far as I am concerned it was not worth the $ 50 I paid for it on a special deal and it will go in the garbage .
 One dollar is too much for the hassle you are going to get from this software . The activation of the software is a real headache , the staff are not helpful . I believe they deliberately force the consumer to purchase their subscription to `` expert tech support '' knowing that the software is not going to function properly . Recommendation Adobe or other company . Please call me Nitro I would like to hear from you someday .
 I agree with the other reviews that this product seems to be a pre 1.0 version . I 'm willing to take the hit in tax and shipping to send it back to them just to get some money back from this useless product . It sure does not convert back to word as they imply . The product activation is a real pain and I could not move it to another system after I installed it on the first , after uninstalling it from the first . I was only able to activate from the first system I loaded it on . I would not like to buy another copy of this product if/when the hard drive fails.I would give 0 stars if I could.I also ca n't believe that they ask you to disable your AV and Internet Security tools to activate this product ! The only positive is that they do have a 30 day money back guarantee .
 I purchased this product based upon the glowing reviews posted here . What a big mistake ! I ca n't believe they are written about the same product . I would give it a zero star rating if I could . It seems to work like it is a beta product . It is highly unstable . It kept causing my system to lock up or crash whenever I tried to create or convert PDF files . There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to why it would fail . Something else that I found out that seems wierd is that the product was a version 1 last year and then jumped to version 4.X recently . There were no versions 2 or 3 . It seems like the manufacturer is doing anything they can to give it the appearance of an established product to trick you into buying it . Be warned , this is definitely a pre version 1.0 product . Do n't waste your money or time on it .
 I have to agree with some of the observations here that the glowing reviews of this product are suspect considering it 's crappy performance . It seemed to create PDFs for me that were OK . However , when I tried to compress them , they became almost unreadable . One more thing - almost none of the editing tools seemed to work at all . Any time I tried to edit objects or text , the program crashed my system . It seems like its a beta version , not an authentic product . Overall I 'd rate this product as a very poor PDF printer driver . I would n't buy it when so many superior free products can be found on the web . Just my 2 cents .
 Nitro PDF Pro registered copy commences license failure warnings after 2 months . Now I want to uninstall it and can not . It attempts to validate install in order to uninstall , so I am now a hostage to this POC software . Overall , I feel ripped off and the pdf functionality is cheap and limited for $ 80 .
 This software is billed as completely compatible with the PDF document format . Unfortunately , it is not . It will suffice for an occasional text document , but not for a complicated layout , or for publishing forms.Radio buttons , check boxes do not render correctly . One can not use OpenType or Type 2 fonts in editing . The program frequently hangs and crashes resulting in unrecoverable documents . There also is inconsistent application of tools in dialog boxes , many hard-to-find functions , and disorganized menus.The plus is that customer service is fast , but their solution is to wait for the next version . I am taking advantage of their 30-day money back guarantee .
 When using Microsoft Visio 2007 and need to create Ledger -LRB- 11 X 17 -RRB- Landscape PDF Nitro Pro 8 will not create document with all information . It keeps cutting off the information as if it is portrait . When you choose landscape it shows the picture of Portrait and Portrait as landscape . This was an issue that was discovered when using Nitro7 and notified them 3 months ago so far to date they keep asking for information or saying a developer is working on it but no solution . They do not seem to be concerned if their product works as good as they claim . With all Adobe issues it never gave us this problem when trying to create a PDF in any size or layout from any of our programs it just worked .
 After reading a review of the Nitro PDF converter I thought I would give it a try . Like many software companies , Nitro offers a free trial . For several reasons -LRB- not the point of this review -RRB- I determined not to make the purchase . But much to my irritation , Nitro 's trial software imbedded their logo into my system so that it shows up in large print at the bottom of every PDF I open . It prints on every PDF too . I 've tried various forms of uninstall including uninstalling and reinstalling Acrobat . It 's still there . To date , Nitro has not reponded to my requests for help . In my opinion , this is dirty and unethical self promotion at the trial user 's expense . I suggest you do n't try Nitro unless you are certain you want to buy it .
 I got an update for ver 6 and when my pc broke I upgraded it ... nitro kept saying `` unable to activate due to it being on another computer '' something like that . . They wo n't respond even after 4 days . This is the worst service I have ever seen in my life . Wow what a dog !
 Not terrible , but not good . Is pretty limited compared to Adobe and Nuance , and worse of all does not open all PDF files . It shows an Adobe logo when it fails and says go get Adobe Reader !
 See my review on version 5 . I own both versions and version 5 is much better than version 4 which I upgraded to version 5 . No more problems with printing with version 5 .
 Whenever I try to convert PDF to DOC it crashes right away!Support ignores you.Very nice UI , but it has to work too before I pay!Sorry guys , nice try , but it has to work better than this.Test it BEFORE you buy .
 Well , for starters , Nitro 's PDF to Word makes you use specific versions of Word -LRB- it uses Word macros to do the conversion . -RRB- They do n't tell you upfront about this important fact . I use WordPerfect occasionally and I 'm out of luck if I want to do conversions , it ca n't be used . Also , since Word is launched as well during the conversion , the process consumes a lot of resources.As Far as the conversion process itself , Nitro PDF does a rather poor job of converting . See the independent review on PDFZone.com , where it says : `` It sounds good , but this is not a feature to buy the program for-it simply does n't work very well . `` http://www.pdfzone.com/article2/0,1895,1850873,00.aspI wish I read review before this before I brought this piece of crap !
 Will someone please tell me how to uninstall Nitro Pro ? I 've been trying for hours . thanks , Ellen
 I am a graduate school student and I needed a PDF converter to mainly capture articles that I read on the Internet . Out of the box , this product will not allow you to convert a page from Internet Explorer or Mozilla to a pdf file . I only found out when I read their troubleshooting steps that have to install an `` add on '' to Mozilla to accomplish this task . Well , this add-on is free to begin with . You do n't need this product for that . Furthermore , if you want to convert an internet page to PDF , it seems like your file is uploaded somewhere on the Internet , converted to PDF and sent to you in PDF format . I ca n't imagine using this product when I `` m trying to view my bank account statements and I want to convert them to PDF.Another thing to watch is their rebate process . To get the second part of their rebate , you will have to send them a copy of a competitor 's CD cover page . Why ? I guess they want your money and they are setting you up for failure . I bought this product at the beginning of January and it 's already end of March and I still do not have a rebate.So , if you want a no fuzz PDF converter and you do not need to edit , combine or split pdf files , just use cute PDF . It 's simple and it 's free !
 The idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good , but in practice ZoneAlarm is too intrusive for most home computer users . It seems to have bugs too , starting with an installation that initially would n't work on one of the computers on my home LAN . ZoneAlarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered . I have n't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall ZoneAlarm yet , but I 'm close !
 Zone Alarm used to be the best consumer firewall product on the market , and I was a loyal customer for 10 years -LRB- went to a LAN party and ZA detected and gave detailed reports on 14K + attempts to probe my system , a normal week being on comcast internet usually yielded 2-3 attempts -RRB- , installing their free firewall on all my systems and buying at least two pro copies for high use professional systems . I think their marketing people took over the company and are trying to compete with Norton because the product featureset and quality has turned 180 degrees , going from the best to absolutely the worst!After being prompted to upgrade from an older ZA version , clicking ` Yes ' , gone were the familiar interfaces and questions whether to allow a new programs to access the computer/internet . Replaced with feel good wizardlike windows , which is not all bad . It set my search preference in all my browsers to some ZA proxy search engine -LRB- routes searches to google through their ZA web page -RRB- and would not let me remove the option in the browser preferences . Like literally would not let me remove the option and select a different home page ... kind of like what a virus would do . . When uninstalling ZA they asked some trick question about keeping browser preferences , which I answered wrong and even after uninstall my browsers routed through their proxy , deleting all search options and uninstalling and reinstalling the browsers , same . . So I did what you do when any other nasty clever virus infects your system , re-partition the HD , do a root level antivirus scan and reinstall the OS -LRB- Win7 -RRB- from scratch . It works well after flattening , and I 'm telling 20 of my friends.You 've been warned ! By a loyal 10 year customer of ZA firewall.It would be interesting to hear if anyone knows the type of internal shakedown at ZA that would have caused this type of 180 degree turn in product quality .
 I 've had Zone Alarm for about 6 months and will not renew . Is it effective in preventing viruses ? Maybe . I avoid as much as I can exposure to potential sources but can say I seem not to have had any inhabit my computer . In this regard it may be doing its job.What I dislike is a feature that drove me away from Norton , the popup message that it was scanning my email , I felt Norton was simply using that opportunity to promote themselves and now Zone Alarm does the same - slowly . It should run in the background but instead takes center stage and prevents me from accessing any other programs until it is done . If I have a large number of messages in my in-box it will scan them each time I open Outlook , even if they have been scanned before.The thing that troubles me most , however , is that I may not do a complete system reboot for 2 or 3 days . When I do , Zone Alarm claims it 's anti-virus is out of date and needs to be updated . Why is n't this happening in the background real time ? Am I 2-3 days out of date and at potential risk for infection because Zone Alram is not routinely checking for updates ?
 One can not separate the antivirus from the firewall . If you would like to continue to use the firewall , but not the antivirus you must delete the whole thing . The antivirus is not that good , it missed a virus that -LRB- free -RRB- Trend remote scanner caught .
 I have used this program for a couple of years and it is really annoying . First , I hate its updates , its locking my machine when it decides to do an update , stops Acrobat from running , stops the whole the machine if I step away and here is the worst . . it checks itself and stops its own scanning program from launching . Norton finally looking good again !
 I bought this product based on Consumer Reports review . I 've had Norton and McAfee in the past which slowed down my system . My computer is slower to start up with ZoneAlarm , but faster than McAfee while on . However , most of the time , I need to shut off ZoneAlarm in order to access the internet - just like another reviewer . Defeats the purpose do n't you think ? It also recognized my offices 's software as a virus and although I allowed access , it keeps showing it as a virus . I 'm going to have to go to another product .
 I installed this 2 days ago . It installed easily enough ... within less than 5 minutes I was doing my first virus scan . It only found one infection , which I do n't think is accurate -LRB- I think it missed some stuff -RRB- . Every time ... * every * time you connect to the internet or go to a site it will come up with a popup asking you to allow or deny access . Gets very annoying after a while . The last straw came today , when I could sign on to the internet but not access any sites . I ran my Spyware Doctor and my Adaware , they both came up clean . On a whim I uninstalled the ZoneAlarm , and voila my internet starts zooming along smoothly again . This was a total waste of money for me , I only wish I had kept the receipt so I could return it .
 I can not get Toast 7 to compress aTS file with out it crashing under Tiger . If it worked it would be great . Very disappointed .
 I bought TWO copies of Toast 7 to update Toast 5 because it advertised `` Data Spanning - Backup AnythingSpan files , folders and even applications across multiple CDs and DVDs . Now you can safely backup files of any size and easily retrieve them with the included Restore tool . `` It DOES N'T ! Do n't be fooled . If you want to copy a large set of files onto multiple discs you still need to do it by hand unless you want them to be Mac 10.3 or better ONLY , no OS 9 , NO Windows , No ISO 9660 . Very Nasty advertising from my point of view .
 I 've read all of the glowing reviews of Toast Titanium 7 - `` makes music DVDs , multi-DVD spanning backups , cures cancer , raises the dead , etc. '' And having used previous versions of Toast , I thought I 'd spring for the upgrade . Big mistake.Although I 've been using computers for 20 years now -LRB- mostly Macs -RRB- , I 've had nothing but problems with this new version of Toast . I have n't had a single successful burn yet , on any kind of media , recording any kind of format . I thought updating to the latest version might be helpful , but Roxio wo n't let you download it unless you 're a registered user on their website.Understandable - but I AM a registered user , and their system would n't recognize me . So I tried to open a new account , and it would n't let me . Okay , I clicked their `` forgot my password '' button , and they say they 'll send me a link via email . I 've played that little game for about 3 days now , and never a message/link from Roxio.Trying to solve my tech problems online has n't helped ; Toast keeps giving me error codes which are n't defined anywhere on Roxio 's help pages.Maybe , some bright and glorious day , I 'll actually get the program to work and it will merit more than 1 star . But my old version -LRB- 5.2.3 -RRB- worked fine , and I dropped a lot of money for a few glittery features ... and instead lost all the previous functionality and raised my blood pressure in the bargain . Shame on you , Roxio!UPDATE
 This is a great product , but Sonic Solutions -LRB- Roxio -RRB- bought this product a few years ago from Adaptec and does not seem to care anything about customer service . Good luck getting your rebate money , I have read many reports of this theft . It does not matter how many versions you have purchased over the years , they do not care about you . I was even locked off their forum when I complained . There is no email , it 's automatic and you get a no reply address , the phone contact is on your dime to Canada , and about as useful as ants at a picnic.I come away feeling this company does n't care about Mac products and Mac customers , why do n't they sell to someone who does ? It 's a shame a good product must be so badly represented . Sonic , you guys are horrible !
 Hi people , I know `` high tech '' related companies frequently have the worst customer service/relations but Roxio , as far as I am concerned , really takes the prize for their exasperating `` Customer No Service '' . I am beginning to wonder if it is n't Roxio corporate policy to be intentionally exasperating and screwed up so you wo n't -LSB- ca n't -RSB- bother them . Twice this last year have I been stiffed by this sorry company.The first time was when I went to register their Easy CD Creator -LRB- Windows -RRB- . Their website would not accept the serial number they gave me so I could n't register therefore I could n't download any Roxio software updates or even log in to there tech support forums or contact them in any way except telephone . The bad thing was later I when I tried to download virus software from another company , that installer said it detected a version of `` Easy CD Creator ' that would cause problems with the the virus software and I should go and download the fix for Easy CD Creator before the virus software installer would run . So I could n't use that virus software because I could n't download the Easy CD update because Roxio did n't like the serial number that they themselves put on their product.The second episode was in December when I bought Toast 7 for Mac and mailed in the $ 20 rebate forms and stuff . Today I received a postcard from them saying my UPC barcode did n't qualify . What the h % # & !? When I tried to contact them , I had to register but their new user registration page was totally blank . Finally I tried to register with them as a user on a different part of the website but that one told me I was already registered -LRB- somehow -RRB- . When I I clicked on `` forgot my password '' It asks me what email address I used to register . How am I suppose to know ... because I never registered ! Then to get any kind of help whatsoever , guess what ... you need to log in . But I ca n't because I 'm not registered ! So I try to register under a different name and an alternate email address . It somehow also thinks I 'm already registered and asks me to just log in . But when I try to log in with my new name it says I 'm not registered . What the f# ## ! This whole rigamarole seems to be specifically designed to drive people crazy ! Roxio 's specialty seems to be catch 22 's and do-loops . Customers can not even send Roxio an email so all I can do is write a review here at Amazon . Sorry ... Roxio is not the kind of company I want to have anything to do with . I do n't care how `` good '' their software is or is not .
 Okay . I have also had all of the Titanium 7 problems reported by others ; namely , I keep getting messages that I am not registered , and when I try to register , I ca n't because they -LRB- Roxio -RRB- do n't recognize my password . Open a new account ? Not so fast , tech-boy ! You 'll be stymied at every turn by this unfriendly software . BUT-the very worst thing of all which I did n't see mentioned in any of the Amazon product reviews or noted in the product specifications is that Roxio/Toast no longer supports iTunes . This means that if you wish to burn music purchased through iTunes downloads , you will get an error message and wo n't be able to make the CD . This alone is worth boycotting this product . Do n't say I did n't warn you . Save yourself the money and look elsewhere ... or just burn from the Mac software in iTunes .
 I 've been using Toast for a number of years and was anxious for the upgrade . What a disappointment ! While the DVDs always work on my computer , the disks work only on select stand-alone DVD players and then only sometimes . Tried to work with support and was told if I wanted the software to work everytime , I should purchase a professional film product.The only other product I was more frustrated with was Popcorn and Roxio has refused to provide a refund .
 Anyone who pays for this program has paid too much . Open Office is totally free software , available for download at it 's official site , openoffice.org . There , you can download it as many times as you want , get support from their forums , and not pay a dime.I use Lotus Symphony , which is also free , and which I have had better luck with . It 's based on Open Office , but I have not had the problems with it that I had with Open Office .
 I was hoping this program would give my kids some extra learning for their homeschooling , but was a complete waste of time and money . The program is not divided into grade levels and the scores can not be used for other children . Most of the material covered is stuff my kids already knew and they were very bored with what there was . There is basically no math , just one example of each problem , that 's it . Do n't waste your money or time on any of these products .
 Buyer Beware ! If you have a Windows 2000 operating system on your PC , or the latest operating system for Macintosh , this little gem will not work on your machine.When asked about this problem , the manufacturer of said , `` it 's not designed to work on the current operating systems . `` I asked them if they intended to upgrade the software and they said , `` I do n't think so , but then again , technicians are always the last ones to know . `` Wrong , it is we , the consumers , who are the last ones to know . We find out AFTER we have bought the product and try to use it.Writing Tutor may once have been a good idea and a good piece of software , but if it was as good as they say it was its manufacturers should continue to support it.As it stands today , the software is pretty much useless .
 Not even worth the -LSB- money -RSB- ! The typing section of the program may be better . The writing tutor - the level of analysis is very low . It does n't catch a number of common errors .
 This programme is really awful . It states that it is suitable for `` any '' type of writers , but it is really only suitable for elementary school aged children , and even that group would not find this programme very enticing -- I know , because I teach elementary school . I am angry because of their advertising rhetoric , and like the previous reviewer stated , although it worked , it is way behind the times in technologically . Like my kids would say , `` This programme -LSB- is bad -RSB- ! ''
 This program has several cute features -LRB- though nowhere near the 50 they claim -RRB- but each works out rather like a `` demo mode '' of shareware . There are a few limited examples in each module , not a full list of features . It takes a lot of work to try to make the program at all useful , and to be blunt , it takes most of the creativity out of writing , rather than sparking your creativity . Most of the exercises reminded me either of a second grade `` storyboard '' activity or a sixth grade story prompt . None of the exercises are helpful in developing a real idea that you already have into an actual story or article.I will say this , though
 I bought this program three years and loved it then . I would stick with it , cause I liked the way it worked , back when it did . However every Windows update breaks something else . It 's become flaky in too many ways to list ; it changes instrument voices from one playback to the next , has stopped copying and pasting , ca n't copy it 's own saved songs correctly . Reinstalling , even with fresh downloads , does n't fix anything . As the computer is fine with all other apps I do n't think it 's the problem . I ca n't say Notation wo n't work fine for you , but you can do at least as well with other low-priced software .
 I have used and tested hundreds of software apps for over 20 years and it never ceases to amaze me how brain dead most of them can be . First , the version that was shipped to me from Amazon in January 2003 was Ver .6.0.2 . Very unstable . Frozen screens . Via email , their tech suggested that I update , on line , to Ver .6.2 . No more frozen screens.I had hoped that the new version would allow the main screen to be maximized . No such luck . Tech support says you can not max the main screen . `` It is a limitation of the software . '' No , it is the limitation of the programming effort . The report screens can be maximized , but not the main screen . Go figure.Here is the most salient disappointment in this `` software . '' You MUST pay for annual updates , as you would a tax program . In fact , when activating the software , you must choose a single tax year . Their excuse is that fair market values change every year and of course they would not want you to use old data . Right.My beef is that the company -LRB- and thus Amazon -RRB- does not inform the purchaser prior to purchasing that their software is only good for one year . This is simply sleazy.The values they determine for donated goods are much higher than the actual thrift store values . Which is okay for my deductions , if , in fact , they are accurate.Finding items to be donated is a bit kludgy . They use drop down categories that are not all that logical , e.g. I had trouble finding hats . They decided to call them caps . Silly me . They are very , very weak on electronics , computer items , etc. . But strong on designer kitchenware . Go figure .
 I bought this product , and the mandatory internet update failed . I attempted to contact their Tech Support and one month later they opened the mail !! -RRB- , but offered no support at all beyond the stock answer listed in their FAQ 's -LRB- which I had already tried , and told them so -RRB- . It also appears to have nasty anti-copy measures built in , so a reinstall wo n't work and the program wo n't even load now . Consider your options before buying this !
 Nowhere in the advertising , the packaging , or even the ubiquitous EULA does it state that this product is only good for a single tax year 's use . Not until it is installed and the user is asked if it will be used for tax-year 2002 or 2003 does the user get any inkling that this is a one-year license , just like Turbo Tax . So be aware , if you think you 're going to be able to use this year after year to track your donations , it wo n't let you ! Not without purchasing the annual updates , anyway . Getting this software not so much a `` purchase '' as it is a `` subscription '' that needs to be renewed every year .
 should be their marketing call . After I spent $ 19.99 for this , I went to writeoff a computer I donated to a school . A message popped up , `` You must pay $ 10 to get the `` Computer and Electronics '' part of this program . `` I have seen better ethics from porn spammers.As a 6 year customer of TurboTax , this is my last year using Intuit products . Last year 's militant software protection was the first straw , this is the last .
 Beware . Only until after I had purchased this product did I find out it was restricted to one use , one year only . You can not use it for other members of your family household . Smacks of the earlier attempt by TurboTax to limit use of that product to a single computer , the one on which it was registered . I am tired of such antic $ . I have switched to TAXCUT and also returned this one.Customer service said `` we are not in Calcutta '' but I did not pursue that point.Ken
 Garmin is great , but Amazon when I called to talk to them about getting the additional software for my Garmin I purchased at Christmas , they sold/sent me the DVD version which is not the correct item . You need the SD card version so it fits into the Garmin . I called Garmin and they walked me through on how to use the DVD . I had to go and buy a 2G card and then download the DVD and then transfer it to the card . . and of course it did n't all fit on the card so I had to delete some countries . . it was a mess . . I could n't return the DVD since I had already opened it . The product of the maps are great but Amazon should have known that the DVD version was obsolete and not sell it .
 Save your money get a Tom Tom or Magellan . You need your laptop in the car .
 This was for Palm OS and the OS is compatible with both WIN and Mac . I am sure it is a good program , but there is no way to chose which parent platform to download for . I did not find out there were two different downloads until after I paid the money and try to install it and asking customer support . SO BE CAREFUL IF YOU OWN A MAC , THEY WILL ASSUME YOU OWN A WINDOWS MACHINE AND HAVE YOU DOWNLOAD ITS SOFTWARE !!
 How can the Handmark -LRB- formerly Palmspring -RRB- company sell this as full retail product specifically labelled on the outside as NOT shareware , and nothing printed inside says otherwise , but after installation it says it is a limited use DEMO which you have to pay more to unlock ? If this is not bait and switch , then is it not fraud ? Why is n't there any review online warning other new victims/buyers ? I must not be the only one who has experienced this , as Handmark NOW has an `` instructions '' web page -LRB- after the fact again -RRB- that says its newest `` Gulliver '' version ships Demo !
 The product works well as a stand alone application , but does not work with MS Money . It is completely useless for those looking to something that will transfer back and forth .
 This product has a great format on the Palm , however as one who is not a wiz on the computor I gave up after spending about 6 hours trying to get it to interface with my Quicken . Might be a great product for those who are very computor literate but if your of the load and use nature , stay away . Also when I went to the Pocket Money support group I got a whole lot of instructions that may or may not have been in English for all the good they did .
 I upgraded from 5 to 5.5 primarily to get OSX compatibility . I have been very dissapointed in the slow perforance of it in OSX compared to the performance in OS9 on the same machine . I am very happy with it in OS9 but I want to switch to OSX

 I am usually a fan of DK material , and was quite happy to see this product . It looked both interesting and useful for my children . However , having opened the box , and unwrapped the CDs , what do I find ? -LRB- 1 -RRB- Encyclopedia of Science 2.0 -LRB- already got it -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- Encyclopedia of Nature 2.0 -LRB- already got it -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- The Way Things Work 2.0 -LRB- already got it -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- The Ultimate Human Body 2.1 -LRB- already got it -RRB- -LRB- 5 -RRB- Encyclopedia of Space and the Universe -LRB- wow , at least there is one that I had n't already got ! -RRB- -LRB- 6 -RRB- Earth Quest -LRB- ok , so there are two I had n't already got -RRB- . And where was the indication of this on the package ? No where.So now I 'm stuck with a bunch of duplicates to try to return ! -LRB- Hmm , maybe I can sell my old copies of the ones I 've already got instead ? -RRB- Come on DK . You can do better than that ! I understand the repackaging gig , but at least let people know that is what it is ! -LRB- BTW
 Several years ago I bought Typing Tutor 7 for my daughter . She used it on our Mac and learned how to type , but she had to endure the numerous crashes it caused . Later we bought a PC , and foolishly ordered Typing Tutor 10 thinking that surely a program as faulty as the previous Typing Tutor could n't stay on the market . We were wrong . We installed the program and my son signed in and tried to get started . The comuter crashed twice in the first 15 minutes and we uninstalled the program and vowed never to buy another Typing Tutor program again !
 I specifically bought this item to work on my dvorak keyboard unfortunettally it turns out that it has no support for it . Oh well it was only $ 4.00 very cheap
 If I could give this ZERO stars , I would.I installed Norton Symantec System Works 2001 in two PCs with two different operating systems
 This product is poorly documented and technical support is nonexistent . It generates cryptic error codes and provides no support for resolving them . Do n't waste your time or money on it .
 The good is that there are lots of games . The bad is that your opponents and partners , -LRB- worse -RRB- seem to be morons . The bidding in the bridge section is terrible . I was stuck with this game for many weeks and so got to know it . It is hard to figure out why your partner made a particular bid afterwards . There is also a flaw -LRB- for my IMAC at least -RRB- in the pinochle game that freezes up the game after the second time the game is played . I sent an email to the company complaining , no response ever . Frustrating programs .
 Britannica CD 2002 -LRB- Deluxe & Standard Edition -RRB- is a real disappointment for the advanced user of Britannica CD 98 . Let 's see why :1 -RRB- Find tool has its own window . Therefore you have to make more clicks to choose an article and read it than in the case of Britannica CD 98 . Thousands of additional clicks mean A LOT OF EXTRA TIME ! 2 -RRB- It is said that Britannica CD 2002 has more than 80.000 articles . It seems a lot more than 72.000 articles comprised in Britannica CD 98 . But the truth is that most of the so called new articles are actually parts of formerly more comprehensive articles!Example
 If you are a serious user of reference books and you intend to buy multimedia encyclopedia because of its text content and not multimedia features such as videos and animations , you might be interested in this brief comparison between Encyclopaedia Britannica and Microsoft Encarta -LRB- in both cases I 've been trying 2002 Standard Edition -RRB- . One big Britannica 's plusArticlesArticles in Britannica are usually longer and more precise than articles in Encarta , not to mention the overall number of articles -LRB- Britannica beats Encarta , especially its Standard Edition -RRB- . And finally
 I was disappointed with the package . They did n't really make an effort to incorporate multimedia like you would expect . I prefer the Encarta deluxe . Encarta deluxe gives me better search results and has the multimedia components one would expect from a computer encyclopedia - and Encarta is slightly more user friendly . In defense of Britannica they have better writers than Encarta in terms of writing style , but the information content is about the same .
 Encyclopedia Britannica have failed to take advantage of multimedia . There are only a handful of video references , many of low quality . Monochrome images are all dark for some reason.The poorly designed interface has some bugs which should have been worked out . I bought the DVD version and one reason was for the world atlas , which is the most disappointing aspect of the package . I have seen better freeware atlases . Detail is extremely poor . Encarta atlas beats this easily . I wish I could say something nice about the application , but I honestly can not !
 Anyone who used the great printed Encyclopedia Britannica of the 1940s to 70s will find this electronic issue a great disappointment . The comprehensive essays and in-depth discussions just are not there . In many cases I found a three-year old one-disk Encarta and a printed twenty-year old World Book more interesting and useful .
 My review gives britannica zero stars , in protest , because the item can not be shipped abroad -LRB- Israel in my case -RRB- . Should I get paranoid ?

 The `` convenient '' install went OK . After it was installed , I immediately registered the product on-line and downloaded the latest update -LRB- both content and an apparent bug-patch -RRB- . Nevertheless , this piece of software seems to have a memory leak , and typically uses 320 Megabytes of system memory EVEN AFTER I QUIT THE APPLICATION . This requires me to re-boot my computer to regain usage of HALF OF MY SYSTEM MEMORY . This is inconvenient , and utterly ridiculous for modern software.Unless you enjoy re-booting your computer everytime you use the Britannica , I advise you to NOT buy this software . This saddens me , because I like the textual content . The multi-media element , however , leaves much to be desired.System details : - Macintosh 867 G4 - 640 MB RAM - OS X 10.1.4
 Within an hour of installing the DVD , the registration process had n't worked , the online service would n't let me in because I had n't provided information for which there was no blank , and the online updating had frozen my computer twice -LRB- and never worked -RRB- . On the disk info itself I 'd found three typos and a broken link , and had been crashed once while following an ordinary link . The single QuickTime movie I looked at was visually dark and had oddly pointless clips with minimal information . The dictionary gives no pronunciations and the atlas , as far as I can tell , is surprisingly limited . The logic of the encyclopedia 's organisation is far from transparent though I suppose that might improve with use . Graphic design is ugly , very unlike the print Britannicas I remember from school , and page layout -LRB- again as far as I can see from brief acquaintance -RRB- inflexible -LRB- e.g. the window for marginalia ca n't be collapsed to get more of the actual article onscreen -RRB- . I 'm near returning it for falling so far short of what it could be , but there IS a lot of information here -- in a package which really should have been designed -LRB- and copy-edited ! -RRB- to higher standards .
 Britannica is the best encyclopedia in print . Why , oh why , ca n't they get the software right ? Examples
 If you want this product for your IMAC , be careful . There are appparently no longer DVD-ROM drives available for IMACs that do n't already have them .
 I 've been anxiously awaiting this product for over two months now , and each time the release date hits , we 're then told to wait longer . I 'm sure it 's because Macmillan is either updating its information , still working out bugs -LRB- the PC version was apparently pretty buggy -RRB- or Carbonizing for use with OSX . Whatever the case , the company 's Web site is hush-hush , and those of us still waiting are starting to get a bit too restless . Let 's see how long that sales rank in the upper 500s lasts before we all get fed up .
 I struggled with the decision of whether to buy Microsoft Encarta 's Reference Library DVD 2002 or Encyclopedia Britannica 's 2002 DVD . Unfortunately , I chose the latter.Britannica claims to give you three installation options
 Although Encyclopaedia Britannica ads says `` Get the Entire Encyclopaedia Britannica right on your PC '' and `` it contains the complete text '' etc. . , this is not true . It was with great frustration that I realized that these were fallacious words . For instance , if you type `` Emiliano Zapata '' on Britannica 's Website , you will read a brief description of Zapata 's life along with his PHOTO and the `` Encyclopdia Britannica Article '' advice . But if you type `` Emiliano Zapata '' onto the DVD version you will only see the text with no photos . But did n't the advertise said that with the DVD you `` GET the ENTIRE Encyclopedia ? '' -LRB- sic -RRB- . Am I stupid ? This article showed me that the DVD is not as complete as I was made to think . Probably other articles are missing ... As a result , I lost confidence on this encyclopedia and I am considering only use it as a last resource on my studies -LRB- I currently own the Encarta Cd-Rom , Grolier Encyclopedia Cd-Rom , Compton 's DVD rom and Hutchinson CD-Rom -RRB- and I might say that the Encarta interface -LRB- at least the 96 edition -RRB- is , by far , much more user friendly than Britannica 's or everyone 's else . The britannica 's interface is confusing , separating the text from the multimidia files and showing the same article as more than one result on the same search . I was disapointed in buying this DVD .
 One of the joys I got out of using the 1970s hardcopies as a youngster was to stumbling across tonnes of other topics of interest as I narrowed in on what I was after . Now with the search engine , there is no alphabetical index that alows me to do this . I search for a topic , it gives me that only . If I only know the first few letters of a word I 'm looking for , the search engine wo n't help me . Please put in that index and it will raise the product 's edutainment value by 100 %
 This piece of software is very buggy and holds less information than advertised . The scroll boxes did n't refresh correctly so that I was unable to read the information in the box without closing and reopening the box.When searching for information on Red Foxes I was unable to find more than a generic article on foxes in general . If you ca n't find specific information on the most prevalent subspecies then what good is it ?
 I have owned a hard copy edition of Britannica for over 25 years and it 's a masterpiece . I have owned software versions for 6 years , and this year 's is without a doubt the worst product of all , and clearly inferior to the contemporaneous Encarta 2002 , Worldbook 2002 , and even Grolier 's 2002 . Advertising of content has been confusing and deceitful . Navigation is very poor .
 I purchased this product last yr . from Best Buy . I tossed the case which had the serial number on it and put the c.d. 's in my carrying case . Now that I have a new computer , I can not download the disc 's to my new laptop or computer . I payed too much money to not be able to utilize the product .
 I agree with `` Ocean Girl '' . My problem and maybe her problem is that Furniture Maker is not compatible with TurboCAD Delux , but requires the Professional Verison . This is according to TurboCAD techincal support . Unfortunatley this is not stated in the description that AmazonFurniture Maker Plug In V4 Turbocad Furniture Maker Plug In V4has nor is it included in the description on the TurboCAD home site . I also found it a waste of time to try to contact TurboCAD technical support by phone , they but you in an endless loop . However , they were responsive to my email support request .
 This product does not come with any instructions . If you are having a hard time loading it , you can not get any help from the company . They have a phone number you can call but they are only there from 9-5 during the week . Then after waiting on the line for over 15 minutes for someone to answer your question , the tech group are no help . I had to send the merchandise back because the company had no idea what was wrong .
 Was the BIGGEST waste of money was told the GPS Gold -LRB- 219.99 -RRB- had topo built-in . It came with a topo screen cover.BULLSH-T had to buy MORE programs.have spent over three hundred bucks and DAMN did I get RIPPED OFF ! MAGELLAN your COMPANY SUCKS!IF you hav n't bought one yet , check into another brand .
 I purchased this software from ANT-Online on 09/08/2006 . THIS IS NOT THE CURRENT VERSION OF MAPSEND !!! This is version 2 of the software . Magellan customer service has confirmed that version 3 is the current version . Do not be fooled by the product ID ending in a '' -03 ' it is version 2 and you can not tell until you open the box and take the shrink-wrap off of the CD case . Of course once you open the box , you can not return it to replace it with ver 3 . Sure the price is good compared to other places but you are buying old software and there is nothin on Amazon to indicate that it is old .
 I had an older Magellan Platinum GPS for a few years , and decided to buy a newer color model , the Explorist 600 . I ordered the Magellan MapSend Direct Route software from Amazon . They advertise the version 3 product number , but I got the version 2 software -LRB- not a good start -RRB- . I installed the software on my Dell 8400 , running XP professional . The software will only run if I keep one of the CD 's on a drive . -LRB- Next bad sign -RRB- I created some regional maps and attempted to download them to the Explorist SD card . -LRB- You have to use a secondary `` conversion '' software to do this -RRB- I tried several times to download to the SD card both in the Explorist and in the card reader on my printer . In every case , it would error out and tell me it could not find the Explorist or the card reader . I unistalled and reinstalled the software , rebooted my computer and tried again . It still does n't work . Then I find that several of the devices hooked up to my computer by USB do n't work . I have n't been able to use my printer since this happened , or my Palm docking station.I went to the Thales website and left a detailed e-mail message on their `` support '' site . That was a week ago , and they still have n't responded . Finally , yesterday , I called their support number , and spoke with a gentleman whose second language is English . I lost count of the number of times I asked him to repeat himself to be able to understand him . After an hour of working with him on the phone , my computer was more screwed up , and we had not resolved any of the problems . I gave up on him.Now I have this $ 400 electronic rock -LRB- Explorist 600 -RRB- that is worthless without the software , and a crippled PC . I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before I bought the Magellan products . Hopefully , I can get my money back for the Explorist , and buy a brand that works.Oh , and I am going to have to pay for a service call to get my computer functioning properly again .
 Magellan DirectRoute software as a two CD set . The software will NOT RUN unless CD # 2 is in the drive you installed it from.If you intend to run this software on a notebook by installing from a dockable or networked CD drive -LRB- as I did -RRB- -- IT WILL NOT WORK!I asked Magellan support for a work-around , but their response was that there was none . And , oh , by the way , the CD is copy protected so you ca n't even make a backup copy to take on the road with you . Magellan seems more concerned about people making illegal copies of their software than they are about making it useable.Unfortunately , this software is the only way to get the detailed maps for a Magellan GPS . Although even that procedure , if you own an Explorist , requires running a secondary `` conversion '' program -- adding a LOT of time to the download process.From what I 've seen so far , the maps are very much out-of-date as well . The list of roads and `` points of interest '' in my area are missing anything constructed in the last five years , and still show places that have been gone for over ten years.My recommendation -- buy it if you already have a Magellan GPS for the detailed maps -- but know that 's all you 're getting and they will be old . Then , if you want to do serious trip planning , get MapPoint !
 I bought the Explorist which I am generally happy with , but this software is lousy and there is no product support for it on the website . The version I have 2.0 has not been updated to work well with the Explorist , and the 64MB limitation is a pain when you have a 512MB SD card . In general , the routing works but the interface is nowhere near as good as Streets and Trips .
 I truely wish I had found the prior reviews for this product before I bought it . Unfortunately , I am now stuck with a product that will not start and will not run on my pc , running WinXP2 !! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !! Support sucks all around and there appears to be no fix now or in the near future to get software working ... I lost $ 100 bucks on this one !!!
 Where do I start ? In the past Magellan used to be a pretty decent company . Now it looks like they 're trying to do a `` producers '' number and being the worst so they 'll be happy to go out of business .1 -RRB- I waited for years for an update . They had them but they never advertised them EVEN on their own website .2 -RRB- Then after I called to ask why there was n't any update , they said they were on version 3 ! I bought it and they charged my bank account TWICE ! 3 -RRB- I then waited for at least 3 weeks to get it .4 -RRB- I installed it and now in street routing , major highways on directions are just listed as blank spaces .5 -RRB- I -LRB- tried -RRB- to call support and hung up after 2.5 hrs . on hold!Do NOT buy this product !!! I 'm sure Garmin is a lot better and actually may WANT to succeed in business !
 This software does NOT support the Explorist series from Magellan . For that you need Magellan DirectRoute v3 .0 , which is part number 980654-04 . Amazon does n't currently carry that version . If you have an Explorist , do not buy this , go elsewhere and get the correct version.If you have an older Magellan GPS , this should work just fine .
 The only humor I have found in my experience with this software is that it requires Disk 2 of the set be in the PC before it will run . It is to me hilarious that Magellan actually believes that someone could find this program worth stealing.I should have know what I was in for when the program did n't have my address . I live in an historic section in the middle of a city of over one million population ; my house and address are almost 100 years old.I bought this software because it was the only mapping software that could be used with the Meridian GPS I received as a gift . I should have known what I was in for with the Meridian Gold GPS when I saw the PC connecting cable was the old RS232 Serial type , not USB . Meridian 's answer was to tell me to buy a Serial to USB adapter cable.Instead of using the cable connection you can load regions from the MapSend data onto an SD card which fits in the GPS . However , you can not load routes and Waypoints onto the card . Those HAVE to go through the direct GPS to computer cable . And I suspect that the waypoints and routes you upload to to the GPS are only useable on the internal map , not the one you have on the card . The documentation and help are very vague on that as they are on just about every other aspect of the software 's operation.All I wanted to do with the software was map out a road route on the PC -LRB- start , ending , and points along the way -RRB- and upload it to the GPS . Well , this software wo n't do that . You get to pick the start and end points , and the program chooses the route , period , You may know there is a bridge out on the route the program sets but there is n't anything you can do about it . And even if you could it would be a moot point because routes ca n't be conveniently moved to the GPS anyway.The interface does not follow any of the usual conventions -LRB- windows , browser , mapquest , etc. -RRB- The tech support was not responsive . The documentation seems deliberately vague and confusing . In short I can really find nothing to recommend this product . If I could have given it a lower score , I would have.My computer software experience goes back 25 years to programming dBaseII on a two-floppy drive Osborne with CPM operating system . In all that time I have never before written a review , positive or negative , on anything , not that I remember anyway . But in this case I felt like I had a duty to warn others .
 I 've owned the new V. 3 product for over a week and have still not been able to unlock it for use . Customer service is worse than I 've ever experienced . They wo n't commit to calling me back and have suggested that someone will be working on the problem and I should continue to keep trying the unlock process until it works .
 I had version 1 and it worked great with Windows 98 but not with Windows XP . Version 1 has a patch you can download from the Magellan web site that will correct the problem according to Magellan . However , it did not solve the problem . I bought version 2 because the web site said version 2 & 3 did not require a patch . You guessed it , version 2 also would not operate with Windows XP . I called Magellan support and after holding for 30 minutes a recording comes on telling me the proper personel to answer my questions was not available . I have yet to determine how they knew my questions . I would not recommend anyone purchasing Magellan software and expect it to function with Windows XP and do n't expect help from the Magellan support personal . I have spent several hundred dollars on version 1 & 2 and neither works . Sure wish I kept my old computer with Windows 98 . If I had it to do over I would have purchased the Garmin GPS instead of the Magellan . I understand the Garmin software and support are great . I would have rated the software 0 but 1 was as low as it went .
 This is the worst software I have ever purchased . Hard to use ! hard to install ! Ruins what is otherwise a good product - the Explorist 500 . If you 're trying to choose between Magellan and Garmin go with Garmin .
 THE PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH BUYING , IF YOU HAVE A DVD OR CDR DRIVEWITH WIN XP IT WILL NOT WORK MOST OF THE TIME OR AT ALL YOU MUST PUT THE CD IN TO DO ANTHING WITH THE PROGRAM . GARMIN PROGRAM SEEMS TO WORK WITH EASE , CHECK IT OUT BEFORE YOU BUY A MAGELLAN . GARMIN IS MUCH EASIER TO WORK WITH . MAGELLAN TECH , SERICE IS VERY POOR THEY DO N'T SEEM TO TRY TO FIX THEIR PROBLEMS THEY HAVE WITH THEIR SOFTWARE , THEY JUST TRY TO SHIFT THE BLAME TO YOU , EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THE PROBLEM IS THEIRS .
 Just bought Mapsend from Amazon . They sent me version 2 when this is clearly out of date . Do n't be fooled - it 's a piece of crap . This is devious and dishonest of Amazon - no wonder it was marked down . Avoid Magellan at all costs ... avoid Mapsend at all costs ... maybe even avoid Amazon if this is typical of the stunts they pull .
 Very slow and hard to use . What a waste of my money . Should have purchase a different product .
 Installation of the product was difficult . It installed on one laptop without the uninstall module . As a result , it will be there forever - ca n't be removed - ca n't be repaired - without a SUBSTANTIAL investment of time.Use of the software is not intuitive . Documentation is sparse and confusing - even contradictory . Programming in hexadecimal is easier.Security is cumbersome , intrusive and useless -LRB- why would anyone steal anything with no value ? -RRB- Loading regional maps is way beyond difficult , and none of the constraints appear in the documentation.I called customer support twice - about this product and about a failed attempt to update firmware on my Magellan Meridian Color GPS . Both times the representative on the other end of the phone exhibited the winning combination of rudeness and stupidity -LRB- Why are our jobs going to India ? -RRB- If you have extra cash , you will put it to better use if you substitute it for kindling.If my products are any indication , I expect Magellan to market their new mimeograph machine in the near future .
 I bought this product from a local store in NJ . It was on sale for a great price , so I decided to buy it , but I wanted to check for newer or different versions , so I went to the Magellan website . It had NO information on different versions . I loaded the program on my computer and transferred the maps to my GPS , but no joy . I tried several different ways -LRB- i.e. the user manual on the website , changing the file type -RRB- but nothing worked . I finally called tech support . Right away I asked if there was a newer version of Direct Route NA , but the technician avoided the question and walked me through the steps I had tried over and over again before i called in the first place . I went through the steps with him twice before he told me there was a newer version , and he insisted i go through the steps again , even though i knew it was pointless . I finally asked for a customer complaint line . I called and they said they would replace the software for free , but i do n't know if i 'll ever see it -LRB- based from my experience so far -RRB- . I have the Explorist XL , and it works great , but believe people when they say the customer service is not very good.BTW , I bought version 1.00 . The newest version is 3.00 .
 I purchased this software for use with my Meridian Gold GPS and Thinkpad . It would sometimes not recognize the data CD in my DVD/CDR drive . I found that rebooting the computer would fix the problem most of the time . I kept using the software because it is very good and very easy to use . However , a couple of days ago , the software refused to run at all - not even the splash screen . Magellan support was no help . Told me the problem might be a firewall or a resource conflict . Tried various things for several hours , but no luck . Will probably chuck the software and buy a Garmin .
 DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE AND DO NOT EXPECT HELP FROM MAGELLAN TECH SUPPORT!I purchased this software -LRB- v2 .00 -RRB- in Dec ' 06 . Installed on my XP computer . It wo n't run at all . I called tech support . After a lot of time spent on hold I was told that it was a known problem and the solution is to disable all of the startup services in order to run the program because of a conflict with the anti-virus protections . I was also told that a patch was being worked on.I also tried the SW on 3 other XP machines that I had access to and it ran once on only one of them -LRB- with anti-virus software installed -RRB- but never again.Skip ahead to June . I called Magellan again about the availability of the the promised patch . Guess what , there is none . Magellan offered to send me a new copy of the software . 2 months and several phone calls later the software finally arrived . It was the same version that I already have with the same problem . I tried installing it on another machine that my company uses for testing that has only the operating system on it and no other applications , and it runs , but only on that machine which is not mine and I can not keep the software on it . The software also requires that the map CD be in the drive when you can get it to run , which is an unnecessary obstruction . The software also locks itself to a single GPS unit , also for no apparent reason.If by chance it works on your machine you are lucky . I have been able to run it on 1 out of 6 different computers that I have access to . Magellan Tech support is AWFUL ! They are slow , they do n't speak english well , and ca n't give reasonable answers . Their solution of disabling the protections on the operating system is not a reasonable answer . -LRB- I asked the last tech support person if he would disable the protections on his computer and he said no . -RRB-
 I have a fairly new computer -LRB- Fujitsu S7110 laptop -RRB- and this SW wo n't run on it . It installs without any error . Clicking on the program icon results in nothing happening.As a test I installed it on my desktop -LRB- a CyberpowerPC -RRB- and it runs just fine.But , I need it on my laptop , not my desktop . It does n't do me any good while on the road to be running on my home machine.I called tech support and they basically had me disable all the boot time software and services and , yes , the software does run . But is that really a solution ? It 's more like a kludge . The software has issues and Magellan does n't want to admit it.The Magellan web site hints that version 2.0 of DirectRoute wo n't run on all DVD drives , but they do n't provide a solution.I asked if they would upgrade me to version 3.0 and they said no.This software was essentially a waste of money for me .
 I purchased the GPS and both MapSend and BluvNav software . I have never been able to get Mapsend to work on Windows XP . Support is bad and could not help at all . I was able to get the software to run on a old laptop until the laptop died and now I ca n't use the software because it does not run on XP . I also have version 2 of the software and still it does not work on XP.Save your money and buy something else that works .
 These maps are horrible . Save yourself some time and money and buy a Garmin . The Garmin maps are 100 times better .
 I have had this program for over a year and well . I hate it , I changed over to Mac and this was the `` be all to end all '' . Everything you need is in a different bundle which is a pain to try to find which bundle you need and if you have it with some other bundle you have already boughtThe institution DVD -LRB- I paid extra for -RRB- keeps saying how easy it is to use BUT I am always fighting with it ALWAYS , The DVD on how to learn the program is different then the windows they use on the version on my computer NUTS ! What am I to do ? I spent the hundreds hoping tI would live up to the hype . I have at time just skipped using the program and just used google for what I was looking for as I did not want the extra stress of fighting with the program yet again
 There were also no codes on my jewel case and I have just started my emails to the company . Obviously , I can expect to be at this for some time ! And from Nellie 's review , I am not sure it is worth the time and trouble . The package can not be returned to Amazon since it has been opened . But one has to open it to install and try to find the codes -- CATCH 22 . Online , Amazon says it ships from Target , but it shipped from Amazon according to the package it cam in . The whole thing is a big disappointment so far .
 I purchased `` AGON
 Unfortunately , there are too many bugs in this program . Calls to the `` service '' department directed me to a patch page , which is not even available on the server . Product does not function as is .
 Can somebody please list the ` code ' they used ? It might not work for my game , but at least it would give the form that the code should be in . I , too , got the jewel box without a codeEdit
 And had almost the same experience , to wit : - loaded it onto a Mac laptop - it crashed at the key box , despite multiple attempts - I sent a note via the AGON webpage feedback - I got a prompt reply with links for patches in two different formats - I downloaded both patches , but neither works -- same error message as `` Gen&egrave;ve Gil '' describesThis is really annoying ! I just saw a comment somewhere that said the program does n't run on Mac laptops , but I do n't see that on the amazon.com site . Not a happy customer !

 I would expect products by Symantec to be of higher quality . This one is just terrible . There is no way to add new passwords manually , and it does n't detect alot of login sites .
 This is the sorriest software package I have ever purchased . I was offline when I laoded it and when I went to log in I found it had trashed my modem drivers . I cleaned up the mess with GoBack , went on line and reloaded . I did the reboot and guess what-NO MODEM DRIVERS . When I went to Symantec they did not even have NPM listed as a product so it was impossible to get installation help
 This product just does n't work . It is unfortunate that I have to give this piece of garbage even 1 star . If I could , it would get a -10 . I agree with the other reviewer that browserplus -LRB- www.browserplus.com -RRB- has a much better -LRB- and less expensive -RRB- product that actually works and does a lot more . If you need to manage your passwords , bypass this product and go right to the browserplus website .
 I only wish I 'd read the other reviews before wasting money on this product . It does n't recognize many of the sites I use and ca n't be made to record their passwords . It is , quite literally , a liability and having spent $ 40 on it I have removed it within hours - the first time I have ever felt obliged to do so .
 I do not have the time to write a review , this Password Manager -LRB- PM -RRB- does not even deserve that . I will rather show you what You Will have to face if you install this piece of crap and you have any little `` trouble '' with it like e.g. moving your PM profile from your previous computer to a new computer i.e.I just created PM profile backup file from my old computer and imported it into the PM fresh installation on the new computer , it just did not work ... the really amazing part is the support response to that.If you manage to do all they ask you to trouble-free they should give you a NORTON PASSWORD MANAGER certification for free LOL ! ************** SUPPORT EMAIL ******************** Giovanni , this issue could be caused due to not proper including of previous backup profile information . In order to troubleshoot this issue , I suggest that you please uninstall and then reinstall , and next restore the previous backup image . To do so , please follow the steps provided below : To take the backup of the existing profile :1 -RRB- Open Norton SystemWorks and select Norton Password Manager .2 -RRB- Sign in into the profile , which you want to take backup .3 -RRB- Click on Current Profile .4 -RRB- Click on Modify from the options on the right hand side .5 -RRB- Click on Backup Data option .6 -RRB- Set the location for the backup file . -LRB- . NPM file -RRB- 7 -RRB- Provide / set the password for the backup profile file.To install Norton Password Manager on different system , I suggest that you please follow the steps provided below : Step 1
 I have to say that I have loved this product when I initially purchased it as part of a package in 2004 . BUT - it just recently crashed and I was told by Symantec -LRB- after much time on the website & on hold on the phone -RRB- that they are no longer supporting this software ! Since I have been a `` good '' computer user and backed up all my info I was assuming there should be some way to get back this information - WRONG . The only thing they said I could do was try to reinstall the program , but since I initially purchased it as a download only , I no longer was able to do that ... I am EXTREMELY frustrated with the lack of support & concern for my dilemma and it has turned me very sour towards Symantec ...
 Rarely ever works ... have tried everything Norton has on their site to get it working again but nothing works ... and impossible to contact them by email.Save your money .
 After waiting forever for this product to actually be released , I am severely disappointed after having it for 24 hours . First , it can only be installed on one computer so you have to buy additional copies for your home and work computer . Second , once it starts remembering your passwords it is great about automatically filling them in for you at web sites and programs , however you can never see your passwords in the clear again . Since the program remembers them for you , it wo n't be long before you forget all your passwords , without retrieval . Since you ca n't see them in the clear , they are lost to the internal encryption within the program . It desperately needs a way to see all your passwords in the clear if you so choose !
 There are no provisions to backup your passwords , nor provisions to randomly generate passwords . How can I move my passwords from a desktop to a laptop ? This software does not allow you to control where the data is saved . This software assums that you have some other master list of passwords in case this data is lost . I ca n't believe Norton put their name on this product .
 Everyone of us wants to have a secure digital password manager to help in organizing and accessing your critical information , be it credit card number , banking account or web site access.You do not want to entrust all this information to some shareware program from no-name vendor . That 's why I was very excited to see a late entrance by Symantec - a name you can trust -LRB- within reason -RRB- would not misuse your data for a personal gain.Howerer this particular version ` Norton Password Manager 2004 ' is completely unusable and actually can bring more problems then solve them . Let 's see : - it requires additional license -LRB- = more money to Symantec -RRB- for each PC you are going to install it on ; - it is limited to store only three addresses per user profile -LRB- I guess Symantec knows better then user how many addresses user may have -RRB- ; - detects userID : Password logins from some Windows programs -LRB- not all -RRB- and from about a 1/3 of all sites I tried it on -LRB- so you can still excercise your memory remembering the rest of logins -RRB- ; - only works with Internet Explorer of all browsers -LRB- Microsoft stopped by and said thanks -RRB- - does not allow you to see your own passwords , once you are finally able to teach the program to store them for you -LRB- how is that for managability ? -RRB- - does not allow for manual data entry except for credit card information , so if you have a banking or brokerage account you want to store - good luck with that ; - not portable , so you ca n't take it with you on the roadSymantec should be ashamed to put a Norton trademark on such a lousy product . Did they listen to customers at all when designing it ?
 This program misses the mark by a large margin . I bought this program thinking I could store all the username/password dataon the many websites that require this information . From the start , I tried 5 different websites that I use frequently -LRB- e.g. brokerage sites , credit union , & merchant sites -RRB- and NPM only worked for one website . NPM attempts to recognize web pages that need username/password info and when you enter data on one of these web pages it asks you whether to store the data you just entered . Problem for me was , that 4 out of the first 5 sites NPM never asked me whether I wanted to save this info ! Since there is no manual way to force NPM to remember user/password data , you are simply out of luck - the program fails ! Buried deep on the Symantec Knowledge Base is a web page to submit such bugs of which I submitted 3 bugs in 1 hour . I twice asked for a reply to my problem reports and received none . Also , not being able to view the user/password data for sites that do work , as mentioned in a previous post , is a huge problem if you 're trying to share some of this data with your spouse . Symantec spent more time on the cool scrollable graphics then they did on making this software useable and robust . Needless to say , I 'm sending this software back for a refund .
 Not a good product at all . I should have realized that the fact that Norton has not provided a new version of this in years -LRB- sounds like they gave up on it -RRB- . The product sometimes will stop working and will not fill in websites it already has info on . Closing and reopening does no good . Rebooting does , but that 's not a workaround . Whoever certified this product for release clearly needs to be fired . And whoever is responsible for Norton 's support on this product should follow them out the door . I 'll probably dump Norton altogether -LRB- I have their antivirus program -RRB- since they can not even figure out a basic product like a password manager .
 A better alternative is Bagusoft Password Safe . -LRB- www.bagus-software.de -RRB- . It also has an AutoFill function and you can use it on a USB stick . It 's cheaper than Norton and there 's also a Freeware Version without AutoFill .
 If you spend a lot of time on the internet , you probably have dozens of websites you need a username and password to log into . You may be tempted to use the same username and password for all websites , but this is bad for your security . For example , for your online banking account or any site that stores financial or any important information , you should have a unique username and password that is used nowhere else . The problem is it is impossible to remember more than a few usernames and passwords . So what do you do ? You use software that will save and automatically fill in your username and password.Recently I got Norton Password manager 2004 bundled with the latest updates for Norton Antivirus . Although I was perfectlysatisfied using a program called Roboform , I figured Symantec is a big company with lots of money to develop the best product , so just maybe their product may actually beat Roboform . I used it for two weeks and what were my findings ? Read on to find out.While Internet Explorer and some other web browsers have the ability to save form information and usernames/passwords , you have no access to that stored information whatsoever , and you ca n't even tell what is being stored . That is why you may need password management software . Both software will allow you to save passwords and save form information . That is the minimum you should expect in a password manager . Norton does this satisfactorily but there are some time-saving features that it is missing.Benefits of Norton Password Manager 2004 : * Save multiple profiles -LRB- Save different information to be filled in - work profile , home profile , business profile -RRB- * Save multiple credit cards * Require password prompting before filling in information -LRB- optional -- can be turned off -RRB- Time-saving Features Norton is missing : * View and edit saved usernames and passwords . * Go to login url - you can go to the login URL -LRB- which is n't always on the main page -RRB- . * Choose to have forms filled in automatically or click a button when prompted to fill in information . * Custom fields -LRB- Create custom-named fields and enter the information you want filled in . Norton only fills in fields itrecognizes -LRB- name , address , city , state , etc. -RRB- Conclusion
 This simply does n't perform the functions a password manager needs to in order to do the job . The most serious problem is that there is no way to retrieve or see a current password . Thus it will log in to a login page OK , but when you want to change passwords a different page generally asks for the existing password and two entries of the new one ; there is no way to get the existing password onto that page unless it was written down initially , which defeats the purpose of the software . Naturally the problem is most serious in those places where you want complex nonsensical passwords and those changed often ; exactly those places for which one buys the software . Avoid it . I suggest www.browserplus.com for an excellent , more functional , and cheaper alternative .
 I bought Password Manager when it was first released and was very satisfied with it . But then came the crashes and its unwillingness to start up correctly -LRB- e.g. , the Sign In dialog would not display on reboot -RRB- . After years of uninstalling and reinstalling Password Mangler to fix its variety of issues -- always having to go back to the original installation CD and work _ up _ from there -- and struggling with Symantec 's obscure and unhelpful Web site -LRB- and their obscure and unhelpful off-shore technical support -RRB- , I 'm giving up on it.Password Manager has not been supported for well over two years now , and the Symantec site hopefully suggests a variety of products to `` upgrade '' to that do NOT include Password Manager -LRB- BEWARE of that trap ! -RRB- -- you may think you 've upgraded , but you have n't ... you 've simply bought a new product that does not include Password Manager .20 + / - years ago , `` Norton '' applications were the cat 's meow and the only elegant salvation for lost and corrupted file DOS issues , including the infamous `` format c : / '' oopsie.Since Symantec -LRB- then mostly a Mac shop ... a clue , in retrospect -RRB- bought up Norton , product development , support , engineering , and QA have gone into the toilet . Passsword Manager had its flushing success , as well .
 i have had nothing but trouble eith the norton firewall . it locked up my computer . then when i tried to uninstall it it wont uninstall . i keep getting popups from symanatec-little error messages about this every time i start the computer or change websites . do not buy this product ...
 If you purchase this you 're just paying Norton for multiple headaches and a product that rarely works . Three times this week the parental controls which I chose not to install have randomly installed and the program wo n't let me as the administrator and only user of this computer log in to alter the parental controls/firewall controls/anti-virus controls . So now I am blocked out of my email sites and news sites . A warning keeps popping up to uninstall but unless you log in as the administrator you ca n't uninstall . Which then brings me back to the problem of not being to log in . I spent far too much money for protection and the only way I 'm getting protected is I 'm spending more time fighting that program and having to restart my system hoping something has changed than I have actually getting to enjoy my computer!And do n't expect any support when you run into these problems . You 'll pay almost as much for one phone call to Norton as you did for the program . Norton definitely knows how to rob customers and get away with it .
 I 'm truly sorry I bought this software . The ad blocker and pop up blocker are far weaker than the 2003 version . The ad/popup ad blocker dose not work on this version . The automated support system on Symantec 's website is hard to find answers and frustrating to navigate . The privacy monitor is a good concept , but a pain to work with , especially in email . The only thing I trust in this product to work is the virus scan utilities . Everything else is hit or miss depending on the day . I 'm extremely disappointed with this software .
 i got this product free thru promotion program & rebate . But i feel sorry to install this . I have to uninstall this after 1 hour using it . It 's not simple to set up -LRB- another word , too much questions for setup -RRB- , continuously popup , slow down you system and internet connection . Popup killer is not working properly.DON ' T BUY IT
 We used Norton Internet Security 2003 -LRB- NIS 2003 -RRB- to filter the internet for our children . After doing a Windows XP SP2 reinstall recently we tried to reinstall NIS 2003 again and the program crashed after the first on-line update . Reinstalled Windows again , purchased a like new NIS 2004 CD , and the same thing happened . We tried a fresh installs a total of five times before giving up , and neither Norton program will work anymore.It would not surprise me if Norton purposely now breaks these older programs , trying to force people to purchase a newer product . Their `` Knowledge Base '' for the error code took me directly to a Norton 2007 sales pitch page.Norton used to be respectable , but now they are just a very sleazy company . There are better choices .
 I have been using Norton products only since about1986 , but I 'm ready to switch . All manner of problems with this program never seen in previous editions . Instructions and support seriously inadequate at all levels.I have used this version on two machines -- spent days trying to clean a botched installation -LSB- I believe not by me , but the installation program -RSB- on one machine . Now a month-old installation an a new desktop is failing . Spent hours with `` knowledge '' base and incomprehensible advice . Then , for a $ 29.95 phone call , received numerous recorded `` we are too busy to talk to you even if you pay us . '' Then , a rude and sarcastic rep , who dumped my into an uninstall routine that failed , disconnected my call , and refused to hear symptoms .
 NIS 2004 Pro on XP Home gave me 100 % protection , by killing my ADSL internet connection altogether -LRB- a novel approach ! -RRB- . Although it set up fine , it slowed the computer down once installed and killed email and browsers.I could still ping servers on the net , but could n't make any other type of connection . This was despite fiddling with the firewall rules for hours and looking for clashing drivers.It also dumped my ActiveSync partnership between the pc and my ipaq , so I had to redo those settings.After uninstalling the first time I had to add a network connection to get on the net.After uninstalling the second time no added network connections work , I 'm still not on the net a week later.Like others said the evaluation of Zone Alarm Pro works seamlessly for me , has a smaller footprint , is less invasive , and actually uninstalls itself if asked !
 The $ 30 rebate form says it is for current upgrade users and users of competitors products . I used to use McAfee and switched to NIS Pro . Rebate was denied cuz of `` invalid proof of previous purchase '' . Point of the matter is I am not a previous user , I switched from a competitor . So get this if you want to switch but do n't hold your breath on the rebate . Not a bad product but not a great one either . I will not renew when the term is up . It is difficult to use when you want to stream in video media because it thinks you are under attack .
 I 've done ISP tech support since 1998 . Of all the firewalls I 've seen the various versions of Norton Internet Security have caused more crippled connecitons than any other.I get calls weekly where disabling or uninstalling Norton Internet Security resolves problems with connectivity . I 'm not sure if it 's the becausethe program is just poorly designed or it if it 's just poor help and tutorial info with it.But the end result is that this program has cost my employers huge resource drains in supporting Norton 's customers , and cost my users countless hours of time wasted troubleshooting issues with thios software , and days of lost network access . I also know someone working an a major univeristy that found that this was a source of problems in how their pop-up stopper re-wrote HTML code in web pages it was filtering and caused applications they 'd built to fail.There are free firewalls you can download that are as effective and easier to use . This one can cause far more trouble than it 's worth .
 I am on Amazon tonight to look up alternatives to Norton Anti-Virus because of their poor maintenance . -LRB- They have outsourced their maintenance , I think to India , and there is such difficulty and so many emails exchanged to try to get understanding and answers that I eventually just gave up on the anti-spam package and will never buy it again . I have had better results with the corporate version of anti-virus , but even with the business edition I have to wait very lengthy times to get to a customer service representative , but the ones I have gotten have been really great . But they are sitting at a phone right here in the USA . I have been a long time giving up on Norton because of past history . I started with windows back in the days of Windows 3.1 and Norton had wonderful software that filled the gaps in Windows and made the Windows experience better . I was also treated extremely badly when I tried to complain to the corporate/sales people about my dislike of and disapproval of outsourcing . The person ultimately hung up when I asked that my comments be relayed to her superiors . All of that being said , I feel my instincts were right and I am not even going to consider Norton , especially for a combination product . I also feel that the quality of the products are worse . They used to be much easier to configure and get working . These problems started before their firewall product , but that one was a particularly difficult product to deal with compared to many products in Norton 's pass . Well , ultimately even a very loyal customer like me has to wonder whether it is time to give up .
 The `` Norton/Symantic '' Shepard is much worse than the `` Adware '' Wolf . If you are a developer or need access to local development tools such as IIS , DO N'T INSTALL THIS PRODUCT . I 'm sorry I did n't read the Amazon reviews before I installed . It 'll kill your machine 's speed , IIS localhost and you 'll either have to reformat OR IF YOUR LUCKY Restore to an earlier restore point . - -LRB- thanks to windows XP restore -RRB- . I was lucky . Worst part is that there 's no way to get a refund . I ca n't imagine how a large company like Symantec could put out such an ill conceived product - and even worse - a very sick help-and-support department . Talk about internet wolves . Get McAffee for antivirus and ZoneAlarm for Internet Security . Much better .
 Downloaded first for my notebook , this was okay although it dramatically slows down machine , why is it it needs to do a virus scan of a document already held on your machine ? -LRB- Assuming already done full system scan and scanning all mails -RRB- Then downloaded version for desktop then my nightmare from hell started and whilst reasonably PC competent it was far too deep for me in what it was doing to my machine.It was bloody murder , nothing worked or if it did it took 3 minutes to open a file.My mail went AWOL and when i checked the status window it told me I had an error in the E mail setting but no idea as to how to fix it . User support was a joke -LRB- especially from the UK -RRB- and now i decided to forget the money spent , do a system restore -LRB- it did n't like it -RRB- to before i bought it and now would n't dream of letting it get near my machine again.Be warned !!!!
 My husband was so frustrated with MANY problems that he finally uninstalled the whole mess . Even getting it off his machine took 2 days . For the first time in his life , he considered suicide.It slowed my PC down -LRB- and I have a new AMD -RRB- . I can not access IE without disabling Internet Security Professional -LRB- this started out of the blue a couple months ago -RRB- . I 'm afraid to even try to uninstall it . I 'll probably end up taking it in to a shop and having them uninstall it - and paying.I will never buy from Norton again . I thought Norton was supposed to have a reputable product . It 's trash .
 I downloaded this set from Norton , and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download . I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues . I lost all my personal info . Their site offers no live help at all . I tried to call Norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service -LRB- tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC -RRB- or they have a $ 30 tech-support number . Who wants to pay $ 30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $ 95 ? -LRB- I also bought the back-up CD -RRB- . I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice . They said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $ 15 to `` handle '' and ship a CD ? -- and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails . This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support . After 10 years , I now downloaded McCaffee 's product after calling their support ... they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful . No problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers . I see many other reviews that say the same ... stay away from Norton , they do n't deserve you , or anyone !
 After very lengthy installation and activation on my Notebook computer -LRB- Win XP Pro with Internet Information Services 5 -RRB- , Internet Explorer could not be started . It kept `` waiting for reply '' - that 's when I was trying to reach http://localhost . Then I discovered the installation had also prevented me from accessing Sharing and Security ... on Windows Explorer - even when Personal Firewall was switched off . I had purchased the `` Professional '' edition of Norton Internet Security believing it would give professional results . Very disappointed . Had to uninstall the lot to recover full functionality in Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer . Could find nothing helpful in Symantec 's support knowledge base . A whole evening wasted ! In disgust and in urgent need of a firewall , I downloaded Zone Alarm Pro trial version and it worked perfectly . No hitches . In the past , I 've never been able to reach a human voice on Symantec 's support service by phone in Australia . I 've been using Norton AntiVirus and the free version of Zone Alarm , but thought Norton Internet Security Professional Edition would be the best way to go in starting my small business . If I do n't get the service I need after logging an online query for help , I 'll be taking up Symantec 's offer to hand in the software and get my money back - but they say it may take six weeks to process the redemption !! I 'll never buy another box of software before reading Amazon 's reviews . I should have known better . Anyhow , Happy New Year , everyone !!
 I bought Norton Internet Security 2004 after I got a VIRUS that NAV 7 corporate edition could n't detect or remove . I thought upgrading the 4 year old program would help . Nope ! Norton detects Trojan.Bookmarker.Gen but even in Dos mode is unable to fix it . It turns out that I got an advanced form of the Cool web search trojan/spyware . Well Norton seems to care less . I emailed them about the problem with no response after 2 months . They used to let you submit a new virus discovery but I could n't find anything anywhere on their site about reporting new viruses.What happened !? I guess I could pay them by calling their highly over priced help line to tell them their program sucks but they already have too much of my money.And what is it with these guys claiming that because it is spyware it is not a virus . If a program hides itself , alters files without permission , and otherwise takes control of your system without your permission , I 'm sorry it 's a virus . And the leading Anti-virus software should do their job to make their software do what it 's supposed to do , eliminate uninvited software -LRB- period -RRB- . Stop passing the responsibility to Spyware removers . It 's a virus , plain and simple.No , I did n't install any freeware , only MS , Adobe , Macromedia , Mozilla , and Norton software . Like someone else said , get McAfee Antivirus and Zone Alarm , not this piece of worthless junk.Am I alone in this sentiment ? -LRB- ... -RRB-
 Way too restrictive and/or buggy . I am constantly having to turn this off to get to some web pages . So I am in greater danger than I was before . Have spent several hours trying to tune the thing per their website support instructions but it does n't seem to do any good . Very disappointed . Never had these problems with 2003 version . I would avoid until you start seeing some positive comments or they come out with some fixes.Update - please read the June 2004 PC World eval of firewalls . Described Norton as sluggish , etc. . I took it off and installed their recommendation of PC Cillin . What a difference , my PC has gotten it 's speed back . And my problems have gone away .
 I bought this product sometime in Feb of 2004 and everything worked fine but then one day about three weeks ago IIS stopped working and the machine became very sluggish . I also get . mmc errors . I am running XPpro on a P4 2.4 machine w/512mg of Ram . I am now seeing that many other people are having the same problems . It seems that Symantec has put something in one of their updates that disables IIS and causes other problems . If you call Symantec they lie to you and tell you they have not received any complaints and tell you they do n't know what you are talking about and try to send you to a technician that will want a credit card number . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . IT IS A VIRUS IN AND OF ITSELF . It will alter your operating system without your permission . In my view that is a crime against property . I am a contractor and I have worked at many many different businesses . I can see that it is no coincidence that every place I have ever worked uses McAfee . If I could I would rate this product zero stars but the pull down list does n't have a zero .
 Based on my very postive experience with Norton Anti-Virus and Norton Personal Firewall , I did n't think twice about upgrading to Norton Internet Security Pro . I should have . It does not do properly what it is supposed to do , and it runs so many unneeded processes in the background that it may bog down your machine , depending on your specs . It 's content blocking feature blocks the most absurdly innocuous webpages , graphics , etc.On top of that , it is more often than not too unstable to be at all useful or satisfactory . The worst example of this I have found is that the NIS user/logon/password feature interferes with a similar built-in Windows feature . The average user does n't need to password-protect access to their machine at all . In my own case I found that this element of NIS , which you are obliged to use , made it impossible to restart the computer ; instead I had to do a complete shutdown -LRB- and far too often -RRB- . As a consequence , the first thing I do when I start up is disable NIS altogether . If I uninstall it , I lose the anti-virus protection -- which * does * work.I requested a refund and was sent a Letter of Destruction -LRB- LOD -RRB- , which I duly signed and returned -- and never heard another thing from them . I never did get my money back.Neither the average user who excersises common sense , nor the professional who is trained to detect threats needs NIS . You 're much better off sticking to Norton Anti-Virus -LRB- or a competitor 's equivalent -RRB- and running the Windows -LRB- XP -RRB- firewall if you feel you need one . Beyond that , it 's just a matter of being smart enough not to walk down a dark alley with $ 20s hanging out of your pockets.Lastly , if you are concerned about spyware , bots , tracking cookies , etc. , checkout Lavasoft 's free program called ` Ad-aware , ' available from http://www.lavasoft.de/
 I have Norton Internet Security 2002 . I have used NIS for a long time and I have , until a few months ago , recommended it for virus protection , anti-hacking security , ad blocking , and privacy protection.A couple of months ago , a Live Update created an apparent problem with SYMPROXYSVC.EXE that made it very difficult to browse Web pages . Pages often downloaded as slowly as 100-200 bytes/second . -LRB- E-mail and FTP seemed unaffected by the problem . -RRB- Although Symantec was quite happy to take my money for a subscription update this March , it refused to provide E-mail technical support for the product because support for NIS 2002 had been discontinued . E-mails to customer support received nonresponsive replies -LRB- or no replies -RRB- , and a customer support rep ignored my explicit requests to be put in contact with a supervisor . A fax to the attention of the customer support supervisor was ignored.Although a subsequent Live Update fixed the underlying problem a while later , I would rate Symantec 's customer and technical support as effectively nonexistent and I do take notice of the company 's refusal to stand behind its product even though it took my money for an extension to my virus definition subscription . Accordingly , it is no longer possible for me to recommend anything that Symantec makes.I forwarded a copy of the letter I faxed to the customer support department to Symantec 's Investor Relations department because I think their corporate office reallly needs to know what is going on with their customer and technical support departments .
 What a piece of junk : It did not install properly , it states support for Eudora email , bit it does not w0rk.ZoneAlarm is much better firewall , simple and works.The worst part is the uninstall does not work . The only way to uninstall it is to download rnav2003.exe from symantec to remove this piece of junk from the registry . It is amazing that they ship a program that does not unintall yet they seem to know what is wrong and have fixed it with their rnav2003 utility program.Do not waste your time or money on this piece of junk
 I 've installed on my P4 2.43 GHz , 512 Mb RAM DDR 333 , HD UDMA133 80Gb , Windows XP Pro . A program-for-the-PC-that-you 'll - buy-in-the-future -LRB- but now you do n't have -RRB- . Now my PC takes 3 minutes to arrive on the desktop ! And all functions are slowed . I 've un-installed ! Now my PC goes fast as before . I 've reinstalled after three days . The problem of slowing my PC remains the same . I used before Norton Internet Security 2003 but I 've never had these problems . A little note
 Took an hour to install , no errors . Required me to activate even before it completed installation , even before I knew it would work . After installing , it took 20 minutes to reboot my 1.8 GHz computer . After reboot , spent the next 3 hours doing updates with a cable connection . After all was installed and updated , I could not access the Internet , but everyone else could access my computer . I could not open MS Office files , and creating a 1 MB zip file took 45 minutes because NIS had to repeatedly scan the file as it was being made . It disabled my ADD/REMOVE programs so I could n't even uninstall it . Will be spending my weekend reinstalling all my software after wiping my drive clean to uninstall this program .
 This is pure junk . You will never get IIS to work , even after uninstalling NIS ! Do you know why ? Because it considers your desktop as a server and so it will prevent IIS to run . Why ? Because Symantec wants you to buy the corporate version , for servers , which is much more expensive.The registration is based on your hardware and there is a limit of registration attempts -LRB- not indicated anywhere explicitly -RRB- . If you change a few components in your computer , it will stop working , a crash can easily corrupt it as well . You ca n't use it in an image file -LRB- driveimage or so -RRB- already registered because it wo n't work.Customer support ? In one word
 If you want to get extremely frustrated then get this product . Also , if you want to have nothing fixed on your computer get this product . I wish I could return it .
 I bought this product primarily for Norton Ghost , to create backup images of machines . IT SUCKS . I HATE IT . DO N'T BUY IT . Here 's why : USB 2.0 support
 This is worst release I think . Once I activated -LRB- which was a painful process because Key was Invalid -RRB- I was never able to use this once.I Can not believe they came with such a poor activation method which is painful and will never work and In fact , I changed my outlook setting ... got a clue ?? . . I do not recommend Norton Systemworks Pro 2004 at all . Stick with 2003 or better get Zonealarm with antivirus or Trenmicro.Keep away . .
 installation stalled every time . Can not contact support.software expires 15 days.If someone does n't contact me , demand money back.Humphreys318-208-8619

 Crashed my hard drive when I tried to update from System works 2002 . Deleted important files needed to boot windows . BACKUP YOUR HARD DRIVE BEFORE INSTALLING , or you will be pissed off like me . No help from the techies at Symantec either.Once I was able to resurect , it seems to be working great though .
 I have always like Norton products , but this one is horrible . I am taking a break after a 6 hour install process on this garbage , and I 'm not even done yet . I had 2003 , 2002 , ... and this one wo n't install without constant errors . I ca n't even get it uninstalled off my system to have a clean boot up.Forget about viruses , worms , hackers etc , this is one and you have even paid for this garbage .
 The installation keeps failing , and then it does n't clean itself up - it leaves you with the Symantec Core Licence Client service running , and if you delete that you will trash your network connection and then you 'll need to reload XP .
 Do you all remember Basic Computing 101 - `` Garbage In , Garbage Out '' ? Well , save your hard-earned shekels on this dreck folks , because it is so bugged-up and full of garbage it just might ruin your hard drive ! If you want to lose ALL your data , buy and install Norton Systemworks Professional Edition 2004 . I bought this snakeoil from Comp USA and it had multiple errors right out of its beautifully shrinked-wrap box . It has never worked right nor done its job . On top of this , Symantec 's free support is boilerplate and useless . I had to pay $ 29.95 to speak to a breathing human to try and fix this nightmare . As a professional computer guy , I can tell this product will NEVER function smoothly or do its job . I strongly suggest you DO N'T buy Norton Systemworks 2004 Professional Edition .
 This beast of a program caused a blue-screen crash shortly after I installed it on my XP system . Now I get `` serious error '' messages every time I boot up my computer.I should have listened to the warnings on here ... Year after year Norton puts out this kind of clumsy software ... they never get it right ... I do n't expect they ever will.Never again , Norton .
 If you have the 2003 version you need to keep it , it is a wonderful product , and I wish I still had mine . Whatever you do , DO NOT UPGRADE to this 2004 version ! Buy the subscription and save yourself many headaches . These other people know what they are talking about . Now I 'm looking at re-formating my hard drive or buying a new one to get rid of my pain .
 I am DE-INSTALLING Norton Systemworks Professional Edition 2004 and burying this DOG deep to remove the stench from my office . It is beyond a doubt the worst CA-CA I have ever been suckered in to buying . Symanec should be ashamed of itself for selling this CRAPOLA , and Peter Norton owes us all a public apology and RITUAL SEPPUKU for putting his name on The Ultimate Con , Norton Systemworks 2004 . No more Norton anything for this former fan and user . ARRGGHHH !!!!
 Some gripes with suggested alternative applications at teh bootom.So I had Norton AntiVirus 2002 and Internet Firewall -LRB- both OEM that came with my compaq -RRB- . Uninstalled the firewall after an update revoked my user rights to administer it and left me helpless to change firewall rules.Anyway , ran some script from Symantec Support which successfully removed the firewall.Then later I upgraded AntiVirus to 2003 and the put SystemWorks on the machine . SystemsWorks dis n't install it 's own copy of AntiVirus becuase it was already there . All fine so far.Then I discovered that none of the MS Office apps would open a file . They all spouted some guff that AntiVirus application would n't let them . This was for every Word , Excel file I had , files I knew to be good and clean.So to my surprise when I fire up the AntiVirus app that the SystemWorks control panel comes up but there was no AntiVirus in the list of apps . No matter what I did , I could not get into the AntiVirus control application . I uninstalled SystemWorks but that did n't help . I tried to uninstall AntiVirus thinking that it 's still there as a separate app but there was no way to uninstall it either from Add/remove Programs or the start menu entries.Sucks.So I ended up rebuilding my machine anyway minus Norton anything.Suggested alternatives.DiskKeeper 8 is great replacement for SpeedDisk . I 've used this for years on servers and it works great.PowerQuest Drive Image 8 is a good alternative to Ghost . -LRB- ironically Symantec just bought PowerQuest last week ! -RRB- Yet to evaluate AntiVirus alternatives . Maybe Macafee or PC-Cillin .
 I am generally a big fan of Norton products , but if you have Norton SystemWorks 2003 , then you have almost everything that the 2004 version has . I loaded the 2004 version and checked it out , the differences are pretty minor.Also , when I loaded the 2004 version on my computer it disabled my internet access somehow -LRB- Earthlink -RRB- . It kept giving me warnings that I should run `` LiveUpdate '' , but I could n't because I could n't get onto the internet . After I uninstalled it my internet access went back to working like normal.I 'll stick with the 2003 version . I 've never had any problems with it .
 Having used the Norton Utilities since Peter Norton first brought them out , I am abandoning them . The other reviews on this page describe the problems with them , which get worse with each `` upgrade . '' Symantec is following McAfee 's lead
 I bought this 4 days ago . After I installed it I began to get error messages every other minute . It also disabled my MSN8 . After spending the entire weekend loading and unloading programs , formatting my hard drive and installing windows twice , I discovered that it was the System Works that was the problem . I am returning this today .
 This program completely destroyed my computer . I pushed the `` one button checkup '' and the program promptly found about 30 items to it needed to fix . I pushed `` OK '' and the PC never recovered from what came next . The PC froze in the middle of the speed disk program and this corrupted my hard disk . I then had to restore the PC from the manufactures original disks . Now , let me say just one word about trying to get support from Symantec
 Adding product activation was the straw that broke this camel 's back . I have used Norton Utilities since DOS and have continued up through Systemworks 2003 . Well , the latest version went back to the store . Aside from a myriad of problems , the reality here is Symantec is just not a customer-friendly company . Look elsewhere . Some good alternatives : Anti-Virus
 I could have put up with the product activation , but this new version of Systemworks only half-installed , now I ca n't get either the old version -LRB- 2003 -RRB- reinstalled nor the new version reinstalled . Ca n't reinstall Internet Security 2004 either . Symantec deserves to lose money on this release , it was n't ready for prime time and I wish they would compensate me for the hours of attempting to get this piece of garbage to work . Diskeeper 8.0 and McAfee Internet Security Suite 2004 will do almost all that Systemworks did and much more reliably . If you have to clean the registry , try MaceCraft 's RegSupreme and for cleaning out old files , try McAfee QuickClean . I 've used Symantec products since the early days of Norton products and this was a big disappointment .
 I 've been using Symantec 's `` Norton '' products since the early 1990s , and this is my first real disappointment . This program slows my computer considerably which was a really fast one , and my programs do not work properly
 I have been running SystemWorks for years , and Personal Firewall for 1 year , didnt have a day 's problem with the 2003 bundle on 98 or XP , but nothing but problems with 2004 bundle -LRB- NSW+PF -RRB- . First activation didnt work , now its conflicting with something else , causing it not to run at all , although no obvious error message . Rebooted without other drivers . . no joy . Support an absolute nightmare , despite forking out $ 30 a pop.Steer clear of this one , folks .
 Outdated ? Yup . Do n't let the 2004 moniker fool you . This is just the latest rehash of a product that is completely outdated and has n't had a real update in quite some time . They slap some new graphics on every year , but for anybody using Windows XP -LRB- or anything derived from NT or later -RRB- you 're completely wasting your money and the only thing of value will be the Antivirus software . -LRB- Do n't get me wrong , the Norton Antivirus software is slow and bloated , too , but at least it does the job well otherwise . -RRB- Under XP all the other utilities are either disabled , or very close to useless . The native disk check and defragmenter that come with XP work either the same or better than what comes with Norton . Please do n't make the same mistake I did . Save your money ; there are MUCH better utility suites out there for XP . And the truth is that with XP the only third-party software you really need to get are anti-virus and firewall protection .
 Just tried to load this program unsucessfully . Attempted online tech support and received email that I would get a response in FOUR TO FIVE DAYS ! I switched from McAfee after my subscription expired and will be returning Norton and going back to McAfee who has a free Chat Support where I can solve my problems immediately - who wants to wait 4 or 5 days to solve a problem ?
 I feel compelled to say
 It installs fine but none of the norton programs would run . Not ready for a release . Do not buy it , it is waste of time .
 Obviously people have different experiences , but here 's mine
 I have Norton Systemworks 2003 and it worked well on my XP computer . Tried to install Sytemworks 2004 3 times and everytime , I could not use my USB card reader anymore . I do not have the time to fiddle with the settings to get this to work . I can not even just install the Antivirus portion only without it uninstalling the entire Systemworks 2003 and not just updating the Antivirus . I am now back to 2003 and wondering if I should go with McAfee .
 Other than the anti-virus stuff , everything else is just MASSIVE dead weight . You 'd think something this massive would offer a firewall program . If Symantec did that , then the price could be justified . But they -LRB- Surprise !! Surprise !! -RRB- force you to buy that seperately . In short , the time for this software suite has passed a LONG time ago !! You 're better off getting Norton Internet Security , which is bundled with Norton AntiVirus and Norton AntiSpam -LRB- Add in Executive Software 's Diskeeper , and you 'll have all you 'll need . -RRB- Do n't bother wasting your money on Norton SystemWorks . It 's a freakin ' rip-off !! Everything else can be taken care of by the Windows OS .
 I have used Norton AntiVirus for years and never had a problem with it ; I installed SystemWorks and had to shut most of the utilities down because it slowed my system down to a snail 's pace . Now I only run the AntiVirus and everything works fine ; unfortunately I ca n't return SystemWorks.Also , if you submit a rebate form for this product , do n't expect to actually receive any money back from Symantec . They will conveniently misplace your proof of purchase .
 Do n't buy this software . I tried to uninstall Norton Anti-virusfrom my system before install of NSW 2004 but it insists that aversion of anti-virus is still there and will not install.Installation locks up EVERY time . Save yourself anguish byanything else ... O no Nada tech support until u cough up30 bucks ... . Unless u are a programmer and feel like editingyour registry
 If you are running Windows 98 do n't even consider this nightmare . Three tech support calls and 10 + hours of frustrating attempts to install ... stick with any of the prior versions or competitors product . I returned to Symantic for refund .
 I 've been buying norton for years . Since it first came out actually . And I wasted money on this product . I install it only to find out that they want you to activate it every time it runs . It wo n't work otherwise . And it 's not returnable . Once you buy software , you ca n't give it back . So I 'm stuck with a copy of Norton that will not work . Thanks Symantec . See if I ever buy anything from you again ...
 Ok , so I did n't read and obey the reviews for this product but I thought I had enough experience with Norton products to make it work . It does n't . Save your money . While I did n't have the problems with installation that others have had , I find that the software does very little to aid in helping my computer to run better.Of special note is clean sweep . When you run it MANY programs say that they are protected and can not be deleted . What is up with that ? I paid my money for this product , now get the stuff out of my computer that I tell you to . It really does n't work . A specific example is Netscape . Netscape has infested my computer and I have tried to delete it through add and remove programs but my Sony -LRB- AKA shotty -RRB- wo n't let me delete it . So I thought Norton would go in an tear it out . No way . Norton does n't do anything you can not do yourself . Do yourself a favor , skip the Norton and buy premium beer instead !
 I 've had Systemworks for the past 3 years ... but this was by far the worst experience ... too many problems , i.e can ' find a qdcspi.dll - that was supposed to be fixed in the 2001 release ... ??? I 've begun experiencing problems with IE sessions ... I use Win ME which is far from being a reliable OS but I know that I have n't had those problems before ... As other people have suggested here ... keep the 2003 version and just sign up for new virus definitions .
 Do NOT buy this softwareSystemWorks 2004 requires product activation which does not work . It keeps asking to be reactivated , each time the computer is restarted , and finally stops working . Symantec has NO fix.This problem has also been documented in PC World , and Info World magazine articles .
 One of the best parts of this suite , should have been GoBack whcy Norton acquired from Roxio last year . I could n't believe that the new version took out functionality that was there in Version 3.0 -- the ability to retrieve files which disapeared after reverting the hard drive . WHY ??? The Antivirus is excellent as usual with Norton . The scheduling does n't seem to pay attention to your settings . Set what you will , the program still wants to run a couple of times a week , and new a check up.If they enhanced rather than degraded GoBack -LRB- suggestions
 I 've been using Symantec 's `` Norton '' products since the mid-1990s , and this is my first real disappointment . So much about this version feels like a hurried beta version . For example : The `` Quick Fill '' feature of Password Manager -- a feature that fills in names , addresses , phone numbers etc. on web forms as well as in loaded software -- ca n't be disabled . Therefore if you want access to the functionality of Password Manager , you 're stuck letting the program fill in the forms of web sites . This is a huge inconvenience.Some web sites -LRB- e.g. magazine websites -RRB- have these forms on every page of their sites . So with every page , Quick Fill pops up and asks you what you want to do -LRB- although there 's an `` always ignore '' option , it frequently does n't work
 I 'm relieved to see that so many others are having trouble installing and running Systemworks 2004 . I thought it was something I was doing wrong . Now I 'm fairly sure it 's IT and not me . After many many attempts to get this thing to run , I 'm returning it and sticking with the 2003 version .
 I bought this new version because I got it for free after rebates . One button check-up will no longer automatically repair any errors it finds , if you spend anytime on a website with a form to be filled -LRB- ie cnnsi -RRB- the password manager -LRB- NPM -RRB- pops up , steals the focus and asks if you would like to complete the form . I have found one site that NPM does not even work ! NPM seems to put your entire phone number in the box for area code . Unless you get it for a low , low price after rebate , keep the 2003 version and get the google tool bar , it will fill out forms and block the annoying pop-ups .
 I have owned the product 3 weeks and have tried the on-line `` support '' they have not responded . Called the company who said they 'll get back to me . TWO weeks still no responce ... I can get fee based support for 29.95 and they will call me back within four or five days and might help the problem ...
 As a user of other Norton product do n't attempt to install Systemworks on an older CPU . The minimum requirements for a computer running Win 2000 is a 133mhz processor and 64mb of ram . I have a 400mhz processor and 521mb of ram . The machine was crippled , startup was 7-10 minutes , opening a program took an additional 1-3 minutes and the virus check would cripple the web browser waiting for every file to be scanned . All was solved by uninstalling the product . Overall it may do the trick at fixing computer problems such as lost files , viruses , windows registry problems , and such . If you have any of these except for the virus problem install , fix it , and uninstall because you will have more problems then you started out with .
 I 've been using Norton Utilities , now called Systemworks , since they came on 5 1/2 inch floppies . Back in the `` old '' days , Norton would release a new version that contained better or additional features . Unfortunately , Symantec now insists on releasing one every year , regardless of any major changes . Too bad .
 For some reason this program disables Earthlink Total Access internet access . I discovered that the problem is with the way the program loads . If you do n't include it in the startup , everything works fine . The problem seems to be with the Clean Sweep and Ghost .
 Want a quick way to reduce your machines performance ? Norton Systemworks 2004 is the software for you . Quick makes basic tasks a real pain to perform and causes no end of trouble while playing games . I dropped the software after a year of being subjected to their feeble software and then being asked to spend more money to keep my machine safe . I switched to AVG which is free and allows my machine to actually run properly .
 The term `` Easy '' in the ads really means uncontrollable - just like the OS called MS Windows . They offer no support - ooops , they do support you for 40 bucks - my word that 's the same as this software costs !? So you buy it once and then over and over again , until you throw it away . Then happiness sets in . Working behind the scenes , SystemWorks ruined two of my Laptops used for important work -LRB- while I was in Europe -RRB- but did I understand , NO . I thought it was a Virus , but Virus Scans were negative and it turned out to be SystemWorks . Actually - I call it SystemDoes n'tWorks . Easy my foot ! If you have a problem during installation , give up fast . I spent days on this but , since there are no options -LRB- to make it EASY to use there are no options or controls -RRB- once it decides not to allow installation , there is no appeal process and no support from Norton . You just ca n't `` force installation ''
 I agree with the previous reviews . I have used Norton products for many years , but no more . SystemWorks 2003 was disappointing enough , but the 2004 edition is worse when it comes to installation and disruption of your computer . Now we also have the major annoyance of product activation on top of Symantac 's notoriously bad service and support . Definitely do not buy this .
 I have been attempting since November 18th to recover from my installation of NSW 2004 and Norton Firewall 2004 . I have been using Norton Utilities/suites since about 1985 , but never again . I had a perfectly good installation of NSW and Firewall 2001 , but thought it was about time for me to upgrade . Looks like I should have sought out some of the early reviews ; I would never have changed . In any case , after nearly a week of fixing things , I am at least back to where the computer no longer gives me frequent blue screen crashes , freezes , slow/no shutdown , etc. . Also , even after a good shutdown , I often got an incomplete Windows ME load , and would have to do a power switch shutdown and recover . Norton GOBack was installed , and later removed , as whenever Disk Doctor or Speed Disk are run , Norton recommends disabling GoBack , which clears the restore history files . Of what use is this program ? NSW is also a resource hog . I have 512MB of RAM , and the installation took me down to 47 % resources free . I have had to trim out the startup files to get up to about 78 % free , and , when later running Norton programs , there is a lot of memory leakage that lowers the free resources . My other applications seemed to work about as fast as usual , but Norton programs themselves seemed quite slow . This has been a big disappointment . I am not sure I have fixed this thing yet , but I have had two successful restarts without fatal exception errors on startup . I seem to recall in the Symantec EULA it said that if the user was dis-satisfied with the product they could get a refund within 60 days of purchase . I am going to check this out , and if problems continue , uninstall the product and request a refund . My recommendation
 Remember the old days when installing a Norton product meant peace of mind , high expectations which were typically fulfilled , and an overall feeling that you were utilizing the best system software on the market ? Yeah , me too.I 've been a fan of Norton products for years . My recent purchase of SystemWorks 2004 , however , has abruptly ended my admiration of Norton products.After installing this software , my system has realized a decrease in performance of , I 'd say , about 500 % . This suite is a substantial memory hog . Furthermore , I 've somehow lost the ability to access my WD 100GB HDD -LRB- `` Drive D is not formated . Format now ? '' Yeah right -RRB- . Every program on my system hesitates many times during it 's operation . Also , expect significantly longer boot-up and shut-down times.After a little deliberation , I decided to uninstall the program . Does Norton include an uninstaller ? Of course not . Their `` help '' information directs me to use the `` Add/Remove Programs '' built into XP . Guess What ? That no longer works either . Thanks Norton . The result - Format C
 This product is absolutely horrible . I bought five update copies for my office since I was very happy with the previous version . I have had nothing but trouble and ca n't get help ! Worse , when you need technical support , they will CHARGE YOU unless you ask your question by email . Then , you get a lame response from an offshore support operation . Do yourself a favor and do not buy this !!
 This program bites . Loaded it up and it would n't run . Went to the Symantec web site and sure they knew about it but gave no fix that worked for me . I used to love the Norton line but this one has soured my outlook on them.AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!
 Norton user since the early 90s . Probably ex-user now . - Activation * grrrr * - wo n't LiveUpdate - getting error msg . ` net connection OK tho . - Will demand the CD again and again when nothing has been changed . Installs maybe 2 byte - whatever . - Slows down computer to a crawl . - NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE V2003 ! I mean , goodies like Processviewer and Passwordthingy are nice , but besides that it 's exactly like 2003 with the year number changed :-LRB- - Does n't even uninstall completely.System
 looks nice , however you should be aware of the following problems _ before _ you buy .1 -RRB- It slows down your system to about 1/2 the previous speed if you enable all the options .2 -RRB- password manager although nice idea - breaks when you log in to many web pages with a password .3 -RRB- ghost does not work at all with drives that have a bad sector -LRB- most drives over a year old ! -RRB- 4 -RRB- there is NO support from symantec unless you pay per incident5 -RRB- the norton utilites for recovering disk files , basically just run good old chkdsk6 -RRB- disk editor is missing from this distribution7 -RRB- content blocking takes a long time to load up8 -RRB- and of course my favorite is ... the `` liveupdate '' settings file will continually corrupt itself every couple of weeks.I have this same problem on many systems I 've tried this on.I vote NO , keep your money and get something else .
 ZERO RATING !! I have used Norton products from the Windows 3.1 days . I have used Norton Systemworks -LRB- NSW -RRB- and Norton Antivirus -LRB- NAV -RRB- since 1997 ... I guess from Systemworks version 1.0 !! My complaint is not about installation issues or incompatibilities with other pieces of software , or even memory hogging issues . Over the years I have learnt to fine-tune NSW to make it work for me . And in the 15-20 times that I have installed NSW , I have had to do only 2 manual uninstalls -LRB- NSW v. 2.2 ... I think ! -RRB- . A little painful , but I got it working.My complaint is that NORTON ANTIVIRUS DOES NOT WORK !!!! BACKGROUND : I needed some partitioning software . Partition Magic -LRB- PM -RRB- -LRB- Another Symantec product , though in all fairness I had this issue last year too when Powerquest owned PM -RRB- had just botched up a 3 step partition routine . I was trying to see if there was any freeware/shareware I could use.MY EXPERIENCE : I updated NAV with the latest definitions and proceeded to download . I downloaded this partition software and ran the zip folder through NAV . NO virus detected ! I then extracted the files and ran the extracted files through NAV . NO virus detected ! I ran the install , but nothing happened , I ran it again and nothing happened . I clicked on `` windows search '' and it gave me an error message . I suspected that I had been infected . I went to Mcafee and ran their FreeScan software , within the first 5000 files they had detected a few instances of Trojan Horse `` Exploit-MHTRedir '' and of a dropper program `` Multidropper-jz '' . I let the scan complete . I did not have a Mcafee product or subscription , so was unable to delete the virus.I was confident that NAV would pick up these infections and clean them out . I ran NAV scan , BUT IT DID NOT PICK UP THESE TROJAN HORSES . I was SHOCKED !! I thought , `` Hey ! Maybe Symantec does not update the `` LiveUpdate definitions '' everyday . Let me try using the Norton web-scan similar to Mcafee 's FreeScan . It scanned and came up with NADA ! Nothing !! I thought , well , let me just look up the virus library , pickup the definitions and apply them manually . This was the SHOCKER !! Symantec acknowledged the existence of these viruses and based on the dates of the virus definitions -LRB- April 06 , 2004 -RRB- , and my frequency of updates , I should have had protection against these viruses.I was in total shock ... I was living in false security . I had trusted this company to look after me and my data , but it let me down . I will NEVER , EVER PURCHASE a Symantec product again !!!! MCAFEE EXPERIENCE : On the Mcafee side , they had these Trojan Horses as well as the `` droppers '' and their variants listed in detail -LRB- compared to Symantec 's one generic listing -RRB- . On the Mcafee Scan , I noticed that one of the droppers was tagged to IE and so decided to go with a retail copy of Mcafee , I drove down to my local Walmart at 11.30 pm -LRB- I am kinda ' obsessive , compulsive !! -RRB- and picked up a copy . I installed it , but I could not get the latest updates.I dialed into their chat service and , WOW ! I was connected to one of their agents instantly . Within 5 minutes I had got instructions to uninstall Mcafee , download the latest definitions and run a DOS Scan.I followed the instructions and half-hour later , I got a report saying that 6 instances of Trojan Horses and dropper variants had been cleaned from my system . I Googled for the virus and noticed that the dropper could drop an instance each time a browser was opened ... that might account for the new instances!Norton Anti-Virus is USELESS . VERY , VERY DISAPPOINTING !!! NEVER AGAIN !!!!
 I have used Norton systemmworks to keep my hard drive operating . I backed up my hard drive 3 times with Ghost but when I needed to restore the hard drive , each of the ghost images failed with an error 437 . There was no warning that the images might not be able to restore the hard drive and once you begin to restore the image , the hard drive is wiped clean . AVOID THIS PRODUCT . AVOID THE GHOST BACKUPS .
 NSW 2004 Disabled my Earthlink Total Access . After a week of having to do a quick restore on my Windows 98 , my computer sloooowing way down , improper shutdowns , freezing screens , etc. etc. , I seemed to get it all working . But what an unnecessary load of grief !!! I un-installed NSW 2004 then re-installed with a custom installation leaving out the Password Manager . This may have been the problem . My internet access was functioning again after I did this . I will probably be a lot more careful before choosing a product and read reviews , be aware of return policies . I jumped the gun on this one . Norton got the best of me this time , but there wo n't be a next . I will be watching out for a better product/company .
 I have NIS on 3 PCs and one Mac . All installed and worked fine . Had an opportunity to buy NIS 2004 Pro cheap -LRB- after rebates -RRB- the big shopping day after Thanksgiving . Spent two days trying to install 2004 Pro on a newer Dell running XP . I do know how to clean out the old stuff . Spent 30 minutes on telephone with Symantec IT who led me thru 20 reconfigure steps for my puter . Never did work . . Talked to local IT rep who says Symantec `` Microsofted '' the buyers . Product full of crap . Removed all 2004 and reinstalled NIS 2003 without a hitch . Anyone want to buy 2 copies of NIS 2004 Pro cheap ?
 I 've used Norton Systemworks for years so well acquainted with installation process . It hung up on the opening screen when `` next '' button would n't work . I was unable to find a phone number for tech/installation services . I could still access the Internet but java script errors prevented loading some sites . Then I discovered major problems with my OS -LRB- XP Home -RRB- . This involved 6 to 8 hours on phone with Dell -LRB- at least they were accessible -RRB- and finally reinstalling my entire operating -LRB- we tried a repair first -RRB- system . Now I am having to reinstall all programs and backups but you can be sure Norton Systemworks would n't be one of them . I finally got a response from Norton 's registration department -LRB- only e-mail address I could find -RRB- which suggested I run the program from safe mode . NO THANK YOU !
 In years past , I would never run a Mac or PC system without Norton Utilities or SystemWorks . Things started looking bad with NSW 2002 and 2003 ... Very little improvement , higher prices . With NSW 2004 , Symantec has effectively killed any reason for anyone to use this now-useless software . If you want hard drive imaging , buy Ghost standalone . If you want anti-virus protection , buy Norton AV standalone . Stay away from NSW . Even if you can manage to get the product activated -LRB- I could n't -RRB- , it will bog down your system with tons of memory-resident and background applications .
 Now I bought this suite because I have been using symantec products for past 3 years and have been satisfied with performance . Also for the amounth of utilites in the package it 's a good priceWell I do n't know who was coding this years version of Anti virus because I 'm getting so many issues with outlook xp not being able to connect to pop3 email server . I 'm using windows 2K pro and according to Microsoft I have to uninstall and reinstall antivirus program every time this goes down , it would n't be a big deal if it happened once a month but it happens at least once a week . It 's impossible to get an messages unless it 's from someone I know because the anti-virus konks out all the time . The Anitvirus software has turned into a productivity killer for me.Next time I 'm reading reviews in Computer Shopper or PCWorld before I but another Symantic product.There 's better utility software out there do n't make the same mistake I did .
 The term `` Easy '' in the ads really means uncontrollable and what support - ooops , they do support you for 40 bucks - my word that 's close to what this software costs !? So you buy it once and then over and over again , until you throw it away . Then happiness sets in . Actually - I call it SystemDOES N'Tworks . Easy my foot . They have no incentive to make it a better product , then who would buy support ? Come on guys , why not support installation for free ?
 I have been trying for weeks to get presale information on this product and every single email has gone unanswered . This company is only interested in your money , not your satisfaction . Look elsewhere . Check out V Communications -LRB- http://www.v-com.com -RRB- for similar products and MUCH better support.UPDATE
 This software conflicts with Easy CD DVD Creator 6 , but to find that out is not easy . After six hours on the phone -LRB- mostly spent waiting -RRB- , their tech support finally revealed this . Read other reviews on the ` net !! Installation of both on your computer may corrupt registry files !! I had to re-format the drive and re-install software . Then , when trying to re-activate NSW 2004 , the fun began with their lack of support . Repeated attempts by Symantec to re-activate the software have been 100 % unsuccessful . Both Symantec customer and tech ` support ' are basically unavailable due to high load . Extremely frustrating to deal with . I am switching to McAfee and hoping for the best ...
 This current retail version is full of problems during installation . On my Win2000 Pro system , I got errors during the install which had corrections available from LiveUpdate . Unfortunately , the install causes the system to reboot and then the computer ` blue-screens ' . This is caused by having Anti-virus active at startup along with Personal Firewall , apparently . The only way to get around this is to bring up the computer in Safe Mode , deactivate the Antivirus at startup option . Then re-start . After running Liveupdate the problem still existed so I uninstalled it.Don ' t even think of using it on a WinME machine !!! Systemworks 2004 installed -LRB- apparently -RRB- but literally slowed the system to a crawl - and I mean a CRAWL . 90 seconds to have the Start button respond ! In addition , the install performed an uninstall of Norton SystemWorks 2002 -LRB- which had been running just fine -RRB- and now that will not re-install without going thru a 10page manual uninstall requiring extensive manual editing of the registry . A non-IT person does n't have a chance of understanding this junk.Symantec may be the premiere virus fixers but they provide the worst install/uninstall mechanism I 've ever seen . You can literally trash your computer trying to get rid of their software.To add insult to injury , there is no free support - you must PAY to talk to a human
 I 've discovered two new threats ... W32.SymantecNIS2004Pro.Worm and W32.SymantecNSW2004Pro.WormSymptoms are not being able to connect to the internet , login to your personal firewall , run your anti-virus program , or scan your emails from viruses.Removal of both of these is extremely difficult . There are a few removal tools out there -LRB- all of which do n't work completely -RRB- and conflicting advice from the Symantec Knowledge Base and live Technical Support . You will be required to alter registry files yourself and search for hidden files so you can manually delete them . Symptoms can develop right after installation of Symantec programs , or even a few days from then -LRB- it varies ... how interesting -RRB- . Please be aware that even after uninstalling all Symantec products using Add/Remove Programs -LRB- which by the way , probably wo n't work , it varies ... how interesting -RRB- there will still be 24-73 Symantec files still residing on your computer -LRB- it varies ... how interesting -RRB- . These files may still interfere with your normal computer use , such as using the Help & Support features of your OS or computer manufacturer . The last few remaining files are extremely difficult to remove as you can not delete them yourself even after doing a Selective System Startup , loading only Microsoft System Services.The best protection against this threat is ... once you finally get all Symantec products removed from your computer to never install one of their products again . Be careful , distribution of this threat is very high and can you believe people actually pay for the threat ? For even further protection ... visit http://www.mcafee.com
 Installed evaluation version available from symantecs website . Before installing , it performs a system test and always freezes my machine at about 32000 files.A progress bar is also missing . Scanning takes about 1.5 hours so far , but it wo n't tell how many files are left to scan .
 I downloaded systemworks and now my computer worse . My computer does not shut itself down correctly anymore . What a mess !
 Having used the Norton Utilities since Peter Norton first brought them out , I am abandoning them . The other reviews on this page describe the problems with them , which get worse with each `` upgrade . '' Symantec is following McAfee 's lead
 I would stick with NSW 2003 Pro and not just because of the product activation . Too many problems with the installed Norton Antivirus -LRB- NAV -RRB- 2004 . What is irritating is that Symantec knows there are specific problems with the auto protect feature in NAV 2004 , but you do not get the error message until it 's installed . You 're then linked to their website to check specific settings in Windows -LRB- I 'm using XP Pro -RRB- . Then if that does n't work , there is a another set of steps they recommend including uninstalling and reinstalling systemworks , cleanbooting , etc.In my setup , NSW 2004 Pro had to be installed before the Zonealarm firewall . The auto protect feature in NAV 2004 would not activate if you installed NSW 2004 Pro after Zonealarm . You would get a specific error message and be linked to the Symantec website to go through all those steps mentioned previously . If those steps did n't work , then they wanted you to go through an uninstall/reinstall . By the time you get through -LRB- and it still does n't work -RRB- , you 've just had it . In another case , the auto protect feature in NAV was disabled by the installation of a Creative Audigy 2 ZS sound card . I went back to NSW 2003 Pro which includes NAV 2003 and there were none of these problems .
 I have used Norton SystemWorks for years and have been very satisfied with it - until now . SystemWorks Pro 2004 really gummed up my system . So , I 'm sending it back . My advice is not to buy it unless , and until , you see a steady stream of positive comments here and on CNET.com .
 Well , as a Windows application programmer myself , I usually get any new software to work under 15 minutes . I was `` humbled '' by my experience with SystemWorks Pro . It would install fine , but unexpectedly exit right after the startup . No error messages , no warnings , nothing . Symantec knowledge base offered 4 various fix options -LRB- one of the most popular articles on the site ! -RRB- , but none of those worked . I guess the problem hit my `` vanity '' , so I sat there for the next hour or so until I solved it -LRB- basically removal of every trace of any other Symantec product from the XP system -RRB- . Finally , it worked . Unfortunately , once it started , it knocked-out my Outlook e-mail -LRB- `` server could not be located '' -RRB- . Turning off e-mail virus checking completely did NOT help the problem . LiveUpdate reported internal errors , so no chance of updating . That did it for me . Uninstalled and things are back to normal . Two stars instead of one because SpeedDisk actually worked .
 I rated this program as a one star only because there was no lower rating on the scale.I bought Systemworks 2004 and tried to install it last night . I tried it on my Windows XP partition and also on the Windows 98 partition with the same results each time . I have just finished restoring my computer 24 hours later.On the first install , it said it would overwrite Systemworks 2003 . I let it try . Almost all the way through , it gave an error message saying that it found Ghost and could not install over it . Then it completely uninstalled the entire program . I then removed Systemworks 2003 but found out later that their uninstalld does not remove all of it.Next try , installation started and then said that I have Antivirus 2002 on my computer . It was there 2 years ago but was replaced with NAV 2003 a year ago . It asked for disk `` Antivirus Label '' whatever that is . Not having ever owned any such disk , I could not provide it . Systemworks then unstalled everything again.When I tried to run my computer after all this , Explorer would not open folders and the computer locked up.I have used their products since 1986 and this is the worst piece of garbage that I ever wasted my money on .
 This is the single worst software purchase I have ever made . I bought Norton 2004 Professional because of Norton 's reputation and a good mail-in-rebate offer . After following all pre-installation instructions , the software crashed during installation . After following all uninstall/reinstall instructions , same problem . After following all Symantec online tech support instructions , same problem . After emailing Symantec for support -LRB- and changing so many settings on my computer that I 'm pretty sure its even more vulnerable than before I started -RRB- , same problem . BTW , Symantec says it will respond w/in 48 hours , more like 4 to 8 days per correspondence . I have now spent way more time than any rebate is worth , still do n't have protection and Symantec wants to charge me about $ 40 to actually talk to a support person by phone . Lastly , after giving up on the disc software I purchased , I downloaded the trial version . It worked great . Only problem , the product code I paid for ca n't be used to activate the trial software . -LRB- Why ? Because that 's Symantec 's policy , that 's why . -RRB- So , I 'm stuck with a trial version that expires in 15 days , but I ca n't activate it without paying for the software twice . HORRIBLE ! AVOID AT ALL COSTS !
 NSW 2004 Pro consists of few changes from the 2003 version -LRB- for example , Ghost is still v. 2003 -RRB- except for in Antivirus 2004 . Like others , I have been frustrated by the problems that Norton Antivirus 2004 creates on my system -LRB- dual P4 1.7 Ghz CPUs , 1 GB RDRAM , so speed should n't be a problem -RRB- . It conflicts with several other programs , causes the system to hang , requiring a reboot , and is generally a pain . I ` vbe tried turning off some of the new scans it does for adware , etc. , but that does n't fully fix the problems . NAV 2003 worked great . It 's bad enough having to activate the product . I wish I had stayed with NSW2003 and bought another year of virus definition updates , as I ended up uninstalling this piece of junk and reintsalling NSW2003 . On the bright side , the uninstall seems to have clean up my registry enough that NSW2003 shows another year of virus definition subscription .
 In the case of Norton Systemworks 2004 Professional , as the years pass and the version numbers are incremented , the software actually get worse . And now , it has come to a point where Norton SystemWorks 2004 Professional should not be used at all . With the exception of Norton Ghost , which can be pretty useful , the rest of the product suite is a complete waste . Why ? you ask . . Ok .1 -RRB- NSW2004Pro is heavy , slow , and at full install requires significant system resources , even when you manually configure the OS/System 's services to stop the auto-start of unnecessary crap . It WILL degrade the overall performance of your system and the benefits -LRB- only one , Ghost -RRB- you gain from it are not worth the expense .2 -RRB- If you install NSW2004Pro , you will NOT be able to change your computer performance settings for virtual memory allocation . What ? That 's right . NSW2004Pro consistently and persistently overrides your manual configurations and sets the virtual memory to the OS/System recommended values . There is NO way around this.I can go on and on about this horrible software product . I really recommend that you look for other solutions . I wo n't suggest any , I 'm sure you 'll be able to research that on your own . I would n't want you to think I work for a competitor to Norton .
 I was very dissapointed with this product . After installing and running SystemWorks , I noticed every application I run on my computer had slowed down considerably . There was constant hard drive activity , even doing somthing as simple as navigating the programs menu under windows . I also noticed my firewall reporting that windows messenger was accessing the internet in the background , which it had never done prior to installing this software -LRB- why did it need to do that ? -RRB- . If it didnt slow my system down so much I may have kept using it , but it was to much of a performance hit . I will say on a positive note , it uninstalled nicely.btw , system specs are an AthlonXP 2400 , 512 ram , Geforce4 ti4200 .
 I 've used Norton products since the early 90s and have to say that Symantec is a company that buys well known products to generate revenue but the products quality is run into the ground . Every year they come up with a new excuse to introduce a `` new '' version and 2004 is that last I will every buy . It 's not only even slower -LRB- the virus scanning especially -RRB- , more bloated and adds nothing from 2003 , but it also does n't work as well . Recovering files is totally worthless . I also found out about horrible Symantec support as 2004 now includes copy protection keys . Even after registering the product , if you lose the key -LRB- or became unreadable in my case , they refuse to provide your customer information and will charge you $ 25 to send you a new CD you do n't need ! Incredible , but true . I own Powerquest products which were just bought by Symantec and replace `` Ghost '' but does n't work well either . I have since moved to other antivirus products that are much leaner , faster and do their jobs well and have continued development . Oh yeah , 2004 has been incompatible with XP SP2 now for a while . Stay far away from Symantec . There is a reason why Norton products are getting panned virtually everywhere by actual users and ` praised ' by a few commercial reviewers .
 Most software you buy allows you to install it twice if you own both a desktop and a laptop system . Microsoft allows this for example.Symantec however does not . Their website did not address the issue so and e-mail to customer service earned this reply : `` please be informed that in order to install Norton SystemWorks -LRB- NSW -RRB- 2004 on two computers , you should have two user licenses . `` I do n't know about you , but I am not paying 2x the money to protect both my laptop and desktop . I will seek out alternatives to Symantec and so should you .
 What a disappointment ! I was * very * happy with Norton 's Sytemworks 2003 - it worked really smoothly and transparently . My subscription was ending so I thought I 'd upgrade to 2004 . BIG mistake . It completely gummed up my otherwise zippy system . Everything slowed to a crawl , from start up down even to ordinary text editing . I have no idea what it was doing , but I 'd type something and the cursor was in some sort of time warp , about three centuries behind . Navigation through a document was even worse
 This was my third try of the SystemWorks -LRB- after 2001 and 2002 versions -RRB- , and my impression is still the same . It is not worth the hassle of installing and configuring each component and seeing substantial slowing of your machine . I always find it easier to do a fresh installation of Windows a couple of times a year than to suffer with a bogged down machine running SystemWorks . If you are not happy with this product , return it and get your money back .
 I 'm amazed this product gets such good reviews by the experts . I have a modicum of experience with computers and software and am unable to recommend SystemWorks.Like others , I 've had nothing but problems with Norton/Symantec Products . I 've had to re-format my hard drive on more than one occasion for issues I felt Symantec not only caused but should have been able to prevent -LRB- the problems can be found on their website and were known issues prior to my version of the product -RRB- . No free tech support -- not even for installation issues which I have found to be frequent . Advise against the purchase of this product !
 I have used Norton products for years with great success . But now I have an ME machine that I can not use Windows Explorer because it locks up . I have to boot the machine 4 or 5 time to get it to come up properly only to have it lock up in Explorer . All of this started since I installed the NSW 2004 version.Customer service tells me that one of my programs is interfering with nprotect , but it is the other way around . It is their product that is interfering with my other software , and it wo n't uninstall.I tried their cumbersome manual method of uninstalling the software but it did n't work . There is no way to get this product off my machine except a total rebuild of the hard drive.Norton had some great products but I guess they just got too greedy with the annual upgrades .
 More than being very disappointed with this software , I am extremely disappointed with Symmantec 's customer service and support , which is basically nonexistent unless you pay them almost as much as you paid for the software in the first place . -LRB- They also outsource all their technical help and it is often VERY hard to understand the person who you are paying -LRB- dearly -RRB- to help you . Even worse is to be told that you must uninstall other manufacturers ' software , or even other Symmantec software before this software will run properly . There is a lot of good `` Utility '' software on the market from companies with good support . Because of that , I will never purchase software from Symmantec again .
 I used Norton Systemworks 2001 on my old laptop with Windows 1998 . Considering the laptop was second-hand when I bought it in March 2000 , had 2GB hard-drive , 40mb RAM and a Pentium 133MHz processor - I gave the credit to Norton for making it last until February of this year . And even then , it was the screen that went on it . I bought a new laptop shortly afterwards , and as I had so much sucess with Norton Systemworks 2001 , I thought I would treat myself to the latest version , and bought Norton Systemworks Pro 2004 . I had no problem installing the software , and enjoyed seeing familar features like the one-button check-up . However , I noticed a considerable decrease in performance on my laptop -LRB- Inspiron 8600 -RRB- after the installation . It seemed to take twice as long to start-up and shut-down , and programs took longer to load . DVDs etc. did not seem to run as smoothly , and the computer seemed to revert to a lower spec in terms of it 's overall performance - which was not my intention at all . I made a mistake by not reading reviews prior to purchasing the product , and being blinded by my experiences of previous Norton products . I have since uninstalled the software -LRB- I encountered no problems here either -RRB- and asked for a refund from Symantec . I am pleased to say that the computer 's performance has returned to normal . Perhaps Norton should go back to the drawing-board here - and rather than try and adapt their software to Windows XP and higher spec systems , completely start from scratch . I think that after reading most of these reviews , a change of name for this product might be the best thing for Norton 's reputation !
 I have to agree with the reviews listed here . I 've used Symantec products for over 10 years , this version stinks . Very large , slow running programs , plenty of General Protection Faults and it destroyed my standard Microsoft Solitaire -LRB- SOL.exe -RRB- game . Something bad has happened with the 2004 versions , I 'm sending it back and trying to re-install NAV 2003 .
 i received it really fast and in good condition ... u can not see the down and across clue at the same time , controls hard to work ...
 Do NOT buy ANY Symantec Product UNLESS YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A NEED FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE - THERE IS NONE ! I have just spent 4 hours AFTER HAVING PAID for SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL to my firewall trying to get my renewal activated . After going through 15 menus on-line to try and email customer service , I was given a form . I entered the info . When I finally got an email response , it had nothing to do with my question , then told me if it did n't help , I would have to REPEAT THE ENTIRE ON-LINE Process ! I then called their `` Customer Service '' line - PUT ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES ! Finally had to redo renewal by phone without answer to question . This is typical of ANY NORTON PRODUCT CUSTOMER SERVICE !
 I have used Norton products for years , and find SystemWorks to be comprehensive and very effective -LRB- especially AntiVirus -RRB- . SystemWorks 2004 is no exception
 Be aware - there is not a $ 100 rebate for this product . The $ 35 rebates are identical and you also must provide proof of purchase , or UPCs from each box . So , since there are 3 rebate forms and only 2 sets of proof of purchase items -LRB- one set of UPCs and one set on the inside of the boxes -RRB- , you will not qualify.I verified this with Symantec who claims this is a mistake.Does anyone know different ?
 I would not recommend this software to my worst enemy . When I used its diagnostic and repair software it made the computer worse , rather than making it run faster . It has some weird file rearrangement program , that is obviously antithetical to Microsoft . The last straw was when it would n't let me access my ISP to use the internet . The crowning touch was when Amazon.Com charged me a $ 40 restocking fee , after I returned the damn thing .
 I 'm using Windows 98 SE and have run Norton antivirus 2000 for several years and was very happy . Then a very dark cloud appeared - it was called Norton Personal Firewall 2004 . I had to clean my hard drive for other reasons and when I reloaded everything I decided to get rid of my old firewall , Black Ice and install Norton 's new Firewall 2004 . After I reloaded everything and got back up running the computer speed gradually became slower and slower until it virtually stopped . After discussion with several experts I decided to uninstall both the 2000 and 2004 Norton versions . I did reinstall Nortons Antivirus 2000 and got a new firewall , Zone Alarm . The computer runs just fine . I am not a computer expert , but it seems to me that Nortons Firewall 2004 did something very naughty to my computer , and my blood pressure . I would not recommend Norton 's Personal Firewall 2004 to my enemies .
 This is a follow-up to my earlier troubles following installation of Norton Firewall 2004 . After two completely lost days at work - and $ 200 in consulting tech support - trying to sort the problem out , we solved it . If you are unable to defrag your hard drive , or use your `` A '' drive or CD-ROM like I experienced , then you must UNINSTALL ALL REFERENCES TO NORTON , not simply Firewall 2004 , and then reboot ! Although I had already installed , and was quite happy with , Norton Antivirus , Symantec 's software integration `` feature '' when adding Firewall 2004 apparently left hooks in my computer to render it problematic . Once uninstalled - and I mean COMPLETELY - then everything worked fine . After uninstalling , search for any reference to Norton or Symantec , then delete any and all . Later , I downloaded the free version of Zero Alarm 's Firewall and it works great ! Very user friendly , intuitive , seems to work as advertised , and FREE ! Do n't waste your money -LRB- and TIME ! -RRB- with Norton 's version .
 After having such a great experience with Nortion Antivirus over the last several years , I just assumed that Norton would have a good firewall program too . I was wrong . First and most irritating , my computer became extremely slow on start up after installing the program -LRB- adding about 4 - 5 minutes ! -RRB- , despite having a new computer with more than enough drive space and RAM . I removed the program for awhile and regained normal start up speed . Second , the popup warnings are a mixed benefit . While it does block some obviously bad attempts to access my computer , I sometimes have to tell it 10 or 15 times within a few minutes to allow access from permissable sources even though I am clicking `` always allow '' access from this source . Third , the privacy blocker seems like a good idea -LRB- you enter in your private info that you do not want sent over the computer such as your home address , phone , etc -RRB- , but I had to turn that feature off when I tried to make a purchase on-line DESPITE clicking `` ALLOW '' about 20 times . The warning window repeatedly popped up every time I clicked allow . The program just did n't get it . I keep checking the Norton website for patches , but to date there are none . Today I was so fed up with the slow start up that I removed the program again . So much for my $ 50.00 ... I say it 's worth about $ 5.00
 WHY did I ignore the fatal customer reviews on this shameful product ?!! After installing , my DSL internet would n't work , but I fixed it by turning OFF Norton Firewall 2004 . But now , even after uninstalling completely -LRB- I think -RRB- , not only can I not defrag my hard drive , I CA N'T EVEN ACCESS EITHER OF MY TWO CD-ROMS !! I ca n't read ANY of my program CD 's - including Windows 2000 Pro OS - but wierdly it lets me play audio CD 's . Maybe this is so that I can play a sad music until I figure this mess out . I 'm just hoping that after submitting my feedback on this wretched software that I can find a fix from one of the other hapless customers who also made the mistake of purchasing it . Can you help ? Thanks .
 BIG FAT risk writing this . Read on to see why.As a designer , I 've been using my Anti-Virus and Firewall with NO problems for a while now . As I do every morning , I get online and check for Norton updates -LRB- especially Virus Definitions -RRB- . So , about two weeks ago , I load in a bucket-load , only to find my perfectly-tuned work machine slowing like an F1 car running out of fuel at Monaco!Now I ca n't see ANY webpages WITHOUT disaabling my Firewall - DESPITE granting IE/Opera/Mozilla net access SEVERAL TIMES.When I do connect with Firewall enabled , I get attacked with heaps of twats using trojans . But I ca n't see any web sites . There 's absolutely NO CHANGES made to an already successful set-up , so WHAT 'S GOING ON SYMANTEC ???????? Every time I go online , I 'm comprimised . What sort of Firewall is that ???? I 'll be buggered if I 'm going to spend more cash simply because you ca n't be bothered to support 2002 users with this software . I have paid for my updates until October 2004 ! I 've also had a heap of customers with this new 2004 Firewall/Ad Blocker installed saying the website I made does n't work ! It even blocks legitimate branding images on a web page as adverts ! It presents users , critically , with NO CHOICE and makes the job of legitimate enterprises and designers alike with a VERY business-biased veto option on what we see.I had the utmost respect for Symantec for years , then this!No support , then ` Sorry , we did n't get $ 50 out of you this year , go swim ! ` Atrocious . Get something else !
 Update
 I have been loyal to Norton for almost a decade . I am now looking for a new provider of security services.Positive-NAV seems to be working ok -LRB- so 1 star -RRB- Negative-the abusive activation schemethe bundled trash programs -LRB- FIREWALL , etc. -RRB- -LRB- deserves minus stars and circular file -RRB- Firewall will 100 % protect you from internet intrusion and infection , because it cuts you off from the internet . It is very user unfriendly , it does n't provide adequate support -LRB- It cuts you off from the internet , the manual is useless and the ONLY source of help provided is an internet address !!!!!!!!! -RRB- An example of the stupid controls
 After many years of using Norton Antivirus I figured I could n't go wrong . I was already using ZoneAlarm 's shareware firewall and I decided that Norton would be the real deal . What a mistake . This program simply is too difficult to understand to find out whether it indeed could work . It seems far less flexible than programs that are given away for free.If you want an idea of what others think of this piece of garbage check out ebay . You can buy earlier versions for less than the cost of shipping ! One of their competitors will give you $ 10 rebate for the disc . It 's more than you will get from anyone else . Do n't waste your money.Be advised that once you register this baby Norton will try to trick you into a subscription every time you renew Norton Antivirus . And they will ignore your attempts to get the charges reversed .
 After having a hacker leave a virus on my computer , I finally decided I need some protection . I went back and forth between getting a firewall or a router . Routers were pricier , so I looked at reviews for firewall software . If you look too , you 'll notice none of them on Amazon get fantastic reviews . They have some serious potential to screw up your system . I figured that I have Norton AntiVirus , so their firewall should work fine . Plus , I get a discount since I have another product of theirs . I bought and installed it . Once that was done , I realized that to get the discount I need proof that I own the earlier product . Good luck getting proof of ownership from a downloaded product . I 'm pretty sure that 's a dead end.Like many others , though , it really screwed up my system . I get 5 - 10 error screens I have to Enter through when booting up , nothing is loaded in my system tray , peripherals ca n't be found , and it hangs on shutdown . Oh , and the firewall program says it is disabled . Why ? Who knows . But when I go to enable it it says that I do n't have the necessary rights/priviledges etc. to do so . I 'm the only user on the computer . How can that be ? Again , who knows . Maybe Symantec , but I ai n't paying $ 30 to call them.The best part to this whole thing is that the hacker who originally acessed my system did n't really do any damage . I had to pay 50 bucks for my `` protection '' to really screw me over.Thanks , Symantec . Get bent .
 I upgraded from Norton Personal Firewall 2003 , which was working fine . Now I can not access the Internet without disabling my firewall.Zone Alarm is free , and Windows XP comes with a firewall . I 'm tired of having my computer corrupted by Norton Utilities and my Internet disabled by Norton Personal Firewall . I will not purchase any more Symantec products .
 This program has given me nothing but problems . I finally had to refomat my drive . They charge for telephone customer support . Save your money .
 After 5 faithfull years of norton i gave this load of stress one star , as it installed flawlessly thats about all i can say thats positive really.The program is not user friendly in any way shape or form , `` does anyone know what all these numbers mean '' , program control popup alerts are a pain in the a-se , they ask you to make a decision to allow or not but dont tell you what they are , its just way too clever for me ! and with no way to disable them its annoying , also in this day of privacy it keeps way to many logs . I suppose its a pity i registered it so i cant sell the over-complicated load of cr-p , `` good job i got it cheap '' im just going to sling it in the the bin and buy z-alarm pro . DUH
 This product if full of defects , can not be installed easy , lot of headache and not phone support for customers . If you want for a new product customet support , they will ask you for 24.99 per incident ! They are crazy ! On line support ? yes , send a email 5 days ago , still no answer , and u can not find any phone # to talk with anyone .

 Bad uninstalls of previous Norton products can cause this one to hang and not install . No customer support -LRB- they promise to email you in 3-5 days ... -RRB- . No easy was to self-troubleshoot the problem -LRB- even though there are lots potential causes listed on the Customer Support web site -RRB- . I 've used and recommended Norton products for ten years , and will now switch to another brand . This was obviously released before it was fully developed .
 This is one program I wish I 'd never bought ! If I could rate it 0 stars , I would . I had nothing but problems after I installed it and System Works on my computer . My CD R/W drive stopped working , and I could no longer print from the Web.But even worse was the firewall itself . Even with it enhabled at the lowest settings , it prompted me one right after another about the inbound ICP addresses to the point where I could not do anything on the Internet . Even selecting Permit did not stop the onslaught of prompts . There was an option on 2002 that allowed you to turn the warnings off , but it was apparently either removed from this version or too well-hidden . Plus , there was no option to uninstall the program as in the earlier versions . Once I got it off my computer , all the problems I was having went away.With so many obvious bugs , it makes me wonder if they rushed to get it out without doing a thorough beta test .
 Recently bought new computer preloaded with Personal Firewall 2003 - had problems accessing some website features but was able to fix following excellent advice from ATT . Received message from Symantec saying my version should be upgraded to 2004 version - BIG mistake - can not access ANY website -LRB- including Symantec -RRB- with Firewall enabled - no matter what ! - no advice available from Symantec website -LRB- unless I pay $ 29.95 per call -RRB- - very unprofessional < Symantec - expected much better from you . Hope I can uninstall . Star rating - minus two .
 - Not a user-friendly program-Poorly oranized software-No configuration options at all-Impractical and slow unless you have a very fast CD drive
 Be warned that Convekta 's philosophy seems to be to produce chess software for COMPUTER profesionals rather that software for CHESS professionals or amateurs .
 First let me state that the Great Mind Store -LRB- who sells this product on Amazon -RRB- was great to work with . Mistakes were certainly made on their end -LRB- e.g. , shipped the wrong registration name and code TWICE -RRB- . After I made a heroic effort to try to get the registration process to work that first time , Great Mind admitted they sent the wrong code , resent new registration information , and refunded me $ 10 for my initial trouble . When I also could not get the second code to work for registering the product , I ran the software in `` trial mode '' because that was my only option while waiting for help with the second registration name & code error -LRB- a response to this second complaint never came -RRB- . Let me just say I had attempted to write my own code for an RSS Feed prior to purchasing this software and the only problem I kept having after I 'd load my legitimate RSS file into a Feed Validator -LRB- such as -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- was that the feed -LRB- from the handwritten code -RRB- always produced error messages in the Feed Validator . I bought the software to overcome the glitches.The FeedforAll wizard was easy enough to navigate through but the resultant RSS file was full of more ominous errors than my handwritten version . Trying to open the RSS proved futile -LRB- it could not be opened in any browser -- only saw error messages -RRB- . It did n't get a chance to submit the RSS to a Feed validator because not even FireFox could open the RSS . I wrote many emails requesting tech support and waited almost two weeks to get a reply that never came.I say `` thank you '' to the Great Mind Store for addressing this negative experience in a professional manner -LRB- and for refunding me the full purchase price -RRB- . Yet I 'm very disappointed with the software itself since it is so glitchy and only produced `` error '' messages in the browser . Trying it out proved to be a huge waste of my time . I now wonder if other reviewers on here work for Notepage , Inc -LRB- the FeedForAll company -RRB- because I had relied on their positive reviews to purchase this product in the first place.In short
 I 'm not usually one to give very negative feedback , but this purchase was a waste of our money.This training CD gives you no reason for what they are doing during the tutorials , no definition of what various processes mean , or how you could use any of the functions in your own work . It speaks using a text-to-speech computer voice , so it 's mind-numbing to listen to , and the video quality is sometimes difficult to view.Furthermore , the lessons are pieced together -LRB- possibly from prior versions ? -RRB- so not all of the sequences are in order and occasionally the file names are incorrect.I am going to buy the Total Training DVD 's and count this purchase as a loss .
 It 's a good thing there are none available . I brought it used and am unable to install it on my computer . I get an error message that does n't make sense , since I have already installed the ACT software required to support ACT ! LINK . I have e-mailed SAGE and got no response . Use caution when purchasing this version , as I believe the problem might be that ACT ! Link 2.0 for Use with QuickBooks is not compatable with QuickBooks Pro 2008 . I must add , my business partners have had no complaints . In fact they love it . Maybe I will too , if I ever get to use it .
 As an ACT ! Certified Consultant , I worked alongside the programmer that wrote this connector back in the day . Even if the latest `` ACT ! Link for use with QuickBooks 4.0 '' is not being sold or supported by Sage , you still are in luck . - There are several plug in solutions `` Sage ACT ! Link to QuickBooks '' although none are currently sold on Amazon.Where do you find it ? Search on the internet for plugin `` Sage ACT ! Link to QuickBooks '' or perhaps your local ACT consultant can help . BTW Integrations can be tricky - Even if you are DIY-minded I strongly recommend your review your contact data and make it as ` clean ' as possible on both databases . Also make sure they can ` talk ' to each other . This means the link needs recent and compatible versions of both QuickBooks and Sage ACT!It 's worth it -- get the wonderful boost to productivity !
 I bought this a couple of weeks ago . It is no longer available , but more importantly it does not work with Vista . Customer Support replied to my query simply by acknowledging that it does n't work with Vista and offering a 20 % discount on Spyder3 . At the very least , they should have suggested that I return the product for a refund .
 I 'm in the midst of auditioning LCD panels and the local ISF certified guy wants $ 350 per panel to calibrate them . I like TV and everything , but there 's just no way that I am going to spend $ 350 on TV that I might possibly keep.Still , the store settings on any two panels have two problems . First , they are amped up beyond compare as the TV vendors compete to be `` who 's the brightest '' on the lit showroom floor . Sitting in my living room , they are far far too bright to watch . Second , they display colors totally differently . It 's just hard to compare to 2 sets that are calibrated so differently.Now the TVs that we are looking at cost a pretty penny , and it seemed that a couple of hundred dollars to inform the decision was a good idea , just like the hundred dollars for an HDMI splitter seemed like a good idea . The splitter was a good idea , the Spyder TV Colormeter not so much.I calibrated 2 panels with this product . Two things are true about the calibrations . First , they do not look at all the same . The Sony panel has red shifted flesh tones while the Sharp looks cold and sterile . Second , they look way way worse than before the calibration . After 20 minutes of watching Casino Royale , it was time to revert back to a toned down version of the factory defaults for each.At first I thought that I had not followed the instructions right . Maybe it was not dark enough . Maybe the sensor was not positioned right . Having done the process several times , I can state categorically that while the colorvision Spyder TV may not deliver good results , it is consistent in its delivery of bad results.I simply can not recommend this product .
 Used on Sony Bravia LCD and got same results as factory default settings except for tint which was badly biased to red . Managed to get a better picture using trial and error -LRB- by varying things like backllight and sharpness which are not evaluated by spydertv -RRB- . Tech support is a joke . Do n't waste your money !
 The product has high potential . Unfortunately , tha same can not be said for the company , Colorvision . The hardware would appear to work fine . The software is problematic : -LRB- 1 -RRB- it does NOT work with Vista -LRB- 2 -RRB- it does not load completely with XP Professional -LRB- 3 -RRB- the web site patches do NOT work -LRB- 4 -RRB- the web site is difficult to navigate to -LRB- 5 -RRB- Customer Service is TERRIBLE ! unresponsive , indifferent , and if and when you do get a response it may have no relevance to your problemI returned the product out of frustration
 I have the same problem that Xrayman does.I was wondering if I had a faulty unit since it was an `` opened '' item and slightly discounted in the store where I bought it . I guess I 'm not the only one who has this problem . My TV is a Plasma , for whatever that 's worth . And I too found that the SpyderTV did not set things correctly . Color was much too saturated , and contrast and brightness were not correct . The only thing it did do was correctly choose the color temperature , which I do think is better than what I had it set to , so I 'm now using SpyderTV 's recommended color temp . But I reset everything else back to the settings I had already achieved by eye . I am going to try it out on an old CRT television and see if it works any better on that.My plasma is n't new , and I would recommend that people do not use this product on a new plasma . It requires you to put a bright white square up on your screen for far too long . I had to run through 15 color temperature settings , letting SpyderTV take a reading on each one , while leaving the bright square up . Took at least 7 minutes . That will temporarily burn the square into a new plasma screen . ... and might throw off the remaining measurements that have to be taken .
 This game is almost exactly like Horsez , which I have finished , but this game I bought but it does n't work on our two new computers , my mom 's old one does n't have any sound which is of no fault to the game , and my grandma 's computer cuts off half of the screen . But since Horsez and this game are exactly alike , I 'd like to give some hints . For Ginger 's present , you have to pick up the chess peice first , then pick up the phone number , but DO NOT MAKE THE CALL YET ! No you have to go outside and into the director 's office , which is near the front gate . It 's a little sliver of black on the left side of the wall . On the desk there 's a key . now you go to the library and get the key to the attic room . Now you go into your room which is the door by the staircase . Now you call the phone by the chess board . You now go up the stairs and into the door on the right . Now how to get into Esteban 's room . First when you 're in the library , you go out of the big circular window it 's pretty straightforward where to go from there , once you 're in the room , you go down the elevator and through the door to the right . You 'll see Spike and the safe is in that room . Talk to Spike and he 'll give you a clue . Next you go out the door down the hallway and take a left I think you 'll be in your room and Ginger will be there . Otherwise you 'll be in the lounge where Kiew is . Anyway talk to Ginger and she 'll give you another clue . I forgot how to get to the lounge , but in there you 'll find Kiew , you have to talk to her last otherwise she wo n't give you a clue . Now you go back to the director 's office and use the clues to figure out the code . In Horsez it 's 4224 , but it could be different in Champion Dreams , I might be giving completely wrong directions , anyway , in Horsez , once you enter the code you get the key card . Esteban 's room is through the door that 's down the hallway that leads you to the office and to the right . In there there 'll be a bag on the couch , search through the bag and you 'll find what you 're looking for .
 This is n't the best game . It does n't have particularly good graphics , and gets boring after awhile . First , you pick your horse out of the choices that they provide , which are pretty much a palomino , a creamello , which is pretty much a lighter palomino , a bay , a black , a skewbald -LRB- which is a pinto with black and white splotches -RRB- a palomino pinto , and that 's pretty much it . For some reason they call these `` breeds '' in the beginning , but near the end , no matter what breed you chose , they say that your horse is a thoroughbred . The basic shape of the horses are exactly the same , and have no distinguishing features at all . They all look the same , except for the color . You also pick out your character 's name , and your horse 's name , which actually does n't matter in the game , so there 's no reason to put the question there anyways . It would really be nice if you could customize your character in any more ways than changing hair color and clothing . Then you watch a couple videos that explain why you 're where you are , and then you have a schedule that you have to follow . For the first couple of days , you have to do the schedule that they plan out for you , but after that you can do what you want , except you ca n't change anything after the first period . You also discover that there 's a voice in your head called Elsys and it explains what to do and occasionally how to do it . You do three events , dressage , showjumping and cross country . You 'll find that the jumping -LRB- showjumping and cross country -RRB- is fun at first , but it gets increasingly more challenging until it 's just frustrating . You also might find that you do n't really want to do dressage . I have to admit , it is really boring . This game is definitely not the best game on the market . You might be better off doing a little more research and finding a game that is better , which may not be all that hard to find . If you are really considering buying this , and you 've read plenty of good reveiws , and you are thinking , `` Oh , well , this is just one person . Every one else says that this game is good . '' Well , please , I 'm begging you on my hands and knees , this really is n't the best game . It 's your decision to buy it , but please think about it before you do .
 This is the absolute worst game I ever purchased . It would not load properly onto my computer and I was not able to type a name for my horse or my player . As soon as it hit `` a '' it put 17 letter `` a `` s in . I am returning this game ! It sucks ! Do not waste your money , buy something better !!
 Graphics were horrible and story line was boring to the point that you can not even focus to play the rest of the game . Buy if you do n't care about graphics but I do not suggest this game to anyone who cares about realism . I could not even finish the first day of the game because the graphics where so terrible . Do not waste your money buy a better game .
 The game is too confusing . It was too hard to control the character around the castle . The cover is n't anything like the game - the cover looks fun but the game is too serious and boring . When you 're done playing , theres no way to quit without killing the program . It was so bad I had to take it back .
 This game was a great disappointment to me . I am a three day event rider and bought this game along with Lucinda Greene 's Equestrian Challenge to kill some time while I recover from a bad fall . I was really looking forward to this game with all its great reviews and when I started to play it it just became very frusterating . The plot line challenges are ok . Very trial and error . But the jumping is just plain boring . Four speeds ??? I 'm sorry cross country is not supposed to be a relaxing canter through the feild jumping fences . Which is about all you can really do and still manage to clear the fences . But most of the time no matter what you do you cant clear a stadium fence or get a refusal in cross country . As for the horse care it takes forever to groom your horse and to clean its stall you have to make the wheel barrow have a green arrow key over it . Getting it to turn green is sometimes impossible . There are some good points in this game . The idea behind it is really good and the plot is well thought out . My only complaint with the plot is all of a sudden your character is in love with Esteban . Which was kind of random . But I could live with that . The graphics are ok . Nothing to rave about . Dressage is interesting . I 've read all the movements and still can not do a half pass at the canter . They 're fairly accurate for the most part . Though not always named correctly . Overall the game was just very frusterating to me . I still havent finished it quite yet . I cant get a clear round in either cross country or stadium . Also I felt that the game was a bit inaccurate as far as the presentation of a three day event . Cross country comes before stadium and there are not ribbons given for individual placings between events * also a complaint with Lucinda Greene * . I also did not understand `` Talking '' with your horse . It was a little too horse whisperer for me and very hard to understand . I can only hope that eventually they will come out with a good equestrian game that combines great plot , realistic and exciting riding , good graphics and good challenges all in the same package . If that is what you are hoping for in this game , you wont find it .
 SOFTWARE STRUCTURE2 CDs
 The learning company has great software out there , but this certainly is not one of them . There is nothing interactive about this CDRom . It 's no more than a read along book . Sometimes you can click on an image and it makes a silly `` clown '' - esque action that has nothing to do with the book . It looks like the creators started to make a kids software , but ran out of budget/time and are still trying to sell it . I could n't believe that something like that was put our for sale so I looked and looked for a manual to make it do what the advert says it does . No manual , no interactive layers . You will have much better result if you buy the books and read them to your child . Poor Dr. Seuss , he who fought that kind of capitalistic & opportunistic exploitation of others ...

 I can not get this item to stay downloaded on my computer and everytime we try to use it , it freeezes and we have to shut the whole computer down .
 My son plays this at the library so I thought it would be the perfect thing to have on our vacation . Unfortunately , it only works on older versions of Windows and Macs . If you have a new computer running Windows 2000 or later , do n't expect this to work .
 Instead of receiving a CD , I received several 3 1/2 '' floppy disks.And no Certificate of Authenticity .
 I was under the impression that this was a Windows 95 disk for ANY computer . Unless you happen to have whatever computer this was original equipment for , it is useless .
 i had ordered windows 95 for cd-rom , instead i recieved 26 3 1/2 '' floppy disks . if satisfaction guaranteed applies here , i guarantee i am not satisfied .
 Amazon sent a recommendaton for this in email . I 'm blown away by the fact that Amazon would recommend this product , much less based on MY purchases . It is obsolete . It is so obsolete it ca n't be used on any modern or even recent computer system . It has no place , other than historical amusement and Amazon is recommending this to customers in 2012 ? This would be like a modern doctor recommending bleeding by leaches . Shame on Amazon .
 ... I do n't know if it was an accident but I was sent Win2000 instead of 95 .
 The product ID was not legit per the computer I have and I agree with a previous review . Unless you have the original equipment it wo n't work at least for trying to restore a computer .
 I have a mac , and I have a TiVo . Obviously I wanted to take advantage of the tivotogo transfer capability . Well , I 'll tell you , am I disappointed ! The `` extra '' program is called `` TivoTransfer '' and it has some nice eyecandy . It 's very similar to the open-source TivoDecode Manager some of you are use to . On my very first try , the software is unresponsive . On my second try -LRB- after closing the program prior to installation -RRB- it works . Unfortunately , just as the StarTrek episode I had it upload to my mac was finishing , it causes my TiVo box to crash and reboot -LRB- which takes about 5 minutes . It 's very annoying . -RRB- This is completely unacceptable ! I 'm in the middle of watching a show on my television set , and the TiVo CRASHES for the first time in 9 months `` coincidentally '' at the same time as toast is finishing the upload . I 'm not sure what the problem was , but I called the store , and was able to get a refund on the grounds that it did not work as advertised . I can not comment on the PSP video coding -LRB- which is the main reason I bought the software -RRB- I simply did n't get that far . 1 star .
 Purchased this product for use in converting LPs and cassettes to CDs . Had been doing this work with Audacity , which is freeware , and thought CD Spin Doctor would be a step up . Found that there was no manual or no tutorials for how to use Spin Doctor and responses to my two questions to tech support indicated I should check out the Toast on-line forums , rather than expect an answer my question . Spin Doctor was apparently an application that was just dumped into the Toast package without any need seen to offer support or training on how to use it . After using Spin Doctor for awhile , I discovered that it was not possible to do the kind of fine-tuned editing I had come to expect from Audacity and after doing some more exploring of Audacity , I found that I could do everything I needed to with Audacity , including automatically dividing a recording into individual CD tracks and exporting multiple tracks all at once . At that point it became clear that Spin Doctor not going to do the work I needed it to do , and I returned the product for a refund .
 I was most in need of software to convert vinyl to MP3 . The software bundled with Toast 8 for burning vinyl is called Spin Doctor and will probably suffice for a lot of people . I have many 16 channel recordings that I wanted to get the best sound from them , and Spin Doctor falls very short . I purchased Sound Studio 3 and the difference is like a transistor radio verses stereo in my opinion . Toast 8 seems to be excellent for DVD and CD to MP3 and relitively easy to use . I bought Toast 8 based on reviews from their website , wrong place for review . For me Toast 8 was a waste of money .
 Toast is n't the Mac equivalent of Roxio 's Windows programs . All I wanted to do was burn copies of DVDs , and it constantly balks , hangs up , claims disks are damaged , etc. - - with discs that are NOT copy protected , run fine on either Windows computers , or DVD players.To add insult to injury , literally within hours of purchasing Toast 8 , they released Toast 9 - - and the best offer they would make -LRB- NOT a free upgrade ! -RRB- was a modest discount on 9 .
 Works well , but I am tired of purchasing a new software package and then they come out with a new version a month later and you have to pay FULL price for the new one .
 I 've had Toast for about a month now and all I can think about is the HOURS I 've wasted trying to get it to work . This was supposed to make my life easy . I bought it so that I could transfer stuff from my TiVo to DVD and to my iPhone . So far I have been able to do the latter with moderate success ... it takes a long time and the quality is n't particularly good . As for the former , I have tried various fixes and options , but it still takes over 2 hours to burn a 90 minute movie , and that 's after the hour it takes to download it from TiVo . And I 've burned 3 disks exactly the same , but only 1 of them actually worked.Now , of course , they are releasing version 9 ... so I 'm doubly pissed since I just bought 8 last month . I hope the new version is better , faster and reliable . I 'll keep an eye on reviews before I make the leap .
 Roxio marketed this product for Mac users who want to transfer Tivo shows to DVD . Well , it worked for me for about two months until the Tivo Fall Service Update , now every time I burn a DVD from a TivoTransfer I get terrible out of sync audio and video.This sync issue is a problem that began in October '07 AND many users experience this problem . Do a web search for '' TiVo Fall 2007 Update Apparently Breaks TivoToGo/Toast on the Mac '' . As of Early February '08 Roxio has not posted a solution or update to fix the sync issue.I contacted Roxio asking for a refund once I realized this is a widespread issue - however their response was I was beyond their 30 day refund period .
 I bought this product explicitly for the TivoToGo feature -LRB- did n't need any of the other features -RRB- and , simply put , it does n't work . I have three TiVos all of which are supposedly supported - at least they work on the PC version when I run Parallels . I have followed every suggestion on the Roxio support site -LRB- rebooted tivos , my mac , installed upgrades , etc. -RRB- but none of it has made any difference.I recommend downloading the free `` TiVoDecode Manager '' software - its not perfect but it actually works .
 Terrible . Refused to install on my brand new Mac . After multiple tries , I was going to call for tech support but they want $ 2 a minute to tell me they produced a horrible product . I have a better idea - how about I keep the $ 25 it would cost me to call you , and you can have your crummy software back .
 I have been using Toast since version 6 . THE SUPPORT IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE . I have had nothing but sheer misery from this company when it comes to trying to get my registration info re-sent or upgrading or downloading the product from that disgrace of a company digital river . STAY AWAY !!! Do n't listen to the toast fan-boys and their one sided love affair .

 The Tivo Transfer feature would be great if it worked properly . Unfortunately , each show I transfer to my Mac has audio and video that is out of sync and the transfers are unwatchable . To make matters worse , Roxio support is non-existent . Check the Roxio forums for more info . Buyer Beware !
 Unlike many other companies , when you want to update toast you are faced with a time consuming process.You must register the product -LRB- with your email address -RRB- . Create an account . Log into that account . Download your update . Reinstall the software -LRB- on my most recent update I had to re-enter the CD license key -RRB- ! What a hassle!If not for the difficult updating procedure this software could be rated 4 or 5 stars .
 It really sucks !!! It 's very easy to use but on the other hand , the quality of the imagine is very very poor . Sometimes the imagine is so full of pixels that it 's impossible to continue using . I thought that I was n't using it properly but it turned out that it 's the software that 's not good .
 I have to be honest . If you do very little , this package will do very little along with you . I REALLY wish Nero existed for the Mac . Roxio 's poorly stable programs , lack of features , and non-existent customer support makes for a pretty ill customer base . Ahh , but they probably do n't care about that , they just want your money . So , if you 'd like to donate $ 65 to the Roxio bank account fund-raiser , please click , `` Add to cart '' . Just do n't forget you still need to buy CD/DVD burning software afterwards , mk ?
 My last Roxio product was `` Easy CD Creator 5 . '' When I switched to a Mac I naturally expected `` Toast '' to be the Mac version of this product . I am extremely disappointed to find that the crippled video editing features in my -LRB- many years old -RRB- version of CD Creator is miles ahead of what they include with the most current and up to date version of `` Toast '' which I unfortunately own . It allowed me to edit video clips , create several levels of customizable menus , customize the size of compression , and burn to a DVD which played on my standard DVD player . Toast can create one uncustomizable menu level , has NO editing , and locks up every time you drag a file into it . They -LRB- in the product description -RRB- say it reads mpegs but it 's more like it freezes every time it sees an mpeg . It does n't even read every mpeg reliably . The only thing I can find that Roxio adds to Toast that is n't in my old version of CD Creator is more enhanced MP3 and music features -LRB- which is n't what I bought it for -RRB- . I may have been better off using `` Parallels '' in combination with CD Creator . I am sorry but compared to Roxio 's CD Creator -LRB- which is basically the same price -RRB- , Toast seems to have been designed by total IDIOTS . And I always thought that Mac software was better for working with multimedia !
 new lacie 18x DVD writer with DL firewiremacbook pro 2.16 dual intel , 3gb ram , 10.4.11 media - fujifilm DVD-R , 4.7 gb , 16xonly gives errors when burning at speeds above 8x -LRB- and `` best '' speed setting -RRB- . Whats the point of setup if you can only burn at 8x ? PLEASE FIX THIS SOFTWARE ! - l
 No support.Lousy manual.I can not do with this product what I wanted to do because no one will answer my e-mail to help me . It is not user friendly.I made a mistake thinking this would work for me . I am a spinning instructor and purchased it to put together my spinning music . I wanted to use the fade in and fade out feature and can not figure out how to do it . I have googled to see if there is any help out there and have not had any luck . I followed the limited instructions provided and it is a no go .
 I am an intelligent adult and have successfully mailed in and received hundreds of product rebates over the years , but there is no guarantee you will receive a Roxio rebate if you purchase this product ! The company that processes their rebates are fraudulent and do everything they can to get away with it . I call them every month!Unfortunately , I was originally not going to buy this program , but decided to anyway when a great price was offered in combination with the $ 30 rebate . Without the rebate , for me it was a total rip off . If this product seems worth the price to you , regardless of the rebate probably not going through , please ignore my negative review.I ca n't stress this enough ... Do NOT count on receiving the rebate for Roxio Toast !
 Toast Titanium 10 , which I payed over a 100 $ bill for wastes more DVD tapes than I can afford . When I give it a simple task , suchas convert a VLC clone into a DVD in seldom succeeds . The last tape it failed to get the audio . I always wind up using Parallels andusing DvdFlick which never fails to get the TS folders .
 Deciding to upgrade my old standby software for my new ProMac the installation of Toast8 has been nothing but trouble for me.The look of this app . is great but the actual usage was a nightmare.I have spent over 3 hours on the phone with Roxio 's Tech . Support but they have been unhelpful and finally useless for my issue.What happened to me was , with Toast 's new automatic media finder.Every time I wnated to burn an old MP3 file -LRB- that had always worked with the Alsoft version -RRB- this NEW TOAST would not only change the name of the disk info I would list but would RENAME the actual file !! Toast would take my original file , example
 If you are thinking of buying Toast 8 to use the Tivo-to-Go feature to encode Tivo files for your iPod or to burn onto DVD , do not spend your money before checking out Tivo and Roxio discussion forums to see if some well-documented problems have been fixed.Toast 8 worked well until the Tivo Fall '07 update was pushed out in October . Tivo files transferred since the update will usually play on your laptop or desktop , but there are serious problems with the export for iPod and DVD functions . At first , the export functions would not work at all in many cases . Roxio eventually got a fix out that allows it to work most of the time , but there is a continuing problem with audio synchronization . Audio is often out of sync with video by anywhere from a half second to three or four seconds.The annoying thing is that it 's completely unpredictable ; some programs encode perfectly , some are all but unwatchable . There is no pattern except that 30-Minute programs seem to encode correctly more often than longer shows . My own experience is that you have about a 50/50 chance that it will work correctly.There are alternatives out there ; they may not be as fast or convenient as Toast 8 , but they actually work every time . Popcorn 3 , by the way , has the same set of problems .
 Could n't get it to work . I wanted my tivo programs to download to my Mac so that I could take my TV shows on the road with me . I wanted to be able to burn to a CD . Could n't get the Tivo , Mac and Toast to pair up . What really bugs me is , OK so I am not the most proficient computer person out there , I am fairly knowledgeable . Well , Mac would n't help on a 3rd party , Tivo could get me hooked up on their end , but then Toast has no customer service ... unless you want to pay $ 35.00 for the call . Sorry , I like my purchases to have a bit of complimentary support . I returned it . Oh yeah , and the rebate was only if you were upgrading from a previous version . That was not clearly marked in the information before I bought it .
 All I wanted was to put my LP 's on the computer . Spin Doctor comes in the same box , on the same disc with Toast but it is a stand alone program . The manual that comes with Toast tells you that if you want any information on Spin Doctor , click the help menu . The help menu is Roxi -LRB- a woman avitar -RRB- with a list of canned questions and answers . You have to surf through all the questions to find your answer . The problem is that Toast is Toast and not Spin Doctor . Spin Doctor gets the same support in the help screens that it gets in the manual - none . I have yet to figure out how to combine the two sides of an LP recorded at separate times , into one album , or how to delete the two sides and start over . Things like this should be something simple like drag and drop , or Select All and Delete but they 're not . Customer Support is also non-existent . I am still waiting for an answer to a question I sent in 8 months ago . It takes some poking around to figure out the filters and defining the tracks is clumsy , especially with a live album as you have to break the tracks visually by the sound waves graph , without being able to listen to it while you work on it . In case you 're wondering , you will need to record all your tracks in real time and manually add the track names and other tags such as genre . It 's very time consuming . Once you record the LP in Spin Doctor you will need to export it to either a Toast or iTunes library . The end product is acceptable , but just barely . I 'm going to put this one on ebay and try one of the other programs - one that has a manual that explains the process and has an intuitive feel.Regarding the rebate
 As with other responders , I have been suckered by the promise of a product that in no way delivers . The Tivo To Go function has audio-visual syncing problems . Roxio insists it is a small number of users that have the problem . Go ahead and buy this to see if you also get to join the ranks of `` the small amount '' .
 Beware Mac users who are not using OS X 10.4.8 or higher ! It may say all you need is OS X , but I bought my computer shortly before the release of Tiger , so I am running OS X 10.3.9 and Toast will not even open ! So now I guess I 'm looking at paying another $ 130 to upgrade my OS . Hope I wo n't be throwing good money after bad , as they say !
 The Toast CD is defective . Once on my hard drive , Toast will not boot . There is no phone number for customer support , and emails and on line inquiries have been ignored.A total wast of money for a worthless disc .
 I 've been using MacFamilyTree for about a year now -LRB- got it as a gift -RRB- in conjunction with Ancestry.com and their mobile app . Thought I 'd check to see what else is out there for Mac . Tried the demos for Reunion and iFamily . I too found this app clumsy to work with and the reports limited . Aside from the form creator -LRB- reason I gave 2 stars -RRB- , which is a great idea , I do n't think Reunion is worth the price . While iFamily for Leopard is the lower cost product of the three , it is very similar to MacFamilyTree and also has a good range of reports.I 'm sticking with MacFamilyTree , it has great reports and several export options .
 Take a look at Legacy or RootsMagic with Mac Cross Over or VM Ware etc. . Compare the features side by side . Reunion is n't intuitive like the best of Mac Software in general . It 's expensive.There is no outside manual like the excellent David Pogue 's Missing Manual series . David gives an over view as well as great explanations . Many of us would like a Reunion manual . I suspect that there is n't enough of a market there for an author.Ben Sayers does have training stuff which is very good but again when I got my CDs in the mail -- no overview just interesting and helpful random ideas.It 's been a long time since a Reunion software updates and I agree with the person who said after all this is Reunion 9 and still clunky.Reunion is n't represented at genealogy conferences.If you check out the Reunion user group you will find the same handful of Reunion users , telling us that this is the best thing since sliced bread . It is n't the worse genealogy software just check out the competition so you know whats available .
 Waste of money . Program is so dated , very tedious , confusing , boring and bland . Hard to believe this is a MAC program . Price is way over the top and overall not good value . I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.I bought IFAMILY FOR LEOPARD-that gets a definite WOW from me.Don ' t waste your money on Reunion , buy ifamily for leopard .
 I have used this software for about 6 months . It is the most clumsy software I have ever used . Gedcom handling is just barelyfunctional , transfer from ancestry.com basically does n't work , sources get lost . Diagrams look awful . Reunion is the absolute nightmare.Any other software is better .
 I had expected above all else that when I ordered this problem for my Mac that it would be a user-friendly program , easy to navigate , more interactive , and with an elegant appeal . It was just the opposite . The program is n't one that is user-friendly nor does it have a tech-savvy appeal to it . It seemed like a cumbersome program and there was nothing in it that appealed to me . So , I sent it back immediately . I was more than have to uninstall it from my computer . This software does n't offer anything more than ancestry.com , which I think is an excellent program . I was simply looking for something somewhat like ancestry.com which I could pay for one time and enjoy similar features . I am just going to stick with ancestry.com and any associated fees that I may be charged .
 Since I did n't have the time to test all the Mac genealogy applications available , I went for the most expensive one thinking that it would also be the best one . Well , Reunion 9 might be the best application for Mac , but when I saw Family Tree Builder for PC -LRB- which is free -RRB- , I regret not having a PC.Reunion 9 has a nice interface and it is easy to navigate , but it still needs some polishing -LRB- after 9 versions ! -RRB- . Clicking on a table does not let you edit it , -LRB- source -RRB- lists are sometimes missing scroll bars , drag and drop is very limited and clumsy , chart editing is rather primitive , and adding information about a marriage is simple ... if you know you have to click on a hidden button . There are tens of configurable options that I 've never used , and the ones I need are missing.And worst of all
 I gave Reunion 3 stars a few months back , but after trying to print out a new set of reports , I have to downgrade it . I have spent more time trying to figure out how to get good reports and charts than I have spent doing input and research put together . Instead of allowing direct printing with lots of formatting options like FTM , Reunion tells you , if you do n't like their clunky , hard-to-read reports , to send them to your word processor and reformat them yourself . Is n't formatting your data what the program is for?If you need Mac software , I would suggest checking out the less expensive programs or waiting for FTM for Mac , which I have read will be released any month now ...
 I wanted and needed a program that was very user friendly because I am a stark novice , new to genealogy and not a professional . I have spent two months making a tree on Ancestry and needed software to send the tremendous amount of stuff I had accumulated.After a lot of time spent researching genealogy software , it seems as if I was lead down the garden path once again ! The reviews I read on Reunion 9 for Macs were so glowing that I said even though the price was a bit large and the OTHER reviews said it was as good as sliced bread or canned beer , I took the bait . What a waste of time and my money!Program is tedious , NOT user friendly , extremely confusing and has a VERY steep learning curve for ones who are newbies . The software mfgr should warn folks who are new to the family history game about the learning curve ! I guess they just assume all who buy this piece of junk know all about data entry and such for family trees ! There are some of us who DO NOT and it would be nice to be warned before hand ! The price is way way over the top and overall not good value ! My dislikes are so many I ca n't list em all ! But one GLOWING complaint - no delete function for wrong entries ! You got ta open a clipboard and navigate this to delete an entry ! Where is the `` save as '' button ? You got ta be joking!Did I mention NO paper instruction book ? They want you to PRINT your own , and it is LONG too ! Guess printer ink and paper costs are best left to us unsuspecting customers ! Thanks a lot!I have been diligently trying to figure out this program for three days and have given up in disgust!Hard to believe this is a MAC program ! It will now sit on my hard drive unused till I decide to take it off and give it to my grand kids in around fifty years IF anyone in my family ever becomes interested in genealogy.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROGRAM TO ANYONE WHO IS NEW OR HATES STEEP LEARNING CURVES !
 Zone Alarm used to be the best consumer firewall product on the market , and I was a loyal customer for 10 years -LRB- went to a LAN party and ZA detected and gave detailed reports on 14K + attempts to probe my system , a normal week being on comcast internet usually yielded 2-3 attempts -RRB- , installing their free firewall on all my systems and buying at least two pro copies for high use professional systems . I think their marketing people took over the company and are trying to compete with Norton because the product featureset and quality has turned 180 degrees , going from the best to absolutely the worst!After being prompted to upgrade from an older ZA version -LRB- in June 2012 -RRB- , clicking ` Yes ' and installing , gone were the familiar interfaces and questions whether to allow a new programs to access the computer/internet . Replaced with feel good wizardlike windows , which is not all bad . It set my search preference in all my browsers to some ZA proxy search engine -LRB- routes searches to google through their ZA web page -RRB- and would not let me remove the option in the browser preferences . Like literally would not let me remove the option and select a different home page ... kind of like what a virus would do . . When uninstalling ZA they asked some trick question about keeping browser preferences , which I answered wrong and even after uninstall my browsers routed through their proxy , deleting all search options and uninstalling and reinstalling the browsers , same . . So I did what you do when any other nasty clever virus infects your system , re-partition the HD , do a root level antivirus scan and reinstall the OS -LRB- Win7 -RRB- from scratch . It works well after flattening , and I 'm telling 20 of my friends.You 've been warned ! By a loyal 10 year customer of ZA firewall.It would be interesting to hear if anyone knows the type of internal shakedown at ZA that would have caused this type of 180 degree turn in product quality .
 On the reccomendation of a sales person at Stanford Bookstore , I bought MacDrive 7 to help migrate from my old Mac to my new PC.I ran the installer that came in the package and the computer hung up . I re-booted Vista . This time the installer ran and told me that this version does not work with Vista . I called Mediafour customer support and was directed to where I could download MacDrive 7 . something that is supposed to work with Vista . I ran that installer . MacDrive then worked long enough to copy all my user files from the Mac to the PC and then stopped working.The worst is that My PC still asks to look for a driver for a device I do n't have , the doc , or whatever Micro Soft calls the thing at the bottom of the screen wo n't hide itself , and my email program ca n't send email.I could ask for a refund , but that would n't fix my email .
 There are a couple of major issues you need to consider when thinking of purchasing this software.First off , the program does not work with drives that you have created using the Mac Raid feature under the disk utility . Since i have drives configured this way , it came as a very unpleasant surprise , since all of the descriptions state categorically that it works with ALL mac drives . This is a very misleading and unethical presentation in my opinion . Amazon , if nobody else , should insist that a caveat be noted in the product description that MacDrive works on all mac drives EXCEPT those raid drives created with the mac drive utility.When i asked the macdrive customer service about this discrepancy they admitted that is does not work with raid drives but at the same time staunchly maintained that is still works with `` all '' mac hard drives . Make your own decision.The second major issue I 'm having is that macdrive does not show any drives at all when running under Parallels . It does work as described above under boot camp , but i run Vista on my mac in both modes , so it is a severe limitation in my opinion . The info on the macdrive website seems to indicate that they think macdrive is compatible with parallels . Having gotten nowhere with their customer service before , I 'm just hoping some other people report it and they fix it.So , if you think you can get enough use of it , knowing the limitations , it may be worth the money .
 I bought this on the off chance I would ever see another Mac disk -LRB- it 's been years -RRB- . Given the business I 'm in -LRB- publishing -RRB- there 's always a chance a client may for some reason want a Mac . I did the install , but it would n't activate , saying the server could not be reached . Given that I had installed Dragon before it and the latest Acrobat after it , the problem was n't on my end . This went on -- punctuated by uninstalls and reinstalls -- for several days , until I finally called the manufacturer , who gave me an activation code . Guess what ? It STILL would n't activate ! Even yet another uninstall and install did no good . I can only assume this software is so sloppily written that the disk it comes on is good for only three things
 The product seemed to be okay except it did not emulate Frontpage . Their technical Support affirmed this .
 I have used Namo for several years , and it does represent a viable alternative to more expensive web editors . There are bugs -LRB- not handle blank spaces in text well in large documents -RRB- in V6 and so I too decided to purchase V8 to see if the program has been cleaned up.Unfortunately , my vote on the new version -LRB- V8 -RRB- is lower than on the original -LRB- V6 -RRB- . Problems :1 . Looks to be basically a repackaging of V6 switching to the ribbon menu structure as opposed to the historic and conventional drop down -LRB- Microsoft seems to have started this and it appears to emulated for emulation sake - I find this slower and more difficult to use -RRB- . Some features appear to have actually been removed .2 . There appears to be no save all function when working with multiple documents . This was a big time saver with the old version and still not sure if one document has to be saved at a time or not .3 . I can not find any SELECT ALL feature . Another major weakness .3 . A standard XML file did not open properly , and the file opens up fine in V6 . This makes the XML editor useless .4 . The photo album feature , a main attraction of the V8 , does not work in Firefox , only Internet Explorer , as has been mentioned in other reviews . This is a serious drawback of any claimed new version . It is absurd to restrict any development to suit IE , as IE does NOT follow standard protocols . This is an old habit which is taking way too much time to put an end to . IE is not any standard for browsing .5 . Customer support , by ALL REPORTS , is atrocious to non-existent . You are on your own with whatever happens.It looks like V6 was the peak achievement of Namo and I do not recommend a purchase of the new version .
 BEWARE ! I had difficulty installing this software on my Windows Vista machine . Never was able to get it done . Called their support desk and was told to email my problem to a support email address they gave me . Correspondence through that was horrible . Delayed , slow responses , inaccurate information . Nobody would just pick up the phone and call me , and would not help me through the install on the phone when I called . Because of the delays in email responses , I ran past my 30 day return date ... so they would not take my return ! Their fault , not mine ... and they still would n't take it ! Never did get it installed , and ca n't even find a buyer for $ 20 . I warn you to think twice about buying this product - regardless of how much you pay for it .
 You will be sorry if you buy this product . The company stopped caring about it years ago . There is no support at all . The company was bought out by a Korean company . Since then they stopped working on it completely.It 's too bad . This could be one of the best web site editiors on the market . The user interface is excellent , well designed and layed out . I actually love this program and wish they would fix it . But it is un-useable in it 's present state . There are too many bugs and the software behaves very strangely while using it . I spent a lot of time with this program , but most of that time was wasted working around software bugs . I tried valiantly , but finally had to give up.This version , Webeditor 8 is the same software as it was in 2002 . The only thing new for version 8 is the ribbon interface . They kept everything else , including all the bugs . I found documented bugs from as far back as 2002 that are still in this version.If they ever update it I will be the first to try it , but for now , do n't waste your money .
 Have used version 2006 -- Best web authoring software I have ever used . Came with outstanding printed manual that covered basic concepts of web authoring all the way to advanced features of this program . Much better than FrontPage or other products I have used to create self-contained static websites for intranet , project management , teaching , personal websites , etc. . Five stars across the board , installable on every computer you own with no license hassles if you have the valid key . Finding this product at a flea market for $ 20 to $ 30 with CD , printed manual and key might make you lose your lust for Dreamweaver or Expression.I was going to upgrade to current version -LRB- V8 -RRB- because of added features . Searched web and found horrendous support reviews
 This is absolutely the WORST product of its kind on the market that I have ever tried . Constantly crashes , slow performance , will not save a file on your server without a huge hassle -LRB- fails to save your changes or simple deletes them during upload -RRB- and easily triggers servers like 1 & 1 to shut you out , thinking you are a hacker when you need to upload corrections to your file , such as when upload a file , test it on the web , see you made a typo & need to correct it . Typically you get shut out then Namo crashes , so you lose your work and have to start over again.I have wasted so many hours messing with Namo it is sickening . I can not stress just how horrible this thing is !
 This product was out of date when I received it . The product kept blocking Norton so I removed it from my computer , I rate ithorrible ineffective .
 I ca n't believe that it has been 16 years since I last saw this in the theatres . Thanks to the clarity of Blu-Ray , the flaws in the CG animation is even more pronounced . Just watch for any scene involving Scorpion and his extension . There are even super-imposed images as special effects even in the mid-90s ! Cary Tagawa is over the top as an evil sorcerer . Robin Shou and company ca n't act to save their own lives . Even Christopher Lambert has a hilariously bad Christian Bale-Batman accent.Paul W.S. Anderson , where do I start ? This is his sophomore effort but yet it felt like amateur hour . His direction of the martial arts sequences stink . They do pale in comparison . His close-ups fail to capture the intensity of each hit . Anderson began his Hollywood career with this and now he 's type-cast into directing video game adaptations with absolutely no substance.Overall , this Blu-Ray is a sort of an upgrade in picture and sound quality from the DVD , but just like the Star Wars prequels , Blu-Ray clarity is a double-edged sword and it further erodes and downgrades the FX of latter days .
 overall this movie is horrible . for someone who practices martical arts myself , some of these scenes are almost insulting . espescially the kano vs. sonya scence . she obviously has no knowledge of any form of martial arts and watching her fight almost made me feel embarassed for her . the only thing this movie is good for is entertaining you when your completely gone from too much alcohol consumption .
 alright it had cool special effects but the video game is known for its violence - if you play the games right before you watch the movie you 'd swear it was Barneys great adventure !
 The film dose not have graphic violence in it like the video game does , because this is a kids movie .
 I got the `` Mortal Kombat '' case but the `` Last Tango in Paris '' DVD . I did n't bother to return because I do n't have time to ship it back but I am very displeased .
 I do n't really understand how this movie has such a good rating as it does . I 'm a fan of the MK video games ... have been since the arcade days . This movie messes up almost everywhere and even if I was n't a fan of MK ... it still is a dull and boring movie . Here are some of my points . Oh , by the way ... the blu-ray release , product quality , and amazon were fine . * possible spoilers * The first maybe 15 minutes of the film is good . It shows some back story of Liu Kang , Johnny Cage , and Sonya Blade . All very interesting , but once they board the ship to Shang Tsung 's Island it goes sour fast.I can not stand how they portrayed Scorpion . His spear bugs me to death . The way it has a mouth and chases Cage around the trees is ridiculous . Seriously ... who thought that would be a good change?Raiden . Oh my . This guy was so annoying . His forced smokers voice he used trying to sound all bad was unbearable . Raiden also came off as a douche bag to me . His one liners were embarrassing to listen to . Who would respect that god of lightning and thunder?The fight scenes were dull . When a fight scene began I 'd take my phone out and check the weather . I 'm serious ... I just wanted them to end . Most of the fights did n't make any sort of tactical sense . For example when Cage fights Goro the gives him the nut shot -LRB- props for using it movie -RRB- and Goro cries in pain and is vulnerable for a good 30 seconds . What does Cage do to the super tough untouchable Goro when an opportunity presents itself ? He runs ... he freaking runs away to a dead end on a side of a cliff . Great tactics ... makes no sense and makes the movie less unbelievable.Another thing is characters kept saying `` Flawless Victory '' When they won . Liu Kang got the crap kicked out of him and then ended up killing the guy , `` Flawless Victory ! '' , he says . No , sorry Kang , you 're wrong . A flawless victory would occur if you did n't get hit . He should have said Fatality there ! How do you mess that up ? Twice ... This is turning more into a rant than a review . If you are a MK fan then watch this movie just to make fun of and enjoy some of the short back story scenes . If you are not a fan , it is a pretty bad movie . There 's no point in wasting your time watching it.I have n't watched the sequel yet . I 'm going to soon and I noticed it has a bad rating ... this will be brutal .
 Paul Anderson 's hyper kinetically inane film take on Midway 's Mortal Kombat video game series leaves many things to be desired . The MK games themselves barely had an indistinguishable plot to begin with and definitely insufficient story to warrant one movie let alone two motion pictures . Given the film has a bargain basement semblance of a plot , hammy and obviously wooden performances , the supremely inexpressive Christopher Lambert as a wise-cracking Raiden , and marvelous special effects attempting to mask a stupendously empty shell of a movie , Mortal Kombat is nothing but typical Hollywood formula being injected into the trivial storyline of an uninventive video game . As for Anderson 's presentation of MK , he found an appropriate techno-rock soundtrack , physically similar performers to play the characters , accurate video game clothing , specifically correct character movements -LRB- Liu Kang 's Fireball , Johnny Cage 's Low Blow , Shan Tsung 's Morphing , and Reptile 's toxic Venom -RRB- , and impressive sets to lay the uninteresting action on . Not surprisingly the exact similarities that Mortal Kombat lifted from the games not only made it stylistically accurate but equally artistically destitute as well.In the end , we the audience are left with another calamity of a video game to film bust that will litter the walls of video stores for years to come . As for Mortal Kombat 's DVD edition , it has a fine wide screen or pan and scan presentation , the theatrical trailer , and scene selection . Ironically the options are as lame as the feature , but if I were you I 'd stay like you 're life your life depended on it.P.S . I 'd rather drink Crystal Pepsi than watch this movie .
 An adaptation of a popular game , but this is a poor film in which every fight scene has some irritating techno music . The f/x are not too bad , but this film is way too corny for me ...
 This is , of course , based on the video game of the same name . It 's about as much fun to watch as watching someone playing the game would be . You can regard yourself as having seen the whole movie once you 're five minutes into it
 this is something I pop in when I want to zone outthe only good thing about it is that it has christpoher lambert , and he is hot . that 's it.no talent was required to make this movie . even christopher lambert could have been better .
 Paper-thin plot , laughable acting , and bad fight scenes in which one can easily guess the winner . The only saving grace is the special effects and art direction , but that ca n't keep Mortal Kombat from being a crashing bore . Designed for 11-to-12 year old boys .
 I was into Mortal Kombat from a long time ago , I ca n't say I love it the same , but I still find the movie enjoyable . I had the VHS version prior to the DVD , and this DVD 's video is amazing -LRB- just like the other DVDs -RRB- . Everything was so clear and the blacks were , well , black.However , the audio was terrible . From a normal setting , the center channel had a lot of `` oomph '' I mean that literally to , when someone gets kicked , the `` oomph '' has some oomph ... and a LOT of it . Music is hardly audible because most music comes out of the left and right front channels . The left and right -LRB- front -RRB- were barely audible.I gave it 2 stars because although the movie was good , the video was good , audio was one of the main driving forces in this movie . It gave you the suspense , as well as the feel of Mortal Kombat , for all its worth ... but terrible audio gave a TERRIBLE viewing experience . On this one , I can safely say that the VHS is better ... on a normal receiver setting ... I drastically changed my dB settings on my receiver to give center channel a low volume while the front l/r 's a very very high volume . THEN , the DVD was better . BUT at an initial setting , the VHS was better.That however was the technical quality , the extras however did proove useful . It was a nice addition and being that it came from New Line , it had some nice extras .
 Okay , first thing 's first
 When you take a video game where the whole game is simply one-on-one fighting , there is not much story to go with . Apparently the makers of this movie simply accepted that fact and said `` so what ? `` The action scenes are at times enjoyable , at times laughable , and at times boring . But more importantly , there are other ways they could have worked the use of fight scenes into this movie . That 's one of the -LRB- few -RRB- things that they did better in the second film . Simply saying `` we 're here for a Mortal Kombat tournament '' is easy but uninteresting.That said , it is interesting the ways they worked in some of the elements of the games . Those would only really matter to fans of the plotless video game series .
 Before reading farther , know that I am a huge fan of many of the Mortal Kombat games eagerly awaiting Mortal Kombat Armageddon , but unfortunately the MK movies to date have sucked . Yes , this one too , and for many reasons.The first that comes to mind is that it is way too light-hearted compared to the games , and no I do n't mean only by lack of gore . The acting and script are just horrible . The games have a lot more to them than just `` good guys vs. bad guys , '' but this childish idea is implemented quite early in the movie as the nucleus of the plot . Liu Kang , Johnny Cage , and Sonya are immediately introduced as the `` good guys , '' for whom we 're forced to cheer whether we want to or not , and all three are as immature as typical cartoon protagonists . Liu Kang is supposed to be a Shaolin Monk , but he does not act , dress , or talk anything like one . He 's basically just an average guy you 'd meet walking down the street . Rayden 's advice sessions were pathetic , Sonya 's `` I do n't need your help '' attitude is WAY overdone , and Johnny Cage was so NOT humorous in any way . Are lines like `` Ca n't wait to see what the bathrooms look like , '' and `` You forgot good-looking '' really supposed to be amusing ? And if that guy Art Lean was really a friend of the group , why did they just stand there yelling like morons instead of trying to help him when Goro was about to kill him ? Almost everything about this movie is worse than the worst cartoons.The first approximately thirty minutes of the film focus on the story , but afterward it just shifts from one lame fight to another . There is no balance between story and fighting , something that movies should have . As for the fights , I still can not understand the choice to have Johnny Cage fight Scorpion and to have Sub-Zero fight Liu Kang . In the games there is absolutely no animosity or even interaction between Cage and Scorpion , or Liu Kang and Sub-Zero . Obviously the mentality is `` a good guy vs. a bad guy , '' but portraying Scorpion and Sub-Zero as slaves under Shang Tsung 's power is a deviation from the games more than a little too horrible . Obviously movies ca n't always follow things on which they 're based 100 % , but even taking that into consideration this still goes unpardonably too far . Sub-Zero and Scorpion , as the result of being placed on the `` bad guy '' side , are killed in their battles and only appear for a total of maybe ten minutes in the whole movie ! These two characters are arguably the gods and main idols of Mortal Kombat that made it so cool ! To have them in the movie as little as they did and explain absolutely nothing about them is INEXCUSABLE !!!!! The way the fights play out in this movie is just sickening . The Sonya vs. Kano fight was absolutely putrid . Obviously he had to go easy on her , but even doing so he still could have easily destroyed her . And are you REALLY trying to tell me that Kano would not have been able to take her legs off from around his neck ? Are you REALLY trying to tell me that she would have been able to take him to the ground and break his neck with HER LEGS ALONE ?? As Lord Rayden says many times in the movie `` I do n't think so . '' Gosh I would have loved for Kano to have killed her ... Alas , when Kano died , with him died nearly the only well-acted role in the film . As lame as this fight was though , others are just as bad . Johnny Cage meets Scorpion in some forest before their fight . No explanation is ever given as to why either was there . Did they like nature ? Did Rayden tell Cage to go there to find Scorpion ? Maybe Cage decided that he did n't like how the bathrooms looked and decided to go in the woods instead ? It remains a mystery ... Anyhow , after they warp to Scorpion 's mysterious lair and start fighting , Scorpion is clearly the better fighter . He gets so many more hits on Johnny Cage -LRB- as does Reptile on Liu Kang later -RRB- than Cage does on him that even for a movie , I have to laugh that Cage survived until the end . Why did Johnny Cage win this fight ? Let 's see ... Obviously he 's the good guy , so he has to win . How did he pull it off ? Scorpion takes off his mask and attacks with his fire . Johnny Cage escapes by finding a shield that in cartoon-style just happens to be conveniently lying right there . The shield blocks the flames . While Johnny Cage searches around for a weapon , Scorpion in cartoon super-villain style just stands there nearly 10 seconds , an eternity in any real-life or video game fight , and does nothing while Johnny Cage throws a harpoon at him . I repeat
 Once again , the poor review does not reflect my feelings for the movie . `` Mortal Kombat '' is simply the best ... scratch that ... the ONLY good movie based on a video game . There 's enough in it for fans and newcomers alike to enjoy . It 's a big , silly ninja movie that does n't take itself seriously , which is great.However , what 's with the ... DVD ? Trailors is what they offer us , nothing more ? No commentaries , deleted scenes , or even `` making of `` s?Well , forget it . Sod off , Mr. DVD Man . Buy the VHS copy , everyone , you 'll get everything out of it you need . Refuse to support lazy DVDs !
 What is there to say about this film you ask ? Nothing much sadly because the storyline is too simplistic and offers too many cliches . The character development is n't that great , and most of the action sequences are n't very well choreographed . The only real great fight scenes were with Lou Kang vs. Reptile and the fight with Johnny Cage vs. Scorpion , so it 's kind of a let down considering this film is based on a fighting game . The special effects in this movie are n't that impressive because you can tell it 's not real . The only great acting performance in this film was by Christopher Lambert as Raiden , but everyone else was n't really convincing in their roles . Overall , if you 're a die hard fan of the video game series then you might enjoy this , but I think you want see a better sci-fi action film , then see the Terminator series or the original Star Wars trilogy .

 This is the most terrible , emotionally offensive film ever created . After watching this movie , my eyes began to bulge from my head and limbs began to fall off . Watch this movie if you like the feeling of having your organs ruptured .
 I was dragged against my will to the local suburban theater to watch this tepidly dull and overtly violent film . Suffice it to say I left the theater about half way through this tedious exercise in patience . This is plainly J-U-N-K . It concerns the wildly popular video game and brings the characters to ` life ' or should I say , ` to death ' ? The fighting scenes are horrible , and there are too many of them and they are so violent that one becomes sickened by it all . There is also excessively loud techno music to add to the disaster . I would prefer watching the old Shaw brothers Kung-Fu movies better than this banal viewing .
 Anybody that would sit through something so stupid like this movie should be shot . I was not one of the other losers I have what they called taste in movies in this day and age and this is just flat out retarted . Its also a shame i have to give this movie 1 star it makes me feel as though i support this shi * in a way . I just wonder if the acting in it could be half as bad as the movie or the plotI wouldnt watch this if i was paid , Wake up America and today 's youth
 I made the mistake of buying blind ... . never again ! My main problem was n't really with creating the movie -LRB- which is still difficult -RRB- but more with the menus . The title pages to select from are terrible . First impression of a movie is from the menu . Not happy at all . Today I 'm reading reviews to find another program .
 I have Movie Edit pro 11 and still have yet to receive any return emails or phone calls from customer support . If you listen to any feedback listen to this . Do not buy any product from Majix . Try calling them and find out yourself.Movie Edit Pro 12Magix Entertainment Movie Edit Pro 12
 I saw this on their website and was particularly interested in the convert to Flash movie they mentioned . It is n't until you get the program and realize the manual does n't even mention the word Flash and contact their support that you find out you have to sign up for their service -LRB- which is free , but -RRB- and upload your video . Then you download it and it converts it to Flash . The software itself does not seem to do it but something on the site when uploaded or downloads . I have Versions 8 , 9 , 10 , and ordered 11 of Pinnacle Studio Ultimate which seems to be using a similar ruse in version 11 . Upload to Yahoo and it will become Flash . I also have Ulead versions 3 , 4 and 5 . I purchased Adobe 's high dollar system as well trying to find something to make movies and convert to Flash . For small movies that you do n't want flash or that you do n't mind posting to their website , it is ok , but for longer videos I would recommend going elsewhere . I gave 2 stars because it has some nice features but did n't give more because of the misleading of the Flash feature .
 Completely crashed my computer upon installation.Video is choppy , manual is confusing , software is not intuitive , Support will not email validation number , and Magix does n't answer their phone . ` Wish I had n't bought it .
 I am an avid user of Movie Edit Pro 11 and thought 12 would be even better . I could n't have been more wrong ! The video preview screen is very jumpy and choppy . That alone I could have dealt with . I went as far as exporting part of a video I had been working on and it came out the same way . So now the program is pretty much useless to me . I 've talked to other people and they 've had the same problems as I 'm having . I have XP Home and tried installing the software on my other computers which are running XP Pro and ME and got the same results . I am beyond disappointed in this product and it 's too bad because it had a lot of potential if not for that one major problem .
 This is a horrible product . After installation there were several features missing . After installing a web update previously available features disappeared . Online support sent email with a check system program . I spent 5 hours with it , it caused my system to crash 5 times -LRB- which interestingly enough they tell you will happen -RRB- . At the end of the system check there was supposed to be an email feature that sends the report to them . Not suprisingly it did not work . As mentioned in a previous review the burn feature is impossible to figure out . I managed to burn one DVD and the quality was way below par.Don ' t waste your money .
 I bought this Magix product to help with a major college project I am doing . BIG mistake . At first I was quite impressed with the product and its many features . However , like others have said , there are many bugs in this software . -LRB- ie
 This software requires you uninstall your current version of windows media player install the Math Advantage software with an old version of Windows Media Player . This information came from the support forum after doing a search to help my problemAfter I initially installed the program I tried to run one of the applications , I received an MPlayer2 error . This software is marked 2007 , it should be able to run with more recent Media players
 I agree that this is just hodge-podge of unrelated programs . Some are much better than others . I did not have the installation issues mentioned by others . It even runs on NT . The biggest nuisance is the quality of the math program . It has bugs and is very , very poor quality instruction . My goodness , if your student struggles with math , poor instruction is the last thing he needs ! The vocab and grammar programs are cute . A good review for a 6th grader , not higher . The foreign language program is basically flashcards . Good review , but zero instruction . I picked it up for my kids to use over the summer for something to do to and as a review . They are both middle school students . They found the math very confusing and the rest pretty easy . I got it at a discounted price . Probably worth it . NOT worth the list price -LRB- hence only 2 stars -RRB- .
 I agree with the other reviews . I purchased this product outside of Amazon but came here later to see what others thought about AFTER I ran into a host of issues . The applications are outdated , riddled with bugs and support for the application is lackluster . The packaging advertises quizzes and tests to track progress but there is only one sample quiz of one question per section and no way to track my child 's progress . A BIG Let down.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT !!! You 'd do better letting your child sit in front of the TV watching public television . They 'd get about the same out of it and its free .
 Great packaging . Ridiculously bad content.I 'm a techie and this is the single worst educational program I have ever purchased . This is a hodgepodge of programs they must have purchased from others . The tech is extremely old andprovides no guidance or instruction . Several of the programs do n't work on XP . There are postings in users forums indicating that several people have the same problem but no answers . My guess is that most of these programs -LRB- at least the one that worked -RRB- are from the 1980 's . Avoid at all costs . What a letdown compared to the packaging !
 Oh did we feel suckered . Out son loves Caillou so the game seemed like a natural . This game is really poorly done and clunky . It looks fine but it just does n't work well and our son lost patience with how unclear things are . Bad directions . Poor execution . And more !
 The video appears as a very small window on the computer screen.Also can not get the different chapters to work - have a request into to the company , but got no answer.It is also unclear how to be interactive . Waste of money .
 This CD was not useful ... It is more of a review handbook for someone who already knows a lot about Chinese medicine ... It is also difficult to understand for someone who doesnt know a lot about it ... It also had no interesting features , no pics or links ... . BORING AND NOT USEFUL
 I seriously think I could have created a better program with Microsoft Powerpoint and less 70 's music ... It was informing on Geom. , yes , but dreadly poor at everything else ... Save your money , buy a different program .
 I bought this product because I was looking for a low-cost solution to some data-loss issues . I found that it is pretty effective at retrieving many deleted files , and does a better job than many other low-cost or free programs of this type . It even allows you to preview the files before restoring them . However , I am quite disappointed by the fact that the program can not restore the original file and folder structures , or even the original names of the files themselves , which can create a great deal of confusion when it comes to sorting the restored files . Therefore , if these issues are of concern to you , I would recommend spending a bit more if necessary to buy software that provides these features .
 I purchased this product from american_book_company because they had the lowest price . I can see why . It does n't work on newer macs . They also offered no support and refused to accept a return . So if it does n't work on your system you 've essentially wasted your money . I 've bought many Cantonese learning products on Amazon . This is the most the lease professional looking one . It just has three cheap looking disks rattling around in a large box . I would give it half a star . I 've also bought the Pimsleur Cantonese Gold course , and Teach Yourself Cantonese , and they 're both great . I 'd buy them in a heartbeat , though not from American Book Company .
 It did n't have a main goal , but it was always fun picking out lego dudes and building and flying a helicopter around lego island . But it was still quite hard in some cases .
 I was extremely disappointed with this product and the Sibelius customer service . I expected much better considering the hype . Consider the following quote : `` G7 contains a complete interactive guide to guitars '' . Take a look at it folks , it miniscule with information you could get anywhere . A hyperlink does make something interactive folks.As well , the whole business about including Kontakt reeks of the same hype . When I finally got it working it had 1 preset . Period.As was mentioned by someone , scanning is useless . I have a new scanner and used clean published scores . It takes longer to correct the scanned score than it should to enter the score note by note with a mouse . You have to edit the scanned score using a dumbed-down version of the G7 editor before you can get it into G7 . Even then it seems to drop measures requiring a lot of post scanning tweaking . It crashed a few times as well.The user interface has a lot of `` peculiarities '' , especially when trying to determine exactly what is selected at any given time . Even the manual tells you to hit escape several times to avoid doing something you did n't mean to do . This was particularly frustrating.Screen drawing was inconsistent , it does n't handle chord diagrams the way you 'd think it would , and play back of imported midi can result in some really bizarre interpretations.Unfortunately they have a no refund policy -LRB- no wonder ! -RRB- . I took a previous reviewer 's recommendation and downloaded Guitar Pro 4 . Now THAT is a program made for guitarists . I was up and producing useful stuff in minutes . Talk about intuitive . In a week of trying I was not able to produce a single complete score with G7 .
 I purchased this product one week ago , , , after several hoursa day and talking to there support i find this program not anywherenear intuitive , the reviewer that said it has a tall learning curve was not kidding , i think he was being nice ! this program doesnt do what it claims -LRB- it doesnt play all guitar symbols i even have email from them stating that -RRB- it is very difficult to even put a bend on tab and get it to sound right.the scanning software does not work at all -LRB- if it doesnt crash it doesnt even get 20 % of the song right -RRB- I am going back to guitar pro it cost half as much and is so much easier .
 Great sales hype and graphics ... Inside the box is a scrappy program and probably the worst user manual I have encountered for years . The music scanning program simply does not work . Operation of the main program is weird and illogical . Even the menus are stupidly organised . Guitar MIDI input does n't have the facility to channel your guitar strings . Hence , voicings are confused by the program . Tab input is for standard tuning only AFAICS , not very flexible . When you input from the virtual keyboard , either tab or notes appear , but not both ! -LRB- why on earth not ?? -RRB- . Setting up your score to begin with involves selecting from a huge list of combinations of tunings and graphics ... . this gets very annoying , very quickly . There is pretty well zero user configuration here , so one can not set about work-rounds for the worst of G7 's stupidities . My guess would be that this package was just cobbled together for the market . The manual contains a few -LRB- pathetic -RRB- pages entitled '' How to Make it In The Music Business '' . I suggest the team at Sibelius would be better focusing on how to make useable useful software . If you buy this rubbish , make sure you can return it .
 I purchased this program recently . It has a very steep learning curve . For instance , when I tried to put notes onto the staff with the mouse , it would often put them with additional rests etc , which I did not want to be there -LRB- while I played around with my musical idea -RRB- , and then when I tried to delete the note I put in , it would not delete it . So I called Sibelius and asked who I could go to in the Los Angeles area who could perhaps tutor me on learning this program , and they did not have a single person . It was suggested that I go to the help center on their web site ... which I did , and then I tried to find the listings of discussions from other users on the basic learning of the program ... the help center came back with no listings ... so then I had to write techincal help to find out exactly what words one has to put into the help center in order to find the chatroom discussions ... I am waiting for an answer now.So , save your self a headache and do n't buy this program unless you have a direct contact who can help you learn it .
 I was a Lilypond fan for a couple of years till I realized I was n't producing any guitar notation music.I have been building my guitar teaching business and thought that G7 would be the personal assistant I needed to transcribe students tunes into real notation and guitar tabbing as a back-up . The bugs are too many to mention and its interface is just a shiny facsimile of a Sibelius template of yester-year . Their forum to date -LRB- 2009 -RRB- is non-compos-mentis -LRB- gone -RRB- . After over 5 years G7 Kontakt does n't even hold its own forum!Its been absorbed into a forum of other Sibelius products and lost in the shuffle.When I finally reached someone there they had the audacity to suggest I reach deeper in my pockets for their flagship Sibelius 6 !! heres what you can do for me - make a guitar notation software !! Make it so its valuable to people who buy your crap , not so its valuable to your bottom line ! -LRB- Hint
 I was looking for a program that would turn my guitar improvisations into sheet music in real time . G7 sounded promising so I tried it with a Godin Grand Concert and a Roland GI-20 for pitch to midi conversion . The results were horrible . Even at slow tempos many of the notes were a sixteenth note off , even though they were played precisely on the downbeat . The metronome tempo was not reliably consistent . -LRB- I was running it on a PC with all unnecessary services disabled . -RRB- Arpeggios are horrible . If you 've ever looked at a sequence of a guitarist playing arpeggios , you 'll know it looks like a mess of overlapping notes . And that 's what the notation of G7 looks like . It has a feature that is supposed to turn a mess like this into a monophonic line by removing overlapping notes . When you run it a warning message appears stating that you can NOT undue this operation ! -LRB- Very poor design -RRB- When you do run it the results are less then spectacular . Often eight notes are displayed as two tied sixteenth notes with the ties above the notes when they should be below or vice versa .
 Udgraded from 10.2.4 to 1o .4.6 . Can not see all the benefits yet . Needed to upgrade to run selected sofware i.e. google earth , but lost my wireless connection . After spending almost 15 hours over the phone with Apple I was never able to reestablish the connection .
 Built on top of free unix technology , add that to overpriced software bundles and limiting compliance to vendor supplied hardware and you 've got a real winner.Ubuntu 7.04 PC Editionis basically the same technology under the hood and is going to save you some green .
 I have had a Mac for several years but have not been able to use it lately . I also have a PC which , because Windows is so unreliable and unmaintainable , basically compelled me to try the Mac again by installing OS X Tiger and hoping the Apple had improved their accessibility for epileptics.Specifically :1 -RRB- Allowing to disable blinking caret2 -RRB- Allowing to disable useless spinning icons during startup and when busy3 -RRB- Allowing to disable totally useless `` ripple '' in progress barsPeople with photosensitive/pattern sensitive epilepsy MUST have an absolutely QUIET screen all of the time with absolutely none of the above . All this idiot blinking/rippling/scrolling make the Mac absolutely inaceessible.I have to give up on Apple once and for all . It is a waste of time hoping for real accessibility from this company . Almost $ 10,000 investment down the drain for no reason other than stupid marketing gimmics as that is all the above are.BTW , Windows is BARELY accessible with the meaningless progress bars with the relatively rapidly moving progress indicator that moves back and forth -LRB- and conveys no meaningful status other than the computer is still powered up since it does not indicate any progress at all -RRB- and their various worthless animations such as when you copy files . Despite the fact that Windows is a terrible system I am stuck with it.Sorry if this is not as well written as it should be but right now my brain has been juiced from Apple induced seizures .
 This is an example of a large company pertpetrating fraud on the people who buy its products.I bought my son an iPod for Christmas . Unfortunately he could not use it to download from itunes on his 4 yr old Mac Powerbook computer . He needed to buy the newer -LRB- tiger -RRB- operating system . So another -LSB- ... -RSB- to buy this operating system . He has been unable to install it on his Powerbook.Both of us have spent over 4 hours on the phone with Mac tech support -LRB- hah ! -RRB- and have found no solution . Finally they told us to bring it in to an Applestore -LRB- three hour drive away -RRB- which we did , only to be told that it would cost -LSB- ... -RSB- for them to even look at it.I hope no one else has to suffer like we have just because you bought an iPod .
 I work with both Windows XP Professional and Mac OS X TIger My system setups are below : PC
 This is not a serious design tool . The program is very limited . If you are only going to design square or retangular rooms -LRB- the program restricts you to these options -RRB- - it might serve some basic needs - otherwise I would not recommend it . Tried contacting the company for further assistance - got no response .
 This software is very unfriendly . You ca n't delete windows once they are in place . The 3D rendering does n't work , either . I have windows `` floating '' in mid-air in the middle of my virtual kitchen !
 I bought this about 6 months ago expecting a stand alone synth program and was very disappointed . This is only a plug in for a DAW -LRB- even though it says this no where on their website -RRB- . After flailing around on the internet I managed to find a free player and was happy for a while . I recently got my new mac and found out that even though this claims mac compatibility it can not be installed on OSx Lion . The cakewalk boards are full of people asking cakewalk for help and the silence from is deafening.If you have a PC and are using a compatible DAW , go for it . The Sounds are great . If you are using a mac or you don ' tknwo what a DAW is , avoid this like the plague !
 I bought this RCT3 soaked because my son loves RCT3 so much . As soon as I installed it , it crashed both the Soaked and the original RCT3 . Neither would work again . I was getting ` bad version 4 ' error and asking me to install a disk I already had installed . There is NO customer support for Atari games ! No one answers their phone and no one responds to my e-mails . It is trash .
 This game would be cool ... if it ran . i got the game and was all happy loaded it and the thing wouldnt run . i called tech support and the person told me to download a new driver for our graphic card . i did this and installed it on our computer . when this didnt work we tried to uninstall rctycoon 3 soaked and instead it uninstalled rctycoon 3 and i still have the soaked thing that doesnt work on my computer . so DONT GET THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS WITH THE VERY BAD TECH SUPPORT . now i am rctycoonless and i have 30 dollars less in mmy wallet
 I was not happy when I received this product because you can not play it alone . You have to buy another software to play it .
 Ditto of the above . We are out $ 30 too . I am actually in Amazon.com to repurchase our RCT 3 when `` Soaked '' ruined everything . I will never put `` Soaked '' in our computer again . I truly feel soaked
 I bought 3 and soaked ... . and what a waste ... I have every RC tycoon and all the expansions.Im uninstalling 3 & soaked and going back to 2 .
 okay it is bad and very poorley done . i got bored after playing it for 2 days . at least its better than the 1st one and the 2nd one . he ... he -LRB- emabbarssed and shamed of buying this game -RRB- * sob * why did i get it ???? * sob *
 I really enjoyed R.T. 3 but this expansion pack is very hard to master and has a few bugs of its own . It takes forever to actually make a water fall work and is very frustrating.You have the ability to build rides through terrain now but this to is virtually impossible to accomplish . And often the rides wo n't function . I receive constant pop-ups saying the ride stations are not long enough for the ride cars , even though you can see the cars sitting in the station . Terrain is a major problem as que lines no longer line up with the ground , forcing you to spend alot of time trying to adjust the surrounding land to the proper height.This expansion pack , if anything , is very frustrating , much more so than the original problems with RT3.In the first 2 version of this game it was very easy to build through mountains and underground , those days are long gone here . Unless you have hours to spend mastering this new stuff , you may want to think twice before you add this pack .
 I could n't get the game to install.It would say disk not found and Bad version 4 . It may be because the Roller coaster 3 game I was adding to is a Scholastic version.The only way I could uninstall the soaked add-onwas to use the Restorefunction on my computer Then uninstall the RCT 3 . Other wise you 'll have no working game at all.Buy the Roller Coaster tycoon 3 Gold instead.You get a matched set R.C.T. 3 and Soaked all on one disk.It was a little more money but at least it worked .
 I purchased this expansion pack from a book order and I was so exited . After I started playing with the features , I installed the patch which fixed only a few things . Then , I did n't play the RCT3 because Soaked ! was on it . Now I finally got rid of that terrible game . That took some work too-not just any work more like TONS of work . I was exiting for the first few hours but then I wished I had n't installed it . If you 're a person like me-who ca n't take game errors , DO NOT buy this game . I think Atari needs to clean up there future games .
 Like many others , I found that `` Soaked '' is impossible to install if you had previously installed the demo version of RCT3 . I 'm an expert user , but I can find no way , including editing the registry , using the RCT3 uninstaller , etc. etc.to get the installer to recognize Soaked ... . And as others have pointed out , there is no user support available . More likely than not , you will get a ` wrong version 4 ' error too . and you 'll end up returning the software or just dumping it.Don ' t waste your money ... . what poorly written garbage !
 Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Soaked adds a new security to check so that the original RCT3 disk is required to play.However after installing and inserting the original RCT3 disk I always got an error message that the wrong disk was installed onmultiple computers . Overall it was a frustrating and disappointing experience .
 They require 3rd party vaidation and then start charging you other fees ... . used to be a good product . . now it stinks ...
 Versacheck sounds like a great idea but unless the checks are printed with special magnetic ink , they are hard to use . Stores and banks often will not accept them because their check readers can not read them if magnetic ink is not used . Versacheck sells printers and magnetic ink . The printers are cheap but the ink is very expensive . Moreover , the ink cartridges have a short life and Versacheck will not replace them if they are defective . i had two new black cartridges and neither worked but Versacheck would not replace them.All in all it appears that you save money by printing your own checks rather than having Intuit or another printing company print them for you . But in the long run , it costs more to print your own checks than have your checks prepared by a 3d party .
 The spell check was n't working on Microsoft world 2000 so it suggested update it . Suddenly I have a shareware version of Microsoft office and it 's spamming for a new cd key . The update description never mention installing another program or in the terms of service . Way to spam your users for a product already bought . I would like to get what I already bought working not defer to anther product for more money . That 's insulting .
 Received product . Thought I was getting the real deal . Instead I received a Microsoft Word disk for distribution with a Compaq computer . Installed the software and immediately got a signature error message upon loading the software . $ 20 down the toilet .
 I can not review the product since I have not received it yet . That 's my complaint . I was told I would get it the latest Dec. 18 . Today is Dec. 20 and I still have not received it and Alan , the provider , sid not even respond to my e-mail . I need this microsoft disk SOON !
 The disc was defective and would not play on my computer . Two months later the company has made no effort to right this wrong .
 If you have Win95 do n't upgrade to Win98 - It is less stable and many of the programs for Win95 just plain do not work . Maybe WinME is better but it is still based on DOS - Microsoft is always announcing that their next version is going to be better - Well , we 're are still waiting .
 If you must go with Windows , wait for Windows 2000 . I bought this Win 98 2nd Edition to fix the bugs in Win 98 1st addition , and I still have some of the same bugs . I leave my computer on all the time and my system clock always falls behind . IT 'S NOT WORTH IT !
 Yum ... yet another OS from Microsoft that is buggy , unreliable , and causes your system to crash randomly . I ca n't believe that I actually paid Microsoft for this product - they should be paying me if they want to do their beta testing on customers.Well , horrible architecture aside , the good things about Windows 98 is that it now has USB support , so not all of your dollars went to waste . Oh , and it includes another version of Internet Explorer - a very good product , by the way . Aside from that , if you have to use Windows to play your games , you were warned . I opted out , too frustrated from having to reboot constantly and now vow not to use another OS by this company ever again .
 MS took out number of device drivers from Windows 98 Second edition . After upgrading to windows 98 , I had to connect to internet and download all device drivers from the net .
 With all of the USB devices now available , I needed to upgrade my laptop from Windows 95 to 98 . I purchased the upgrade , attempted to load it , and my system froze after an hour 's worth of labor loading it . I called Microsoft 's help line -LRB- a toll call , by the way -RRB- , and wasted another two hours . The technician told me I needed to update my drivers . I did that , tried to load 98 again -LRB- another hour or more -RRB- , and it failed just the same . This product has cost me more in lost time than the price I paid for it . I will be returning the product .
 Generally speaking , to get the best performance from any operating system a clean install of a full version is recommended . The best choice is to choose a full version of the product and enjoy the benefits of not being left with artifacts and leftover 's of your previous operating system which can lead to instability in certain cases . I would only buy this on a limited budget .
 Okay ... my Win95 is breaking down and unstable ... and I feel like I 'm being robbed having to buy this enormous , bloated fallacy ... thank G-d I have RedHat , OpenBSD , and FreeBSD to work on getting used to instead . Hey ... I wish they 'd hurry up on that hardware support for * nix so I can remove all Redmond Rubbish from my box .
 Grudgingly , Win98 SE has improved the performance of my machine . Under Win95 and Win98 , my computer would always get annoying `` vmm32.exe missing/unable to load '' messages about every other bootup . And my computer used to crash much more frequently than it does now . After installing WIn98SE it boots correctly more or less 100 % of the time , and it 's stable once booted.I know , that sounds like i LIKE it . I do n't . It 's taken me two years to get a stable operating environment . Meanwhile , Macintosh OS improvements are n't about increasing stability so much as they are about adding actual functionality . Does a Mac OS 6 user worry about whether her machine will boot ? No . Did we hail the onset of Mac OS 7 as a more ` bootable ' OS ? Definitely not . When Mac OS X comes , we want to know how it will transform our internet experience , or make it easier to edit movies , or create 3D graphics . We wo n't worry about whether -- after much prayer , if we 've loaded all the drivers correctly , and if we put just enough tin foil at the correct angle on the coat hanger we 're using as an antenna -- we 'll actually be able to turn on our machine.One star is too good for Windows . Period .
 Need help because the key product does n't work . I call microsoft ans they told me it sounds like a nonautentic CD.What can I do?Spend my money and ca n't install Windows 98 . Please help me
 Hi out there ; Recently , I wrote a negative review about my negative experiences with MS products over the years . To my amazement -LRB- my apologies to Amazon -RRB- it was published on the Amazon web site on the customer review list associated with the MS XP OS . I was a poor little David with my little slingshot attacking Goliath ... -LRB- The richest man in the world -RRB- one bill gates , featured in the movie ; `` Pirates of Silicon Valley '' . To my , pleased , amazement the following occurred ; Days after my review published Customer reviews of 5 stars to XP numbering over 800 obscured the negative customer reviews already onsite . Highly suspicious , eh?I replied with a review that my decision not to buy XP was based on the negative customer reviews of XP , rather than the avalanch of phoney 5 star reviews then on site . I was feeling used rather than `` User '' . Soon after the XP software was no longer featured on Amazon.com neither was ME nor 2000 , they disappeared along with my negative reviews.Now , featured is Win 98SE upgrade -LRB- It 's unclear if this is an upgrade of Win 98SE or what and would ` nt it be clearer if it was called Win 98 third edition -RRB- . Also WinSE upgrade is selling at a 25 % increase in the usual upgrade price an obvious display of immense gall.Throughout all this where was Amazon.com ? Running quietly in the background doing what a responsible business does ... objectively reporting even to the extent of referring a customer to an other vendor to satisfy that customer 's needs . I recently ordered a book from Amazon.com and added another book to that order based only on Amazon 's `` Other customers also bought '' . OK it was a small order but it was an order made with confidence . Amazon.com has taught me over the years to trust them . How sad for MS that they as yet do n't understand that simple basic process.To those of you out there that feel your voices are too small to be heard , I encourage you to speak up and let 's together make this world the place it ought to be.Again Thank You Amazon.com we love ya!As always SincerelyJohn King AKA jhnkij@aol.com
 Windows 98 is just Windows 95 bundled with Internet Explorer.Windows 2000 is Windows NT with Internet Explorer.Who do they think they 're fooling ? And they keep whining about innovation ... You are better off with Caldera OpenLinux or picking up an Apple PC running the MacOS . That way you can use Netscape Communicator and see everything the Internet has to offer ... not just the things Microsoft will allow you to see.If you 're stuck on Microsoft products , you 're better off just waiting for Windows 2000 .
 Like many other reviewers have said before , there is n't anything too special about Windows 98 . I purchased it because the hardware I wanted would n't run on Win95 . I did n't think installing it would be too difficult , but it turned out to be a big headache . It stalled in the middle of installing . After manually shutting down my computer , I attempted to try and reinstall the upgrade . However , I had problems starting my computer because the windows 95 files had been corrupted by the partial installation earlier . I had to use the system recovery cd that came with my computer to reinstall what was originally on my computer . Only after that was completed was I able to start installing windows 98 . During my second installation , a warning popped up saying that there might not be enough space to install all of win98 because I did n't take into consideration the programs that were reinstalled on my comp . I proceeded anyway because I was so tired . Then came the long process of handling all the drivers for the hardware I had , which was tricky as well because I had to install the driver , then reinsert the windows 98 cd , and reboot and reinsert the cd with the driver . Long story short , this entire installation process was tedious . One thing positive however is that my system seems to run a bit -LRB- very small bit -RRB- faster .
 I ordered this and it was to be filled by American Computer . It is advertised as guaranteed to be new and would have the product key . I received an illegally copied cd . It was a generic cd that had been recorded . The label affixed to the cd and the label that was inserted into the case were both printed on an ink jet printer . There was no product key . This was a scam . Totally useless software . I immediately contacted Amazon.Com and they referred me to American Computer . Amazon.Com is now processing a credit for me .
 My company purchased this upgrade . We installed it on 5 of our PCs . On 2 of the PCs it kept duplicating and creating Temporary Internet subfolders and the cookies inside the folders exponentially locking up the PCs . On the other 3 if you went into explorer and tried to move folders the contents of the folders vanished . They were not in the delete file . They were just gone . On all 5 PCs you may be working and out of the blue you would get a message that said `` You have performed an illegal operation ! '' and then the whole PC would lock up and would not respond to the mouse or any of the keys . If your work was not `` saved '' when this happened it was `` lost . '' I personally never purchased this upgrade for home use and I never will . It 's nothing but trouble .
 For a company that has enough revenue to run a small country , I expect a lot more for an Operating System . Win98 should have been released as free bug fixes to Win95 . The products are extremely similar and contain alot of the same core features . If you can get away with using Win95 , it is not worth the upgrade.If you feel pretty confident in your computer skills , buy ReHat Linux !
 I used to have some SERIOUS problems with this software . It would crash frequently . It was very slow . Some bugs , like software entries in your `` Add/Remove '' software list remaining even if you UNINSTALL that software like Microsoft tells you to do , I thought Microsoft would have fixed . I can not imagine why Microsoft has not removed bugs like this . The only possible explanation in my mind is that the software is too bloated and too complicated for fundamental changes to be made to it any more.All I can do is express disappointment , and wait for Windows ME , the consumer version of Windows 2000 . Windows ME , much of its kernal being written from scratch , will not have the stability issues and speed issues that the current versions of Windows have . Until it is released , however , there are a few other options availible besides using only Windows.One day I found a shell that works on top Windows 98 , which makes Windows 98 much faster , more stable , and more productive , while providing full software compatibility . The shell is called LiteStep ... I suggest that you check it out . LiteStep is a multi-tasking giant , allowing you to have as many as 8 virtual desktops open at the same time . This has been the greatest boon to my productivity . The funny thing is , even when I have things open and running in more than half of the virtual desktops at the same time , this shell is STILL faster than the regular Windows enviornment . There are also thousands of colorful and functional MODs availible to download for free . A MOD is graphical and functional overhaul , and depending on your asthetic tastes , functional requirements , and computational needs you can pick a MOD that is right for you . No one MOD is best for everyone . LiteStep is part of the open source movement , which means that people are always working on this software and it is constantly evolving . The download for the core shell is not even a megabyte , and took me less than twently minutes to download , install , and be running LiteStep . The only problem with LiteStep right now , however , is that it is generally not ready for beginner users . Configuration involves editing text files and can be somewhat painstaking , and would be hard for those new to computers . If you want a new feature for LiteStep , however , you can download that feature individually and combine it with other features and create your own cusomized version of LiteStep for you . I am using LiteStep right now to write this review because I think that the benefits of LiteStep outweight the downsides for advanced users.There is another alternative , and that is to put Linux on your system . It is stable . It is robust . It is fast . Very , very fast . Faster than LiteStep . But , no doubt you are saying now that it is probably too complicated and archaic to install . Not so any longer . A brand new type of Linux , the Corel Linux OS is so amazingly user friendly that I can only begin to express how helpful it has been to me . It takes only 4 steps to install . FOUR steps . It installs in less time than Windows and detected hardware on my computer without a hitch , but I have heard reports of others having problems configuring hardware , and needing to do things manually . As far as I can ascertain from what I have heard , about 30 % of users have these troubles , and require tech support . About 70 % install it without a hitch , like I did . However , it is not Plug and Play compatable as of yet . It is so amazingly fast , though , that I hate it when I need to run a program on Windows or LiteStep that I do not have to run on Linux . Corel Linux OS I would reccomend to intermediate computer users . Also of interest is the Corel Linux WordPerfect Office Suite 2000 , which is excellent , but that is another review . PC World Magazine says of Corel Linux
 I am a desktop support professional , and after seeing just how many machines can get hosed by Windows 98 and SE , I recommend that no one purchase any more '98 until Microsoft can learn how to write softwares .
 How do you make an OS that in most cases is terrible ... worse ? You make an even more terrible update.This is a strange case -LRB- as is to me with most MS products -RRB- as some of the things added when using this update actually make Windows 98 easier to use ... while also hogging resources , making the system more unstable and other things that the normal user would n't notice but drive me nuts.It is so sad that all the gamers out there must rely on such poor stability to play games that otherwise would be amazing if they did n't have to fight the OS for resources.Alas , in close , Windows is here to stay -LRB- Win2K actually looks like a winner though kiddies -RRB- so we may as well get used to it . Linux , BeOS , FreeBSD , et al. are newcomers on the block and will steal some of Microsoft 's glory but it 's going to take many years to knock out all of the companies that rely on being `` Windows Compatible '' to make them money . Yes indeed , it is here to stay .
 I tried to install the 98 upgrade second edition . My windows 95 system would not accept it reading `` must have a 98 system . '' I need to get the complete 98 system , I guess . . Help ! Help!Anybody
 I would not recommend this product to anyone . It does nothing but cause my system to crash and other problems to numerous to mention . I am having to convert to another OS in order to resolve this !
 Its a computer O/S ... i really dont like it but because Microsoft is so common and well supported i guess it will have to do ... wann hint get a good book and buy linux it wont crash as much ... it only gets 2 stars because it has so many programs that work with it ... . Its my opinion that this O/S is not worth even 5 cents .
 This software came in the time it said would arrive . It is great that it was online . It was a great price .
 This package is another Microsoft cash grab . There was no need to release a whole new version , I 'm sure all of the improvements could of been included on a patch which current Windows 98 users could download for free , but nope . If you are looking for a new operating system , I 'd suggest buying Windows 2000 if you want the latest and greatest that they have to offer . This is just a waste of money .
 If you have win95 , then it might beneficial to upgrade to win98 SE . However , the fact is that there is no difference with win98 , with the exception for IE5 -- which can be attain separately for little or no cost . Most of the drivers and designs are still the same . Furthermore , OS is still crashing as regularly as the old . Currently , I am not even bother to use the win98SE upgrade that I have for my PC .
 I 'm a computer builder/repairman . I would not pay for this . If it was as revolutionary as Win95 was over win3 .1 then it would be worth it . is a high price to pay for a couple bug fixes . I only hope the law eventually catches up the the master con-man that is Bill Gates . If you have Win95 , then you will see a world of improvement , and you will probably think it 's worth it . But not because you want it , but because that 's the way Bill likes it .
 Having to upgrade to windows 98 from 95 to run my scanner was a bummer . Now by upgrading my memory and processor I must also upgrade to Windows 98 2nd edition to run my sound card . I have 98 1st edition , but now I have to have 2nd ed . No way around it and I hate all the extras I have to go through for windows 98 . I want my 95 back but I would not be able to upgrade anything : -LRB-
 I worked for almost 2 hours with a microsoft technician over the telephone however software would not download the digital image into the pc . Olympus comes with the Camedia Master 2.5 software . I was told that the Windows 98 upgrade for the Windows 95 includes all the drivers necessary to work in conjunction with Camedia . However my discussion with the technician at Olympus says that Camedia only works with Windows 98 2nd Edition . I would appreciate any feedback.tad
 Hi i installed this product thinking that it might have some new stuff from my old version of windows 98 well i have two computers one that was running windows 98 and another with windows 98 Se.well windows 98 second edition had basicly nothing new prior to the reg . version of 98 exept more crashes and lockups and blue windows so if your hoping for this product to be new from you original windows 98 version i just want you to know that there is nothing new exept your system having a million problems , slowness and also be prepared to spend alot of money on supporti reccommened to upgrade 2 windows ME
 I recently upgraded two of my computers from W95 to W98 . For the most part my laptop upgrade went fine , although I did have to do some tinkering with it . Upgrading my desktop -LRB- a major name brand -RRB- was a major undertaking . I spent an entire day getting the upgrade to install properly . The machine would lock up or reboot itself in the middle of the install -LRB- not when it was supposed to reboot -RRB- . Then I started to get `` Windows protection errors . '' I went to the Microsoft website to find out more about these but their advice was not very helpful . The emergency startup disk that is created as part of the install is a joke . After loading from the diskette , there was not enough conventional memory to run my CD-ROM drive . It recommended that I add a line to the config.sys so that it loads EMM386 . The problem
 points to ponder
 Do n't you love microsoft ? This is a total waste of money . I would rate it less than one star if I could . Every time Microsft decides to make money , they produce an over-priced product like this , then discontinue support for the old OS , forcing everybody to upgrade . Win98 fixes the problems you never paid for with Win95 , and introduces new problems you will pay for again with Win2k . Basically they gave you a broken product with no alternatives so when you have to pay for the fix , you still have no alternatives . But you need to buy it anyway , because the latest hardware will not work without it . Beware though , you may want to check out your hardware for Win98 compatible drivers , as some perphials -LRB- like some HP scanners -RRB- requre you to send away to HP to get them , and this may lead to more cost that you counted on . You may have a problem with winmodems as well . If you do n't know what you 're doing , you will be almost guaranteed to have problems with drivers that will need to be fixed by a local computer guru , and so you may end up paying a lot more for this `` simple '' upgrade.I really wish I could tell you to `` STAY AWAY '' but there is nothing better , because there is nothing else .
 This was the worst thing I could have installed . Once installed , my DVD player no longer worked . I can play CDs but not DVDs . I tried uninstalling SE , but it leaves residual files that CAN NOT be removed . If you do attempt the uninstall , then the DVD worked , but other programs do n't . Microsoft and Gateway refuse to help with the issue . Gateway claims I purchased it 3rd party from Mircosoft -LRB- ! -RRB- and Microsoft says it 's Gateway 's responsibility . So now I have a $ 3000 machine with a useless DVD . Take my advice
 Windoze98 upgrade from 95 made my computer much worse . I needed the 98 version because 95 has poor USB support . My experience is that many applications run a magnitude slower under 98 . There are also frequent freeze-ups of the system , sometimes I ca n't power down the system through Windoze -LRB- I have to unplug it -RRB- , and sometimes the system refuses to recognize peripherals -LRB- depending on what software was being ran -RRB- . If you do n't need USB support , my advice is to stay with Windows95 . There are far less bugs .
 It is a complete waste of money.Wait for Windows 2000 instead of buying this one.It seems to be an attempt on the part of Microsoft to fill the gap between now and the launch of Windows2000 which has been delayed .
 OS upgrades stink . I resisted the upgrade to 98 because I knew it would be a pain in the rear . It was and is ... half the time I ca n't even boot . I was fine until I did the stupid upgrade .
 As usual , Microsoft dropped the ball . Using Windows 98 is guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes . As a web designer I find that Windows 98 costs me more in lost time -LRB- hangups , lockups , etc. -RRB- than is worth while . Stick with Windows 95 . Win 98 is barely a patch program - much less an `` upgrade '' . Do n't let Billion Dollar Bill Gates rob you again !
 WIN98 SE is only a service pack , with added CAB files and proprietary drivers . It serves ONE purpose , Microsofts ugly lust for more and more money . Since anything you add to your computer comes with newer drivers , and the attempts to patch WIN98 B have only injected more bugs into third party software it 's a waste of money and time . Also NT will not support any added hardware but is safe from invasion , so 2000 was created for more versatility with that security . Home users do not want 2000 , its security features are detrimental . I needed to correct the mis-info of some other posts .
 Probably would work fine with older Macs , but not my new one -LRB- Leopard system -RRB- . Useless .
 I personally used this program exclusively despite owning Photo Shop for my six years of College ; however , it is no longer supported by MS , or Windows 7 for that matter . I am now using Serifs Photo Plus and Page Plus and paid less than $ 130.00 dollars for both ; which combined , have far more functionality and are fully supported in both my windows 7 and Virtual XP . PhotoDraw was Great program , but far to risky to load and use now . I 'm surprised MS has given up on graphics programs , I 'm sure PhotoDraw would rate an easy 5 stars if they reintroduced it without any changes to the original , depending of course on price . There are a lot of people including me at 64 that make a hobby of graphic manipulation .
 I 'm a serious fan of DS9 , and I also write fiction about the show , so I had high hopes for a database containing all the scripts combined with a way to fully search the files for references to specific words -LRB- such as all the times the Orbs were mentioned -RRB- . Instead , I was extremely annoyed to find the word-search function only shows the FIRST use of a word in a script , and it even sometimes IGNORES uses of a word . For example , the word-search function could not find the word `` Maquis '' anywhere in the episode `` The Maquis , Part I '' ! Having all the scripts to read is nice -- and is the only reason I gave it two stars . But the scripts are bulky to access , and it 's all you really get . There are no encyclopedia entries , so I 'm baffled by the earlier review 's comparison to other Star Trek encyclopedae . The only videos that come with the companion are the `` coming attractions '' previews for each episode , which are useless for reference purposes . What really ticked me off is Simon and Schuster advertises the DS9 companion as `` fully searchable . '' When I complained , a Simon and Schuster tech-support rep told me I was using the program correctly , but apparently the advertising department 's definition of `` fully searchable '' was different than mine ! So buy this if you really want to read all the scripts on your computer . Otherwise , do n't waste your time .
 I do not like this product . It has to many bugs in it . It breaks down , I stayed up to 3:30 A.M. with it , I 'm stil working on it .
 I have used most of Microsoft 's operating systems released since 1995 -LRB- 95A , 95B , NT , 98 , 98SE , 2000 , and XP -RRB- , and Windows 98SE seems to have the most bugs . I have installed Win 98SE on about 6 different computers , and have had one or more of the following difficulties on each machine :1 -RRB- I was already having problems while installing it . For example , when the installation was 99 % complete -LRB- i.e. after almost an hour of hard work ! -RRB- , it gave me a `` Windows protection '' error , which prevented the computer from starting up . It took me a while to figure out how to get around that .2 -RRB- When I installed other programs , I sometimes got error messages at the end of installation , though the programs seemed to run okay afterward .3 -RRB- When I run many programs simultaneously , the computer crashes easily .4 -RRB- About 4 out of 10 times I shut down the computer , it freezes and I have to turn it off by pressing the power button!Thus , if your computer can support Win 2000 or XP -LRB- i.e. if it 's fast enough and the hard drive has enough space -RRB- , avoid 98SE at all cost ! Not only Win 2000/XP rarely have the above problems , but some of the latest software -LRB- e.g. Microsoft Office 2003 -RRB- requires at least Win 2000 and wo n't run on 98/98SE . In addition , if I am not mistaken , only Win 2000 Service Pack 4 or Win XP Service Pack 1 or 2 can natively support hard drives bigger than 137 GB . Another -LRB- minor -RRB- inconvenience is that for hard drives between 64 and 137 GB , you need to get a special , free update from Microsoft if you want Windows 98/98SE to recognize the full capacity of the drive.However , if you must use either Win 98 or 98SE , Win 98SE is the better choice because certain programs are supported only by the former but not the latter , e.g. Acrobat Reader 6 and Windows Media Player 9 , and many USB devices I have used are supported by 98SE but not by 98 .
 Not only is Windows 98 just an excuse for Billy to make some cash and get rid of the bugs in Windows 95 , Windows 98 SE is an expensive bug fix and hard drive space eater for Windows 98 . Not only is it _ still _ too unstable to be used by anyone that does anything with their computer besides stare at the screen save -LRB- sometimes it crashes then too -RRB- it is _ still _ horribly slow compared to almost any other operating system .
 Windows 98 is much better than Windows 95.2000 or XP is really the way to go if you have the hardware for it .
 Do not buy Windows98 unless you absolutely have to , and are prepared for a let-down . Although setup started automatically and the installation seemed to progress flawlessly , my pc only gets the blue screen of death on post-install startup . I ca n't even start in safe mode . My pc is totally disabled , as previous Win95 was over-written . This should not happen in such an `` advanced '' software . I do not recommend this product ; in fact , I strongly recommend against it .
 I had Win95 and it crashed constantly . So what I do is shell the money out , not on the upgrade , but on this complete version . I format the hard drive and insall Win98 . And what can I say ? I do n't remember the last time I saw the ` It 's safe to turn your computer off ' screen . Do n't you miss the old DOS days ?
 My original order was placed on 4/28/09 for Windows 98 SE . I received Windows XP which will not run on the computer I am working on . A to z cables contacted me and said they would send out Windows 98 SE and I would send back the copy of Windows XP . As of 5/29/09 I have not received Windows 98 SE . Good luck in dealing with these people .
 Windows 98 is a poor excuse for an OS.It makes my Pentium III run slow and unstable.If it was ` nt for Norton Crash Guard 2000 I could ` nt stand it . I have found the OEM versions that come with new pc 's to be more stable than retail versions . I still love my MAC !
 Like all products released by Microsoft , Windows 98 has its fair share of bugs . But even the Second edition is so buggy and unstable that it is insane to use in any type of production environment . Unless your only concern is for cool desktops and extra toys that have no real meaning to actually working on the PC , do n't bother with upgrading to Windows 98 . If you are looking for a full install go ahead and move to NT , the full version install of 98 is n't any better than the upgrade . So either save your money and stick with Windows 95 or make the jump to NT , because Windows 98 is a bust no matter what edition it is .
 This Program I dont advise buying it has all kinds of bugs and windows update you see like one million critical updates that eat your hard disk space and it throws up blue screens all the time and almost every time i try to install anything it throws a error at me or some other thing at me and i have to restart my computer all the time and my computer has 128mb ram 40gb hard drive and a 700mgh pc and almost no matter what pc you have windows 98 is not worth the hours of headache is causes it 's just not a stable OS and if you feel like throwing your money away buy windows 98 but i finally got windows me and it works great so dont buy windows 98 if you have it buy windows me
 I was completely in the unknown in how to buy Pc 's back in the day -LRB- 2001 -RRB- . I unfortunately bought a HP Pavilion computer loaded with a Windows 98se . The operating system is unstable because it freezes if you run too many programs . It also does n't have a `` eye-candy '' interface with the fancy metallic stream-lined toolbars , -LSB- see mac os x if you want to know better -RSB- , if you care . Overall , if you 're tight on the budget and ca n't afford a Apple Macintosh like me , you 're stuck with Microsoft . Its a cheap , unstable O.S made WAAAY too fast without care , for a massive population . Get an apple if you want a life-time reliable computer , because if you 're stuck with a microsoft windows computer , you 'll be changing your computer every 2 to 3 years BECAUSE THE OS WILL BURN UP LIKE A SHRAPNEL ! .
 I have not received the product . I have sent a couple of e-mail inquires to the seller but I have not received a response . I am very concerned because in addition to paying for the product I also provided the seller with my debit card number.Fidel Guerrero
 Microsoft Windows undoubtedly is the worst popular OS on the market . It is unstable , unreliable , not secure , and contains the worlds most bugs .
 I bought this based upon its high review rating and its claim to be for children . It does have 8 games . However , it does not provide lessons at a truly beginner level . It 's first `` beginner '' lesson assumes you have already had practice with the `` asdfgjkl ; '' keys . Learning these 8 keys in the same single lesson is too much for your average 11 and under child . After having done some more research , it looks like `` Typing Pal Junior '' is a better program for beginning children . It teaches two keys at a time , starting with the `` fj '' keys . It also has dictation practice , in the form of stories you have to type as the computer dictates them to you . This provides the added benefit of spelling practice for your child . It only has two games , but the dictated stories make up for it.My children may eventually use Typing Tutor 10 , but only after they have worked with Typing Pal Junior for awhile .
 Beware
 I threw it in the trash . Could not get it to work on Mac Os X . What a waste of shipping $ !!!
 i wish i would have read other one star reviews before purchasing . my computer would not recognize software no matter what i did .
 As a long-time Freehand user , MacroMedia continues to disappoint . Hardy anything new , yet commands are different and it is much slower than the previous version -LRB- which itself was slower than the previous version -RRB- . MacroM has abandoned the print market anyway ; I believe this is their last release of FreeHand . Its too bad , since it used to be a fine program .
 I ordered this with an open mind and a genuine desire to use this product . Regrettably however , I must say that this application is , at best , a poor implementation of an interesting concept . If it were less expensive it might be an amusing novelty but I can not , in good conscience , recommend it to you at the price that they are asking for it . Here is why : The interface is clunky and a distraction from the real work at hand . The nonstandard interface is not the least bit intuitive and the amount and quality of the information provided is not relative in value to the time wasted to achieve it.I found a product named Ultralingua that is fast , easy to understand and lets me find what I am looking for quickly and get back to the business at hand
 May 9 2010 , I have just purchased the Visual Thesaurus and found it to be very visually playful , however it needs plenty of work done to make it stronger . I compared this with Encarta 's Audio Dictionary and Webster 's Audio Dictionary . Both have audio without the use of the internet . I do n't think this company Thinkmap Inc. was n't thinking too much on this project . I trully believe this software could have a favorite section and a word category section for your words . Also , a tool to enter or saves some words that 's not included in the Thesaurus . Compared to the other two dictionary , this thesaurus needs work . Today 's technology should n't have to be skimpy on including ALL -- ALL the pronuciations without the use of the internet . If this problem is n't corrected with a PATCH UNDATE . I wasted my money .
 This product provides precarious definitions about a word with a ` pretty ' map around a word pointing arrows of a scarce amount of obviously similar words . Any online free dictionary will provide you with more complete definitions that this device . It does not enhance the semantic level and comprehension of a word nor of related words , nor it provides a complete list of synonyms , nor antonyms . If you are a writter and want to find the correct word to enhance what you are trying to explain this will not help you . This product is not useful and is a waste in every sense of the term . The description of what it says it can provide is erroneous and once you buy it and find out that is not helpful , they do not allow returns . This product sounds promising my advice is ... do n't fell on the trap !
 Okay , I do n't claim to be a computer wiz , but installing software is pretty easy . I bought this piece of junk and am greeted immediately by a message that tells me I can not install Visual Thesaraus unless I am logged on as an administrator . Do I know what that means ? NO ! Is there a number to call where I will no doubt have to trek through an hour and a half of various phone trees to get help ? NO ! There is no assistance . If you go to their website there is no prompt where you can get help ? NO ! So I am left with a disk I paid $ 40.00 for that does n't do what it promised . So , if you are someone who struggles with computers , you might just stick with the paper edition . If there is anyone-perhaps someone who is affiliated with the company who made this program-who can explain to me what ` logging on as an administrator ' means on my own computer and what I need to do , I 'll retract this review .
 The product was advertised as MS Office 2000 Professional -LRB- old edition -RRB- . It failed to mention that it was OEM software which must remain with the PC it was purchased for . I am guessing they meant to put -LRB- OEM Version -RRB- on the description . I had every reason to expect I was buying a retail package . This software transaction was illegal .
 This CD only works on old windows versions and can not work on Windows 7 , Vista or Windows XP . The seller did not make that note forthcoming and that is why it was so cheap . When I contacted the seller , he was less than helpful and , in fact , an a $ % ### & about it .
 This product is labeled as working on Win98 and XP . On the package it states it is for Win95/98 and when I tried to install it on XP it gave me an error stating that it will not work .
 All I can say is this ; I installed the program and when I tried to use it , I could not get it to do what I wanted which was to run thru a V.H.S.home movie that I had recorded onto D.V.D. and remove some unwanted segments . It seemed to only want to remove the beginning or the end , so I have uninstalled it for the time being . I tried to follow the book of instructions . perhaps I need a greater intelligence . SorryJ.B
 This could have been the best software of its type if only it were n't so clunky to use . Plan to spend A TON of time reading the manual just to get started using this product . the controls are definately not user friendly or intuitive . I 've had it for a couple of weeks now and I still ca n't write what I want to write . Pass over this program and spend your money elsewhere untill the programers make this title easier to use .
 My litlle sister was angrey becuse the program whould always lock up on are computer and say that are windowas was not right we have windows xp but she wasnt haveing that much fun with it anyway becuse thare were only 4 levels anyway and we some how got spyzapper after playing it dont buy it .
 It 's an ok card program if you 're not really serious about making nice cards . Might be good for teachers who do n't mind a lot of cartoony clip art . Photos and other art work are pretty spare and lacking . If you want to be able to make really nice , attractive cards , I do n't recommend this program .
 The images are cheap and cartoony - you can get better clip art on Microsoft Word . So lame is this product , that there was nothing suitable to make decent Christmas cards . I 'll try Hallmark - maybe they 'll have classier stuff .
 Acid Pro 4.0 has a lot of functionality and I have enjoyed using what little portions of it I can . However , I give the product 1 star because it does not come with an adequate user 's manual . It has an extremely light weight 10 page `` guide '' that is n't worth the paper it 's written on . There was a guide published but Sony has discontinued it , and I ca n't seem to find one . If you 've already used the program , you 'll be ok . Otherwise , stick with Acid , the non-pro version . Having all the functionality and not being able to harness it stinks . : -LRB-
 This is a very wimpy program . The concept is cute and my son would have benefited from it , but the program kept crashing . The directions say that the setup program is supposed to run so that you can save it to your hard drive , but there is no setup program . It just runs off the disk . I do n't know if that is why the program kept crashing , but I know that when I went to the TOPICS Entertainment -LRB- the manufacturer -RRB- website , they told me to reinstall it . It wo n't install , so how can I reinstall it ? It was a waste of money and now I have to buy another , more expensive program .
 Along with this item I also purchased the addition , subtraction , division . and geometry CD 's . A big mistake to even purchase one . I do not recommend either . Low grade , too hard for even me to understand how they work and for my grandchildren it was even worst . I ca n't think of one good point . Do n't purchase , will be waste of time and money .
 THis CD-ROM is hopelessly out of date . . only good for a computer at last 8 to 10 years old , according to my Apple store . it would not work in any of my 3 apple computers.And if this was explained in the listing I certainly missed it ... I think the advertising was misleading and when it was all done with the item shipped back I still lost money.I definitely paid some tuition for my education .
 These usually work well for my needs but the little note about it being for a mac was not very prominent on the site and I ordered it by mistake .
 I spent hours trying to get a topographic map on my computer . I read the instructions and clicked on every bottom in the program . All I could get was a regular map without the contour lines . I would think that a product sold as `` National Geographic TOPO '' would include instructions in how to view a topo map . I also had to reload the program several times .
 Had I known it came without a cable I would not have purchased the software .
 This Microsoft Entertainment pack is good , but the first one is better , also i wouldent buy it because you can download or play the games for free on the internet so you'ed be best of not to buy this item
 This product should n't be on the market any more .
 I do n't know how to begin describing what a total waste of time and money this product is . First , the games require that you set your display to 256 colors . This is 1989 technology and it shows . The dictionary has at most maybe 100 words in it and it 's just a plain ASCII text list that pops up , not even a real dictionary . The pronunciation guide is a dirt simple text paragraph about long and short vowel sounds , it has nothing to do with how to pronounce any single word.This program is total trash . I 'd be embarrassed to give it away . Either the producers at Simon & Schuster never even looked at this product or they do n't care how they get your money . I 'm astonished that any responsible manager would let something this awful onto the market bearing the company name . I 'll sure never buy anything released by Simon & Schuster after this .

 When looking at the intruder list you can see that if you use the right slide bar you can display more info -LRB- click on the sidebar until End Of List -RRB- . Noticing this
 Go to zonelabs.com and download their personal version firewall . I use it and it does everything people talk about here -- I was thinking changing it out and buying this product until I read these reviews -- plus its easy to use AND IT 'S FREE .
 BlackICE Defender is a good product . However , if you 're using Windows XP and/or Norton AntiVirus with this product you should expect to have many contacts for support . I would not recommend this combination of software . Using no firewall at all will extend your life !
 it slowed my cable service down so much that I am thinking about going back to the good old dial up . It was very hard for me to set up and to keep everyone out as the speeds that I have created took sometime to get to and only one second to slow down . from a 2 meg down load to a 33600 on the rictor scale of slow thats slow . . to tell you all the truth I really wasted $ 40.00 of hard earned money . . so now when it is not being used it gets turned off and thats it . if you want speed then try something else or just do what I am doing , , turn the damn thing off . . this red alert thing got everyone so paranoid that they all want to get in side this old beast to see whats up ...
 Do n't bother to buy this product.It will let a whole elephant in , but complain about a simple ping . Instead , your money is better spent on ZoneAlarm .
 This product may claim to stop hackers cold in their tracks but I would ` nt know it . After reading what seemed like good reviews by well respected publications such as PC World & PC Magazine about this product and it 's anti-hacker technology I decided to give this much talked about firewall a try for myself . Well , too bad for me because at the time that I purchased this product it was ONLY available at the company website and ONLY available as a download . After completing the download of this product all my problems were just beginning . First off , my computer shut down immediately after clicking the open button on the download complete dialog box which was not what I expected my computer to do . At this time my computer re-booted and shut down for the 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th time until it just shut itself off as if someone had pulled the plug from behind . I turned my computer back on but every time after the windows splash screen would appear it would just shut down and attempt to reboot over and over and over . I could not even get my computer to boot up until having to go into safe mode and uninstalling this useless software . Well guess what ! My troubles were n't over at all . I still could not log on to windows unless it was without the use of my mouse or unless it was in safe mode and at this point I was so frustrated & angered that this product ruined my computer and my day that I decided to just re-install my entire OS . Lucky for me I always back up my drive and was able to re-install everything back to it 's original state but NOT until I re-installed the OS again.Keyword for today
 I have purchased this product thinking that , since I am on a LAN , I should have some extra protection . I have a network here too , and every time another computer on my own network tries to access my computer , even AFTER entering the password - This Blackice thing says it is an attacker/intruder , and that I should block it or trust it . Now , I do n't want to trust a bad person , and I do n't want to block another person on my network . So I have no idea WHAT to do at this point , and it is so confusing that I just leave it alone . The interface is very confusing , and its so many useless features and options make you go crazy . I 'm sure this program was made by some paranoid person wanting to hide in a net all day without any trouble . Well , for every paranoid person out there - this program is great . For any normal person wanting a little protection from the outside world - This program is bad , not only because it will make you paranoid , but also because it will drive you crazy . Buy it at your own risk . I 'm sure many other people have had this problem before , as well .
 in the past I have used many different firewalls . The famous `` Atguard '' , Zonealarm , and now Black ice . I spent -LSB- $ -RSB- on it , it said that it stops hackers cold . I frequently visit a web site called `` shields up '' , it tries to probe your ports and test your security . using Black Ice , it was sucsessful in probing port 139 , and NETBios . -LRB- thats not good -RRB- , and I found that I was not in full stealth mode . Using the free Zonealarm firewall , all of your ports are in full stealth mode , however recent rumors suggesting that zonealarm may actually be spyware convinced me to get rid of it . In addition to Black Ice , I downloaded a free firewall called `` Tiny Personal Firewall '' , it is very good , and makes my ports invisible , just as zonealarm . Another problem I had after intstalling Black Ice , is that my PC would just turn off , and I would get kicked off the internet often , also , since I have had it , it hasnt picked up a single hacker , and I have it set on `` paranoid '' mode , however the Tiny Persoanl firewall , has picked up , and blocked a number of attemps made by hackers to get into my system . If I could do it again , I would have saved my -LSB- $ -RSB- . Dont but Black Ice . Download `` Tiny Persoanl Firewall '' ... its good , and it 's free ! : -RRB-
 BlackIce Defender is , well , adequate as a firewall . That 's part of the problem - if you ask the company , you 'll discover that that 's not the purpose of the program . Instead , it functions more as an intrusion detection system . It is easy to install , and fairly easy to configure , but that 's about all it does . It certainly stops low-level attacks , like port 80 scans , but if you get a more involved probe , like a SubSeven probe , BlackIce Defender does n't block it . Instead , it lets the probe happen , then tells you that someone was looking for something but could n't find it . That 's kind of like having a car alarm that tells you when someone is checking out your car but decided it was n't worth stealing -LRB- okay , it 's not a perfect analogy -RRB- . Sure , you can block specific IP addresses , or allow only certain IP addresses ... but if you want to block every SubSeven probe , for example , you have to wait to be probed , then tell BlackIce not to let that person through again . Small consolation . Also , the interface that displays the most recent attacks is somewhat buggy - it was n't unusual for me to be paging through attacks , blocking IP addresses who had probed me , when the list would suddenly shrink to the last 20 or 30 addresses . I 'd have to flip back to the attacks page , page down a few times , and back to the address page
 I purchased a Black Ice product.They offer ONLY email support.They may take severals days to respond that they ca n't fix your problem.There is ABSOLUTELY no way to get live help.DO NOT BUY ANY BLACK ICE PRODUCTS unless you know everything there is to know about programming in any language written.In short , buy anything else , this company does n't derserve to be in business .
 Well if you like being asked if it is okay for Internet Explorer and Explorer in general can run every few minutes - this is the program for you . As for me it seems like these are programs that should not even be questioned . I upgraded from the old version to the new version , and trust me the old version was nice , but the new version is absolutely terrible . I 'd kill for the old version . I 'm switching to Norton firewall as soon as it arrives . My printer will now not print and I think this may be why . when I went on their troubleshooting site , there were all kinds of `` yea we are aware of the problem , this is the work around '' , and you had to change various ini files , or whatever . I want a program that works not that I have to fix . I have it set on low to medium security , but be real the only thing left is to let ANYONE in . Go figure !!!
 I tried Black Ice Defender on my Gateway G-400 and it caused the computer to crash regularly . After contacting Network Ice by e-mail and making their suggested changes , my computer crashed less often -LRB- but still too often for my liking -RRB- . I found the information about attempts to access my computer , provided by the program , to be incomprehensible and , therefore , useless . I do n't recommend this program .
 This is a case of tampering with a great product , and fouling it up.The original Black Ice was wonderful . It operated quietly in the background , keeping bad guys at bay . Then they `` upgraded it '' . They made it obtrusive and a nag , interrupting all normal computer use with nagging messages and questions . The problem is , if you set it at the highest security questions , you get nagging messages at every turn . Even if you want to open a game , offline , with broadband disconnected , you get a Black Ice pop-up . To decrease the interruptions , you have to lower the level of security . Not a good trade-off . Then the other day , it just went crazy and seized control of my computer , basically locking me out . No matter what I wanted to do , it shut me down . Kind of like the Matrix . I finally had to reboot and restart in safe mode to uninstall Black Ice . I 've gone out and bought a new firewall program .
 This product is worthless . It says plainly on their website that they offer NO phone support . That is danger number one . It locked up my computer all four times I tried to install it . I was unable to boot . It is hard to get web support when your computer will not boot . Avoid this software .
 Ive used this for about 6 months now . While it does block what it should it also blocks things it shouldnt . I have a fast computer with lots of resources so that wasnt the problem . I have AOL and while black ice was enabled i had constant problems accessing websites etc. . I would have to disable it constantly in order to do anything on AOL . I uninstalled it and signed up for a program on Besafehome.com . Its a filter/firewall software that downloads in minutes . You pay a yearly fee to use it . Its totally maintainence free and always updated . Best of all it doesnt slow my AOL speed down one bit ! Much much happier .
 One reviewer from Ocala , FL United States wrote , `` After -LSB- zonealarm -RSB- allowing admittance I have found out that while downloading free programs , my Black Ice Defender will allow downloading but will block attempts by the downloading program to access my files and send back info to its source . `` Zone Alarm does this too but it also encrypts the reference to the program so a trojan horse can not spoof ZoneAlarm . `` Black Ice keeps a detail record of all hacker type attempts as well as pointing a finger back to where the attack came from . '' Zone alarm does this too.The best on the market is actually free . Search for ZoneAlarm and go with the product our Network Administrator 's use at home .
 I have tried both and ZoneAlarm wins hands-down . Try it for yourself , put your system through the independent security test found atThe fact is BlackIce ca n't help control what access an application has to the internet . An important plus in ZoneAlarm in an age when many viruses are internet-aware .
 I had previously used Black Ice defender , and it blocked incoming probes , but it allowed outbound connections by installed programs -LRB- spyware etc -RRB- . Not exactly what I had in mind . Then I got Zone Alarm Pro and it catches everything , inbound and outbound , which seems like a better solution .
 I bought this way back in 2001 after my credit card number was stolen off the net . It worked ok for someone inexperienced with security , but now that I know what to protect against , I found out you can get better firewalls for free . I use Tall Emu 's Online Armor . Zone Alarm is another good free one.And now I read that IBM -LRB- who now owns Black Ice -RRB- is ending support and updates to Black Ice in Sept 2008 . You 've been warned ! Get another firewall !
 This is a 2007 program that has already been discontinued by the publisher - with reason . In using the tests , I found a huge number of questions -LRB- several in each test I tried -RRB- that had very serious typographical errors - to the point where I had no idea what question was being asked . For example , '' = 56 '' . That was the extent of two math questions I ran into . The possible answers listed were all two-digit numbers . Clicking on the help button provides you with information about how to navigate the program - nothing about the current problem . It does advise you to press the `` speak '' , `` evaluate '' , or `` show me '' buttons - none of which exist ! I skipped these problems and kept going . I found another problem that asked me to express `` four to the third power '' as digits . Evidently , the program was unable to correctly raise the `` 3 '' into position , because `` 43 '' was listed twice as an answer , but 64 was not listed . After each test I completed , I was advised that if I had any scores in the yellow or red zones , I should `` repeate '' -LRB- sic -RRB- the test.I contacted the publisher , and they e-mailed me a patch . But it is only to remove the audio reference to nonexistent buttons . The typographical errors have not been corrected . They do not plan to produce any further patches , because the software was produced by a third party , and the publisher has discontinued it . They offered a refund , but my purchase will not qualify for it.This program is so seriously flawed , it should not be sold by any reputable dealer .
 I am an after-school teacher looking for software to evaluate where my students are . Well , I took the test and realized that there were typos . It had partial questions that you could n't answer the question for.On top of that , when I tried to print , it gave me additional errors.I tried loading the software on another computer too and it would n't even load . As soon as I discovered these problems , I looked for customer support which is non-existent . I 've asked the merchant for a refund .
 My son has taken the 6th grade full and some strand tests . There is no built in help for each problem . Also , there is n't a report for parents showing exactly which answers were incorrect . The actual tests he has taken have been decent , so far . However , the promises made by the software are seriously lacking .
 I am a new teacher and very much into technology ; I use my Treo 650 for everything else and decided ... why not for work ? I purchased and downloaded this software , thinking , this WILL make my life easier.After previewing and using the software , I realized not too long after that something really important was missing . There was no place to capture or measure student grades !!! Very dissappointing ... how can this package have an application to remember the names and schedules of other teachers , but no grading system ? Very dissappointing ... how can this package have application to note methods of discipline and no grading system?I think the writers went into a great deal of detail without remembering to handle an essential basic ... grading.Teacher 's P.E.T is cheaper and looks like it helps to grade , moitor student attendance and keep records of pertinent student info !
 Conceptually this is a great game , especially for a child with visions of being a Vet . You -LRB- can theoretically -RRB- learn about animals , their care and health issues . Those 2 stars for overall are basically for the concept and little else.Unfortunately the general usability of this game , vis - &agrave; - vis lousy controls , is quite low . It 's nearly impossible to move the character at times , which results in stressful failure in the game . It crashes . It ca n't remember simple settings like , leave the terribly loud and obnoxious music off.Playing this multiple times with my 6 year old always goes from excitement to frustration -LRB- bordering on tears more than once as a bunny gets woefully ill while your character is comically stuck bouncing between the sofa and ottoman -RRB- . Once going you can engage your child by `` studying '' the books you 've bought . Also , as you analyze the patients you learn about ailments as well as the treatments . That is all good stuff , but on whole the game is too frustrating to enjoy.One final note , this is the first time I 've ever bothered to review any product .
 I started to play this game thinking it would be so fun.Then I occored a problem when I could only heal rabbits nothing but rabbits!I did everything it said to and waited.After 12 coustermers I still only got rabbits.So frustrating!I tried buying food , toys , and I even bought a bigger cage!Three days later , no cats!I gave up on the game about 2 weeks ago.Im 10 years old and i dont get this game!But other wise the game iws fun but the graphics are dissapouinting.My charector gets stuck about 3 times every 30 min.Also when you start a brand new game she has a shirt too little for her and her hair is all choppy.I have to waste mony on a wardrobe so she can get a decent hair style and docter coat.This game is really diisapointing in some areas but in others its fine i guess.Dont buy it !
 All my specs are fine but constantly have the game freezing up , crashing or my main character walks back and forth . Online help was useless . I am so disappointed because after you get past the first few days there is more to do and I was enjoying it .
 After being greeted with much excitement , this program would n't properly install on my not-so-fussy computer . The web assistance was of little help at all and we had to send it back . Very disappointing .
 When I got this game , I was very excited to play it . But when I played it , I was very dissapointed . The game was very confusing , and hard to control . Sometimes , I could n't get my person to go where I wanted it to go . Learn from my mistake . Do n't waste your money on this game .
 My daughter recieved Animal Hospital Pet Vet for Christmas and it has been a huge dissappointment . I have nver submitted a review before but feel very strongly about this statement . The directions are unclear , it is difficult to maneuver around the site , the graphics make her dizzy when trying to zoom in and out and move the ` Vet ' thru the clinic . Unfortunately , it has been used already or I would return it . Do n't waste your money on this game .
 I got this game because I thought it would be fun . I was totally wrong ! Every customer that I got brought only rabbits . Rabbits , rabbits , rabbits !!! This game confused me a lot . Also , it gets very boring . And , it 's very hard to control . Do n't waste your money on this game ! It will be a total waste of your money . Believe me !
 This game is so boring ! You do n't really do anything . And you have to wait ages for the food to arrive . The instruction booklet does n't come in handy and it 's hard to control .
 I purchased this item for one of my son 's gifts for Christmas . When I tried to load it , there was a . DLL file missing . I emailed the company but have n't heard back from them . I feel so cheated .
 Very poor product . It wont work on `` older '' systems - older defined as systems made before 2007 . When we talk to computer geeks , they have never heard of the 3D PAL requirement in the system specs . I will not by another ValuSoft product . Their products are not reliable or supported .
 well when i first got this game , i did n't know what to do . but there is something called the tutorial where it helps you play the game . this really helped me.so when you get to the options menu , click on scenario and click on tutorial.and once you take care of 10 bunnies you go on to cats then you go on to something else.this game is a little confusing but fun .
 I was very excited to get this game . I did read previously written reviews . My 13 yr old daughter wants to become a veterinarian someday and loves spending time on the computer , so this just seemed like the perfect Christmas gift . Alas , the game has many faults that does interfere with the game being enjoyable ! I should have listened to the reviews ... The game is extremely glichy ! It makes playing it very hard and frustrating . My daughter tried for one week and has given up . The characters get stuck and just stand and vibrate on the screen until you start the game over . Sometimes she will play for a half hour before it starts up and sometimes it does this right away . VERY DISAPPOINTING.Also , some internal setup issues of the actual CD is that it works better running from the disk then saving it to the computers hard drive . We have a pretty new computer , we have windows XP - this program just does n't run well off our computer anyway . We have other games that do n't have this problem . In fact my son got a game - building machines and inventions - and it does n't have any of these problems and actually requires more from my hard drive.Also , my daughter complains of some of the limitations within pet vet that do n't allow her to change . You have to pay a specified amount to hire an employee and the employee in this game is a slouch - there are no other choices when hiring staff , no wage choices , you ca n't get this employee to work or and you can not hire anyone else.Overall because of the gliches in the game , she has n't been able to play it to the programs full potential and has given up ... so the idea is great . . but the makers should have looked at this better before taking the consumers money and putting it on the market . I can not find any fixes or downloads online to repair it either . BIG BUMMER !!! BEWARE ! JUST DO N'T BUY THIS ONE , LOOK ELSEWHERE !
 The software constantly freezes -LRB- locks-up -RRB- and when I e-mailed the tech support I did n't get a response . 3 e-mails and 3-days later still no response . Of course , the store 's policy -LRB- Target -RRB- , and most stores dealing with computer software , is not to refund the money ... instead , they 'll just give me another copy ; what a waste !
 I believe there is something wrong with it . It slows up a lot , very hard to manuever the characters , slow , boring . Not a good game .
 Unfortunately , in order to run this PC game I would have to buy an updated graphics card driver . The one which came with my 2 1/2 yr . old computer does n't support anything in 3D . A new card driver would cost anywhere from $ 75 to $ 200 . That 's a lot of money to run a $ 13 game . So , I have n't decided -- although the game does look cute from the box cover !!
 This game can get very boring . It 's very confusing and hard to control . It is sooooo frustrating !!!!!!!!! The instruction booklet does n't come in handy either . Like some other people , I only got rabbits too . I bought this game because I wanted to heal cats and horses . But , only rabbits came . Buying this game was a big mistake . It is reallly no fun . Do n't waste your money on this game . I gave up about a month ago . I 've left it on the shelf and have n't touched it since .
 I bought this as a gift . They are having many problems with it , and will probably need to send it back to me so that I may return it .
 This is the most overrated software I have used . I kept hearing from Sibelius adds about how much easier it was to use than Finale and that it could do the same things that Finale could do . Wrong ! First of all , you basically have to have a MIDI keyboard to get any decent input at all . It 's not like Finale where you can get around without a keyboard . The output looks like something that came from my old sequencer programs . You also have to make sure that you do everything perfect the first time and do n't change your mind because editing parts of the score is probably the most difficult feat to accomplish in Sibelius . They even pop up warnings letting you know that you ca n't undo some things.The interface is amateurish and made for kids to use . Every score you make looks the same and it is difficult to add your own personal touches . I much prefer Finale which gives me the power to do anything I could want to do . Finale takes a bit longer to learn because it is more complex and , like anything that is worth learning , it just takes some practice . I would only suggest buying Sibelius if you just write music as a hobby and not as a profession -LRB- only if you ca n't find a copy of Finale -RRB- .
 Do n't spend your money on this terrible software . It is a bit easier to use then some programs , but the use is annoying . The worst part is their tech support . They are arrogant and never help you with your Sibelius problems . Do n't bother even calling .
 Very pretty interface design , but I purchase software to get a job done . Unfortunately Sibelius 2 is too slow to be used as a music engraving tool . And contrary to their slick advertising copy , you ca n't get much done out of the box without studying the manuals in detail . I think I 'll leave this one to the amateurs and the wannabes.The best , and still champion , in this category is MakeMusic 's Finale 2003 .
 I purchased Sound Forge 6 on the recommendation of a friend . It seems to work pretty well on XP , no real hassles , did n't need the manual much at all as its pretty intuitive . You can have multiple files in different sampling frequencies open and cut/paste , make modifications like envelope and echo , quick fade out , etc.Its not a full featured effects editor , I ca n't for instance specify a point in the file and say I want this to be at exactly 3.5 seconds in and I do wish it did multi-track so I could more easily line up sounds before merging them together . It also does n't have a very good system for handling sampling frequency changes while cutting and pasting , it does tell you that the 2 files are different but fails to give you a `` make it right '' option , forcing you to cancel , then go figure out what the sample rate on the original was , then switch to the 2nd file , open its sample rate change dialog and type in that number . . Then the bad news happened . It had occasionally asked for registration during startup but all the `` do you want to register '' screen offered if I registered was that they would send me promotional materials , so I passed . Then one day the software informed me that the files -LRB- mp3 -RRB- that I had saved yesterday could no longer be opened until I registered the software ! I think this is a really lousy policy on their part . Plus they admit -LRB- quoted from the privacy policy -RRB- `` Sonic Foundry may from time to time share or provide your identifiable contact information to approved third parties '' and have a big `` Digital Marketing Associates '' logo right on their privacy page . They do offer a `` opt out '' feature but its really hard to find and understand ... being embedded in a generic `` customer service form '' that says `` your message '' and `` Submitting Customer Service request through this form will significantly delay a response . `` While it is not an excessive to require that customers register the software , I feel that Sony Pictures Digital -LRB- which is where you end up when going to Sonic Foundrys privacy page -RRB- should tell them upfront that the software will cripple itself unless they are registered
 I ordered this CD-ROM dictionary but alas it would not install . I tried to use it but it gave me a hard time trying to register it . Although it said registration was an option , it failed to skip that phase . When I ran my anti-spyware programs , they suggested that I had picked up a lot of Spyware and Adware . So Buyer , please beware of this CD ROM .
 If you are looking for a well designed , effective , easy to use , reliable research tool/dictionary for your computer look elsewhere because The Pop-Up Oxford Dictionary of English is pathetic.Avoid this sad sad product . It is completely useless .
 The definitions and examples of use contain severe political bias.Also , the dictionary is not useful for spelling checking because if you type in the word as you think it is spelled it will just say no . This is unlike other dictionaries that will give you many suggestions of words slightly different in spelling than your erroneous one .
 The software does not allow the user to search for a list of closely spelled words . The software wil only find a word with the exact spelling . This is not like other dictionary software I have used . Some words , such as diarrhea , were not listed . It 's great if you want to place the cursor over a particular word and get the definition but that is where the products usefulness ends .
 I live in Mexico , and I do a lot of business through internet , so I have several dictionaries installed in my computer , but this one OXFORD DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH is by far the worst , the iFinger engine works only a few times , and very often the program suddenly `` NOT RESPOND '' , I prefer to uninstall this Dictionary . Please read all the costumer reviews whether You decide to buy it or not .
 If you only want to look up meanings of words with known spelling or which appear in text you are reading this is very good . However this is ALL I-Finger products do . It can be quite annoying in automatic look up mode since as you move your mouse the meaning of every word you move over instantly flashes up . When you move to a word to look up you may have to move your mouse over a dozen words and meanings will flash up one after the other . Unless you turn it off when you do n't want to look up a word you will have words flashing up all the time unless you find a blank spot for the cursor and do n't move your mouse . It can drive you nuts . It has no browse function so you can only look up words you know or see . Whilst it has a lot of words you can only look up words you know are in it . You must have it in book form to see all the words and their meanings . You can only ever see words that you click on or type in . When you open any book dictionary you can browse all the words looking at meanings . If you look up a word you often look up other words nearby in the book . It does not allow you to do any form of wildcard search and it does not look up words which are spelt differently to what you type in . You can not get lists of words with -LRB- say -RRB- a common prefix or any other pattern .
 The dictionary itself is great what is a high risk is iFinger.I 've just lost the licenses for 2 dictionaries I bought at www.iFinger.com on '06 because I 've needed to reinstall them under Win2k pro ; it seems any re-installation depends on www.iFinger.com willingness to run an online validation procedure which is not available for my products anymore as they 've been declared ` obsolete ' -LRB- ? -RRB- . iFinger instructs their clients to keep backup of registry and product data but is useless because you are tied forever to ther online procedures ; if you need to re-install for any reason you 'll LOSE ALL LICENCES whenever iFinger decides so !! . iFinger
 Starting with the good aspect of New Oxford Dictionary of English , it contains 350,000 words and is unquestionally the best English dictionary available on a single CD today.The interface itself is intolerable -LRB- even offensive -RRB- , so much so that I have deleted this dictionary from my system . Why can iFinger not create an interface that will remember its settings ? Through correspondence with iFinger `` support '' -LRB- which is not really support at all -RRB- , I have discovered iFinger has no intention of creating a decent interface which must , by definition , remember its settings.The iFinger interface is completely sad given the quality of the New -LRB- 350,000 word -RRB- Oxford Dictionary of English.My recommendation
 this is a very old crap they are still supplying in the web without update . It interferes with Vista and internet explorer . it would not work . I can not update it , it is useless now.they should provide update with the same license code .
 After Effects is a good product for the industry , but for a person such as a student , this product is much too pricey . Luckily I have had the chance to work a little with this product without having to foot the bill on my own . After effects does n't compare to any other graphics product on the market . Its tools help to create realistic quality graphics , which are out of this world . If you have a chance to use this product without paying out of your own pocket , do it .
 A friend of mine who is from Africa -LRB- living in Dallas , Tx . -RRB- bought the software and installed it . He found that he could no longer access the internet ! So he had to uninstall it . Sad , because he really needs it -LRB- he 's more fluent in French than English . -RRB- I 'm always suspicious of software that says it will work with Win95 ! I mean , what 's with that?I 've been researching to see if anyone else had trouble .
 I bought it for less than $ 7 so I did n't have any expectations and did n't feel like spending the time to get it refunded .
 It is hard to find from the advertised product information that it will not work with Vista .
 The Oxford Duden German Dictionary which I purchased is not compatible with Windows 7 . This information is , I believe , available in very small print in the Amazon ads , and it is also available on the CD , again in very small print . It would be helpful if it could be made more prominent . I should imagine that several people who buy this software would have Windows 7 . Buyer beware
 It is ok to get it if you just have to pay maybe 5 dollars or less , and do n't mind if it does not work like you were led to believe . I tried to download one dictionary -LRB- Spanish -RRB- after my computer crashed , and it would not download a second time . My German one eventually stopping functioning , as if the producer planned it that way to get me to buy something more expensive .
 If you look , you 'll see that FreeHand has the same number of `` features '' that Illustrator has . However , each of the features in Illustrator is SO much more deep than those in FreeHand . For instance , transparency in FreeHand is limited to solid colors of individual paths , and you can only stack a certain number -LRB- 3 ? -RRB- of transparent paths on top of each other . Compare that to Illustrator , where transparency can be applied to anything , from text to paths to pixel images . And Gradients , and mesh . And just the stroke or the fill -LRB- and to mulitple strokes and fills on the same object -RRB- . Or to groups or layers . And then there 's all the Photoshop blending modes like lighten , hue , difference and more . And opacity masks.Maybe `` half '' is giving FreeHand too much credit .
 I am working on a Power Machintosh G3 with Mac OS 9.2 . Having used Freehand 5.5 for several years I was looking forward to upgrading to a more functional version . I specifically needed the new function of creating PDF files.None of my expectations of FH10 have been met.Exported PDF files are incomplete . Items are dropped without any discernible reason . This makes the function useless except for base preliminary review purposes.The exporting functions get hung up and it is necessary to toggle over to the finder to get the export to finish.The application runs slow . It takes a full second to change over tools which leave me magnifying when I try to drag , editing text when I am trying to draw a line and pulling objects off the page when I was reorienting the view window manually.The basic key command , Command -LRB- . -RRB- to stop and action , no longer stops anything that I have used it on even though it is referred to in the action window.I have lost two major files due to application failures . One corruption was due to a crash and a second corruption of a file that occurred after saving it . These two failures alone have cost me days of labor . Saving the files regularly does no good if the file itself is corrupted due to some programming error.I am running 4 times the requested memory for the application . That translates to 15 times my largest file . It cuts into my use of other applications for no increase in utility . There must be a big hole in the program regarding memory management as there is one files I can not open `` out of memory '' even though it is a small fraction of the application memory allocated.To put the icing on this , customer support now requires hours of searching tech notes , which seem to be users comments , or paying to get information on a product they seemingly have not finished .
 If you are looking for a good source for quotations stay away from the `` Pop-up Oxford Dictionary of Quotations '' - shame on Oxford for allowing their prestigious name to be placed on such a terrible program . The first thing that bothered me was that the print displayed on the monitor is tiny and the software can not be corrected for the impediment . Second , you must simply have 20/20 eyesight or accustom yourself to using a magnifying glass while you use this program . Third , after you take out the magnifier or strain your eyes , you can read either the error messages or the software 's lack of sufficient quotations . I did not wait for the fourth reason - I uninstalled the software . I would not waste or through away money on this program - I 'm sorry I did .
 Too many words come up `` No Result Found . '' I find myself going back to Microsoft Word 's Thesuarus time and time again .
 I tried to install this thesaurus and it would not install , include in compatibility mode . I called the vendor and got a run around
 I used to love love love this product.But it is not compatible with Windows Vista . I had it working for the longest time and it was fine . All of a sudden , it stopped working.Reinstalled and I 've used the `` compatibility wizard '' several times trying to get it to work.My favorite Thesaurus is no longer accessible.If you have anything later than Windows NT or Windows 2000 , do n't buy this . Find something else newer that is compatible with your operating system .
 I do n't like the software , it 's not compatible with the the Oxford English Dictionary software that I previously bought . It 's not clear that it is n't actually from the Oxford series . It does work , but to use with the dictionary when writing a paper you have to have two programs running instead of just one . It 's just inconvenient . If you are n't going to use it with another software then it works fine , except that I do n't like the layout of the window ... I just do n't like it . But it works .
 Dont waste your money . the games are to complicated for 2-3 graders . The act of moving the block and your figure around is the problem . I had a hard time figuring out the game . Stick with jumpsart games . They are better .
 Although the age category begins at 6 for this game , my 7 year old -LRB- and I must confess , I too -RRB- find this game montonous and frustrating . The reason is the inability to quick save during the game ... You can only save a game after you successfully complete each level.If you are in the middle or even near the end of a level , and you run the misfortune of using up your last life , you are brought back to the beginning of that level ... TOO MUCH JUMPING OVER WATER !!! My son loved the movie , but has given up on this game ... Disney needs to go back to the drawing board on this one ...
 I do n't think Disney Interactive has a Quality Assurance department . The usability of the game is awful . There is an option to reconfigure the controls , but it 's still difficult . I have yet to figure out how to save the game . Supposedly you can do it between levels , but I have n't figured out how . There are simple graphical errors that should have been fixed pre-beta . When you finish a level , a box appears in the middle of the screen , so you ca n't see what Lilo or Stitch are doing when they 've completed their task . Based upon the movement of the surroundings , it looks like they 're doing something or walking somewhere . I would n't know , I can ' t see them . Over-all , thumbs down . But my three year old loves it . Too bad I have to play it so much , because he ca n't jump over all that water .
 Ah , I can just imagine the project manager at Disney Interactive
 Disney is n't known for great games -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- , but they hit an all-time low with this one . The game controls are awkward , and the software would n't even run properly on our Windows XP computer . However , the biggest disappointment was with the graphics , which are incredibly bad . I feel that this game is a complete rip-off and should be avoided unless you really want to give a present to a someone that you do n't like -LRB- heck , that would be too cruel -RRB- .
 What a great company Disney is - What a cute title Lilo & Stitch `` Trouble in Paradice '' for ages 7 + - I only wished there was some way I could get my money back - I tried to play it - I am 50 + the controls are VERY HARD to figure out - to easy to get yourself `` killed '' - my 8 year old grandson was so disappointed - the graphics are a little bit to `` square-ish '' but cute but that is about all it has going for it - I have opened my copy so I know I ca n't send it back to `` Toyrus '' - if only I could I would request my money back - I do n't understand why Disney has to make all of controls on their games so hard - I also do n't understand why places like Toyrus cann ' t list the `` controler '' useage in their write up - if they had of and I knew it was all keyboard controled I know I WOULD NOT have waisted my money on it - unless you are a `` die-hard '' Disney fan - SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!
 I ca n't belive you people can like this game ... Take my advice and do n't buy this game .
 I bought this game for my 3 1/2 year old . She plays all kinds of games from Pajama Sam -LRB- our favorite -RRB- to Quake III -LRB- without the bad guys -RRB- and Dinosaur 3D adventure . She tried it for 20 minutes and has never asked to play it again . For some of that time I `` helped '' her . It turns out that I was n't much help . The game play is poor . It 's either extremely easy or very difficult to finish the games . The instructions are done in voices from the movie , using alot of slang and words which young people would not understand . There are also several problems where it becomes impossible to finish due to programming errors . The frustrating thing is that you ca n't move on to the next section unless you complete the previous sections -LRB- some of them have to be completed 3 times !! -RRB- The bottom line ... this game was not designed well , period . It was also not tested well . With so many other GREAT games out there , I would never recommend this one . Disney should be ashamed to be associated with this product .
 This is probably the worst game my child has owned . It is less imaginative than I would expect for a $ 20 game from Disney . Gameplay is way to hard for a 4-5 year old . My 4 1/2 year old boy has enjoyed other disney games as well as the Reader Rabbit series , Tonka Games , and Starflyers games ... but when playing this one he actually started crying and hit himself on the head in frustration . At that point I took the helm and realized that the game was very difficult to play . For example ... in one game you need to feed coffee to Stitch in order to drive a car , but the coffee bottle is about 80 pixels wide and the target area to click is only about 5 pixels wide and is totally obscured by the bottle icon , making this very frustrating . The graphics are poor . The games are boring . There is nothing redeeming about this game . For shame , Disney ... this game is a terrible thing to do to a child .
 Save your money , this game is bad . Even my 5 year old said she did n't like it . Some parts were too hard , some parts were stupidly easy/boring . Mr. Bubbles voice over gets really really old . He talks so slow and deep and you got ta sit though it to figure out what to do next . Honestly , I would be embarassed if my name was on this box .
 I purchased this game and was very disappointed . I can usually count on Disney for quality but either the games are too hard or to simple . My kids own almost every Disney game for the computer and this one has to be one of the worst . We loved the movie but the game just is n't worth the money .
 Do not waste your money on this horrible game !!! There 's no reward and you have a really hard time quitting the game once it 's started . Do not buy this game !!!
 This version is not running on the new apple software 2012 . They should give the advice instead of telling that works on later versions ... I would prefer to buy this direct on the apple store
 First , the programs are fine . Word could run a little faster , and Powerpoint could do a little more than pictures , sound , and text . The real problem is with the licenses . It comes with three different product keys , and I used all three of them , no more than the legal amount . However , since all of the computers with Office share the same network , if one tries to open any Office program while another is running one , it tells you `` Microsoft Office 2004 is already in use and can not be started . An office program is already being used by -LRB- insert name -RRB- . '' We might as well just have one computer with Office on it . Thanks , Microsoft ! I payed you $ 150 for three programs !
 This Office 2004 has been a problem . I will get my software at the Apple store in the future .
 This is barely passable as BETA software considering the number of issues/bugs etc. . I 've encountered in only a few days of use . But first , the good : Excellent e-mail view in EntourageSuperb PowerPoint presenter tools for multiple display capable PB 's etc.Compatibility report is great for ensuring ease of sharing filesEasy import of Apple Mail messages/settings/rules etc.Excel Print layout view is a good addition -LRB- about time ! -RRB- The BAD : Entourage crashes on both my installed Macs when trying to change fonts in an HTML e-mail or SignatureEntourage sync Conduit for Palm devices crashes Hotsync Manager . Will not sync.Must manually approve both image & attachment download for all Messages.Excel required Re-install after trying to open Entourage Excel attachment.Entourage drops IMAP password CONSTANTLY
 I rated this 1 star just for the people are reading the 1 star reviews . What do people in 2009 , 2010 , and even 2011 expect from software designed in 2004 ? I had the 2004 software and have sense upgraded and i am here to tell you that if you do n't want to have 2004 bugs do n't buy 2004 software . People are not so bright sometimes . I suggest you buy the 2008 or newer software .
 From my point of view , Microsoft 's Word and Excel are de facto standards . Without them my work is much more difficult .
 I thought the previous version looks better and even works better . I noticed only very few minor changes that did n't make this one better for me . But may be it 's just me ... : -RRB-
 Why send me this ? The product has not been received ! The software was to be shipped to my son at the University of New Orleans . Despite my requests , no one would redirect to our home address.Given the state of the New Orleans , surely you realize that we have not had the opportunity to review this product.If I ever get this software , for which I have already been charged , I will never do business with Amazon again . Period .
 First let me tell you right now that I am and have been for several years a beta tester for Microsoft , MSN , ETC.The beta of Office 2004 was BETTER than this piece of crappola.Stay away from MS products . The program has what look to be great features , but let me assure you that is crashes , is slow , is full of bugs , and I HATE IT.Did I make myself clear enought ?
 Slow . Unbelievably S L O W. And forget the functionality . If you ever seriously used Excel or Powerpoint on a Windows XP machine , you will be severely disappointed -- the functions just are n't there in the Mac version . And if they do show up , they often simply do n't work . This product is a joke perpetrated on Mac users . Do n't waste your time .
 I bought this version of Micrdosoft Word because I thought the label , Teaachers and Students , meant it included the education discount to which I am entitled . I can see why it might be useful to a student , but I hate it . It takes extra steps to do what I want and I can not get the things I want . As soon as I can afford te replace it , I will .
 I liked my old version of Word better . I had a very difficult time finding the spell-check icon for the toolbar , yet things like `` Insert No Smoking Symbol '' were available . -LRB- Finally found it ... Silly me to think that `` All Commands '' might actually contain * ALL * the possible commands ! -LRB- FYI it is under `` Tools '' -LRB- I am of course talking about the `` customize toolbar commands menu . `` Also , if you * do * need to call Microsoft , be prepared to spell your name 6 times to the friendly person in Calcutta who ca n't understand your accent . I finally had to have a friend who spoke Hindi call!C ` est La Vie . Let 's face it . Office for Mac is a necessary evil .
 Unfortunately I am not too pleased with this product because it seems to have adversely affected my mac . I have been unable to get msn messenger and my online access has slowed down & my primary email has taken on all sorts of weird quirks.Perhaps it 's just too much product for me . I am a luddite in these matters so I 'm not the best person to ask.I can , however access more attachments , files etc so I 'll reserve final judgement
 Unless you NEED excel , I find iWork to be a much better product . Keynote 's presentations look far superior , so much so that Keynote was used exclusively in Gore 's Inconvenient Truth . Regardless of your politics , I 'd like to see Power Point do half as well in such a demanding environment -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- . Pages is excellent once you discover the `` inspector . '' The only reason I would get Office is for Excel , which I did . So excel , gets the nod , but as for everything else , try iWork !
 I purchased this because my trial software on my new IMAC had run out . I figured that since I used Microsoft Office for years on the PC , the best bet was this program . While it does do the basic Microsoft Office things , It also runs slow and crashes my nearly un-crashable computer . Also , the conversion between MAC and PC platforms is not very user-friendly , especially when it comes to using Powerpoint . If you only have text , then fine , but any addition of audio or video , you 'll have trouble and will most likely have to download some free program to convert your files to PC friendly ones -LRB- which then might not play on your MAC -RRB- . It 's not my favorite program and the fact that it runs slow and might crash on me , makes me worry every time I use it . That said , I use it quite often and ca n't complain about the final product when on my own MAC .
 I bought Office 2004 for the Mac as an upgrade to Office X , even though I was not really having any problems with the older version . Office 2004 has been nothing but problems . Excel and Word crash more frequently . There are random but frequent hard drive accesses for no apparent reason . There are problems with removing password protection of Excel files . Worst of all are the font-related bugs in Word that are even worse in Excel . Excel 2004 screws up the letter spacing of fonts as well as line spacing for wrapped text . Everything is bigger by 10-30 % . This does n't seem to be a problem at first , especially if you are only entering single words or short strings into individual cells . However , I have dozens of forms that were laid out in Excel X that include wrapped text in merged cells . If I open these documents in Excel 2004 , the font spacing is all screwed up , requiring complete readjustment of each form . Even worse , Excel 2004 is not WYSIWYG . The screen layout is n't the same as what gets printed . I find this wholly unacceptable for a major business suite , especially when it worked OK in the previous version . Do n't be fooled by Microsoft 's promise of bug fixes in their recently released Service Pack 1 for Office 2004 . They may have fixed a few bugs but not the major ones I have issues with . Check out the comments by users at Macintouch.com , under Office 2004 . As for me , I intend to uninstall Office 2004 if possible and reinstall Office X.
 Yeah , the title for this review sounds like a law firm . Sadly , there 's nothing particularly funny about Office 2004 . I bought it primarily for Microsoft Word , and have been very frustrated with the program 's tendency to crash almost every time I use it . Additionally , there are so many -LRB- ahem -RRB- `` features '' that the program has become very difficult to use . Whenever possible , I use Word 5.1 , which seemed to hit the sweet spot of usefulness and stability . Word 2004 just is n't stable enough for me to trust major projects to .
 The instructions are almost useless ! One has to find out things by trial and error .
 I just brought this along with Endnote 7 for MAC which works fine with Office X. Endnote 7 does not work with Word 2004mac however so I now need to buy Office X and try and return 2004 . I have talked to Endnote and they ca n't seem to solve the issue so it wo n't be resolved until Endnote 8 comes out -LRB- whenever that is -RRB- . I have to write alot of scientific papers so need my endnote library . This is a warning to any students/professors/scientists . Do not buy this ... stick with the old office X.
 First , if you are a professor or a student , you can probably buy this through your university bookstore or on-campus computer store for 60 dollars . I 'm at UCBerkeley and that 's what it costs here.Second , once you 've installed it , do n't even bother registering it because it is not necessary in order to receive the upgrades . It took me 4 days dealing with some of the most catatonic `` Customer Service '' people in the history of the concept before I learned this fact -LRB- I did n't feel like joining `` Passport Network '' just to register my software . -RRB- You 'd probably fare better with a geeky 12 year old little brother and the undernet , if you know what I mean.The programs themselves work well , -LRB- at least -LSB- Word -RSB- -RRB- AFTER you turn off all the `` AutoCorrect '' crap . Still , annoying are the little visual flourishes that pop up anytime you do something remotely different than what Microsoft thinks you should do . I do n't need alot of `` visual stimulation '' when I write , so why does there need to be a little blue inchwormish thing creeping across the screen everytime I accidentally type `` nad '' instead of `` and '' ? And I hate the little dime-sized square things that pop up everytime I paste something , etc. . I understand that for Microsoft 's main customer base -- people that work in gray cubicles , all the pretty colors might really make the day seem alittle less fascist , but when you are trying to write a dissertation , or a love letter , or your last will and testament , all the annoying pop-ups become intolerable . This is a Word program , NOT Super Mario Brothers after all ! I constantly feel like I am having to `` Slay '' things to get them to disappear from the screen . And not in a good `` Buffy '' kind of way , either.At least they got rid of the annoying `` Paperclip-shaped helper guy '' that was always irritating and creepy like the `` Hamburger Helper '' hand.REALLY , the ONE STAR has mostly to do with the absolute lack of anything remotely resembling customer service . But hey , Bill Gates just got a raise ! Ugh .
 I went to Apple because I wanted to escape the clutches -LRB- and glitches -RRB- of Microsoft . I got this program suite because I though I 'd need it to work on . doc and . xls projects . Well , I was wrong ! I downloaded a freeware program called NeoOffice and found that there was practically nothing I could do with Microsoft Office that I could n't do as well or even more easily with NeoOffice . In fact , I have , several times -LRB- more than a dozen , but I 'm not keeping count -RRB- , received e-mailed PowerPoint presentations that PowerPoint could n't open , but that I could open and work with NeoOffice . And Office makes you work hard to find the commands you want because they do n't travel with the document and do n't work the same way that other common Mac products work , so I 'm looking around 2 screens trying to find the command set that I need to use . No such problem with NeoOffice.The only times my computer has frozen has been when I was working with Microsoft Office for Mac .
 i searched many programs , looking for a simple way to capture my own video from vcr , camera or t.v. and then record it back to the vcr or cd . This is n't the program . I searched the manual -LRB- very nice -RRB- but it does n't enabale you to record back to your vcr -- so I am returning it .
 ... then do n't try to use it . I 've been waiting a month for any response from thier technical support . The documentation is hysterically bad . There are sections describing how to use one 's mouse and what `` selecting '' means , and the rest of it is diabolically confused . There 's never any indication of where functions being discussed are found , how to interpret the constantly shifting barrage of hybrid computer hardware/technical recording industry/made-up control name terminology , or ... really , anything . It 's useless . Several of the keyboard commands do n't work , the icons are impossible to interpret , and there 's no way to guess what parts of the intricate interface are active and which are merely display . If you have weeks and weeks of time on end , as I do at the moment , to play with it , and are masochistic , like me , then by all means purchase this product .
 After installing the Magix music studio into our computer we soon wished we never had ! -LRB- pc -RRB- The digital audio recording did n't work well
 This game worked fine for about a day , then it woud n't load for play.I was really disappointed.I have n't had a chance to return it , it 's been awhile since purchasing it.I hope I can.I really wanted to play it .
 This is definitely the poorest flying game . The quality of image is bad and the audio effect is worse .
 I tried 2 different disks , would not run . I am well within the minimum required . Tech support is pathetic . Avoid if you cant return it .
 This game looks great - it has a wide following of players with web sites and great tips and tricks . Unfortunately I ca n't get it to run on any of my three PC 's ! My primary PC is a Dell P4 with a GeForce 4 card - game runs intro and then pops back to Windows . Does the same on my secondary machine and my laptop . Go out to UBI 's site , and guess what - they do n't support this game anymore . Go out to a fan site ... and find a list of many other gamers with the same problem , so it 's a known bug that the developer just does n't feel like fixing or supporting ! So if you plan to get this game , good luck , MAYBE it will work for you . If not , do n't expect support from the developer - they want you to buy the next version .
 While the program has a good database of exercises -LRB- with a lot with cool demo 's -RRB- and nutrition , it 's hard to navigate and has a bad interface . The program window is a fixed size and text overlaps . The programmer 's solution is to change your screen size !!! I like my screen the way it is and wo n't change it to run just this program ! I set up my exercise plan and found that it was time-consuming to manipulate . For instance , for three sets of one exercise , you have to click several things to get the exercise to show up and then repeat the process two more times instead of allowing for a copy/paste . I tried to print my plan and I got one page that had the days on it and the second page had the last third of my workout on it . It comes preset with a calories burned report and the ability to customize other reports . Again , a time-consuming process involving multiple clicks . To sum up
 I bought this program when I had a Palm IIIc . I raved about it . It was a great program until I upgraded to a palm T3 . I have emailed Tech support 5 times with no response . They are NON EXISTANT ! The program still works on my desktop but will not funtion on the T3 . Do n't waste your money !
 Got the desktop/palm software 1-2 years ago . It works okay , and does basically what I want it to . But , as far as I can tell , the company has flatlined . No new software updates , no enhancements to their product since it came out . And $ 50 is way too steep . I feel duped . Try something like Diet & Exercise Assistant 5.0 , at palmgear.com . It 's only $ 15-20 .
 It is a very interesting piece of software ... BUT the company does not support the product in any way ... no tech support , noproblem resolution , no product updates , need I go on ??????
 This is a horribly laid out program . After one goes through and enters values of weight , routine , physical measurements , etc. , it does not compute a regiment for you . I 'm waiting for the new Fred `` Dr. Squat '' Hatfield program to come out later this year . The company that carried his previous program , `` BodyCraft '' discontinued the contract a few years ago . Stay away from this Vivonic garbage !
 After using Disney Interactive 's Phonics Quest , which I think is the best of the dozen-or-so titles of early-elementary-school-age software I 've tried , I looked forward to using the Kindergarten software from the same vendor . However , my five-year-old and I were immediately frustrated.To start with , if your default disk for Windows is anything other than c : , this software crashes . That 's an indication of badly-engineered code.But it is n't just attention to detail to software engineering that makes this program a bust . The way that the kid interacts with it is confusing and boring . It comes nowhere close to matching the interest generated by the other three kindergarten titles we 've tried
 Visually it looked like it was going to be a great game/learning tool . The difficulty stars at the bottom were a nice touch . But the repetitiveness of the exercises was awful . I will have to try some of the other recommendations .
 We were very dissapointed in this game . Many of the activities are exactly the same and my child quickly tired of them . To earn `` rewards '' she had to answer so many questions -LRB- more than I could sit through -RRB- that she wanted to move on before completing the task . We would recommend the Jumpstart series instead .
 We were very displeased with this product ! We could not get it to run . We contacted the Lego Company about the problem with no response . My son loves Legos and enjoys his Lego Racers 2 game . We were very disappointed that the Extreme Stunts would not work .
 If there was a 0 star rating ... this would get it.Yes ... L-L-L-Lego was stuttered over and over ... and over again in the first version of this horrid series of PC games . After years of hating the first dismal wreck of a game ... we felt like we 'd take a chance on the series again.Well , guess what . It crashes and burns just like the earlier games in the series . Stay away . FAR away !!
 Recommendation
 I purchased this software after trying the free demo which worked fine . However , once I installed the software , I was not able to see any of my CD/DVD drives at all . I had to restore my computer to a previous state in order to recover , which of course uninstalled the product . I also contacted customer support with no reply . Note to all who purchase , their claim of 24 hour support is an absolute lie .
 This product does n't see my DVD burner . When I went to the website , it list about 1,000 dvd burners that are supported , but only 1 is an I/O Magic . Mine is n't on the list . Also , must download update to back up protected discs , if your burner is supported .
 This product sucks it failed to work with my episodic disc collection . Could n't get any support either , went to there website fired off a mail and never got a reply . WASTE OF MONEY !
 Do n't waste your money on this -LRB- especially if your player is a Sony -RRB- . Tried to backup one of my favorite DVDs to preserve the original , and it would n't play on the Sony -LRB- did play on the computer , however -RRB- . Went to the site , read all the information in the FAQ section pertaining to my problem , could n't resolve it , so I emailed them . After three emails , none of which I think they actually read -LRB- the first reply was a word for word copy of the FAQ section ! -RRB- , I was told my burner was n't supported , and to either wait until it was , or return the product to the store .
 Purchased this item so I could keep the back ups in the van , every time I tried to copy a dvd , it said it was copyrighted and could not perform the command .
 I bought this for my two year old son after he fell in love with , and practically wore out , Winnie the Pooh 's ABCs . This game , however , turned out to be very dissapointing.First - it has issues running under Windows 95 . For starters , it requires you to run in 256 colors instead of 16 bit color , so it is necessary to change video modes every time we switch in or out of this game . Also - the sound track is not very high quality - it has scratchy moments , and some sounds do n't play at all.Second - the game just is n't as good as other childrens games out there . It is n't as educational as Winnie the Pooh 's ABC 's or 123 's . Its more like a bunch of little animated movies that occasionally have clickable things to do.I would n't advise purchasing this game - I 'd suggest getting instead Winnie the Pooh 's ABC 's and/or Winnie the Pooh 's 123 's . Blue 's ABC Time Activies is also a much more interactive and educational game .
 The 5505 is a great firewall , BUT , if you pay this much for a 10 user bundle then you are a fool , on the best day of the week you should not be paying more than $ 350 at MOST for this unit.Let the Buyer Beware !!!!!!!!! and also let the buyer look around for a better price.wow , $ 1,200 , seriously ? I am in the wrong business obviously .
 Let 's start with what works . MPEG-1 capture works . But if that 's all you want , then there are cheaper products available . Video capture at higher resolution is unreliable . Expect plenty of bad frames . Conversion between different formats is buggy . The video editing software is substandard and chock full of bugs . The box claims that DVDComplete is included , but it really should be called DVDIncomplete because it 's just a `` lite '' version . It is not much more than an advertisement for the really thing -LRB- available for extra cost from Dazzle . -RRB- On top of that , DVDComplete tends to choke on ~ 50 % of the captured files . -LRB- Ulead 's authoring and editing software had no such problems with the same files . -RRB- The OnDVD program did n't even install . Customer Support can be characterized by the old joke
 DAZZLE HAS GOT TO BE THE WORSE COMPANY ON EARTH . BOTH IN PRODUCT QUALITY , AND ESPECIALLY SERVICE . FIRST YOU CA N'T CONTACT ANYONE ON LINE . THEY WANT YOU TO JOIN . SO YOU JOIN . THEN YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD , AND IT DO N'T WORK . THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH TO CONTACT LIVE SUPPORT ON LINE . A FEW YEARS AGO I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT , THE dazzle dig.vid.creator 85 . IT WORKED BRIEFLY BUT THEN SAID I NEEDED DIFFERENT DRIVERS . THE JERK I TALKED TO ACTUALLY TOLD ME HE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE BOTHERED WITH LITTLE REQUESTS LIKE THAT . SO I JUST GIVE UP ON THEM . I TRIED IT AGAIN TONIGHT , AND NOW I CA N'T GET ANYONE AT ALL . DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM DAZZLE OR PINNACLE ! -LRB- usually I 'm much more polite -RRB- Pinnacle DVD Maker Plus Quickly Transfer Vhs Tapes To Dvd
 While the instructions read simple to use , I find it not that way . I have yet to get the CD # 354 to perform as expected , according to the instructions .
 Could not get to work with computer , need to return . Another person had purchased this and it did n't work either .
 Endnote X was made typing research paper an enjoyable task . It is user friendly with its keyboard shortcuts and technical support assistance . This was the first time I have used citation software and Endnote X made it easy for me to concentrate on the art of writing instead of shuffling through the APA manual to accurately cite a reference . IT IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANY STUDENT !
 This is not compatible with office 2008 . Tech support just says use an earlier version of office , a pretty expensive solution if you do n't own an earlier version of office . Refman by same company so beware .
 I should have known better . It is easier to learn and remember the various systems used for footnoting and bibliographies than it is to get this product to work properly . You 'll spend more time tweaking the program than you would just writing the things out yourself !
 Do n't purchase this product for the following reasons
 This program is fine for pre-made puzzles , but I was never able to figure out any way to enter words to create my own puzzles . The box said you could , but I could n't find a way to do it .
 Almost everything you would ever want to do with MS Office can be done with other tools -LRB- like Open Office -RRB- which are FREE or cost substantially less.I 've been a Mac user since the very first Mac came out -LRB- 1984 -RRB- . I avoid most Microsoft products because they have become bloated , slow and difficult to use.Want to waste your money by buying this , then waste your time trying to navigate the counter-intuitive functionality ? - Go ahead . But do n't say you were n't warned !
 I do n't understand why anyone would bother spending over $ 400 for Microsoft Office for Mac . Openoffice 2 is now available FREE -LRB- as always -RRB-
 I have been unable to upgrade my Excel 98 1 version with this product . I hope I can somehow either get it to work or else get back my money .
 ... even though a quick linguistic entropy analysis might suggest that all three 5-star reviews were written by the same person . Hmm .
 I have appreciated and enjoyed Quicken ever since version 1.0 . I 've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on upgrades . It has really helped me organize and monitor my finances . I used to be a fanatic Quicken fan -- that is , until I purchased Quicken 2002 Deluxe as part of Quicken 2002 Suite . I found that the program ran much slower than the previous version , the net worth reports and graphs did n't work at all , and I can not customize reports since I continue to get `` Not enough memory to customize reports '' error messages . Since I have 512M of RAM and Quicken is the only app open I do n't believe this is my problem . I reported a bug for each of these problems and could find no information on the online help . I thought I would try and see if there was some patch or workaround direct from Intuit . Little did I know this was the beginning of the end of my relationship with Intuit.After some work I found the help numbers which stated there could be a -LSB- per -RSB- / minute charge for assistance . However , if the problem was a defect the call would be at no charge ... So far , so good . The operator who answered my call took down some information and told me I would need to give her my credit card number before speaking to the product support engineer , and that the engineer would make the determination whether this was a defect and then inform me that the timer was started . A bit leery , I passed along the credit card info and was connected . The engineer asked me if I was aware that a charge could apply to this call -- I said yes , only after he started the timer . He then informed me he was starting the timer ! You can imagine my frustration went instantly to the boiling point ! I immediately told him the program was defective , that I was not going to pay -LSB- a per -RSB- minute -LSB- charge -RSB- to help them figure it out , GOOD BYE ! I am truly not the kind of person who hangs up on anyone , but with a problem that I believe a defect on their part , it was absolute insult to injury to have to pay for it .2002 Quicken Suite buyers beware ! There may be other issues you have with this program and you will be completely at Intuit 's mercy.I doubt I will ever buy an Intuit product again .
 I give this product a big fat D minus ! It is so slow and clunky , that It 's hard to believe ! Where shall I begin?I 've been creating tables of six columns , each has some text in it . It is NOT POSSIBLE to lock the column widths , so that during the writing and edit process , the columns are not accidently resized , which happens a lot , because of the inaccuracy of the program.Secondly , it 's SO unbeliveably slow . I can type faster than the application can put the characters on the screen . It does n't even smoothly scroll , which is a nuisance . And , I 'm using a computer that plays full frame high definition video for editing without a problem , so I know it 's not that . -LRB- These problems happened on two seperate machines . -RRB- There are LOTS of bugs that do n't make sense . Several times , I 've gotten automatic page breaks , which become embedded in the text , and the only way to remove them , is to unformat the text in a clean document , then re-import it.Oh yeah , it crashes A LOT .99 % of the features make no sense , and are not intuitive . They are hard to set up and use properly , and usually makes a big mess of everything.Did I mention that it 's SLOW and crashes a lot ?
 Very diappointed that this did n't work with Windows Vista . My own fault , I just `` assumed '' it would when I bought it . Now it sits , open and unsuable , in my drawer . Learned my lesson !
 Really hoped that this would be a fun game for my 6YO son but , alas , I could n't get it to load and run on my PC . Tried all of the tricks that I found on-line from similar frustrated purchasers but ultimately could not get it to run . My son was -LRB- and still is -RRB- disappointed .
 Having previously used the computer version of Encarta , I thought I 'd try out the computer version of my classic Britannica . Yes , you can type in keywords and pull up resaonably well-written articles . The fun stops there . The articles contain few images
 EB own words
 I purchased Britannica because my children needed a vetted source for their high school assignments and their teachers would not accept Wikipedia . Unfortunately , Britannica 's coverage is too superficial to be of used . The entire product is contained on a single CD . The first topic I looked up was the New Deal ; Britannica gave it 674 words ; Wikipedia 11,871 . I looked up several others ; all with similar results . To me , Britannica is no more than a glorified dictionary . At that , Encarta is better.The product installed and functions without problem on Windows XP SP2 .
 i am underwhelmed with the dvd-rom from britannica . it ia a waste of timeand money . their main object is to sell britannica with snatches to createinterest.these dvd-roms should be sent free to arouse interest . i now owntwo dvds and both are unsatisfactory .
 Have tried about six times to install it . I 've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice , all to no avail . It says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings . It tells you to check the log . Well , there are over 85k entries and even if I found the errors I do n't see any way to correct the errors . When I try to run it I get `` starter MFC Application has encountered a problem and needs to close '' . I 'll be returning this puppy to Amazon for a replacement .
 I hoped to use this software for my wedding invitations , but the amount of postage I needed -LRB- 97 cents for a 2oz . square envelope -RRB- was not in their drop-down list of choices and you can not set your own postage amount . Part of the reason for buying this software would be to create stamps with unusual postage amounts , but it does not allow for that sort of customization .
 I bought 20 sheet of stamps from photostamps.com , The image of my stamps came out too dark so I returned the stamps . Per Photostamps.com website they will issue credit if you return it in 30days . However I did not get credit in my account after sending back the stamps . Their customer service told me that they will send me credit but they never did . I got same answer every time but never got my money back . I am very frustrated and eventually just gave up .
 Have been a customer of theirs for years , and have had a series of software compatability issues , but this last one , as of Mar 2011 is a real kicker . . after I upgraded from IE8 to IE9 -LRB- win7 64bit OR 32bit , I tried both -RRB- their software stopped working . . after a series of their folks worked with me and their own testing could n't reproduce the problem , they basically said , `` yr on yr own , '' instead of spending more time with me to isolate the issue , so that OTHER customers do n't have the same problem . . I canceled ... buggy UI , not enough resolve when the problem is n't immediately apparent to their support folks.They have had other similar problem solving technique when in a previous version , they stopped being able to print international labels , I give up . . USPS does the same thing for free and does n't cost $ 16 a month .
 I 'd give this no stars but it wo n't let me.Why would anyone buy this ? I was in Compusa today as they are closing down on Long Island & thought about buying this . I put it down & said I will researh this more at home . As I suspected , you can go to -LSB- ... -RSB- & do the same thing that this software does . The software does n't allow you to print stamps at home so what 's the point ? The only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps , so it 's like buying a -LSB- ... -RSB- coupon , that 's a one time use . I do n't get it ?
 Hmm , when I first got this program it worked fine which made me happy , but now it often crashes or just hangs midway through a burn . The lack of speed also started to irritate me . I 'm glad I got it for free after Amazon 's mail-in rebate -LRB- OK , I have yet to get the check ... -RRB- . I 've heard that DVD X Copy Xpress can fit * any * DVD movies into one DVD-R or - RW disc . Of course , owning that program has some legal issues that may come to bite you someday if RIAA decides to subpoena the names of people who bought it -LRB- and its cousin programs DVD X Copy , etc. -RRB- like they are doing with p2p file sharing right now .
 I buy this and wanted to make my DVD 's into VCD so I do n't damage my DVD 's while oversea 's and on military activation . But it does not allow coping of CSS DVD 's , which all the DVD 's that I have are ... Save your Money , , ...
 I buy this software expecting that solve a basic need , Copy DVD and CD , only for my personal use -LRB- backup -RRB- , when I see it , thinks , look good ... But ... . Oh deception , this software do n't copy anything !!!!!! , any DVD , any CD , any with a copyright , on resume , anything ... Is better never buy it ... If the 99.9 % of the comercial software that comes on CD or DVD have copyright , means that this software can copy only the 0.1 % of the existing software ... . And for that any software to copy cd 's can do it.Dont take the risk , is better never buy it ! .
 I have some free program that can do more then this program.I already have CD/DVD software that came with my burner drive .
 ver 7.0 No , this will not copy copyrighted DVDs . Pinnacle is well knowen for their infearior software . After reasearching this software , it seems to be a rework of a German developers software -LRB- I think its called Vob copy -RRB- Pinnacle was cheaper than the german ware , so I bought Pinnacle to own a disk and not download of the net . This is very buggy and hit and miss . It does not reconize my external Sony DVD burner half the time . And must reboot the computer a few times . This will happen after succesfull burning a DVD , I will have to reboot . I download the latest list of DVD burners and this did not help the problem.Next I download the newest and greatest version 8 . Now I am not having a hit or miss problem , It is just miss . Does not work at all.One thing everyone can count on is Pinnacle dependablity.They have releast another undependable buggy product.What makes me mad is , I knew better than to buy it .
 It 's true this software will copy dual layered DVD 's on to a 4.7 g DVD - + R / - + RW , but unfortunate it will NOT copy `` copy protected '' DVD videos . `` Copy protected '' DVD is nothing but a DVD with the `` copyright '' flag enable . 99.9 % of the DVDs in your local blockbuster is `` copyright '' aka `` copyprotected . `` Not that it 's impossible to copy those `` copy protected '' DVD , but Pinnacle systems has such a reputation , they will definitely not break the rule and let you copy those DVDs on their software .
 This is garbage . Do n't buy this . It ca n't copy any DVD . Not even a DVD out of a cereal box . And try getting support for it , HA HA . GOOD LUCK . They give you a number , that takes you to another number , that takes you to another number that hangs up on you . buy `` DVD X COPY ''
 I first got the software and try to load it , only to find out that the serial number given , did n't work . I finally did go to there site , and was able to get a new number . Next tried to copy first to harddrive . Had no problem , but when going from harddrive to DVD burner , I have yet , to be able to succeeded there . I have spend time at the web site with no luck , and my next move will be to call support . I did call support on my desk top , and was told of programs provided , to see if the burner was working . I can format and burn to the DVD burner with no problem . So this makes me lean towards that program itself is bad , just like the install serial number .
 This program is not properly advertised . It WILL NOT make copies of your DVD Movies , since most movies are copy protected . In order to use this program , you must download a program to remove the copy protection , rip the dvd to your hard drive -LRB- you must have a ton of hard drive space to rip the entire disk to your hard drive . See vcdhelp.com for more info -RRB- and then copy from your hard drive to the dvd . There are free programs that do this same thing and are really no harder than using this program . It 's a shame , because I have used many Pinnacle products , but this just does n't deliver , since most commercial DVD 's are copy protected .
 There are lot of free programs that does 100 % better than this .
 Boy , was this a disappointment . It takes forever . And it 's not like I have an obsolete machine -LRB- Pentium 4 , 1.7 -RRB- . Worst of all
 Tried to burn DVDs after ripping with DVD Encryper . All I get is `` List out of bounds '' error message . Pinnacle offers no phone or email support . Check out their `` Forum '' , you wont belive the problems people have with this application . I believe 5 stars rating are from relatives of Pinnacle !
 This software is unforgiving and full of bugs . I suspect the few who get it to work have a relationship with Pinnacle or other kind of plant . Get error messages copying non-protected sources to DVD and premature disk ejection for VCD . Do n't waste your money.Support is non-existent and the manual and help are both of no help . Sounds good but do n't bite . YOU WILL BE SORRY .
 I had problems with the software going crazy on me once in a while -LRB- no real support for it either -RRB- . Forget copyrighted DVD backups , but at least there 's no annoying DVD XCopy-style splash screen . Not good for much as DVD Shrink does more , is more versatile and puts out the same quality compression as far as I can see . Glad I got this free after rebate .
 The first problem I experienced with this software was it could not see my cd drive . I went to the Steinberg site -LRB- the company who supports this software -RRB- and found that there are quite a few problems with this software . I also searched their site for technical support and could not find any . Maybe it is there , but it was hard to find . I wanted to return the software but I bought it here -LRB- Amazon -RRB- ...
 Just checked the demo version - this program does nothing but saving passwords . It lacks most functions that are typical for similar programs : - There no possibility to drag the passwords to login pages . - No Search , no Sort - No file handling , Passwords are saved in a fixed folder . - Only one dimensional category list , no hierarchical structure . - No Password Generator - ... There is a lot of freeware and shareware that has more features . -LRB- e.g. Bagusoft Password Safe , Password Tresor , ... -RRB-
 According to the Intuit web site , this year there will be NO REBATES on the TurboTax package . They claim that most people never sent the rebates in and also further claim that most people will save about $ 30 this way . However , without the rebates , although the state program is included in some versions of the package , there will be NO REBATE for the package nor for the federal filing fee . No mention is made about the state filing fee , but I assume there will also be one as well . The absence of these rebates results in a price increase of $ 25 to $ 30 depending on the rebate values over the past few years . Because of this , the TaxCut package is not only cheaper to being with , but is now a great deal less expensive if the rebates are sent in . Yeah , they can be a hassle , but if you want to save some $ 's , try TaxCut . Why do n't these greedy companies just do us a favor and just give people one free federal and one free state e-file . This way , they spin this as looking out for the customer while they are passing on a $ 25 to $ 30 price increase .
 I WAS a faithful buyer of the Turbo Tax product . That is no longer the case after I received the worthless coaster that is Turbo Tax Deluxe 2005 . I went through all the screens in order as Turbo tax fed them to me - filling out my Federal tax Forms . All was working great until I got to the `` Error Checking '' routine . At this point , the software asked me to check for final editions of forms - which I allowed the software to do . It responded that I had all the newest forms . I clicked OK , and what do you know - I was asked to check to see if I had the Updates I had just checked for.After having this happen repeatedly , I used the online chat support . I was treated ok by the rep , but the remedies he provided did not work - even to the point of uninstalling the program and cleansing my computer of all traces of it . I even tried to start over on another unit I have , and the same thing kept happening.I have asked Intuit for a refund - only to be recommended back to the same people who gave me the faulty repair info I had already received.My best advice for anyone wanting a good tax preparing program this year is to try something other than Turbo Tax 2005 . I used TaxAct and it performed flawlessly on both my Federal and State returns - plus , even paying for their deluxe version , I only spent about $ 27 total to file my taxes both Federal and State - as opposed to the $ 29.90 Turbo tax wanted .
 I 've been a faithful customer for 7 years , and past years bugs had been entirely limited to installation problems that I could get past . It installed fine this year . However , I 've now encountered a number of bugs so severe that it actually makes it IMPOSSIBLE to file my taxes with TurboTax this time.The worst bug is the Cash Donations section
 This year TurboTax decides to bite the hand that feeds it , so to speak . I 've bought their software year after year , but next year I will definitely be using someone else 's . For starters , the 2005 version is ridiculously expensive -LRB- count on adding $ 30 fees to the software price if you plan to e-file -RRB- . It 's beset with bugs , like selecting the wrong state for your state return without including a way to change it . When you use the Help feature , it tells you to call 866-373-7820 , which you find out is just a recording that says this is no longer a working number . And the fact that you ca n't transfer last-year 's information from TurboTax web -LRB- you 're supposed to be able to , but in the end the software tells you that the 2004 data is `` incompatible '' -RRB- - they 're practically driving away their repeat customers . My online chat with customer support took two hours out of my day and ended like this
 I have used Turbo Tax for many years . To say that this version is a disappointment is an understatement . Let 's not mince words , this product is garbage . Run , do not walk , away from it . It deserves zero stars.Bug ridden , terrible interface , no support . It is March 10 and a bug they -LRB- finally -RRB- acknowledged in February is still not fixed and apparently never will be . Nothing important , just the program not applying deductions to your return raising your tax payment . You know , minor stuff . The interface ? Do n't get me stated . Horrible . Support ? India , of course . Because they are experts in US tax law.It is time to move on to another product . Turbo Tax is now relegated to the status of being a formally good product .
 For the past five years I have used TurboTax on-line to prepare our taxes . Last year , after filing our taxes , the IRS sent me a letter informing me that I was eligible for an additional refund credit . After refiguring our taxes by hand I found $ 1,700 in two credits that TurboTax failed to identify . I was able to receive $ 1,400 of this amount , but the other $ 300 would have required refilling from scratch -LRB- changing the number of dependants -RRB- . This week , after looking over previous tax years , I now find that there was an additional $ 1,009 credit on our 2002 taxes that TurboTax did not find.I can no longer trust TurboTax to manage my taxes . These were simple Earned Income Credits -LRB- EIC -RRB- and Child Tax Credits -LRB- CTC -RRB- , which TurboTax should have never missed . How can a company release tax software that does not double-check these items when there are child dependants clearly listed ? It is inexcusable.Now , they no longer offer the $ 14.95 e-file refund ? I recommend RUNNING from this Intuit TurboTax product . We will be using TaxCut instead .
 Save your money !!! Impossible to use . After wasting 4 hours trying to create 1 ringtone , I took the disc and converted it into a coaster . Try something else .
 This program was extremly hard to use ! Even when you could try to figure out a few things , it did not work right!What a terrible buy.SENT IT BACK!Called tech support for help , WHAT A JOKE ! They could care less about anything.I will never buy another product made by this company !!!!!
 The program is somewhat difficult to use and the online tutorials and help does not seem to be up . I believe the product says it will work with all major phones , I have a very popular LG phone and the program will not work with it . I find it very confusing , but am still trying to figure it out .
 I 'm writing this review as a cautionary tale to other unsuspecting customers of Surething . I purchased a Lacie drive 3 months ago which came bundled with the Surething Labeler software . I bought the drive in order to be able to use the cool new Lightscribe technology.After buying the product I tried to install it on my Windows Vista 64Bit OS but found that it would not install . I thought it was likely due to me having Vista installed in 64bit mode because many apps were reported to have issues on 64bit so I reinstalled Vista to 32 bit . I then found the software still did n't work.I attempted to contact lacie for support but they simply ignore my request for about a week . SureThing at least replied but said ; sorry you 'll have to buy another version of SureThing . One would think that SureThing would do right by their existing customer base and offer a patched version of SureThing 4 for Vista . No Vista update or fix for whatever shortcomings their Version 4 had . Just more money . After several emails the best I got was a weak analogy from their tech rep about bad parts in Toyotas but no useful help . Thanks SureThing.Be warned about the poor customer experience you 're likely to receive from SureThing & Lacie .
 I bought this software primarily to create playlists . The documentation that comes with the product is a joke . As with most software , you are forced to rely on the `` Help '' tab . After going through the tutorials , and finally saving the playlist from a CD , there is nothing that explains how to transfer the playlist to the `` Jewel Case Front Panel -LRB- 1 of 1 -RRB- '' that appears when the program opens . Not that you would necessarily want the playlist on the front panel anyway . Also there is nothing that gives a clue as to how to switch from the `` Jewel Case Front Panel -LRB- 1 of 1 -RRB- '' to `` Back Insert '' , or `` Front Insert '' , etc. . When I finally was able to paste a playlist on to the front panel , it was in a most unattactive format . So , `` never having to type a playlist again '' would have required deleting and retyping everything that was there .
 I normally never give any thing I rate a 1 star . Let me say that I did not purchase this software , but the company I work for did . First off when you buy this software all you get is the cd , program and some useless docs . The worst part is that you also need to buy a license from symantec to allow your Pc anywhere host to dock to it . Well that may sound easy and all but let me say it has been a nightmare just trying to track down this license file -LRB- slf -RRB- that makes the program functional . Tech support has their head up you know where . I spoke with multiple people who work for the company -LRB- symantec -RRB- and they had no idea what the product was let alone the license . Ok so almost two months of calling and searching the web for any relevant info . Finally I spoke to someone who knew were to buy the license key on their website . This is probably were in a normal situation things would look up right ? NOTAfter IT purchased it then they emailed a pdf -LRB- adobe file -RRB- certificate that now has you register it online on their website . If things could n't get worst it spit back that it was invalid . So more calls to tech support.I got this guy who told me that their license pool was having problems and that it would be about two weeks for it to start working again . As of today it has been over 3 weeks . The moral of the story this software SUCKS save your hard earned/company money !
 I started to review the product and it appeared to be well done , but I really ca n't state much about it . I had to stop the presentation , and when I returned it would not run . Then I lost the hard drive on my computer and needed to re-load the software , it would n't grant me permission to view it . I emailed , and called the company to be ignored and then hung-up on . If you by it , prepare to watch it on one sitting , and hope the power doesnt go out .
 As with many of the older versions of Jump Start , this product does n't seem to work on Macs running OSX in classic mode -LRB- despite their claim on the box -RRB- or virtual PC mode . I had contacted Vivendi Universal regarding a 2000 version of JS 3rd grade that I own only to hear , `` we do n't support that version any more , '' so I purchased a new copy of the 4th grade version -LRB- since that 's the grade level I needed most for my kids -RRB- to find that I have the same problem with the `` new '' version . Ironically the version of JS in the 2003 package was created in 2000 . Are they simply repackaging old products ? My husband and I are extremely knowledgable computer users , so our problems are n't a user issue and so far this issue has only occured with our Jump Start products . If you 're a Mac user runnning OSX , I would strongly recommend finding another product . I also want to add that the company is n't very supportive of their products on the customer and technical support side . However , it 's only fair to mention that when we were to be able to use the games running on the old versions of the Mac operating system , my kids really enjoyed them and we were pleased with the educational content of the games .
 Honestly , we 've not put much time into actually using the program but wo n't be either . I have an `` Advanced '' 3rd Grader and she does not like this Game . The introduction to the game is very , very long and she looses interest . There appears to be no way around the introduction into areas that are `` fun '' . There is also not an `` Exit '' or `` Escape '' route to shut off the constantally talking robot . We need quicker access to the `` fun '' so that we can actually learn something , and this game does n't do that .
 I am so disappointed by this product that I am considering returning it to the company for a refund . The three discs are little more than extended video games with a smattering of academic challenges -- in fact , the second disc is ALL video games except for a short game through which the child earns tickets by answering simple questions . The tickets are then `` spent '' on meaningless video games , like using arrow keys to maneuver a robot over waves . Lots of learning , right ? I really expected more , and since I paid full price for this nonsense -LRB- -LSB- money -RSB- -RRB- I am even more bothered that I now own this . The best , or least bad game is the first disc , but even this vaccilates between drivel and strangely impossible games that have no intellectual merit whatsoever . Like clicking on an animated globe that supposedly shows the zodiac but is so small it might as well be a tennis ball covered with white dots . No child could possibly learn to identify the night sky through that -- anyway , I could go on and on , but be forewarned and do n't buy this unless you can get it practically for free .
 I downloaded the trial from the company 's web site and it simply does n't work.Sorry .
 I bought this software hoping to work on our weekly spelling lists . First , in order to input your list of words you have to ALSO input 3 `` incorrect '' spellings for each of the words , a major pain.Second , of the 3 games , none of them include ever SPELLING your words ! All i want is for my kids to practice spelling their words , obviously too much to ask for a spelling program by jumpstart . I ca n't believe how disappointing this program is .
 Here 's another piece of kids ' educational software that does not measure up to the marketing blurbs on the box . It contains three spelling-oriented games that give you plenty of practice with hand/eye/mouse coordination , but are questionable in terms of educational value.In one game , you play a little dog with a basket , trying to catch fish falling from the air . You 're only supposed to catch fish containing words that are spelled correctly . To me , it was the most fun game of the bunch . Whether it teaches spelling or not is another question entirely.In another game , you shoot hermit crabs that are trying to run off with your coins . You can only shoot the crabs carrying the correct letter to fill in the blank of a given word . I dislike the fact that the crabs each have an angry , mean expression after you shoot them , when they are closest to the viewer . Certainly not a happy game ! Also , with a fast computer , the crabs emerge so fast that you have to set the game on level one in order to make it feasible . Luckily , game play level is separate from spelling level.For the third game , you ride a seahorse in a race , tapping the spacebar to have your seahorse reach up to lick a word . This is another iffy game with a fast computer , and the images get blurry rather quickly , which impairs enjoyment.I was excited about the idea of inputting our own spelling words . However , there is a limit of about 25 ? custom words . And the voice that reads the custom word list is barely audible . You can input phonetic spelling to get closer to the audio pronunciation , but this is not perfect . Considering that game play depends upon hearing the correct pronunciation , this is a disappointment . So the custom word feature turned out to be not worthwhile for us.I just started homeschooling a 4th grader , and we 've been testing plenty of educational software . I 'm sorry to say that I ca n't recommend this one .
 i ordered this program for the ability to enter my daughters weekly spelling words . I thought it would help her review and practice for her exams . this feature of the program is very complicated . you ca n't just enter spelling lists , like i thought . my daughter says she only likes the seahorse race game .
 I purchased this for my 2nd grade daughter to use on our Windows 98 computer . The install completes with a FileIORoot error , and fails to start up when you launch the program.I spoke to tech support , which was of ABSOLUTELY NO HELP ! The answer I got was `` We have over 80 products , and ca n't be expected to support them all . '' Great company , huh?I 've installed other Jumpstart products in the past and have n't had too many issues . Tech support has always been their shortfall . The knowledgebase on their web site did n't even list this product . I 'm sure others experienced the same install problem , yet a search on the specific error message returned nothing.I think it 's time to look elsewhere for educational software , especially when you ca n't get help installing their product.Dean
 This product is good in that it allows users to enter their own spelling words . It is disappointing because the study games do not require a user to spell the words only to recognize them among incorrectly spelled words or to add a missing letter . If the program does not already contain the words you intend to add you will need the hardware to add the correct pronunciation . Personally , I 'd like a more stripped down spelling study aid that would drill words from custom lists .
 I 'm not smiling after purchasing this product . I love JumpStart 's grade level products and have them all from toddler to 3rd grade ! I 'm afraid the method of teaching spelling on JumpStart Spelling Bee is poor and so where the results after trying it with my daugther . Her scores showed no improvement what-so-ever !
 My 8 year old son loves Jumpstart and we were excited to be able to put our own words into the game . However , the games in this CD Rom were so boring , we could not play them . It would be more exciting to count pores on your skin .
 Hi , I 'm StoryMaker . I 've been enjoying JumpStart products since I was in Kindergarten . For Christmas , I gotJumpstart Advanced Study Helpers V2 .0 , a set of CD-ROMs which includes this disc -LRB- JumpStart Study Helpers Spelling Bee -RRB- andJumpStart Study Helpers Math Booster . The Math Booster disc is a very fun way to practice math , and it has very good educational content . This disc is * a little * fun , but nowhere near as good as other JumpStart products.This CD-ROM features 3 educational , ocean-themed games starring Frankie the dog . You can use the content chooser to choose a list of spelling words from the game or you can make custom lists using the editor . Sounds pretty good so far , huh ? Well , it WOULD be , if not for various phenomenons.Firstly , you never actually spell complete words in any of the games . In 2 games , you fill in 1-3 letters of a word . In the other game , you find correctly spelled words among incorrectly spelled ones . The games where you only fill in 1-3 letters barely teach anything for older children - they might teach for younger children , though . I 'm not sure how educational choosing correctly spelled words is . It 's probably more educational than filling in just a few letters , but it probably could be more educational.Note
 Do not buy this product . It will damage your son or daughter 's eyes . The image are jiggling . Even me can not stand them . My daughter also found it is not fund to play with it . So do not waste your money .
 We got this for our 6-year-old and 3-year-old sons , both love Rescue Heroes and both love CD-ROM games . I agree with the other reviews that state things are very hard to steer and click on effectively . My sons have ample experience with our PC , yet could n't click on things the way a normal game works -- very frustrating for them!Then , when they finally were able to master it and complete the three levels , they realized that was it . It is a one-time game , with no randomization for repeat play and no educational skills to make repitition valuable . They played it once for the challenge , twice just for the sake of playing it again and then they were done with it . For this price , I would have expected more of this game.Stick with the toys . FP gets top marks from me for those .
 I bought this game for my 5 year old son . I ended up playing for him . The movement of the heroes is very sporadic . I even had a hard time getting the men to slow down so I could get to the hotspots to click on them . They were very jumpy and he was getting very upset because he could n't click on anything . The game itself was ok . It only took us about 2 hours to finish it . I probably wo n't buy any more Rescue Heroes on CD Rom .
 I agree with other reviews that the mouse clicking is very difficult . It 's difficult to maneuver the men around . My son tried for a few minutes , became so frustrated , I finished the one mission , but could n't get him to do any more . Would recommend the I Spy software - ages 6-10 , but he loves it ! Do n't have to know how to read .
 This will NOT copy your store bought -LRB- protected -RRB- DVDs , you can not tell by the listing but it is in very small print on box . I have a current Toshiba laptop and have had the program lock up 5 times in a row from multiple DVD+R s that work with ALL 6 of my DVD players . I 'm going to keep trying but Be-Aware . The FAQ at Video Vault 's website is pretty threadbare .
 I gave it a 1 because they did not have a 0 , to give . I bought this game for my son and I try to install it and it tells me that it has encountered an error . I go to the web site and it tells me what to do with that error , but after I do what it told me it does the same error thing again . My son and I both got so frustrated and finally gave up . I am returning it to the place where I purchased it for a full refund . Good luck for those of you that also bought this Horrible Game .
 I was disappointed that they send me the wrong item . From the picture of this CD it shows that it 's Mac compatible , but the actual CD that they sent me is only Windows compatible .
 Sometimes buying software is a crapshoot . I took a chance on this because it promised to let me extract `` clips '' from my movies . Well ... anything -LRB- almost -RRB- out of Hollywood or rented from your local Blockbuster 's etc. is copyright protected to the point that this suite is truly useless . I got the Mac version so maybe something for Windows willallow this to perform properly , although I doubt it . Save your money ... this does n't work worth a damn .
 Update -LRB- Jan. 2008 -RRB- Below this paragraph is my original review . But a word about this review . I bought MacScan in the Fall of 2007 and have had a series of ongoing problems with the software . Repeated attempts to get clarification went unheeded . I attempted several times during the end of the year to post the actual conversation I had with a Mac Technician , but Amazon refused to post it . By the end of this January , the owner of The MacScan sent me an email in which he wanted to rectify the problem . Well , the problem is not only with MacScan -- a lousy product but also with customer service more than 4 months passed since he responded to my question , but it was only after he read the review I wrote below . So , essentially he responded to a Amazon reviewer and not a MacScan purchaser.This is the orginal review . I still stand by it.I had heard the frightening news of hackers setting their sights on the Mac OSX . I thought a little extra protection would give me a piece of mind . I went to the Apple sight , itself , for recommendations . This is how I discovered MacScan.I downloaded the 30-day trial and was initially surprised
 I could wish I had read Andre Lawrence 's review before I purchased MacScan from Office Depot for $ 29.99 plus tax on Feb. 18 , 2008 , but I did n't . He is spot on as to the total lack of MacScan customer support and service . There is n't any . You 're on your own.My problem was installing MacScan on a lap-top that belongs to the university I work for , and then having to turn that lap-top in . It was at that point I discovered you can only use the program on one computer at a time . If you want to use it on a second computer , you have to uninstall it from the first computer . Nothing on the MacScan box or website tells a potential buyer that it can only be used on one computer at a time.There is no uninstall feature in MacScan so I had to simply drag the application to the trash and delete it . But that does n't get it . The second computer still tells me that the serial number is `` not valid '' -LRB- because it is already in use -RRB- and I ca n't install MacScan on that computer . Out of curiosity I went back to the first computer , before I turned it in to my university , and tried to re-install it . But I could n't . The serial number is now `` not valid '' because it is already in use.It was at that point I called the MacScan customer support number on the website during the listed hours . No answer , so I left a message on the answering machine . I did n't get a call back , so I e-mailed customer support at the e-mail address on the website . I have n't heard back . I 've sent a follow-up e-mail asking if `` they , '' whoever `` they '' are , the MacScan people , have any intention of responding . But , of course , I 've had not reply to that e-mail either.So I 've given up . $ 30 down the drain , wasted , on a program I ca n't run on any qualified Mac . Listen to what Andre Lawrence is telling you . It 's straight talk . Stay away from this product . Whatever might , or might not , be wrong with it , there is NO support whatsoever , no one backing MacScan up . Yet another sorry example of what Bob Sullivan calls , in his book , GOTCHA CAPITALISM.William Slaughter
 Short and sweet , one day when macscan was updated it thought it was in the demo mode and would turn itself off in 31 days . I tried to follow the instructions for registering to no avail . So i paid for a product i can not use .
 I bought this software after the 30 day demo -LRB- which was actually much less than 30 days -RRB- was up , back in Jan 2012 , I had also used the demo in 2009 and deleted it because it was glitchy . Yeah , you get free updates -LRB- which is a confusing download and invoice -RRB- , but the last one , to version 2.9.4 is still prompting me to put my serial number in to register after I already did and is now again running in demo mode . This is getting really tedious to use and to top it off , now without it , my computer runs slow.You will find that you delete the same tracking cookies over and over . I read a review where someone called it `` bloatware '' and I would agree.My question is , why does it seem this company has a monopoly on the anti-spyware market ? -LRB- which is the only reason I caved and bought it in the first place -RRB- . I 'd love a refund on this crappy software .
 I was looking for something to replace Parson 's Technology Address Book . This product is NOT it . It is far more primitive , allowing only a single file of addresses and no provision for a return address . This product works ok if you are looking for something very basic . I 've deleted the program from my computer and wo n't be using it again .
 Not real user friendly.I was looking for product similar to `` Parsons Technology Address Book '' . Maybe I made the wrong choice.Earl
 StatTrak address Manager seemed to be great , till about 3 mounths later , all my information was deleted for no reason , the called the company and was told to put disk back into your computor , and it will fix it . It did fix it , but later I had to have my computor worked on , so I copyed the program and put it in to an external drive , thinking that I would be able to restore it into my computor , well NO that did n't happen . So I spent days putting in information into this program , only to loose it . I would not recommended it keep looking .
 This software is pathetically primitive and totally inadequate for this purpose . For example
 I got this to replace Parsons Address Book - which was perfect . This was a total waste of money . it is difficult to work with , is not compatiable with Day Timer or Franklin formats to print pages , which Day Timer is all I use . Day Timer no longer has their own software . I have lost my parsons and have searched the web for one . I wasted my money for this . Entering the addresses does not give you anything you want or organize .
 If one is looking for an educational program to help a child learn there are much better programs on the market than Mia.Unfortunately we bought this as a package of Mia and all suffer from the same issues . First , it takes 2 CDs and a game can not be completed without switching to the 2d CD . That compounds the problem that Mia can not be loaded on the hard drive so the game can not be played unless the CD is loaded . Having programs that require the loading of CDs to play them is a pain in the neck because children do not handle CDs properly and an adult must change the CDs . Most programs have only one CD but this one requires two.Mia programs are more like video games than educational software . They are comparable to video games like Spiderman and Sponge Bob which are puzzles to be solved . That is the problem with the Mia programs . The child spends an inordinate amount of time manuevering between the educational activities so that most of the time is spent manuevering and little time is spent on education . And it can be frustrating for the child , even a child that is very adept at video games . Yet because Mia is more of a video game than an educational resource , children who are video game geeks like Mia.Mia 's science is better than Mia 's Math and Reading because at least a written scenario is provided which helps out . But like all the Mia programs , the program hangs at times so that the child can not complete the game . Worse yet because the program is always active , the hibernation and suspend operations on the computer do not function so the program must be shut down should the child leave the computer.Another problem that all the Mia programs suffer from is that the video only occupies a small part of the monitor screen so that the effects are dimished . Other educational software fill the full screen although to Mia 's credit , when the user exits the program it restores the screen to its original resolution , something not all educational softwere does.The Mia programs do have humor in them which is enertaining to children and what educational material there is , is somewhat useful.The game is very lengthy . It takes hours to complete a mission . The oral instructions do not always match the written ones which are the correct ones , and are confusing to children . As the game progresses , lag time increases between segments .
 I was very excited to get this software for my grand-daughter . All seemed to go well until I went to start the game . I got the spider guy and then after I clicked `` Start '' I got a picture of a house and then nothing else , my brand new computer totally locked up . I have loaded many other programs onto this computer in the last few days -LRB- and yes I have plenty of memory left -RRB- . Funny thing is that I contacted the company for assistance and was told to check the permissions on the PC ... that maybe I did n't have permission to load the software ... seriously ? too bad I ca n't return it because I opened the package
 Had high hopes for this game , but it disappoints to no end.My daughter , is constantly frustrated after spending countless minutes pointing the mouse around , to navigate the slow walking Mia back and forth and back and forth and back and forth over and over the same scene to try to figure out what exactly one should do next . Even clicking on Mia to get hint , was n't much use.There are a few learning activities , but the amount of time spend in pointless navigation and actual learning activities is about 20 % activities 80 % annoying navigation.I sat there with her going over the game , trying to keep her attention on the computer . At the end , both of us gives up , it 's not worth the hours spent in front of the computer , learning almost nothing , except how bad games are designed.I actually bought all the Mia adventures , and they all behave the same . My daughter refuses to spend any more time on any of the Mia games.I wonder if they have done any user studies before releasing this title.So , it 's in the shredder it goes.Oh , the one star is for the nice looking rendering , this is a typical all style and no substance production .
 I have been a faithful Mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids . This game is a big disappointment . The language game is virtually unplayable in French . I am fluent in French and went to a French language university for nine years . I could barely understand what the characters were saying . If this program is intended to teach kids a second language , it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead . This game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of French .
 I do not recommend this software ; especially for younger children . Some of the sections are very fast moving and younger children ca n't click on the moving letters fast enough . Other sections of the software are exceedingly simple and therefore boring to children . A couple of the story games have almost no spanish integrated into them . When the software does use spanish , the word is quickly used once but there is no repetition so if the child misses the word , they 're out of luck .
 I speak fluent spanish and I was looking for something fun for my daughter to enjoy after school . I had high hopes for this game but it was a complete disappointment . The game is glitchy and has no ` help ' or ` clue ' feature and if it happens to glitch -LRB- which it has many times for us -RRB- you ca n't go back to do that section over . We 've had to start the ENTIRE game over several times . The most recent problem with it is that it 's not allowing us to pass a certain part of the game because we have to ` translate ' a sentence from english to spanish correctly . It is quite simple and multiple choice . Well ... we answer it correctly and it tells us that we are incorrect . In helping her , we have even tried the incorrect answers in hopes of getting past the problem . No such luck , it tells us that we are wrong . Always . As for the game , the character spends more of her time pacing and looking for objects that go with the story -LRB- which is n't even that interesting -RRB- rather than actual learning ... Do n't waste your money . Even if your copy is n't glitchy , it 's boring . I was really hoping to be able to give a great review here . = -LRB-
 We have tried installing & using this program on two different Macs , both of which are within the published system requirements . It does not work and we will be pursuing a refund . I wanted a fun and educational program for my kids .
 The creators of Mia 's Reading Adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children 's games . There is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child 's effort . If you 're looking to teach your pre-k/k child reading skills I 'd recommend the Blue 's Clues games instead . Any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did .
 I bought this game in hopes of adding a good repertoire of word play and phonetic computer activities to my child 's reading activities . What I got was aimless wandering and a watered down version of an adventure game.Those who say that this game is outstanding are surely misleading the public.My concerns with this game : The introductions are long and there is no way to skip them . The folks who developed this game were so enamored by their own handiwork that there IS an option to view the exceptionally long introduction on its own just in case you would like to watch it over and over again -- Nothing to do with reading.If you want to opt out of the storybook adventure part of the game and move from just activity to activity , you may ! You will , however , find , to your dismay , that each activity is never a new game . Once you 've done it -- you 've seen it ! I was floored . For example
 Mia is hard to move and it is difficult to know what you are suppose to do or where you are suppose to go . Many more times than not , my children get very frustrated and start screaming `` stupid mouse !! '' at the screen . The activites are set up so they do n't teach anything but simply test the child as to what they already know .
 The box said Mia 's Big Adventure Collection has won over 90 awards . I went to the Mia website to see what awards it has won . Mia 's big Adventure Collection has won a lot of parenting and toy awards ! I did n't see any awards from educational organizations.My opinion : The software is not the easiest to use . I have a brand new Mac computer and the software sputtered , stopping when I tried to make Mia do something new . She had a hard time picking up objects . I thought the software was slow , too . It is as slow as the graphic software was from the early 1990s . I would not call this reading software . I call this a game . The talking portion of the software is quite simple . The actual phonics part of the software is contrived . It is just inserted into the story without a natural flow.I would never use this software at school . Home is a different story , especially since I bought it already . My son has n't played with it yet .
 I found this software very difficult to use . It does not have any `` Stop '' or `` Go Back '' button . The only way to exit an activity is to hit `` Esc '' button to exit the program and then start all over . When starting over , there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and I could not find a way to skip it .
 I bought this game for my two kids 5 and 7 and sat thought an interminable 2hrs while they played it.The game does n't come with instructions so you have to find them on the disk . Unfortunately even after reading them I did not find the game very intuitive.One of the first things to occur is that the mouse gets violently mugged by a Rat . I was n't expecting that when I bought the game.It was a complete mystery to me how to save during the progress of the game until -LRB- yet again -RRB- I looked at the instructions . The progress of the gameplay is not instinctive and I had to look at the instructions -LRB- again -RRB- several times in order for the kids to progress further.The complexities of the different mini games are too simple and repetitive , or too hard for the two of them to play without significant help and input from me . I was gritting my teeth much of the time due to the minigames.On the positive side ; the kids were able to handle the interface well , they liked the characters , music and graphics . You can change the complexity level of the game at any time during gameplay by going back to the main menu . It is fairly slick EXCEPT for the save feature which sucks -LRB- it should save automatically during the progress of the game -RRB- . This is NOT a learning game it is an adventure game with word puzzles , there is NO teaching involved . Since I bought this game expressly for my kids to LEARN I do not recommend it for anything but adventure / entertainment play.FYI
 This game looks great but lacks direction . You direct Mia to walk from room to room but along the way you are suppose click things . Which things you are suppose to click is not intuitive nor are there really any clues . For example , in one case you are in the attic of a house . There is stuff littered throughout the attic -LRB- bats , balls , boxes , toys , etc -RRB- . Of the 10 things in the room only 2 or 3 actually do anything . In addition of the 2 or 3 things that do do something , only clicking very specific parts of those things do anything . So for example , if you are suppose to click the bat , only clicking one end of the bat results in a reaction . Often times when my daughter needed help , she ended up clicking every square inch of the screen hoping something would happen.The actual challenges are n't bad but there are few and like I said of above can be hard to find .
 I bought two of the Mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed . class . I bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother -LRB- caregiver -RRB- passed away . The storyline of the game is that Mia has to SAVE her gravely ill grandmother . Then she gets MUGGED by a rat ! I feel this is a little to noir for small children . The math game -LRB- which I am returning unopened -RRB- is about her house burning down , and if she could prevent it by going back through time . I feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects . I am returning both games !
 This program should never have been shipped . It is close to unusable . In trying to dumb down the interface for kids they have made it a sinkhole of frustration for everyone . Even more frustrating than the lack of any mouseover explanations for controls is the total failure to comply with any sort of software usability convention - e.g. no right click menus ; no resizing of objects by dragging , no highlighting of text to replace etc etc etcDespite the optimistic comparison of the other reviewer , only commonality with Photoshop that they both allegedly run on a PC .
 I found this software very difficult to use . It does not have any `` Stop '' or `` Go Back '' button . The only way to exit an activity is to hit `` Esc '' button to exit the program and then start all over . When starting over , there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and I could not find a way to skip it .
 I 'm not happy with the manner in which they executed the story-based gameplay . Your child 's progress to the next segment is dependant on your child laboriously clicking to figure out what to do next . Even when you 're certain where you need to go , it is a chore to walk Mia to the next location . Would be great it they had some software patches to make the `` click boxes '' for certain targets larger so Mia does not walk aimlessly into a circle when we 're trying to make her perform an action on a item or simply walk a certain direction.The educational content we experienced includes but was not limited to simple arithmetic , filling in missing numbers from sequence , knowing how to adjust the clock , distinguishing between shapes , matching symmetry , sorting and identifying numbers . My son simply found the games OK . He did not have the same excitement he had when playing other games like Dora the Explorer series . While the educational content is welcome , it always seemed like there was something missing - seemed poorly executed . In a couple of games the correct answer is not always available for clicking -LRB- e.g. the numbers are on a conveyor belt or floating inside a crystal ball so one has to wait until the right answer comes along -RRB- . The cut scenes were somewhat entertaining and the graphics and sound are decent but at times my son -LRB- and I -RRB- wish we had a button we could click to skip to the next adventure . After taking part in the laborious walking -LRB- i.e. clicking -RRB- to get to our next destination , we were sort of anxious to get moving along.I 'm having a hard time recommending this one to other parents . I 'm tempted to e-mail Kutoka with some suggestions and hope they might consider changing a few things to make the gameplay more smooth by removing some of the guesswork and grind that goes inbetween segments as well as making the math games more user-friendly . While other reviewers were excited about this , I 'm quite dissapointed right now but hopeful . I 'm hoping to get some more gameplay out of this one ; I hope when my son gets older there is replay value in trying the game at a harder level . I happened to purchase another Kutoka game at the same time which my son and I have n't tried yet . I only hope it 's much better than this one .
 We have had this game for a while , and bought it because of the many reviews . However , my daughter and I find it extremely frustrating . Even when we know what the task is to be done , we often can not figure out how to do it . The math puzzles , when we come across them , are fine , but most of the time is spent figuring out where to click for something . This game is very linear , so if you ca n't figure one thing out , there 's no way to move to another task where you might eventually better understand the gestalt of the game . You just sit there , with Mia tapping her foot , repeating the same clue again and again and again and again and again . The help at kutoka.com was good to find , but it was n't sufficient to solve the problem.Even with the parts we have played , I do n't find it terribly compelling .
 I bought this for my son -LRB- 6 -RRB- and daughter -LRB- 8 -RRB- . The program is very interactive but you will waste countless hours just wandering around Mia 's world . If you spend 1 hour playing it you will really only spend about 10 minutes really learning anything useful . It is extremely frustrating to figure out how to get from place to place . The designers obviously built this program to show off their skills but failed to really make it a productive use of time.Bottom line . Do n't waste your money on this . Many other programs are also very fun and challenging and do n't waste your time wandering aimlessly around ...
 This is definitely not a software to reinforce math . It is more interactive play trying to figure out what Mia should do to move to the next screen . Once you get to the other screen then there is some math . This is more of a game than educational math . It is fun for kids on a video game perspective . The Mia 's Reading Adventure
 I ca n't believe how poorly this game runs . My daughter can not play this game on any of our macs . I have a new age aluminum macbook and aluminum imac . Both have maxed out ram . I am a very experienced computer user and nothing would make this game even acceptable . Choppy game play until freeze or crash . Will not remember user name or where we left off.Uninstalled reinstalled . Only program running etc. . I tried to get my money back from the apple store but could not because it was already opened . Very disappointed so please do n't make the same mistake .
 Unfortunately , I bought this at the same time as the Mia Reading Program . I found it just as difficult and just as useless in an educational setting .
 I did not like this product . Each `` page '' has a tiny box with tiny writing about Algebra.This program was uninteresting and quite boring . I could get No one interested in this program and went online and found a much better Algerba 1 which we are currently working for free . Also , I discovered it would cost more to return this useless product than it cost !
 I COULD N'T TELL YOU HOW TO RATE BECAUSE WHEN I RECEIVED IT IN THE MAIL IT WAS NOT IN THE CD CASE PROPERLY & THE CD WAS SCRATCHED UP & DOES N'T EVEN WORK . IF THIS HOW I WILL RECEIVE ORDERS - THEN I WO N'T ORDER FROM HERE ANY MORE ! VERY DISAPPOINTED !
 I have had two of these discs so far and neither one would allow me to open issue # 45 . According to GIT Corporation tech support there is a corrupt file on the Master disc . Here is the response they sent to my email inquiry . `` The problem does not lye with the discs , but with a corrupt file on the Master . The Ghost Rider collection is now in the process of being re-mastered . When they become available , we will post exchange info on the site . No definite date yet , as it an extremely time consuming process . `` GIT 's `` knowledge base '' does not even list this known problem and it appears they have not recalled the defective discs and are still allowing them to be sold.I would be very wary of buying this product until the problem is corrected .
 Unfortunately , I placed an order for several QuickStudy courses -LRB- math and english -RRB- and after placing them into CD drive , I found that none of them have AUDIO in their tutorials !! There is nothing more useless than reading `` text '' on a CD ... If you want to teach yourself mathematics or english ... purchase a book or another tutorial product ! -LRB- I recommend Jason Gibson products for mathematics . . I have not found a worthy product on teaching English writing or grammar -RRB-
 I have bought three of these for math and science . I think that they may be good for a child , but they have no depth to them . I would not buy any of these again .
 What a rip-off . I bought THESE because the covers looked a little more intelligent than the HIGH ACHIEVER series of Algebra products but , this is the EXACT same program ; identical . Very cheesy , DOS-type presentation . It 's packaged differently but it 's another AMAZON software rip-off . This is getting old fast.The ALGEBRA BOOSTER was OK and I had somewhat decent hopes but seeing the exact same thing boot up when I loaded this disc just made my stomach drop . I just bought some shiester dinner , courtesy of Amazon.com ... again .
 Before anyone can buy this , they need to know what version of the software is being sold . Is it 4.0 ? 12.0 ? or 15.0 ? I have 4 different versions of this software that I kept updating with my new computers . Also is it Print artist Platinum ? Gold ? or Silver ? Or is it some other colour that they developed?I 'd like to know a little more information so I can make sure my computer can handle this software and wo n't crash .
 Sellers seem to pay NO attention to customer reviews and we shop elseware . Saying that I have a CD of Print Artist for sale is like saying I have a Cheverlet vehicle for sale .
 I thought when I was ordering this product it would be the full version and then when I got it , I was very diapointed to find out that it was basically a demo model with very few clip art pictures and other things to use . For my home computer I have the full version and like it very much , but I am disapointed in this product I ordered .
 I ordered FrameMaker6 , my American Express card was charged . I had to pay my card account . I never recieved the product and all my Emails were returned because the address was unavailable .
 They have the hebrew backwards !! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right . I find it extremely confusing . I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it.What a poor effort !
 The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you 're already familiar with the language you wish to learn . I 've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I 'm getting rusty . The only problem is that it 's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear . The recorded speakers also do n't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said . This is good cause it 's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot , bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said . It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you do n't already know basic French grammar.I also tried to use this to learn Japanese . Unlike French , I 'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare . If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out . Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese . For instance , in the grammar section it has the past , present and future `` I am '' it 's written in english then beside it it 's written in Japanese . You ca n't click them to have it sound out for you . In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out . So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese . I do want to learn how to read , write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read , write , and speak Japanese ! So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese -LRB- NOT the Romanized -LRB- Romanjj -RRB- version -RRB- already in order to use this product . Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you 're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more . Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit . I 'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books . So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD 's .
 My boss asked me to get this , so that he check out the Latin portion of it.What a waste ! The only Latin on this CD is * Latin * American Spanish.The interface was underwhelming . I needed to guess at what did what , because the controls are mostly icons . What 's worse , there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program.Apparently though , the manufacturer did throw in an extra * not * listed on the back . If you are learning the differences between US and UK English , its there!I gave this one star , only because I could n't give it no stars .
 I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole , and that 's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd . When I installed it , I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole , even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case . So it has been a complete waste of money for me , perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language , but that is not possible either , u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source . I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product . If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected.PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd 's were mislabelled , there is no haitian creole on the cd , despite the fact that it is listed on the cover .
 I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list . I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages . Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more ! How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole ! Very disappointing !!!! The makers should be ashamed !
 I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole , and I , too , could n't find it . There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole ... except the jewel case which insists it 's there . I 'm so dissapointed I have n't actually tested anything else out
 I had a previous version of Easy Language , with only four languages on it . Unfortunately , the software and Windows XP do n't get along , so I ordered the newest edition of Easy Language . I was looking forward to the same level of quality . Boy , was I wrong . Sure , there 's 61 languages . And the sound quality is so bad , you ca n't understand a word that 's being said . For all I know , they 're only using one language , and I just ca n't tell the difference . Graphics - poor . Ease of use - poor . No nice little tutorial to show you how to use the CD . No Pip . Appearence - elementary . The wallpaper reminds me of when I first tried to teach myself HTML . Big disappointment . I recommend - DO NOT BUY .
 The quality of this '61 language ' CD is pathetic.There is very little information per language and thereis no way you will learn anything from this .
 I purchased Flowcharts & More in the hopes of getting an inexpensive s/w tool for making very simple flowcharts . -LRB- I did n't see the point of paying hundreds for Visio - which I 've used before . -RRB- This software has caused me hours of aggrevation and disappointment . It frequently crashes ; and makes the files you were working on at the time of the crash unrecoverable . -LRB- NB
 Instant Deck design is very basic but difficult to learn . Not at all what I expected for a supposedly user-friendly software . No manual , so you have to read directions from disk -LRB- and too many pages to print if you go that route -RRB- . I tried using the Deck Design Wizard , which does well except I did n't see a construction plan with dimensions , just a nice drawing of the finished project . Worst of all , I ca n't get the program to give me a material list . I 'll have to play with this program some more , but as of now , it is worthless to me .
 This product will give you the basic layout only . Trying to put a stairway on a beveled corner just did n't happen . Also if you went outside the set perameters it would refuse to do anything . You get what you pay for .
 The program was not as easy as I thought I would be . I was not able to print working drawings only a list of materials in even tht was only general nothing specific . I was a little disappointed in it 's lack of features and difficuty with commands -LRB- mostly keyboard and low use of the mouse -RRB- . For the price fair , but it could have been better .
 This program has very basic output . If your trying to build your own deck and need a set of plans ... this is not the program . You can go to bobvilla.com and use his deck designer online program that will give you more than this program does . It makes me sad that this company still takes peoples money for this program .
 This is a great idea and my daughter would have loved it but the software is too old and will not work on modern computers . I contacted software support but was told they no longer offer support for this product . I went to their website and found that there is no patch available for it either . I set my computer up to run the software in Windows 95 mode but it still would not work . Their website instructs if you have a Pentium computer then this software will not work at all .
 Unfortunately we could not install -LRB- or rather the CD was imcompatible with our version of Windows -RRB- the CD ordered because apparantly it 's an old version and we have Windows XP Home . So , I guess we waisted the $ s , unless you have some sugestion as to how this can be installed . It would have been nice if we were made aware of this when ordered.HPardellBarbie Team Gymnastics -LRB- Jewel Case -RRB-
 It did not perform correctly . It says you can make your own routines and practice different skills . I could n't get it to do anything but have a performance sheet - which always stayed blank !
 This is a great IDEA for a software title - unfortunately it 's a big disappointment to the kids if your computer wo n't run it - as our 2-year old Dell would n't . It started out okay , but about three minutes in , a warning comes up stating `` CPU Not Supported . '' So make sure your computer -LRB- not just your operating system -RRB- meets the spcifications before you buy .
 I had high hopes buying this product ... but the more I use it , the more bugs I find and the less I can do . Take for instance today , I am building some built-in bookshelfs in my house and want to try different designs . I spent hours converting soffits into shelves -LRB- b/c I could not find a flexible enough component in the program that allows me to build this -RRB- . Finally after mucking around , I get it ... great . Now I want to try different colors on different elements ... and it crashes ... repeatitively . I now have to scrap all my work . I 've also had major issues trying to get my roof created , painting cathedral ceiling & walls . I 've used this program for 4 months now ... so this is not a one off problem I 'm voicing about.It was a good program for laying out the dimensions of our house including the interior walls . But thats where the simplicity ends . I am a UI designer by trade , and I can definately recommend that this company higher a usabilty expert to review the program . I would also highly recommend much more flexibility in what can be imported -LRB- graphics , colors -RRB- , and what can be created -LRB- i.e. non standard furnature -RRB- .
 Not that easy to use . Does n't do landscape architecture well at all . Mainly just for construction . Not hard to use , but not easy either . I bought it used . I recommend that if you buy it , you get it used too . Ca n't see paying full retail price for this . There have got to be better packages out there
 This product was a horrible waste of my money.There is no option for log houses , which I find surprising . This is afterall , far from an alternative building style.It seems as though this product was made for those with little or no creaativity , seeking to create another ugly box like all those that already exist all over the nation.Don ' t waste your money !
 Software does n't work . Contacted company , they sent an update that still does n't work . A complete waste of money !
 I purchased the sofware and cable for my LG600 . I passed up the verizon version because Susteen ' ; s supposidly allowed you to edit ringtones and images . It does not do that very well . I purchased it so I would not have to reenter 250 contacts into my phone and could back it up incase of phone loss or falure . We after almost a year of dealing with Datapilots tech support , on my own I found that if you had Verizon move your contacts from one phone to another , Datapilot will not be able to transfer . the program will crash after just a few entries . I now have to spend another $ 80 to buy Verizons version and have only contact capability . DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM SUSTEEN . THEY DO N'T TELL YO EVERYTHING .
 Backs up data from Phone to PC just fine -LRB- LG VX4650 -RRB- . Does not * Synch * Phone to PC , or PC to Phone . Simply overwrites one with the other.It will only upload the entire contents of the phone contact list -LRB- takes about 7 minutes for 434 numbers -RRB- . It will not upload only changes . Same for downloads to the phone ; All or nothing . This also means it is nearly useless for editing contacts on the PC . Takes too long to upload entire database , change one or more items , then download entire database again.There is a `` merge '' feature , but only for two or more databases of numbers in DataPilot 's PC database.DataPilot will import numbers from Outlook , but marks each one with a comment `` Outlook Contact . '' The comment then gets downloaded with the number to the phone so that every number has the same comment . Stupid waste of phone memory .
 I purchased a Sprint LG Fusic cell phone on the salesman 's assurance that the phone would `` sync '' my 500 + contacts , notes , and schedule , etc. with Microsoft Outlook as my Palm pilot currently does IF I bought the Susteen Datapilot program . After installing the program on my home PC and putting it to work , I quickly discovered that the program does not synchronize -LRB- or exchange -RRB- information with Outlook at all . Datapilot does a poor job of importing Microsoft Outlook files , transfering information incompletely , improperly formatted , etc. . After what information is successfully transferred into Datapilot , this informationis , then , exported to the phone . Thereafter , any changes made to Outlook files or phone data do not get exchanged back and forth between the PC and the phone . Information can only go 1 way . Changes made in Outlook on the PC can only overwrite what is already in the phone , so , any changes made to phone date will be lost and vice versa . I ended up returning both the Datapilot AND the phone -LRB- and the phone return was no easy task -RRB- . Overall , a VERY dissatisying , frustrating experience .
 I 'm dissapointed in the product for the LG Rumor . The Outlook contact link is clunky and the calendar is non-existent . I can more easily link MP3 's through a direct USB connection rather than use this S/W . They took over a month to ship the S/W and sent the wrong package w/wrong USB cable . I wasted my money on this .
 Data Pilot did n't work with my new phone , and there 's no way to uninstall it with Control Panel = > Uninstall ! Susteen website gives instructions on how to uninstall manually by editing the register , but big red warnings say they are n't responsible for whatever trouble you get into .
 Like usual Susteen fails to deliver . I 'd give this one a zero if I could . This version is full of bugs , and due to the well know `` administrator account required '' issue -LRB- even though you install the software as `` administrator '' launching the software logged in as administrator '' the software gives you the error saying `` administrator account required to use the application '' . Susteen knows about the problem and has several `` fixes '' \ registry hacks in their Kbase but none fix the problem . No response from their toll call support number.Steer clear of this junkware .
 I purchased and installed this product for the LG 8300 phone . The software installed okay but would not connect with the phone . The error message stated that additional drivers were needed . The Microsoft search was unable to locate the needed drivers . I searched on my own , also without success . I emailed Susteen -LRB- both Customer Service and Tech Support -RRB- over a week ago for assistance and have received no replies . I am not able to use this product with my LG phone .
 I had a Samsung 8200 and used the Data Pilot software to back up my contacts to transfer them to my new Google G1 phone.Suffice it to say , their data transfer capabilities are worthless . You have the capacity to export your address book to windows Outlook or Apple 's Iphone.Excuse me , but the world does not revolve around Apple or MicroShaft . A simple method to export to CSV format would be VERY helpful . Of course , Google does n't read MS WAB -LRB- address book -RRB- format , and the outlook export to CSV simply does n't work well.Find other ways to sync your phone and your PC .
 This product sits on the shelf gathering dust . I suspect I will try to give it away or sell it on eBay . Problems are countless
 The program would n't recognize my new phone even after buying an additional cable , so the number transfer would n't work either , that being the main feature I wanted . Addionalty the customer service did not answer repeated requests for info . Not at all worth the money .
 Save yourself some time . Do n't buy the product.It does less than you would expect and the technical support is Kafkaesque , leading you in time-wasting circles . The cascade of errors you will observe in their tech support site will infuriate you . It is possible that you will get beyond anger to laugh at the sheer amateurishness of it all , but than you will again remember that you spent money and time on it and become enraged again .
 Susteen advertises that you can upload , download and manage your cellphone contacts with this easy to use software . The software is easy to use - after you get through the installation and update maze however this product DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED . After spending the money , waiting for the product and a seemingly endless series of installation/update steps , it only picked up about half of my total contacts list . When I went to the website looking for help the answer I got was equivelant to ` Oh , well . That 's just the limits of the software'Needless to say , I will not be buying any more product from Susteen
 Not what I was looking for , I emailed the seller & never heard back on whether they accept returns . I was looking for small business software & this was terrible .
 Having turned away from `` Get Data Back '' to `` Data Rescue '' my expectations were not met . First hand use/experience has been with `` File Scavenger '' , excellent flexibility and ease of use offering a complete `` Windows Explorer '' type presentation of retrieved data . You pick what you want and it is restored similarly to the Windows Explorer File system.ProSoft Data Rescue also made matters difficult in that there needed to be a `` reserve '' hard drive - that needed to be formatted into a `` Fat 32 '' format . Thus , any hard drives you had available for use , lost all file/data content . What you viewed as your retrieved data with Data Rescue were files that had to be opened to be interpreted , then catalogued or filed . This was not the case with Data Scavenger.The disadvantage with Data Scavenger was that it was a `` one time use '' on the computer it was downloaded to . -LRB- Could not be copied and used on my other two computers - meaning drives had to be moved or relocated.Still recovering from Hurricane damages and am just now getting to the drives that were in some manner damaged . Whereas as I am not any kind of an authority on software use , for me ProSoft Data Rescue failed in terms of ease and simplicity found in Data Scavenger . Included to this were the several `` demos '' I tried . My best `` informed '' decision on this matter turned out to be wrong . I am asking Amazon.com for return and refund.George G.

 Bought this for two reasons . The good reviews it had and I wanted fresh water fish instead of Goldfish.I was completely disappointed . Fish are all drab silver in color , their swimming is very mechanical . Overall the underwater scene is the most boring ever and completely drab . For a little dose of horrible `` realistic '' movements , select the frog.I will now be very happy to go back to my Goldfish aquarium . The colors were so vibrant , the whole fish tank was more realistic than an actual fish tank . Bubbles , movements , water shadows were are superb . I was looking for all of this with this program but it is completely boring and drab to the nth degree . I would not recommend this to anyone .
 Did n't care much for it , found it boring ... but for the price I guess you ca n't complain much . I only bought it cause of other reviews . The fish where blah not much color . Sounds wher n't very great either . But everyone has diffrent tastes . But it just was n't for me .
 The spectophotometer is nice , self-calibrating , accurate -LRB- repeatable measurements -RRB- , and samples over 380nm to 730nm at 10nm intervals.The RGB-Easy print profiler is worse than useless unless your printer happens to already be perfectly linearized and already on target . The 45 samples points are grossly inadequate . Also , after creating a profile , there is no way to edit or correct it . You either have to live with what comes out , reprofile -LRB- timing consuming when you allow adequate ink drying time -RRB- , or abandon your purchase in favor of the original printer manufacturer 's profile . This tool is so bad that it guarantees that you will need to spend an additional $ 400 each to upgrade to Gretag-Macbeth 's standard CYMK and RGB profiling modules.Even after spending another $ 400 each , do not expect profiling to go easily . The blacks can block-up , your black and whites will not stay neutral throughout the gray scale , and the gamut can suffer . Most of these are correctable , but they require time , patience , and some ability to edit profiles -LRB- not included with the package -RRB- . The provided instructions are minimal -- be prepared to spend hours with tech support and/or reading a book on the subject -LRB- such as Bruce Fraser 's color management book -RRB- . The advertising falsely promises an upgrade path ; however , if you price it out , the upgrades from Eye1-Design to Eye1-Photo are more expensive than buying Eye1-Photo outright . The least expensive upgrade path is to throw-away your original purchase and spend anew on the next largest package.GMB has offered a free profile editor for every package except this one . You 'll have it on your menu but wo n't be able to access it . This is a critical limitation -- you 're denied the ability to view or edit your profiles . Viewing is essential so you can compare your weekly profile updates and detect when an anomalous profile has been generated -LRB- this WILL happen from time to time -RRB- . Without profile viewing , you 're left to detect the profile variance by eye . Without profile editing , there is no way to correct systematic errors -LRB- perhaps your monitor 's red phosphors fall near the dividing line between two sample intervals -RRB- . GMB 's tech support team is knowledgeable and helpful . However , they 've advised me that all of the packages under $ 2,000 are considered entry level products -- the company stays focused on it printshop and graphic design clients who spend $ 5,000 or more on GMB products . Purchaser 's of Eye1-Design are the bottom of the barrel and regarded with distain by the company.I contacted a GMB sales exec , Dwight Davis , regarding the upgrade conundrum . His scornful response indicated that the company has published its pricing and upgrade policies for all to see , so buyers get what they deserve . Essentially his advice is to not buy a package and expect to purchase reasonably prices upgrades ; instead , you need to anticipate all future needs -LRB- including an understanding that the RGB-Easy and CYMK-Easy modules are useless -RRB- and buy a more expensive , all-inclusive package.If all you need is a monitor profiler , you can do much better with other companies and should consider a colorimeter instead of a spectrophotometer . If you buy the spectophotometer , consider buying better software at a lower price -LRB- ColorEyes for example -RRB- . If you need more than monitor profiling , be sure to get a more complete package than this -LRB- for example Eye1-Photo includes a much better print profiler , an editor , and a number of other tools -RRB- .
 DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!I PURCHASED IT AND I DEEPLY REGRET DOING SO . THE THING WILL NOT PLAY IN MY PC .
 I would not advise anyone to purchase software from this company . I sent them numerous emails regarding a problem I was having . All emails ignored . I finally called them . I got some guy in California who said my emails were going to tech support in Europe . They were having a problem getting the Europeans to response to all tech support questions . My advice to RedXpress is do n't sell to the U.S if you do n't want to speak to an American . The guy from California provided some help . After I got off the phone with him I tried his suggestions none of them worked . Sent him emails and he never responded . I do n't even use the software anymore . It ruined too many DVDs to make it worth my while .
 I tried the online demo version of the software and it worked fine . I ordered the software and guess what - it does n't work . Tech support is a joke . Do n't buy this software - it does n't work , and tech support does n't care .
 Why is this , and many other ancient Adobe titles , not properly labeled as outdated for current operating systems , current Macs & PCs ? Such dated titles will NOT run on current systems , in most cases not even with any secondary software or system emulation . Label this for ONLY OUTDATED systems , like Mac OS9 .
 Guess I should have done more research . Photoshop 5.0 can not even be installed later versions of OSX . It requires a classic mode that is no longer available or supported on the current version .
 This is what I ordered , but this is not what I got . I got the upgrade only . It does not have these programson it at all . I paid $ 74.00 for something I all ready have . I was very very dissapointed when I finally got my tower back , I tried to install what I thought was the Office 2000 premium just to be let down . What a waste of money , which I can not afford to loose . So I will just have to consider this a very expensive lesson and not buy an more computer software . Just stick to buying movies . I have had very few bad experiences there . They are not costly either.Sandra Wardslwsundance1@qwestoffice
 Their software is very bad . Difficult to use , expensive , full of errors and gives a lot of problems -LRB- a package costs over $ 100 and it does n't even work -RRB- .
 Do not buy this product if you are looking for topo maps of Buescher State Park or Bastrop State Park . Even though Buescher State Park is one of the areas described within its coverage , the park is located close to Smithville , outside the western boundary of the detailed topo map -LRB- it 's only on the overview maps , which are n't at a scale you can use for orienteering -RRB- . The detailed topo map also cuts off about half of Bastrop State Park -LRB- which is further west of Buescher State Park , and ought to be included -RRB- , so it 's not very helpful for that area as well .
 Lightroom ver 1.0 has incredible potential for becoming THE workflow solution for digital photographers shooting in unprocessed RAW -LRB- digital negative -RRB- format ; provided , that you are a MAC user . The interface truly is stunning , and many of the features are attractive indeed . Yet - notwithstanding claims for extensive field testing -LRB- most probably on a MAC -RRB- by ` real ' photographers -- on a PC at least it still has those bugs , rough edges , and painfully evident oversights that would plague any late-release beta version for Win-XP . To be charged hundreds of bucks for the privilege of being one of the first consumer guinea pigs in the PC-format is just plain unconscionable . And the inevitably forthcoming patches and updates will prove a royal pain on my PC dialup connection.The concept of mass-processing RAW files , then picking , rating , flagging and organizing the ` keepers ' is a perfectly sound approach to improving high-volume workflow . But execution of the concept on Win-XP at least , in plain words , is badly flawed . The LR file system and the XP system file system are NOT synchronized -LRB- as claimed -RRB- , in fact , the PC installation has a warning diaog that - most inconveniently - you have to reimport images should you change a folder name in Explorer ; the ` ReadMe ' file spells even more uncertainty for Vista . And should you have difficulty installing LR , tough luck because you need a registration number to qualify for assistance , but you do n't get that number till installation is completed -- truly a Catch-22 nightmare -LSB- in fairness , LR installed flawlessly on my Windows XP/SP2 machine -RSB- . On the plus side , it 's just a click to further refine a RAW image in Photoshop or Elements , then return to Lightroom . Conversely , the simplest album tasks such as renaming an image or moving a file to another folder are maddeningly inconvenient on a PC . A summary table of keyboard shortcuts -LRB- especially in an Adobe product -RRB- is nowhere to be found . The pdf ` User 's Manual ' -LRB- that requires printing -RRB- is far more detailed than the glossy enclosed ` Getting Started ' guide . But even the overlaid module-specific shortcut summary is incomplete -LRB- witness lack of the -LSB- F6 -RSB- - key toggling of the filmstrip -RRB- and ca n't be printed for quick reference.Since Lightroom fundamentally is a photo album in fancy drag , I would advice PC-owners to stick with Photoshop Bridge , or Elements ' Organizer . Both Photoshop CS2/3 and Elements 5 use the same ACR RAW-file converter as Lightroom , similarly enabling batch processing of RAW files . Eventally , perhaps by version 2 , Lightroom will be the grand productivity enhancer for PCs , as it is already for MAC users . For the time being , it just ai n't ready yet for PC-users -- causing aggravation far more than the promised workflow speedup . In sum
 In wandering around the web , I find I am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing -LRB- from Photoshop Elements 5 -RRB- . When importing , Lightroom `` thinks '' for a long time -LRB- that 's fine , and they do warn you it can be slow -RRB- , but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import.About the rest of the program ? I do n't know . Too frustrated just trying to get it up and running .
 This software does not come close to the once-upon-a = - time quality of Adobe products . it is shot full of bugs overall . Not only does it cause your Photoshop system to quit working , it affects your entire Mac operating System . Adobe knows this is true because they try to cover up with a several page discussion about how operating systems , not Lightroom , can cause problems . Their approach of blaming someone else is shameful . The design of the product is marginal ; almost impossible to read the dark grey print on black backgrounds . It is slower than anything I have ever seen . I could go on and on but it only raises my blood pressure . I have spent the entire weekend fixing the computer programs broken by this `` half done '' system . . If you buy it , you will waste a lot of time like I did . The software is going back to Amazon tomorrow morning . Amazon , shame on you for selling such a poor product .
 I gave Adobe Photoshop Lightroom only one star because I was not able to install the program in my computer which runs Windows 2000 . During installation , the program returned a message saying it required Windows XP to run . Here are the Windows system requirements listed on the box : Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack 2Intel Pentium 4 Processor768MB of RAM -LRB- 1GB recommended -RRB- 1GB of available hard-disk space1024 x 768 screen resolutionCD-ROM driveThose requirement seem very restrictive . No mention of Microsoft Vista . So buyer beware or you may be in for a system upgrade or an unusable program .
 Lightroom is a beautiful well designed product , crafted for the way photographers work . Unfortunately , Adobe just released the 1.1 version w/o the same attention to quality that the original design implied . In upgrading to the new version , the program corrupted all the lightroom files on my main and backup hard drives rendering them useless . It then refused to be re-directed from the corrupted library and would n't even open . No matter how elegant the design , a program for managing photography files that instead destroys them is worse than useless . This is a wonderful product , that has been destroyed by a lack of attention to quality . Do n't buy it , because you ca n't trust it .
 If you 're a professional photographer who needs to adjust multiple , similar photographs in terms of brightness , contrast , and hue - then this software is a gift from the gods.For anyone else - people who want to edit one-off photos you took of your family during the last holiday , this software is pretty much pointless and FAR over-priced . Thankfully we were smart enough to download the latest trial version from adobe before dropping hundreds of dollars on this dud . We stared at it for a while trying to figure out how to do a very simple edit and then gave up -LRB- BTW
 In spite of all the hype I have found this program to be frustrating and useless . It does not interface with CS3 well and it regularly looses reference to files that have not been moved . A real disappointment .
 I tested the beta of this program and it had/has great potential , but the production version 1.0 is buggier than the beta . I run an AMD x2 3800 processor with win xp operating system . I installed the tryout version of 1.0 and am not able to import my raw files off my cf card without the program coming to a complete stop and crashing . I have to actually reboot xp in order to fully shut the program down.This is a well known issue with primarily mac users on the adobe forums . I have yet to see adobe respond to this problem by implementing a patch/upgrade to such a serious issue . To those that state their is a workaround to this bug -- copy files to the hard drive then into Lightroom - this still does not work with my large raw files and Lightroom still crashes . This is also not acceptable as it is counter intuitive to a large part of the program being produced for those needing ease to import from their cameras and cards.The program has great potential , but I am not buying into this because adobe has a bad habit of charging expensive prices for upgrades . I will assume they will ignore the known bug and charge for the fix in version 2.0 . I will wait to see if they get the program working fully with my raw files before I shell out any bucks . I like adobe 's softeare programs , but their business model is beginning to wreak like ms ' .
 I was very excited to use this software . Unfortunately , using a PC , I had too many issues with it to continue . First , while importing RAW files from a Canon 5D Mark 2 , about half of the images could n't be imported according to Lightroom because they were `` corrupt '' . OK . Fine . So I upgraded to 1.42 and then when I went into develop mode to alter the images that did import correctly , the program crashed repeatedly . I downgraded to version 1.3 and still the same . The other reviews say it , but it bears repeating - Lightroom v1 to 1.42 on the PC is too buggy to sell as a complete product . I am very disappointed .
 Lot 's of nice stuff in Lightroom , but you have to be a Photoshop expert to print properly . Unless you have the Color Management set just right you prints are going to look horrible and there is no , I repeat , no useful instructions on how to do this - only the vaguest of explanations that leave you looking for more explanations . The entire help text on Printer Color Management is less than 400 words and none of it actually tells you how to do anything . It tells you what Lightroom can do , but not how to do it . Any question you ask about Color Management on Adobe 's website simply refer you back to Lightroom 's Help/User Guide which , as I 've said , has only the vaguest of explanations.I 'm sure all this stuff is covered in Photoshop because Photoshop people who move to Lightroom do n't seem to have any problem printing , but I 'm not buying Photoshop.I 'm really glad I used the 30 day trial . I 'd be very upset if I 'd spent any money on this product .
 I am sorry to rain on the parade of adulations for lightroom but . . I have been trialing this software for 26days to date and i simply can not -LRB- and yet also can -RRB- understand the hype and adulations this s/w has received to date . . On the plus side . .1 . Its a gorgeous user interface2 . It is a great library & catalog program3 . Sorry , there isnt a 3 . . thats it.On the negative side . .1 . At best it is a so-so image EDITOR . . it recommends you go pay $ 600 for CS3 to do image editing ? . . Luckily you can get Corel Paint shop Pro for $ 79 and launch it from Lightroom .2 . Its claim to be `` all you need '' is as false as you get . . unless sending unedited images to the web is all you plan to do.I have canon equipment and so can use DPP for RAW conversion -LRB- free -RRB- , zoombrowser -LRB- free -RRB- or Corel photo album @ $ 39 for organising then honestly is an extra $ 260 worth it?In summary , Look , i am sorry , but for $ 300 i would expect something more than Elements on steroids , and when you still need an external editor and an external print manager such as Qimage this fails way way short on value for money except for professionals with huge volumes of images.I am disappointed . I had hoped for a single solution -LRB- as claimed -RRB- to my workflow ... yet i have gone back to using DPP for RAW light management , and i still have to use Paint shop pro for those 5-10 % of images that need editing , so in essence lightroom has substituted a prettier interface than corel photo album for image management . For the hobbyist and serious amateur i feel this $ 299 is more of an ego trip rather than a necessary product .
 I actually like this product even though I am only giving it a couple of stars . I shoot NEF plus JPG using my Nikon D200 and a Powershot G7 . So I manipulate fairly large images
 The claim to fame purports to make this a one-stop processing shop for Photographers.Most photographers prefer to send their post-processed files to the lab . And if they really know their stuff , they are probably profiling their images to the lab printers . This is where LR fails miserably.To make my point , I will start off by explaining how RawShooter worked -LRB- RawShooter was purchased by Adobe and after major surgical procedure sold as Lightroom -RRB- : For Rawshooter :1 . Open the RAW file .2 . Choose the profile of the printer I wish to use for the final output . This results in a significant color shift to the image as seen on the screen . After all , the benefit of the profile is to ensure that What You See Is What You Get -LRB- WYSIWYG -RRB- .3 . Make changes to the image so that the final output is to your liking . -LRB- remember , the RAW files themselves are never modified . All you do is create offset points and save that data seperately -RRB- 4 . Export to JPG5 . Send image to the lab with an assurance that WYSIWYG.With Lightroom :1 . Open the RAW file2 . No ability to choose a printer profile .3 . Make changes to the image with no idea how the final output is going to look . -LRB- remember , the RAW files themselves are never modified . All you do is create offset points and save that data seperately -RRB- 4 . Export to JPG5 . Send image to lab with the hope you like what you get -LRB- HYLWYG -RRB- So , LR can not be a one-stop shop for processing and printing RAW files . Any one who understands the importance of printer profiles would demand a WYSIWYG image to which one can apply the changes.Rawshooter was much better at this .
 Overview of review : Pros :1 . Pretty interface ,2 . Nice options to organize and rate photosCons :1 . Poor support for multiple monitors , does not span screens well ,2 . Printing required someone really special to get it right , I gave up ,3 . Vertical scroll required to reach required tools all the time ,4 . Poor interface , seems that a lot of time is wasted switching in out of library view ... 5 . Slow rendering of large Raw files , needs to pre-build the thumbnails in the background to make it bearable ,6 . Uses a database to track modifications and rate photos making you tied to a single machine , never figured out how to move the db to another machine and not loose all the changes/from Laptop to primary workstation / to portable workstation at photo sessions/to main file server for backup ... hate re-doing same thing over again ... do n't you.Adobe in its classical style has created a comprehensive product in Lightroom that can do just about anything you want if you take the time to learn the product inside and out . Unfortunately , you will need to spend considerable amount of time on each photo to get the results you want . After spending several weeks working on just 1800 photos from one wedding and reception I was getting tired of the pretty interface and went looking for something better ; especially when working with Raw files ; lightroom was just too slow even on my heavy duty multiprocessor workstation with tons of Ram , dedicated storage and multiple monitors.I tried out Bibble and was pleasantly surprised ; not only did they provide support for my new Canon 40D at the time it came out ; their interface is dead simple and gave great results with just a couple clicks ; wow , if only the guys at Adobe had some good interface people who could think out of there tried and true complex interface mentality ; and provide a simple one that works . Do n't get me wrong ; they did give a simpler interface in Library mode ; but the results are simply terrible using their auto tone ; did they really try out this stuff on real pictures before they sell it ? Also Bibble uses a file named the same as the photo with . bib extension to track the changes ; you can copy the photos from one machine to another and open it and see the same changes you just made on the other machine ; wow , someone was really thinking.Considering I have 20 years software development/QA background I can understand how hard it is for Adobe to shake off their old ways . I use to direct a group of Graphics artists who made a living because of the complexity of the Photoshop interface , so it has its advocates . The last two years doing freelance photo work on the side have made me test the market for a solution to the digital photo overload I am experiencing . Unfortunately , none of the big software companies are spending enough time on testing before they sell their products ; guess that is what they think the customers are for . I think smaller companies produce more innovative products that lead the innovation ; and Bibble is an example ; I am sure the Adobe guys will get there eventually by following the others no doubt.Adobe does stand out for organizing the photos , but I find that for processing large numbers of photos with the least effort and getting great results ; Bibble Pro has it beat hands down . Honestly , I would much rather be out taking photos then sitting in front of the computer working on them ; fortunately now I do n't have too . Thanks Bibble Pro .
 After switching routers with no increase in speed , I decided to try Network Magic in an attempt to increase in-network copy times . What a terrible mistake!At least before NM , the network was working . I 've been involved in computer networking for about 15 years , so it 's not new to me . That said , once I added a Vista and a Suse Linux box to the mix , plus a Dlink 634 router , network copy times increased dramatically . In order to complicate things even more , I ensured that I was using no less than three different AV products , each with their own firewalls and quirks.I could download from the internet at up to 800kbps - perhaps faster , but that 's the fastest I had seen . But from machine to machine within my own network , I could n't get above about 200 . After trying everything , from disabling firewalls to the aforementioned router change , there was simply no increase in speed . That 's when I made the mistake of adding NM.Initially , I did get a bump in speed - for the first several minutes . Then , my dlink router decided to shut down . Not power off , just stop routing . Over and over . It had never done this before and has n't since the removal of NM - but I 'm getting ahead of myself . I bounced the router and continued . Now my Vista laptop on wireless began dropping the connection to the network . Again , new behavior . Copy speeds , which had peaked at around 500kbps , were now running at around 160 . In an effort to clear up things , I shutdown every box in the network . Bringing them up slowly , according to NM 's instructions , I got the network back up . For about five minutes.I started the project at about 8am on a Saturday morning . By 2pm I was uninstalling . By 5pm , I had my network back . Network Magic is - at least for me - nothing but problems . From what I was able to determine , it seems to do no more than automate the sharing of items . It seems that all it does is automate network tasks using windows networking . If that 's true , all is well and good - or should be . However , I did have the router and connection issues . So it seems that somewhere , somehow , NM introduces it 's own problems.Will it work for others ? Do n't know . Was my combination of OS 's and AV products part of the problem ? Not sure - but I did shutdown all the AV products to no positive effect . I even took the time to send NM a complete list of all my products and versions in an effort to give them a chance to diagnose the problems . They sent me an email thanking me for installing NM and asking if I wanted to buy it for a discounted price . WOW . Thanks.All in all , I wasted an entire day installing a product which , in the end , created more problems than it solved . It offered zero in the way of increased functionality . If you take the time to learn this product , you can take the same time and learn windows networking - and get better results . Ca n't and would n't recommend it .
 Whatever benefits Network Magic might have , it 's not worth the problem it creates with the Windows file system , namely slowing Windows Explorer to a crawl.After installing the product , when you click on an Explorer folder , there is a noticeable delay in opening the folder and showing the contents -- usually an instantaneous operation . I 'd guess that the larger your network , the worse the delay . There are other delays as well in managing and using files . It may also impact internet browsing , though I 'm less sure of that.The reason seems to be that Network Magic apparently turns on an obscure -- and usually disabled -- feature of Windows which constantly scans other computers in the network for scheduled tasks . This is probably part of the product 's system for coordinating among various machines.I noticed the slowdown almost immediately after installing Network Magic . It practically crippled my work . I do a lot with Explorer to manage files , and that slowed from a couple seconds for normal tasks to up to an exasperating minute , mostly just waiting with no feedback.I uninstalled Network Magic , but that did not fix the problem . Luckily , I found a fix for it by searching . Using RegEdit , delete the registry key ... HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Current Version \ Explorer \ RemoteComputer \ NameSpace \ -LCB- D6277990-4C6A-11CF-8D87-00AA0060F5BF -RCB- I did not experiment with NM to see how it would run without this key . As far as I 'm concerned , a product that hurts performance this much with no warning or explanation is not to be trusted . -LRB- It also continues sending you daily e-mail even after uninstalling , which is another bad sign . -RRB-
 I tried the full product for the one week trial offered by Cisco . -LRB- Sept 2009 - from Linksys site `` Network Magic Pro '' -RRB- Network Reporting : This product reports network activity over a 24 hour period for specific PCs you specify then e-mails the report once a day -LRB- I got an e-mail after midnight most of the time . -RRB- So the reporting function IS NOT local , but depends on using a Cisco web URL to work . It reports the PC 's sites visited -LRB- but not times -RRB- , overall online usage time and a funky over simplified graph . The reporting would be much better without having to wait for a report , and depending on a website `` service '' . Software Installation : In a peer-to-peer network , not using a server , you have to install and setup the software on each computer - a big waste of time . This includes setting up a username and password for each PC.Network File sharing : What a joke - you can set this up in windows , why on earth would you want to have more software using resources ? Network Printer Sharing : See Network File sharing , -LRB- above -RRB- , same thing - you can do it easily with windows.Oh - the only thing that was nice was the network diagram . It showed devices on the network with their names , for instance iPhone , PDA , Desktop , laptop , etc. and indicated if they were on line or not.A lot of what this software gives you can be accomplished with windows GUI , Graphical User Interface , or DOS command line commands.Now if you have a Linksys -LRB- Cisco -RRB- router after the week trial you get limited functionality of the program - you ca n't get reporting anymore for instance.In my humble opinion I think if you buy a Linksys router they should give you this software instead of having to pay $ 50.00 for it -LRB- on their site Sept 2009 -RRB- . I have subsequently gone around and un-installed this software on all my computers . It is not worth anything - well maybe $ 5 . for the network diagram , that was nice.One more thing - you can not do file/printer sharing with a Palm device . -LRB- I have a Palm TX , but it did show up on the cute network diagram !!! Please do n't waste your money or time . Thanks .
 A linksys tech ask me to delete it and said `` you do not need that '' so , I deleted it but I had already paid for it .
 If you 've got a wired all XP professional network , then it works fine , however do n't add a vista laptop with a wireless connection to the mix it is just one big headache . Went back & forth with tech support and when I finally gave up and said that when I did n't use NM to manage the connection , everything went fine ... their response was Great glad that things are working for you .
 The programs works most of the time and is not hard to install . The one thing you need to note is if you check network magics web site . It tell you that is is for 8 users when you get it it tell you for 3 only . and to be fair if you check the fine print on the picture it DOES say 3 users . I just missed it
 I havent yet bought this product but i got its free trail when i bought a router . so far i dont even know how to set up a password for my network , only just a network name ? im unsure whether to buy the actual program , all i want is to be able to share the network with a Macbook Pro that i have just bought.does anyone know if i buy 4.0 whether i can share the network without intruders , because so far there seems to be no way of getting a password on the trial .
 the software would not load properly onto any of my 3 computers . I have the newest windows 10 , windows vista and windows xp . Now I have software that I can not use
 This software is advertised as Mac OS X , but it 's not . It 's for the older Mac OS7 .1 to 9.x OS.If you have the OS 9 install disks you can run the older software in emulation on OS X , but it 's not true OS X.
 Am quite dissapointed as the discs are blank . Am returning them to seller . Marcia A. Rygaard
 Wouldn &#8217; t install without a ton of personal information and spyware , then wouldn &#8217; t run properly . Also every time you try to use it your forced to endure their cheesy flash add before it freezes and fails to load the program . You need not buy any product from a manufacture like this unless of course you want to waste money .
 This was a total disappointment to me . I was so excited to get this since I 'm dying to learn Spanish . Does not help at all ! If anyone is considering getting this , try Pimseluer . It 's easy , fun and you do n't have to be tied down to a computer to learn the language . It is on CD 's so you can learn it in the car or while cleaning the house . Pimseluer uses conversations that you will really use speaking to a Spanish person . They also have other languages .
 Family Tree Maker 11 has a program error which has not been corrected . It can not correctly transfer information for a tree chart to PDF . The charts are incomplete and not centered on the page . The problem was detected last October 2003 , acknowledged by technical support and I was told
 This program was extremely unstable on WinXP . I bought Legacy Family Tree and found it to be far more sophisticated and had no problems on WinXP . Do n't waste your money on FTM , get Legacy Family Tree by Millenium instead , you 'll be completely satisfied .
 I have been using FTM for 6 years and purchased the upgrade . It is not as user friendly as the old versions and seems quite complicated from a getting started perspective . I used to dabble on a daily basis with my tree and now I find myself spending a lot of time trying to understand where to go for the various trees , displays , web options and merging . UGH
 My experience with the company that produces this Family Tree Maker software and may other CDs that they pedal is very bad . They will double bill you and they lie and say they refunded you , and then lie and say they show no record that you even ordered . While FTM genealogy program is OK -LRB- there are others in the market which are better -RRB- , it is unfortunate company policy that they design it to where you have to keep buying more add-ons . Other genalogy software companies are honest , but not this one . The census CDs I foolishly boutght are worse than worthless . I do NOT recommend purchasing anything from this company . Buy from a company with integrity .
 After having spent all the money on the program you should NOT have to buy all the bloody add ons to make it even semi useful
 I am a first-time user and purchased # 8 . I found it to be easy to use and understand , and the ability to print out nice looking family trees is great . However of the 35 CDs that came with the # 8 Deluxe package , I found one useful and the others excess baggage . If you get the cheapest version of FTM , you 'll get your money 's worth . Any more and you 'll have a lot of spare CDs to use as drink coasters for your hot chocolate . The strengths of the program are it 's ease of use , the ability to include photos and `` scrapbook '' info , and to print attractive trees . The weaknesses of the program are the misleading advertising that makes you think you can use it for researching and the frustrating `` buy , buy , buy '' pitch at every turn . I would recommend FTM , but mainly as a good basic database .
 The only thing I got was the installation cd . The other cds require you to go online for informaion . You do not have access to the cds you are sent . It is too expensive to have an account with all the online areas you have to go to . What happened to buying cds with the information . I contributed all my tree , which was enormous , and I got nothing for my work . I lost my cds that I had found all of it on and now I am having to pay to retrieve it . The information I gave was free and in return I have to pay for what I sent . The only thing I got was Family Tree Installation . 20 cds and nothing more . They will not be getting any more free information from me .
 When my computer crashed , I lost my family tree files . I bought this new version so that I could install my backup files but I can not for sme reason . I am in the process of manually re-entering my data . From the instructions I can not figure how to read any of the accompanying discs , nor can I read any of of the discs I have from previous versions of the software .
 I wish I could give them zero stars.Broderbund pulled support for software I owned only 2 years after it was released.I was unable to install it because it required internet registration which was no longer supported . To solve the problem , they offered to SELL me a different software title.They must have thought I was stupid . They expected me to give them more money ??? This company has second rate software and third rate customer service . Do not buy anything from them .
 I have used older versions of Family Tree Maker for years and liked it . I decided that with a newer version I would take advantage of the on-line features offered . I ran into trouble when I tried to register the product . I finally called the telephone number provided for support and found that the company that bought Broderbund does not provide support for this version , only the new versions . They did not want to talk to me once they found I was using a brand new copy of Version 11 . Because I could not even register the product , I can not use any of the on-line features . It works just fine for building a family tree , but I thought I paid for more than that .
 I bought this product to find out information about my family , but this is n't what it says it is . This product is for people that already know about their family not people trying to find out about their family . You get a lot of disk but any information on those you have to go to Geneology.com to get the information and then the free subscribtion that you get to Geneology.com you only have access to a few things but not what you need from the disk , that is extra if you want to use it . I have n't been able to find anything about my family or my husbands family from either of these programs . So if you are trying to find information about your family I would try a different program because this one does n't help .
 I bought this software because Family Tree Maker reviews indicated the latest FTM software -LRB- made to run with vista -RRB- was n't nearly as good as the earlier Version 16 . FTM does offer a Vista patch that 's supposed to make Version 16 work with vista . While the software will run , the function that lets you export a family tree diagram to . pdf format causes the software to crash . FTM tech support was great to work with , but after 5 or 6 attempts , they still have n't found a way to make version 16 run on my new vista machine . The software does run just great on XP , and the vendor who sold this product to me was excellent . The only problem is the fact that FTM 's vista patch does n't fix everything it 's supposed to fix . I 'd buy FTM version 16 again if I did n't have vista . I 'll go back to XP or buy a Mac before I buy any new PC with vista or 7 .
 Made a mistake when I purchased this program . Repeatedly removed and re-installed the program with the same result
 The list of features on this program was enough to make me salivate , but do not trust your precious research to this buggy program . Files are corrupted with such regularity that you must perform manual backups each time you make a change , and there is no way to overwrite files with the same name , so you are forced to save each backup as a new file , filling up your hard drive with multiple family trees . There is an auto-backup feature that is useless as it corrupts when your primary files corrupt . There are also firewall issues with the web search feature . A quick search of the support forums for this product reveal that many , many people are having the same problems with this software , but no fixes seem to be coming . I was really looking forward to using this program , and I 'm extremely disappointed at how it performs . I would not recommend this until the problems are addressed .
 I do n't think this was designed by a gardener . I was hoping for something to help with scheduling plant care , managing plant lists to help with garden design , recording desired growing conditions etc. . Instead it is a generic database program with a simple template for recording a picture and flowering information.If it had special functions , or even a database of plants to choose from to avoid tedious entry , it might be handy . As is , a scrap book of plant tags is a lot less work .
 While I endorse the Sony LocationFree system , I was previously annoyed that additional LocationFree players required the purchase of this CD-ROM for about 30 bucks . However , as of November 29 , 2007 , the software contained on this CD-ROM is available as a free download from Sony 's website . No code is required -- it is truly just free . My 1-star rating of the CD-ROM sold here is based entirely on `` value '' , comparing it to the exact same version that is available as a free download .
 I paid for a one year subscription that was not set to expire until Jan 15 , 2008 . I did not receive 52 weeks -LRB- 1 year -RRB- , I only received 50 weeks then my subscription was deactivated because I would not renew two weeks early . I made more than 4 attempts to correct this issue.I was ripped off and I will not EVER buy another Norton product ever.I now use `` McAfee Total Protection '' which is a superior product anyway .
 installed fine but everything ran super slow -LSB- new high end laptop with 1 gig of memory -RSB- in one month it locks up , cant boot , costomer service gave advice that didnt work , paid computer tech $ 81.00 to remove it . JUNK
 I had always heard great things about Reader Rabbit software but I was very disappointed in this one ! My four year old got frustrated after 5 minutes and gave up . She found the instructions to be too difficult to understand because they were very detailed and spoken too quickly . The premise is that you 're supposed to gather items for a surprise party . You need to obtain a specific amount of each item and it goes into an empty room once you gather enough for the party . You need to go to different areas to make cookies , wrapping paper etc. . I do n't know how a four year old could do this without adult supervision . This software will sit on the shelf until my daughter gets older . Hopefully then she 'll enjoy it .
 There is one part of this game where the main character enters a room that is entirely empty except for a carpet , a few drapes , and blank walls . It 's like someone forgot to work on the scene . There are other parts where the animated characters do the same things over and over and over , and the tasks are extremely repetitive . Other scenes are equally dense or unimaginative . The artwork is awkward and ugly . The interface is non-intuitive , as is the flow of the story . There 's also this Blob thing that lays on the ground to help you with navigation , and he 's a depressing little thing.So , this title is not recommended . Try Freddi Fish or Puttputt or SpyFox . Avoid this turkey in disguise .
 My kids did not find the games very interesting and neither did I.
 My daughter loves the Little Bear show -- I like it , too , so I bought her this game . Unfortunately , this game is really old -LRB- in computer years -RRB- so the technology is outdated which makes it more difficult and frustrating for my daughter to use . It also does n't load on anything with an operating system newer than Windows XP , so it works on our old desktop but not my husband 's new laptop . I would recommmend looking for a better game .
 I spent nearly 8 hours trying to get Norton Ghost to leave me with a cloned drive I could actually boot from in XP Pro . Acronis did the job first time in under 2 hours -LRB- I had it automatically recopy the entire disk -RRB- . I 'm sold on Acronis .
 I lost a lot of picture and music files that I could not retrieve from the backup portion of the software after I had a computer meltdown . Maybe the meltdown was due to inadequate protection . I will probably never know , but I use a different software now.Also , I canceled my two year subscription , but NEVER got a refund.I had used Norton products starting with my first computer in the 80 's . But no more when they can not save my files or even refund unused year plus of subscription .
 I purchased Cyberlink PowerDVD 7 Full Version from OC Tech Deals and received a OEM bundled version that was labeled `` not of resale '' . I initiated a `` Comments : '' back to the supplier on 8/29/08 that expressed my dissatisfaction with what was shipped . Their ad on Amazon and the shipping paperwork all referenced PowerDVD 7 Full Version ; but they actually shipped an OEM bundled version . I rate OC Tech Deals a 1 -LRB- lowest rating -RRB- for deceptive advertising and shipping `` non-resalable '' OEM disks . OC Tech Deals never replied to my 8/28/08 comments so customer service also gets a 1 rating !
 Absolutely horrible !!!! When I tried to burn a DVD , the burn failed 3 times . On the last time , it totally messed up my whole computer . Norton , Explorer , Quickbooks , and even my wireless keyboard would n't work . It took me three days on the phone with different tech supports to get my system running again.Avoid this crappy software .
 it works but got money back the real deal is in all the other products/downloads you need to buy bafter this ! Thanks
 Where to begin ? 1 . This is an 11 CD product , which are independent programs , writen by 11 different companies , that do not interact with each other . Hello TOPICS its 2007 , quit acting like it is 1997.2 . Four of the programs will not run . Why ? because it wants you to have shock wave 8.5 installed on your computer . I have Shockwave 10.1 installed . The program does not care that you have a newer verison . That is stupid .3 . I sent an e-mail to these four companies to get a patch four the shockwave 8.5 requirement , its been 3 weeks now and no response .4 . The products are about useless , my teen wo n't even look at them , he said the on-line web sites he found are much easier to use and they are free .5 . I ca n't return the product , because I opened the product to use . The store did n't care if I was not satisified , they have a store policy on software product returns .
 Hmmm , NOF , I thought they went out of business ; amazing , and amusing , how so many people support bloated wastes of CPU cycles . I tried NOF version one back in '97 -LRB- maybe it was ' 98 , I forget -RRB- ; I uninstalled it after about 20 minutes . It made pointlessly bloated and redundant , highly incorrect , and completely standards-non-compliant code . I 'm sure they 've perfected the process by now . Homesite 's good if you need pretty colors to keep things straight -LRB- if you know what you 're doing , you should n't need it -RRB- . Try using notepad -LRB- or , if you 're on a unix , try pico -RRB- , you ca n't go wrong ; that is unless you have no idea what you 're doing , in which case you might 've chosen the wrong profession . #ifndef USERHAPPY #define USERHAPPYif -LRB- os == windows -RRB- -LCB- install -LRB- linux -RRB- ; / / have a nice day :-RRB- -RCB- #endif
 Sure , it 's easy to set up a simple web site with NetObjects Fusion ; however , you ca n't edit the html , it uses cluttered and heavy code -LRB- since the program codes the html for you -RRB- , it uses a lot of propietary modules , it produces confusing and redundant nested tables that is next to impossible to edit using a regular html editor , and it produces slow loading pages . The program is also not as flexible or extensible as other authoring software out there . If you want a professional authoring tool that produces lean , clean , editable code - stick with Dreamweaver .
 This product is simple enough for a basic website containing only buttons and text . Conversely , it is terrible if you want to do anything marginally advanced . Fusion 's automation is limited to the very basic functions of building a site . Try importing a database file with links and you 'll be very dissapointed that you now need to re-link all of the fields with their respective destinations.Need help ? ... does not include any technical support .
 I guess it 's fine if you want to do a lot of data input by hand and from scratch . But if you have data in a database like Access that you want to import you will be frustrated . Constant error messages and it seems like it would take longer to find all the errors in the import file than it would to do the data entry ! I gave up .
 Afer 12 hours and about 35 crashes , I have a cartoon-like `` landscape '' that only vaguely resembles my property and is n't even useful for proportions . I was hard pressed to find a single feature that behaved as advertized.THis software was worse than useless because it took the whole day to figure out how badly I was cheated .
 This Software has a real nice package with lots of great examples on it . How they made them , I have no idea ! Maybe I 'm to spoiled with my AutoCad LT program . I bought this program because I 'm redoing my backyard . Thinking it would be nice to have a finished view of my ideas before I started -LRB- like the ones on the box -RRB- , I dove right in . That was over a month ago , and I still ca n't get my ideas down . I 'm so damn frustrated with this program , and its poor instructions , that it drove me to write this review , which I have never done before . The review from the person giving it 5 stars has to be working for the company . If I could have givin it 0 stars , I would have .
 I bought this software for my husband a year ago because we wanted to be able to put a photo of our house into the landscape plan . We have yet to figure it out . The manual is the size of a text book . The software is not user friendly . If you have lots of free time to learn how to use it , this software might be a good tool . I am not impressed .
 I ordered this software to help me design my backyard . It was way too difficult to use . Trying to look at my project from different angles was impossible . I sent in my rebate last September and have not recieved my check . I went online to see what is going with my rebate and it claims my check has already been sent . There is no date of when the rebate was sent so I guess it is the old `` Checks in the mail '' answer . If you want to keep your sanity `` DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT '' . I only gave them 1 star because it did install and this site does n't have a 0 star selection .
 I bought this software for designing landscape and my deck . The landscape tools have a large library of plants , shrubs and trees all nicely depicted -LRB- and you can make them grow -RRB- but you have to drag and drop them into your design and then double click on each one to get a description . Makes it hard to find what your looking for.The deck tool is very poor . It does n't calculate materials except for railing material ! -LRB- Why bother ? -RRB- Any good design program should include a library of standard materials . This one does n't .
 I just wanted it to plan some landscaping . I am an experienced software user , and have been active in the software development industry for 15 years . Just want you to know that so you can understand that I am not a novice user.However , this is the 1st product that has me completely stumped . I doubt that I 'll be able to get my money back but I will try . This has been a complete waste of time . The pictures on the package are the most misleading I have seen on a software box .
 I spent way too much time trying to get this program to do what I wanted it to . The 3D walkaround is n't nearly as good as Sierra 's LandDesigner . Every time you put the CD in it launches the installer which can get annoying . In the course of using the product I found several bugs , one of which I could n't find a workaround -LRB- unexpectedly resizing the right side of the lot which would then foul up every object on that side -RRB- . All in all I feel like it was a waste of money .
 I was used to an old version of a land design package by Sierra that gave me nice , big pictures of my house to work with , but it broke . -LRB- Okay , so it was slow , but I could visualize what I wanted . -RRB- This monster takes forever to figure out and the digital pictures you import show up in a tiny window . Once you figure out how to make that thing bigger , you 're exhausted from trying to learn the rest of it . Also , it advertises that you can do interior design with it but I simply ca n't find that feature . -LRB- They did give me a booklet of houseplans , though . -RRB- I hate it and wish I could get my money back .
 Master Landscape is not easy by any means to master . This product is very hard to use , it takes weeks to learn . My recommendations would be do n't waste your money and buy something else . This product is really a 5.95 value .
 Plant data base is not accessable by choosing the name of an item - you choose from pictures which are dragged on to your plan and only then can you find out it 's name . Also not enough choice in materials i.e. gravel , rocks , paving , outdoor garden features like pergolas , sunhouses etc. . The house design is not easy to use for amateurs - not easy to construct - I am still trying to find out how to apply a flat roof to part of a house design and to build walls which actually go to the apex of the roof . I have used better and easier to use programmes 10 years ago when the technology is not what it should be today . Not recommended at all - a complete waste of money .
 A particularly illogical piece of CAD software ! In my opinion a fundamentally flawed program which will do nothing other than waste your time !
 After reading the reviews of this product -LRB- and they were overwhelmingly bad -RRB- , I would not buy it .
 This program looks like it does alot but once you start drawing with it you quickly see limitations . I am a Photoshop , powerpoint , excel user and am comfortable with toolbars and functions . This program will not group and move an object . Each line drawn must be adjusted individually . I gave up after 2 hours of trying to draw an odd shaped house angled on an odd shaped lot . For straight lots it will probably work fine . Also , the arial views were extremely difficult to control . I was flying all over the place but could n't get around the corner of the house .
 I do not recommend this program for garden design . It has a vast number of plants to choose from and although they are broken down into catagories you will not be able to search for a specific plant and the pictures are small and hard to recognize . I spent 3 hours looking through the perenials hoping to find that I wanted for my bed only to have the program lock-up on me . Oh well ... I do like the home design and floorplan trace .
 I purchased this product last week in order to complete a garden design for a client who wished to see various 3D views . In my previous job I used AutoCAD and TurboCAD , so am no novice when it comes to computer-aided design.I feel that this product is slickly packaged fluff - I would be very surprised indeed if a qualified horticulturalist or garden designer was in any way involved in the design.Firstly , the site layout tool is fairly easy to use , allowing you to get the basic plot onto your plan . From there on though , things begin to go awry . There is a very poor selction of fence styles etc , but to custom draw your own is extremely cumbersome , using a clumsily designed and rather archaic 3D-Custom builder , which you must swap into and out of . In addition , the selection of styles for hard-landscaping surfaces is very limited , meaning you can only render a vague idea of the actual finish you are looking for . Finally , on the hard-landscaping front , the photo-importing tool -LRB- one of the main features that swung me in favour of this product -RRB- is terribly difficult to use.On the plant side , it goes from bad to worse . The plants that are in the selection are badly drawn to a large extent , and one feature that is absolute fluff with no basis in reality is the plant ager . This feature ages all trees almost identically up to the age of 20 years , which is pointless . Even the most extreme novice is surely aware that a black oak will be considerably larger than an English Hawthorn as time progresses ? More importantly though , the plants have no Latin names - which is quite shocking in any garden design programme . The English names are Americann-English , which varies wildly from real English -LRB- yes , I know it 's an American product , but to launch it in the UK or Europe without taking account of this is lazy , money-grabbing marketing -RRB- It is for this very reason that Latin nomenclature is used !!!! The English list is not even alphabetical ! In addition , the ` artists renditions ' of many of tha plants are quite inaccurate.I have read a few good reviews of this item on this page , and can only assume thay have been paid to write them . This is most definitely the worst piece of software I have ever purchased , and I will take it back to the shop I bought it from as soon as I can to try and argue for a refund . DO N'T BUY IT !!!!!
 Do n't waste your money ... I should have paid attention to the other reviews ! I have 18 years experience building and marketing business and GIS software . I am also an accomplished landscape hobbyist . This company has put all their money into marketing a product and not into building a user friendly product . A few of the problems :1 . 3D rendering has many `` flyaway '' lines ... that is stray lines projecting outwards from the house making the image unusable .2 . 3D Photoview is difficult to use . I was also unable to integrate my 2D layout with the photo .3 . The 3D flyover and walkthrough features are impossible to control and therefore not usable .4 . The plant library is useless . All it gives you is a list of pictures with NO descriptions or titles . Therefore , you have NO idea of what plant you are placing into your landscape . You only know what plant you have chosen AFTER it is placed by right clicking on the image and checking properties . Useless and SLOW !!! 5 . The manual is poorly written -LRB- I read it ! -RRB- and does not explain the process -LRB- from start to finish -RRB- of how to put together a typical plan . For example , it tells you how to import a photo but NOT how to use it in your plan ...
 Please do not believe the hired reviewers of this software that gave it any praise . I am a landscaper and this software is useless for the do-it-your-self or for any serious designer . The plant selection is extremely limited despite the claim of the large number of plants . The plants symbols are so far off in appearance , size and color that it is laughable . I tried entering at least 50 popular landscape plants and found 2 or 3 in the database . I am only hoping that I can return this junk after I have opened it .
 The other reviewers were dead on ... I bought this product from an office store , before I read these reviews . I wanted to start with the basics , and recreate a survey I had done of my property . Even using the landscaping tool for this simple task was difficult . When you drag the line beyond the window , it does not automatically scroll down , so you have to page down , and extend the line . Also , once a property line is drawn , the dimensions are too small to read . This program tries to do alot , and feels like they just bundled a bunch a inferior prodcuts together . Do n't waste your time or money .
 I have purchased the Prophet Pro 4.0 version for $ 199.95 from the vendor and straight out of the gate the installation was fraught with bugs and problems . I had to first tweak the registry with a patch to get the software to even begin the install , I then had to download a file from Micrososft `` Windows Installer Distributable 3.1 '' to get the software to install on the machine . After the installation according to the users guide when I start Outlook I was to be asked questions regarding the configuration and what files to use and where to install which never happened . After this it was no suprise to find that no component of the application was present at all within Outlook . I uninstalled the software and went through the process again and finally got it to run only to find that some of the toolbars did not work when pressed and that when I wanted to backup my DB to my network drive it would not do it because you have to backup locally and manually copy it to the server for safekeeping . To make this even worse , if that was possible , Avidian does not provide patches , updates or fixes on their website like most NORMAL developers do , you have to pay a seperate fee for that bit of heaven . When asked why this was not included in the purchase price I was told that their oversees customers dont require patches or fixes , which makes you wonder what the heck those people are doing over there . In short the only good thing about this product is the money back guarantee which I am going to fully avail myself of . If you are looking for a good CRM product look at Maximizer , I think that will be the route I am going to pursue.PS ... Avidian people dont seem to give a hang whether or not you are happy with their product or service , maybe they will start if more of us who buy the product and return it spread the word a bit.PSS ... Too bad I cant choose a number of stars lower than 1 , 1 seems to good for them .
 I loaded this program on XP OS and knew right away I was in trouble . You could not see any of the pictures , text , nothing . Everything was discolored , washed out . In short , this CD , which I really had high expectations for , was useless and was trashed within 1 hour of loading it . Do n't bother with this CD as you may as well be tossing your money out the window .
 Yes , I had the same problem I have windows 8 and this product does not work . So anyone with a new operating system should not buy it . This program may only work XP .
 The product specifications for this product as listed on the page I ordered from claim that this is compatible with windows . While technically true , it is only compatible with some versions of Windows . I found out after installing it that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7 . I think they should specify on the products details section which versions of Windows it is compatible with . I spent a fair amount of time installing this product , and then researching on the manufacturer 's website on how to resolve the compatiblilty issue . There was no solution other than buy a more current version of the product . I am waiting to see if I will get a refund due to compatibility issues .
 I installed this garbage in my computer and suddenly my DVD/CD writer did not work . I would get errors and the program would crash every time I tried making a cd . The product support is lousy . Eventually I had to uninstall it . Waste of money .
 Made several coasters along with crashing my heavy duty PC before I finally dumped it and went back to a standard NERO offering . IMO , you can find a better product
 I 've had this for 10 months , have n't used it much , mainly just copying discs or burning files on them . I 'm really sorry I paid money for this . Most of the discs I 've tried to copy it has hung up and I 've had to cancel the operation and throw away another disc . Best I can tell there is NO customer service.When I researched , it seemed to be either Roxio or Nero , and Roxio had better reviews . How Nero could be worse I just ca n't imagine.Also the program wants me to upgrade . No way .
 It did n't work for me . I bought this a while back and when my computer drive crashed the other day I found it unopened among the software I was reinstalling . I thought cool , I can install it too . Not so cool . Now every time the computer boots or I open the program it crashes stating C++ error , buffer overrun . I ca n't use it and it is nothing but an irritation . I have tried to download updates but that crashes the program too . I checked Roxio 's forums and see a post with my same problem un-addressed for over a month now and with 253 views . Seems I am not the only one with this problem but I ca n't find a solution so I am looking for a replacements program . Shame too cuse it had exactly what I was looking for in services . Oh well . Back to the drawing board .
 i just downloaded antispam to my new laptop and a formerly perfect machine now has intermittent internet access and is just plain acting funny when I go online . I just contacted support via email , but I have little hope . I 'm going to try for a refund .
 In regard to blocking spam emails , I have not found much in this product that is not available for free with Outlook Express filtering.The popup blocker would be OK if it did n't block good as well as bad popups.All in all this program creates more trouble than it prevents.Not worth the price .
 Ditto , ditto . I bought it OTC at Costco , and find that it habitually moves mail on my allowed list to the spam folder . At least it gives me an easy way to id all new messages , read the two that are legit , and delete the 9 spams . I basically read my mail from the spam folder now !
 As a user of this and other Norton products and as a tech-support professional , I must tell you that the bad reviews are true . I used to be a big fan of Norton products until recently .
 I ca n't tell you the amount of problems I have had with this product . I decided to just go with MS Outlook 2003 's spam filters which are working fine without Norton anti-spam . I often suspect that this program was the cause of outlook crashing as I have had not problem since uninstalling this terrible program.I think the only bright side was that it caught most ofthe spam . One of the bad things is it marks everything it thinks is spam with a special header . Also I was unable to mark valid emails as valid . I had to maunaly move any valid emails . Plus I was not able to delete by the empty spam button.My advice is save your money for a better product , check out the reviews on amazon before buying . I 'm $ 30.00 poorer and not very happy .
 I have a 2-month-old Dell , XP-Pro . Been doing great w/Symantec Anti-Virus and Firewall.I installed this devil on my PC and could n't connect back to the Internet -LRB- cable/modem -RRB- . Hour 1 - My ISP blamed my Firewall . I checked and noticed my ` Intrusion Detection ' was now disabled on my firewall . I tried to enable and get error , `` you do not have sufficient privilege to enable this '' . I am the Administrator ! I finally uninstalled my Symantec Firewall and was able to connect to the Internet . I reinstalled the firewall and had the same issues.Hour 2 - I attempted to go to Hotmail . I get another error saying , `` You must enable Java-scripting to view this website '' ; same for Yahoo mail and various links to news at MSN and others . I researched the web for patches or compatibility issues and could find nothing but similar complaints.Hour 3 - I decided to Purge the Demon . I uninstalled the new 2005 Norton AntiSpam . I found that my Symantec Firewall would still not let me enable Intrusion Detection feature I. So , I uninstalled and reinstalled the Symantec Firewall performed updates and guess what ? My computer is back to normal . After this hellish experience I am thinking that a little spam may not be such a bad thing .
 This is the last Norton product I will buy . It will not classify spam in Eudora Symantec support says they are looking into it -LRB- Now two months -RRB- . It misses spam all of the time , even with training . Installing was a nightmare!If you are having spam problems , I strong suggest you switch to Eudora and get their spam watch . Far better .
 1 . high false identification rate . missed quite a few spam emails , and marked a lot of legit emails spam2 . Integration with outlook express , it make the rule unmodifiable , which would be fine if it works well , but they do n't put a stop to processing more rules , and my subsequent rules will move the messages marked spam to a different folder , then the toolbard wo n't allow me to mark the message non-spam from those folders.I kinda solved that problem by making a copy of the norton rule , and added a stop processing more rules in it.I wo n't buy it if it were a stand alone software , but it came with internet security ...
 It works intermittently - beware opening your email too soon after reboot as it seems AntiSpam takes a while to connect up with Outlook . Do n't use the `` This is spam '' or `` This is not spam '' as this usually hangs Outlook requiring a reboot . The entry under `` Outlook or Outlook Express fails after clicking the `` This is Spam '' button in your email program '' on the Symantec web site does n't exist so I guess they know there 's a bug but ca n't figure out how to fix it .
 This product is working on the problem I bought it to address - blocking offensive pornographic e-mails . so far its been 100 % effective . -LRB- It has only been a couple of weeks however -RRB- the problem is we 're apparently not getting any legitimate e-mail now . folks on our `` allowed '' list are n't getting through . All the settings seem to be in order , but I 've confirmed that good e-mail is getting blocked also by unsuccessfully sending an e-mail from work and unsuccessfully eliciting e-mail from other `` allowed '' users . To compound matters , the `` product support '' that 's free is virtually worthless . I ca n't figure out how to get to a helpful place - seems to require a series of mysterious downloads . I 'm reluctant to try the phone help because of the cost and the bad experience others have reported with that help source . I can not recommend this product . seems like some of the problems interfacing with Outlook reported for the 2004 product are continuing .
 The GOODIt does effectively filter SPAM . In my experience over the last 7 months , it has been 92 % effective . This is great because 63 % of my email is SPAM . Let 's me focus on my work.The BADIt is really really slow . If you click the `` This is SPAM button '' it takes about 6 seconds to process the request . More disturbing is that other operations like selecting different emails are also slower.The UGLYAs other users have indicated , do n't open up your email -LRB- Outlook Express in my case -RRB- too soon after reboot or AntiSPAM will not load . Very strange . Wait until you hard drive starts buzzing before you open the email application.In the past , I also experienced crashes when hitting the `` This is SPAM button '' . Strangely , I have not had this happen lately.If your SPAM level is only about 10 % , do n't bother with this program . If your SPAM level is 50 % or higher , this might be worth a try .
 Thank you for your published reviews . It was the review of the Norton Antispam that prompted me to forget about trying to order a new Norton product after experiencing difficulties attempting to upload my newly renewed subscription to the Antispam software which had expired while I was on vacation . After reading your published comments -LRB- I was attempting to order the product on Amazon.com and happened to run across the appropriate review -RRB- and realizing that I was not the problem but Norton 's poor product was the problem , I called a respected computer businessman who came to my home the same day , identified several problems associated with the attempted uploading of the Norton product , and now promises to have my repaired computer returned to me by week 's end . The computer person told me he had endorsed the Norton products until 10 months ago when far too many customers were having problems with the upload versions -LRB- subscription renewals -RRB- as well as other concerns.I am so relieved I did not purchased the product before reading your review and am grateful to Amazon.com for its published reviews , whether good or bad !
 I purchased the Norton Internet Security with the Norton Antispam hoping that it would eventualy solve my ever increasing amounts of spam in my inboxWith my daily routine of clicking this is spam - my Norton Antispam folder contained 8000 spam emails in 6 months . I checked my statistics and the logs to my astonishment - Norton Antispam did not scan 1 single email.Reporting this 3 times during 1-2 hour live chat sessions -LRB- with their customer support -RRB- only proved to me that this product is as bad as all the reviews state . The `` techs '' provided me the same advice and fixs over and over again which , were all tried and failed . The phone support was equally as fustrating as the chat support and Symantec 's outsourced technical support technicians seem to have a single cheat sheet page of solutions that never resolved any of my concerns.I will do some additional research and choose anything but a symantec products . They were good in the past but failed miserably with this version . They get an D - for the software and a BIG F for customer support . Buyers Beware !!
 I work in IT and I 've dealt with a lot of buggy Symantec products before but this is by far the worst one I 've ever used . If you 're an Outlook Express user then this program will be totally useless to you . It seems that the infamous '' ` This is Spam ' button crashes Outlook Express '' bug from the 2004 version is still there -LSB- ... -RSB- After going through the usual uninstall/reinstall/change every freakin setting routine , I spent hours trying to find a solution on the symantec tech support site and on other sites with no luck . The Symantec tech support site is terrible . I could n't find any place to report an incident through email or post it to a support forum or anything like that . And with phone support at $ 30/incident , I 'm currently looking at how to get a refund !
 Search for Amazon item number 10099566 to see an overwhelming number of bad reviews of Norton AntiSpam 2004 . They did n't improve the product much in the 2005 version . It is really disgusting that Symantec has leveraged the Norton brand , formerly known for quality , with the cynical money grab that is Norton AntiSpam . Absolute junk software , with comically bad support . I hope to see a class action lawsuit against Symantec for selling this product that they certainly know is defective in a myriad of ways .

 I found this software to be VERY dissapointing . It just does not work very well ? I use Incredimail as my e-mail provider , and find Norton AntiSpam to be less than helpful . It is very good at always mentioning Norton AntiSpam on my spam e-mails , problem is it does n't block most of them ? So what is the use of having an AntiSpam program ? I find this product to be a total waste of money . Now I am really wondering about the quality of other Symantec Norton products in general ?
 Nine out of 10 tries to open Outlook Express have failed since I first installed this product . I suppose that 's one way of stopping spam ; you do n't get any email at all . Symantec 's free online technical support has tried to help , but the apex of the advice has been to redownload and reinstall the suite -- 32 MB of data and then 32 MB of Live Update . Like other reviewers , I suspect that this product should not have shipped.Purchase with extreme caution and fully back up your system before you install so that you can fully back out .
 I 've used this product in its 2004 version and just recently upgraded to 2005 . The 2005 version is nothing but junk when compared to the 2004 version . It seems to stall when closing Outlook Express , it takes upwards of a minute to mark an email as an anti-spam email , and some items marked as spam never get recognized properly and end up in the wrong folder everytime . I 've unstalled the product but doubt I 'll ever get my money back .
 My `` This is spam button '' intermittently appears , and NORTON CUSTOMER SERVICE or TECH SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTENT . I have run the maze to find a way to ask them about the intermittent toolbar and NO REPLY . Symantec would rather you DIY with FAQs dealing with a limited set of issues instead of REAL OPERATIONAL CONCERNS . I 've had internet connection issues , lost IE links -LRB- recovered them -RRB- ; I use Firefox , had numerous issues . LOTS of PROBLEMS - but mostly disappointing was the LACK OF SUPPORT . If you get this , you 're on your own to deal with lots of problems and erratic behavior .
 Skip this one , and reconsider whether any of the symantec products are worth the hassles .
 Norton ca n't be serious . This is truly the worst piece of software ever perpetrated upon mankind.The most incredibly obvious pieces of spam are coming into my inbox by the hundreds , marked `` Norton Anti Spam '' , even with my settings on the highest possible sensitivity.The first and only piece of mail they marked as Spam was of course from a desired sender.This is so bad I am amazed.I only wish there was a rated lower than one . This is definitely in the sub zero regions .
 Wish I had read the reviews first ! Faulty program can not be read by computer at all . I spent an hour trying to no avail . Will contact Amazon ?
 The game was great the first time we played it , then it did n't work , the company would n't return my calls so I returned it to amazon .
 I received a disk with the freddie the fish cover . When i attempted to put the game on for my twins , the disk could not be read .
 This is very difficult to navigate . I bought it used and there were n't instructions . A game should be logical enough to decipher without directions . Especially a program like this one , duh !
 Do n't even think about buying this software ! I had previously purchased Linux Mandrake 7.0 and was going to repartition my hard drive to use both Linux and Windows . Big mistake!Not only did the installation fail initially and the documentation was scant to say the least , after I did finally manage to get it installed -LRB- somewhat as my winmodem and HP deskjet printer USB both were not supported -RRB- , then the Boot Magic program could not find root and so I had to use LILO instead to access both OS . LILO is fine but for novices to Linux -LRB- me to a degree -RRB- it 's not graphical like Boot Magic.Anyway , I decided this was n't worth it so I decided to uninstall it and totally screwed everything up . I had to go to a friend 's house and use his PC to download AEFdisk to get rid of the Linux partition and restore my PC . Well , I managed to get rid of not only Linux but Windows as well , so needless to say , I had to reinstall everything again.I then decided to try Linux for Window and could n't get past install but the install.bat file only supports cd-rom drives D thru H. I turned to email support -LRB- which advertises 24 hour turnaround -RRB- and received a response 4 1/2 days later . I had already figured out by then how to edit the install.bat file and so tried again but this time got a kernel panic error because linux could n't mount root.I 've given up with this . I 'll just build a new box and install linux only on it.Unless you 're a Unix geek , in which case you wo n't be using Winblows anyway , do n't even bother with this crappy software.Bad software and worse support!Save your money !
 I have two versions of this program , and boy did it mess up my computer . After the install began , and was finished , there was no rebooting my computer . I had to format my drive and reinstall all of my applications and it just made me hate linux even more . If I do build a linux computer , I 'll do it as the only OS on the drive and I 'll only use my left over parts from my upgrades of previous systems . In simpleer words if you want to try linux use a spare computer , NOT your main computer .
 I just loved the Linux For Windows packaging ! Three easy steps ! Well it is not 3 easy steps . Had a problem right from the get go , as the install.bat is coded for CD-ROM drives no higher than H. My drive is M , but the error message I recieved gave no indication of such . And furnished email tech support was no more helpful . Support could have suggested Windows person -LRB- me -RRB- change drive letter . Thought of that , but for some novice user ? There is not enough documentation in the 2 supplied manuals , espically when it comes to figuring out the video card install . After 2 attempted installs , have Linux 4 Windows on my secondary hard drive , somewhat . Still have a video card problem . Think this Linux 4 Windows is an inductory package for users somewhat curious what Linux is all about . Well fine , if you are able to load Linux it would me nice to have something in the way of at least a few sheets of paper . Showing you how to work the darn software . I still want to experience Lunix , so will have to plan on spending more for a ' seperate ' PC box . After a incomplete install , had to retore Windows , and after many hours , happened to notice my hard drive were no longer DOS . What a mess !
 use a real linux distribution , in your main pc , whit ext2 partition , and whit all your documents secure , and use your old computer to play with windows . do n't play with linux
 I am a home school mom and purchased this for my daughters . Under the `` features and benefits '' description -LRB- from the back of the CD-rom -RRB- it states `` Multi-sensory instruction approach . Various levels of difficulty motivates , stimulates and challenges your students . Both programs include an assessment function with pre - and post - use tests to help track student 's mastery and a custom presentation feature to allow teachers to segment and personalize programs . '' I expected an interactive educational program whereby my girls could click away at maps and satellite images , etc. , and learn as they went from screen to screen . What I actually got are two play-on-the-computer videos , one called Themes of Geography , and the other called Soil & Vegetation . After these are viewed , there are quizzes . That is it , no interactive screens , no tabs to go from subject to subject , just two video-type movies about 30 minutes long each . After our entire family looked for additional access to more information , and finding none , I concluded that the CD is just one of those rip-offs that come around from time to time . This is not worth even a dollar . Do n't buy it !
 I thought this looked familiar ... then I realized that this is the Micro Cookbook software that IMSI discontinued about 5 years ago . I do n't like it any better now than I did then . I highly recommend Cook ` n. DVO is committed to the cooking software category and their Cook 'n software is the best product on the market .
 I recently purcahsed this item and it is -LSB- not worth much -RSB- . It looks old , like the windows programs of the early 90 's . It has a limited amount of recipes and the overall use of its other futures are very basic . Try one of the other recipe software items . It has got to be better than this .
 Just for your information , I purchased the software package `` Complete Gourmet Cooking Suite '' and to my surprise , it `` DOES NOT '' run under Windows 2000 . Period . I contacted the technical support department at Activisionvalue.com -LRB- the makers of the software -RRB- and was informed of this . Just a warning . I have not attempted the software on any other platform .
 I wish I had seen the previous reviews before I bought this product . If I had I never would have made the purchase . I am using Windows Me and can access the cookbook section of the program but the diet and fitness CD does not install properly.I have not tried the labels CD since I have other software that can create labels if I need them . I DO NOT recommend this software .
 The software is not up to par with many other computer based cook books , lacking both content and usefullness . The fitness portion of the program is about as usefull as a small pamphlet on health , but not as easy to use . To sum up this part of the software `` before you do anything check with your doctor '' -LRB- and while you 're there pick up a health and fitness pamphlet , you will not need to buy the software then -RRB- . The lable maker portion works , and one may find a use for this , but again for what you pay for the software you could buy a lot of stickers at the dime store . To put it in a nutshell , walking is good for your health , and you should keep walking when you see this program -LRB- at least pick up your pace while passing it on the shelf -RRB- .
 This program sounds very good on the cover . When you open it , there are several programs , which make you feel as if you get alot for your money . However , there are serious flaws in the exercise/diet program . There is difficulty saving material . It often will shut down just as you are planning your menus . It may be a deal at 10 dollars , but not the 20 dollars originally asked .
 I was thinging of buying this software until I read these reviews . Do n't think I will .
 I had low expectations when buying this product , and this package failed to meet them . There are at least 3 different setup programs , none consistent , 2 of which are based on an old Windows 3.1 setup program , with 8.3 character expectations . After installing , 2 programs would n't run - `` could n't find file xxxxxxxx.xxx '' , so I do n't actually know how these 2 run . The main 3d program launched , but is about useless . Your time is worth more than this .
 ... I wanted to use the Landscape Design 3D to make a plot of my yard . The first thing I did was try to add a fence , and it did n't work . I could add a fence segment all right , but then the program was stuck in `` add fence '' mode and no combination of mouse clicks or key presses seemed to get me out of it . I had to go into Task Manager and `` end task '' to get out of it.Next , I tried adding a path . That worked OK , but the 3D view of it had some cropping issues such that the path appeared to be shaped like a semicircle instead of an arc.None of the other products were much better , and yes , the install process was flawed for me too.Don ' t buy this .

 I hate this encyclopedia because it doent work for Macintosh computers !!!! If anyone gets a chance please tell them to make it for Macintosh computers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I would like to bring your attention to the fraudulent practice of Clever Island -LRB- very appropriate name for this company - real clever ! -RRB- . I purchased an item online and a pop-up offering me my so called free gift . It was a free 10-day subscription to Clever Island . I closed the window after I found out it was for children 3-8 years old -LRB- my child is 21 -RRB- . I did n't put my credit card number in but my card was charged 69.00 exactly 10 days later . I sent this information to the National Fraud Information Center http://www.fraud.org/
 I bought this product for my 5 year old son thinkingit would be a great way for us to spend time learning and exploring on our computer . Boy was I wrong.First of all it took me 3 tries to get the program to installcorrectly , it would always crash during loading . Once I did get it installed I realized that the product was simply a thinly veiled attempt to get me to sign up for a longer more expensive subscription . Finally after sitting through what was essentially a comercial for the product my son was able to get in and start playing games , or so he thought the navigation was so poorly laid out that my 5 year old son had no idea what to do , and I 'll confess neither did I . After randomly clicking on everything we could I was finally able to get to some of the activities . Unfortunately they proved too boring and repetitive to hold my son 's interest for more than a few seconds . Not only that but I was appalled by some of the values expressed by the characters in the activities everything from a rude , wise cracking , skateboarding mascot to a character whose only purpose was to wipe his running nose on his sleeve at every opportunity . Throw on top of this the fact that the program would periodically crash or prompt me to load external software from another site and I was glad when my son decided he 'd had enough .
 This site was offered to us originally with Time Warner Cable . We subscribed to it for several months for only $ 5.00 per month . My daughter loved it so much that when we moved to another city that did not offer Time Warner , I searched for Clever Island and finally found out where to subscribe . We kept the service for over two years paying more than $ 11 per month which was automatically drafted out of our account . It was a very neat program and she loved it , but when she outgrew it , we tried to cancel it . I have left numerous messages on the number they list 1-800-4-clever I think . They never returned my calls . I had to call my bank to stop the automatic drafts . They are still trying to draft our account . No returned calls EVER !!! Beware of this company . Too bad the customer service is so bad because their program is really cool .

 THe program you cant beat its wonderful but beware when you run out of labels -LRB- for the disc -RRB- you cant get them anymore but if there is a place someone knows about please let me know all in all its good
 I do n't like it . It is hard to download , and then to open up . I do n't know if I got a bad kit or what but it just does n't do the job well and it is n't user friendly.I 'd be better off sticking with Works.Wish I could get my money back . I bought it at Staples .
 I also had problems getting the mailing list portion to open . I went to the web site and was still unable to fix the problem . I dont think it is xp friendly
 This `` dictionary '' is only a simple translator . Virtually nothing on definitions or conjugations .
 This software does not work on my computer - I feel as though I have been ripped off . This software does not work on my computer - I feel as though I have been ripped off .
 I gave it two stars because it did not work right . As I found out this program is not compatable with some operating sytems . It still does n't work right with my windows 7 ultimate . If I was going to try this product , I would get the pro plus one . The one I got is more for kids.But keep your sales receipt . Because it may not work correctly .
 The photos are not representative of the product . This product is very out of date and will not work on any windows opeating systems that are 64 bit . Do not buy this product !
 The sellers description of the game leads you believe that it will work on the newer computers . The words used were `` works or windows 2000/me/xp 32 bit or higher '' . If you have windows 7 with a 64 bit , it does not work . False advertisement .
 DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE !!! Since this software is not supported by Quickbooks , you can not register it . If you can not register it , you can only access the software 15 times . It is not usable beyond that ! This item should n't even be for sale . Call QuickBooks for yourself
 I have been unable to add photos to my webpage , or find any customer support person who will answer my e-mail . Documentation is virtually nonexistent , and the supposed `` help tickets '' support do not work . The templates our OK , but hokey and limit your choices severly . If you have your own page design in mind , stay away . One month later , the page still does not work.Of course , BUYER BEWARE because the domain name you choose is really not reserved for you , but goes to the company MOHAHA who produces the software . Thus , you do not own your own domain name as they lead you to believe -LRB- you wo n't find this out until AFTER reserving your domain name , and even then only by checking register.com -RRB- . They claim that it nontransferable , so unless you continue to use the same service , the domain name will be lost to you and go to someone else.Seems like a good deal , but I strongly suggest looking elsewhere , even for a few bucks more .
 This software was free with my umax 5600 scanner but really this is totally scrap software the first review is ture do n't waste your money . instead of using ulead express i am using vistascan for my scanner . not use this software
 You put it in and after installing it goes to the `` Browse '' mode which has a screen and all your computers files on it -LRB- How confusing is that ?!! -RRB- I tried to open some photo files but it would n't let me . I finally closed it and opened my HP file and cut and pasted my photos into their program . Then , I switched to project mode . What a joke of a selection for graphics !! They were very animated and the choice was limited to specific themes - no template could be used for my photos !! I still never figured out how to insert my photos that I had pasted in the `` browse '' mode into their templates - probably because I lost interested because their graphics stunk !! What a waste of money . They have a link to update and check out new downloads and it dated itself with a calendar download for a 2000 calander - yikes !!
 I could not get the software to work on my computers since they all had Flash Player 10 . I tried to install Flash Player 7 as the software suggested , but my computers would not allow this . You would have to have an older operating system -LRB- older than XP -RRB- for this to work , I believe .
 Not well thought out and many features that are on the PC version are NOT on the MAC version . . I 'd rate it a - C.
 Maybe it is a good application on a windows based computer but it is very hard to learn and there are no tutorials available . It is vitually useless to me .
 I tried to do basic drawings and quickly became bored with the steep learning curve and kludgy interface . Features galore , but like one of those dog turds that gets the white fuzz on it - pretty on the outside but still stinks on the inside.Best testimonial
 I own a small city house with four floors plus basement and purchased this software to plan the renovation . Was very disappointed when I fould out the limit of three floors . This limitation is not mentioned on the website or any description of the software.Later remark
 I 'm usually a quickstudy when it comes to learning software and yes , I do read manuals . This program takes too much out of me and the book is no help . I made some progress but found the preview or `` liveview '' was terrible . Laying floor or ground cover was also more trouble than it was worth . There are no tutorials and I also ended up with graph paper and pencil . Save your money . But at least someone is addressing the Mac crowd .
 I used 3D Home Architect for years on a PC , going back several years . I finally found this program for the Mac , and was hopeful , but the program is useless . The interface is not intuitive , and nothing seems to work the way it should . Even simple features like copy and paste seem to fail . What a disappointment !
 this product has tons of features but it was not nearly as easy to use as I had hoped . The interface was confusing , the interaction methods are completely foreign to the Mac . I 've been using Macs since '85 and I 've used hundreds of different programs . Most have a somewhat familiar feel to them , even if you DO have to read the book to use advanced features . This one was so weird I could n't even draw a line without reading the manual first .
 Tough learning curve . Still practicing . I am pretty good with computers , but you almost have to be a computer architech to use this software efficiently .
 Also bought this for Mac , DONT even try if you have Snow Leopard . It crashes about every 10 minutes , graphics wont render . I wish I could get back my entire day ...
 Pretty much a worthless piece of software . Kitchen design does not work , and trying to rotate anything takes way too many steps . Save your money and buy something else .
 If you are looking for a program to do a 3d view of your dream home without any substance , this program is for you . If , on the other hand , you are looking for a program to help you design real projects for a do-it-yourselfer you are going to be sorely out of luck.Punch Home design Studio is just a toy with little substance . You can put up a wall and throw down a sink but you cant run piping to that sink or electric to the bathroom lights . Its like a great big content editing program for a 3d video game with as much use as that . A toy to be experimented with but not appropriate for much more . When I querried about how to put in piping for my radiant floor I was told that you dont do that because the plumber does that . Now what if I am going to be the plumber , Im supposed to just shoot from the hip ? Ditto for the rest of the details.When it comes to the landscape editor , the joke gets worse . Of 32 plants I had planned to put in my renovated garden , PHDSP had 2 . Yest , only two plants of 32 were found in the library and the interface to that library stinks.While we are on the subject of the interface , the Mac interface is very bad . Clearly this is a bad hack port of a windows program . The user interface is not like a mac program but more like Office for Mac -- clearly a low quality hack . If that wasnt enough , when running it on leopard , it tends to crash and erase everything you did since the last save , so if you do intend to play with this thing , save often.So why am I making this post ? Well because I tried to return the software and was unable to return it even just the next day . I was told that the $ 149 I plopped down for a lemon with overinflated advertising was lost . Maybe I can eek out some cash on eBay for it . Yes I am upset.In summary , I was looking for a program that was useful for helping me design my home do-it-yourself projects from installign radiant heating to planning my sprinkler system and what I got was a poorly implemented toy to assemble pre-fabricated 3d objects into a pretty picture . Advertising scores a 10 of 10 for promising much but the program will only be minimally useful .
 Being the only home design software for the Mac I could find at an affordable -LRB- but not inexpensive -RRB- price , I bought a copy of Punch ! Home Design Studio to use in designing a remodel of our kitchen . I had used another vendor 's software to do a bath redesign a few years ago , so this ought to be a quick learning curve . Wrong . This is the only time I have regretted gettng the Mac.Punch ! Home Design Studio is not in the least intuitive , and seems to have a mind of its own , which it can not make up . So if you like surprises , you 'll love Punch ! Home Design Studio.The process seems to want to start with the foundation . A good idea for your building contractor , but not for the designer.The package does include a paper manual , which should make an old guy like me happy , but it is pretty pathetic . And of course the help screens just parrot the stuff in the manual.So , to plan my remodel I had to get out the old t-square and pencil , and wish I had started there in the first place . Anybody need to design their foundation ?
 I bought this because I 'm trying to go `` all Mac '' , and I had enjoyed it 's PC-based predecessor . But this version , for the Mac ... I get errors when I try to print a model to assemble . There 's no framing editor , and no lumber estimator ! Worst of all , when my architect friend asked me to export into DXF or DWG format - these are industry-standard formats - that is when I found out 1 -RRB- Punch ! does not export to either , and 2 -RRB- no other commercial app reads `` Punch '' format . So frustrating !
 This is absolutely the worst home design program I have ever used . In the past I 've used 3D Home Architect and Better Homes and Gardens , but I recently bought a Mac so I could no longer use my old programs . I bought this one because the Punch website had tons of beautifully rendered graphics and they supposedly won several awards . Here 's the truth-the graphics are the worst I 've seen on a home design program since the early 90 's . Far from being realistic , they remind me of that old Dire Straits video `` Money for Nothing '' . The objects lack basic details like door knobs and trim with beveled edges . Also , there are very few objects to choose from , for instance there 's only one shower and it 's a corner shower . So if you would like anything other than a corner shower in your bathroom , that 's just too bad . They also only have one style of kitchen sink-a double bowl . So again , if you would like a single or a triple sink , I guess you 'll just have to use your imagination . The program is also supposed to draw curved walls . Well , that 's a lie . The truth is it draws a `` curve '' by using a group of straight and diagonal walls . So if you want to draw a circle , it will come out an octagon . The other major problem I have with this program is how hard it is to use . All of the other home design programs I 've had in the past were so easy , I could immediately start using them without having to study the manual . But this one is so complicated , I had to read half the manual just to figure out how to zoom in and out of the screen . I 've now read the entire manual with the hope that once I 've learned everything , I 'll be able to enjoy it . But every time I use it , I just want to cry because it 's such a terrible program . Bottom line , do n't let Punch 's fancy ads and awards fool you . This program just sucks !
 As the other reviews have pointed out , this Mac version has turned out to be a big disappointment . After spending the money and a fair amount of time trying to figure out the unintuitive software , I learned there were virtually no construction-related tools -LRB- framing designer , etc etc -RRB- . I 'd consider this more a sophisticated toy than a serious house-design software . It 's too bad Punch is not more honest and up-front about the limitations of this software .
 I 've used Punch ! Super Home Suite for years -LRB- on a PC -RRB- so I figured the learning curve would n't be such a big deal for Home Design Studio . I was so wrong . Apparently by `` intuitive interface '' they mean you have to be a psychic intuitive in order to figure out how things work . There were some improvements made from earlier editions and definitely more features - still limited to only 3 floors though - and some things that should have been simple - intuitive even , were unnecessarily complex multi-step procedures -LRB- like the second floor automatically sitting on top of the first floor . -RRB- The short and simple of it
 Stay away from this software . It may be a great product in the PC world but for Mac it is terrible . Little in the way of support , lacks most tools found in PC version . Common things like wrought iron fences or a tapered round or square columns are n't to be found . I do n't know what else is out there but this is NOT a good choice for sure.This software needs a major upgrade right now and they should give anyone who spent good money on this version a free upgrade.Oh yeah , the support person they have monitoring the forum for this Mac Only version does n't even use a Mac !
 Thats what I have to say.I am an ASP Programmer and have been building websites for over 2 years now.I got this package so it could help me provide readymade solutions in shoppingcart , shipment calculations , tax etc. . This package has a very high learning curve.Inspite of being in ASP I had a lot of difficulty finding my way through this package for solutions I was looking for.The documentation which comes with this package is very sketchy . Being a programmer and on top of that spending money for a ready made solutions program but still finding it very difficult to move thro ... you get a picture I guess of what I mean . I bought the SQL Server option with the pack and then I found that the SQL Option is purely meant as an interface format for the application.No SQL Database comes with the package . I just could not find out thro their documentation how to import the sql database developed by me into the application - kept getting errors . I emailed them and as of today -LRB- three weeks -RRB- I have yet to receive a reply . The support for this pack is sketchy , vague and not informative enough to help you to a solution.There is a newsgroup where other customers submit their problems , but there are few solutions offered and the range of problems indicates to me that people dont get their solutions on time or never.Surprisingly I find the negative reviews for this product being taken off periodically , which creates doubts in my mind about the clean image of amazon.com .
 This is a classic example of a company living in the 19th century -LRB- read no concern for customers -RRB- but somehow managing to sell a software product . Firstly somebody ought to teach this company how to give straight answers and secondly they ought to decide who is this product is targeted for
 I spent over a month trying to get this program to work with my software . When I would try to preview the cart , nothing would show up . I had entered nearly my entire inventory . When I called tech support , they said there was a problem with how I set it up and to delete everything I had entered . I started over and entered only a couple of items and it still would not work . I tried to get help from tech support , but it was useless . They did not know how to help and their response time was awful . They refused to give me a refund on the program . I had purchased it through Amazon.com and luckily , they refunded my money . If I were thinking of buying a shopping cart program , I would stay away from this one .
 If you believe that real users posted all of the great fake reviews then maybe you should invest in StoreFront . I once clicked on the `` 5452554543532 -LRB- see more about me -RRB- '' link and it went back to a guy named Bob LaGarde who happens to be the owner of the company . What a jackass ! Who does that ? Goes in and puts postings of how great his company and his products are and then does n't cover up his tracks . I think Amazon needs to remove this company 's product from their website for unethical use of the rating system . It is people like this Bob LaGarde that give the industry a bad name . By the way , I checked out their demo and if you want the real story , the people who posted how horrible the software and support is are pretty accurate .
 First off , I did not buy this product myself -LRB- thank goodness -RRB- . I was asked by an associate to help set up this new `` e-commerce software '' , because I 'm somewhat computer savvy . Everything I could say about this product has already been said by others . Those that say it 's great ... I just do n't believe you -LRB- do you own shares in this company ? -RRB- . If you do buy it , have lots of patients with both the software and the tech support ... you 'll need it . We eventually took it back , exchanging it for something that only cost about $ 50.00 . It worked like a dream , there was just no comparison . Expensive is not always best and that 's certainly true in this case .
 The company is a huge scam operation . Here 's how they did it to me
 This product does not work with Iphoto 08 . No photos show up to pull into the scrapbook . HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - NO PHONE #s to contact - they allow NO RETURNS even when you pay $ 70 and the product will not work on a brand new computer !!!!
 As far as I can figure out , this product which advertises itself for the Mac , does not allow interface with the Mac 's IPhoto which is where the digital photos are stored on a Mac . So what good is Scrapbooking software without pictures ?
 The interactive format is an excellent tool for learning . I take the blame for assuming that all the questions would be for adult critical care - they are not . I also expected that correct and incorrect answers would have the related rationale - they do not . It does not have a means to focus on a particular area of critical care that you may need to work on such as cardiac , infectious disease , or renal.A suggestion would be for the program to assess your basic knowledge of critical care nursing before you begin your review to point out areas of growth needed by the critical care nurse . Once the reviewer has mastered the review questions - a post test to give the CCRN candidate confidence.Additionally , I think that basic foundation nursing questions should be left out . The publisher can make another CD for those wishing to study for NCLEX.Instructions or a boot up menu should be on the disk too . Both Mac and Windows programs are on the disk - a plus.Lastly , a more through accuracy check needs to be done . For example
 Installation is near impossible , with no support . I ca n't understand why Convekta can not have installations as simple and straitforward as Chessbase products -LRB- or , for that matter , any other computer software geared to consumers rather than to computer professionals -RRB- .
 I was excited when I purchased this item based on reviews at displayed on the chess assistant site . -LRB- Convekta.com -RRB- . However , the following problems were blatant and apparent . In the 10 hours of testing this product this is what I found .1 -RRB- There were 2 menu choices for `` infinite analysis '' .2 -RRB- In another area of the program it was referred to as `` Infinitive '' `` Analysis '' .3 -RRB- The explanations in some of the manual were poor reflecting probably a poor translation from another language -LRB- Russian ? -RRB- 4 -RRB- The program was slow , and hung during many different operations requiring me to reboot my windows xp machine -LRB- with centrino 2.0 processor -RRB- .5 -RRB- Could not save programs with background analysis inserted . - Program hung .6 -RRB- Simple processes such as copying a database took a long time .7 -RRB- Conversion to PGN format resulted in a database that could not be read .8 -RRB- Automatic update of commented files was -LRB- NOT automatic -RRB- . Although the message gave the appearance of a completed update , the files were no where to be found . The update worked only by selecting individual files and then 1 -RRB- unzipping and the 2 -RRB- adding them to the database which was a tedious task .9 -RRB- The program has limited designs for chessboard and pieces .10 -RRB- help files were not helpful at all .11 -RRB- after quitting background analysis and while trying to run the engine on another game I got a message that would not go away to the effect that the engine was busy .12 -RRB- Program took 2 hours to install . Poor explanations during install as well.The only thing this did properly was connect to ICC , but still many of ICC 's look and feel could not be replicated . Again this review has been written only after 10 hours or so of testing .
 If you are looking for SQL 2005 training these CD 's are not worth it . I give you the following problems : - Many of the concepts are covered by him reading from books-on-line word by word with no additional explanation.-In the permissions tape he actually had an error , tried to figure it out , then moved on without an explanation or fixing the problem.-The instructor speaks very , very slow and there is no way to accelerate the recording . Sometimes there is at least a minute of nothing happening . Drives me crazy.-He shows you things , but gives no explanation of what they are or how to use it . He simply points it out , for instance , a scrollable list , he scrolls through the list so that you can read what 's on the list and then moves on to the next topic.I could go on and on and on , but I think you get the idea . The author may be very knowledgeable in SQL , but he is not a trainer . Do n't waste your money .
 Without a doubt this must the worst software product I ever purchased . Not only does Symantec start charging you for updates to their Virus data base , which containt exactly zero viruses for OS X -LRB- since there are none -RRB- , OS X already comes with a firewall free of charge , so you need neither . Being new to OS X , I though extra security could n't hurt , but I was wrong
 Those upgrading to OS X 10.4.x from an earlier version , and who have already installed Norton products under the old OS , can remove them by means of a Unix-based utility that finds and erases Norton files , including the invisible ones . They would be well advised to do so , since older Norton products do n't work with 10.4 , and interfere with the functioning of the built-in firewall . There are several such utilities posted on the web . The one distributed from the Kenyon College site works perfectly , and can be found via Google.The built-in firewall can be turned on via the `` Sharing '' menu in the Control Panel.As far as anti-virus protection goes , that 's an entirely theoretical issue as far as Macs are concerned . Anyone who wants to go down that road would do well to explore the various on-line Mac forums before deciding .
 I purchased this back in August '05 at the same time that I bought my new iMac running OS 10.4 Tiger . It 's advertised , and lists system requirements as Mac OS 10.1.5 OR HIGHER . Did n't work since it was installed . Waited and waited for the patch or update to allow it to work with OS 10.4 , low and behold , they recently just posted a buried footnote on their site saying that it IS NOT going to be updated to work with OS 10.4 . Tried to contact their customer service ... still waiting for a response . -LRB- ... -RRB- I was a repeat customer of Symantec products ... this is the last money they 'll rip me off for ! Where is the class action lawsuit ? Sign me up .
 This product , which is being advertised by numerous vendors for use with OSX , no longer works with current versions of OSX -LRB- from 4 up for sure -RRB- . Norton has stated publicly that they are no longer providing upgrades forMac related software such as Firewall and Network Privacy.Their Antivirus V10 works with OS 10.4 , but in view of their stated policy on other Mac products , one may question whether they will continue to upgrade Antivirus in the future.Intego products do work with current versions of OSX .
 I bought this package after upgraded my PowwerbookG4 to Tiger in Sept. 2005 . The Autoprotect and Firewall never worked . The Symantac Co admitted this probelm in their website and never offered a solution for these problems . A piece of junk !!!
 Not until I was installing NIS Mac 3.0 on my new iMac did I receive install errors indicating that only a limited portion of the suite works on an intel-based iMac . The intel iMacs use OS 10.4 . The older powerPC Macs use 10.3 . The small print on the box indicated it was for OS 10.3 but the Amazon specs only indicated compatibility with OS 10 Macs . No updates/patches fixes are out on the Symantec website -LRB- as of 10/15 -RRB- for use of this product with OS 10.4 , yet intel iMacs have been shipping for 9-10 months now . Symantec is off on this one . I have mailed-off for the 60-day money back guarantee from Symantec as a dissatified customer .
 Poor design of user interface . Had a real problem establishing a beginning point with family tree . Information was inexplicably shuffled or lost , making parents children and children parents . Required a great deal of back-tracking to fill in information . Required data re-entry over and over again of duplicate information because does not sense a connection between family members . No obvious way to save a version you are working on . Needs some kind of overview mode on constantly to show what you are doing . Format is very clunkly and sectionalized . Difficult to tell what you have accomplished . Have n't tried uploading to -LSB- ... -RSB- websites but it seems this software was designed for use on the website and is not really a good stand-alone . Lack of intuitive , user-friendly interface .
 Do n't get me wrong -- this is n't a BAD product , but it really is n't very useful , either . I find the dancers are fairly amusing for a while and the analog recorder makes a really easy way to record old tapes , but that 's about it . Also , the recorder ONLY records in proprietary Micro $ oft . wma format instead of offering a useful-for-editing format like . wav . Because of this , the only time I ever use it is when I am feeling lazy and I have it set my recording level for me.I would only recommend this product if :1 . Like me , you can get it `` Free after rebates '' -LRB- do n't forget about taxes and shipping -RRB- . Do n't even think about paying more than $ 5 -LRB- after taxes , etc -RRB- for it .2 . You already know you like a certain feature -LRB- like the dancers -RRB- -- do n't get this hoping for something great because you will probably be disappointed3 . You have a lot of extra space on your hard drive and4 . You have a fast internet connection -LRB- Downloading dancers requires up to 20MB or more PER DANCER ! -RRB-
 Just bought it not worth the hassleIts not very functional without tonnes of MS downloads so dont buy it if you have a 56kb modem like me . I dont want to have to download a tonne of updates , I want functional out of the box.Product Activation should not be on products this cheap , its a waste of my time . I have no problem with activation on Windows and Office because theyre high value products and at least you get to try them out before activating ... This though is a hassle.The digital music converion program only converts to WMA , I expect at least one alternative format such as WAV or MP3 . Bad software in a pretty box .
 Microsoft is getting worse at what it includes in its Plus ! add-on packs . In its Digital Media Edition , it includes such useless stuff as the Dancers , where people dance at the bottom of the screen , and an alarm clock . Like anyone is going to leave their PC on overnight to wake them up in the morning . Why does n't Microsoft include items that the average home user can use , such as DVD software to watch DVDs , or an anti virus -LRB- like they included in Plus ! 98 -RRB- . Another thing to note about this program is that you have to activate it , like you have to do Windows XP which is very , very annoying . If you 're looking to save money , leave this worthless thing sitting on the store shelf . If you 're looking to waste money , well by all means buy this . If your a person who does a lot of sound and music editing , get a more professional piece of software such as Roxio 's Easy CD Creator .
 So . . I buy the the ... program but the activation code does n't work . . I call microsoft who says they ca n't help me they say they have had both piracy problems and wrong activation code problems . . Microsoft says return it to Amazon . Amazon says it is unreturnable because its been opened . Catch 22 ...
 I bought this because it is advertised as the solution to ripping vinyl into digital media . Yes , it rips it , then it gives you a nice UI to MANUALLY TYPE IN the artist , album , AND SONG TITLES . Their media player used to apply this info to a list of 1 . . N tracks . It seems this s/w does not go to their db and gather the info for you . It is a real half hearted attempt . Maybe I expect too much from the largest s/w company in the world .
 As usual , Microsoft comes up with a product that promises more than it delivers.I expected to turn my cassette tape collection into MP3s but could not.Plus ! has an analog recorder all right , but the resulting files are in Microsoft 's proprietary WMA format.Plus ! includes an audio converter . You would think that this converter would enable you to convert your WMA files into MP3 files but it does not.The help file -LRB- a missnomer for any Microsoft help files -RRB- says I can convert to MP3 if I have an MP3 codec installed . If you do n't know what a codec is , get lost!Thank you Bill ! Not only does Microsoft charge 20 bucks for something that should be standard with Windows but it still falls short of what anyone would expect.The recorder splits tracks as it records and lets you splice either ends of tracks . However , Plus ! will not let you splice the end of one track , delete the spliced end , and combine the shortened track with the next track . In essence , you can cut the begining or the end of a track but not take out , say a silence from the middle of a track . How stupid!It is quite frustrating to see Microsoft devote time on mediocre gadgets like these when it has so much catching up to do to make its main applications work properly.Then again , I guess Microsoft is not about making great products , just great money ...
 OK , my major complaint with the last version of Plus ! was that it gave you little to nothing ; mostly demo and watered-down programs . Well , although this version seems to be heading in the right direction , it still offers little in the way of usable add-ons . First , I 'll address Picture Story , since it seems to be the fan favorite . While I love it 's ease of use , the truth of the matter is , you do n't need it . Windows Movie Maker , -LRB- included in XP and ME -RRB- , does the exact same thing and offers greater customization and more special effects options . Best of all , it 's FREE , and offers ME users the opportunity to create `` picture stories '' as well -LRB- Plus ! is now only available for XP -RRB- . Plus ! DME does offer some additional Movie Maker content , however it 's only compatible with version 2 -LRB- another XP exclusive -RRB- . Other than Picture Story , there is really very little of value here . The analog recorder seems like a good idea for cleaning up old LP 's , however I have n't owned a turntable since the late 80 's , so I really ca n't comment on it . The CD label maker is OK ; comparable to the versions supplied with your average burner software . It 's a good solution for those who opt to use Windows XP as their default CD-R/RW burning software . The media player add-ons are OK , mostly new skins and a few security features to keep others from listening to your music , -LRB- although the only use I can immediately think of is maybe keeping the children from listening to anything you might have containing questionable lyrics -RRB- . I do n't plan to convert my MP3 's to WMA , so the converter is useless to me . The dancers and alarm clock lose their novelty after the first 5 minutes . I own a Pocket PC , so the synchronization tools are welcome . It makes converting media files easier and allows you to download media content from the web -LRB- although I have n't yet felt the need to do so -RRB- . All in all , it 's `` ok '' . It 's nowhere near a `` must-have '' item . I would only suggest it if you catch it on sale . P.S. , like all MS products , it also requires activation and is limited to one computer . Just thought that was important enough to add .
 It 's ironic that a software package that costs only $ 20 could still be termed `` a poor value '' . While the intentions behind Plus ! Digital Media Edition were probably to enhance the XP experience , these features should have been included with Windows XP as a patch given the price of XP and the limited features of Plus ! DME.For example , we have Plus Dancer . This program puts a small , pre-recorded dancer on the bottom of your screen who moves with the music selection that you currently have playing . After about 5 minutes my amusement with this feature was gone . Some of the other features are useful if you are into photo or music editing , but there are far better tools out there , and many are free.The only feature that I have ended up using was the Alarm Clock . It is moderately useful as I prefer choosing an MP3 track to wake me up , rather than a buzzer or an annoying early morning DJ.If you are hardcore into photos and music and need something cheap to enhance your projects , this MIGHT be worth picking up . Otherwise , just hit the Net and look for some decent share.ware
 When you purchase this online via Microsoft you are greeted with a 38.6 MB file full of nothing but junk . The only thing you are doing by purchasing this software is helping Microsoft test product activation . Regular plus for Windows XP is worth more then this . All you get is a bunch of demo oriented stuff . I would not buy this .
 I was looking forward to this package because of the `` Party Mode , '' which `` Transforms your PC into a full-featured party jukebox . '' That is the most misleading statement I have ever seen on a Microsoft product . `` Party Mode '' is basically a media player add-on that keeps people from accessing your other files while it 's running.A jukebox program -LRB- such as eJukebox from AudioSoft -RRB- lets people browse by artist , genre , album , etc. - and then add files to a dynamic playlist . That 's not what this program does . If you double-click on a song , it stops the one currently playing and begins the song you clicked on.This program : - Does n't display cover art,-Has a complicated interface,-Doesn ' t give complete song info,-Let users exit by simply clicking the `` x '' , If you 're looking for a jukebox program , this is n't it . If you 're thinking of using this program as a jukebox , save your money and just click `` full screen '' on Windows Media Player .
 Preliminary reviews and the box for this product tell you it only works on Windows XP . But it does n't tell you it can only be used with the latest version of Windows Media Player ; there are other competing products around.For me the real stopper came when I found out that you ca n't even install Plus until you have version 9 of Media Player . Until now , I 've been happy with version 8 , and I am reluctant to update to version 9 since it wo n't allow you to return to version 8 if problems occur.I wanted to try the analog to digital features of Plus , but I 'm afraid this will stay in the box until and unless I decide to risk the upgrade to version 9 of Windows Media Player . Sigh !
 Although many of its stuff are pretty fun to use and creative , but after all , it is not really a `` must '' have item . and though its only 18 bucks , still seems a bit expensive for its actual usage .
 So I bought this thing , based on the reviews and the price , mainly to do a slide show from our last vacation photos.I really like the product -LRB- that the slide show -RRB- BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO SAVE YOUR WORK AS YOU GO . You have 1 shot at it , once you are done and that 's it . Guess what , I spent a day building a slide show with sound and music . Did generate the show a few times , being carefull to not exit at that would ` close ' the project for ever . Decided to add one more slide , generated the slide show and bang , the app crashed ... + / - 6 hours of work down the drain -LRB- sound a lot , but by the time you add voice and music bit on 120 photos time flies by -RRB- . Think twice before byuing this thing ... -LRB- by the way ther rest of the utilities are fairly useless specialy those dancers ... -RRB-
 Lot of Filler . I 've gotten free downloads from Microsoft with more value . Who is going to hook up their PC in the living room for a party ? If you do n't like Moviemaker -LRB- which stinks -RRB- , the extras are useless.Hmmmm . Alarm Clock ?!? Who sleeps by their computer ... -LRB- Okay , some of us do -RRB- . Need I say more ?!?!
 I would never purchase Macaffee Firewall Plus 6.0 ever again . After I installed the product I could not connect to the Inernet using AOL . I called tech supportt -LRB- $ 2.95 / minute -RRB- and could not resolve the problem after a twenty minute phone call . I uninstalled the Macafee Firewall and my AOL went back to working normal . If you are using XP service pack 1 , do not purchase this product . If you do , you will spend endless hours trying to resolve the problems . Look elsewhere for a firewall product .
 My opinion about McAfee 's new Internet Security Suite Version 7.0 has changed little from my last years review of their Internet Security Suite Version 6.0 , although I gave the newer version 2 stars instead of 1 star from last year.Installed the software on my desktop as per the instructions and there still is an issue with the Privacy Service Component of the software . Contacted McAfee thru their web page support service . -LRB- You have to chat with them as before because it is the only free customer service offered , and telephone service is fee based . -RRB- After installing all four components -LRB- Virus Scan , Spamkiller , Privacy Service & Firewall -RRB- I could not establish an internet connection . I discovered on my own thru trial and error and installing and re-installing each component one by one , that the Privacy Service Component was to blame . After going thru a lengthy procedure from McAfee.com to remove the Privacy Service Component -LRB- it 's not as simple as Control Panel/Add or Remove Programs -RRB- and re-configuring my internet connection setting , and re-installing Privacy Service , I finally was able to establish the internet connection . Total time spent reading , researching , installing , re-installing , customer service , chatting , etc. ... was approximately four hours . A little less time than last year but due to a different problem.Some of the problems you will discover is that this software does not like Windows Service Pack 2 or any other additional security software to be installed on your computer . In fact , all other security software -LRB- including McAfee own last year 's version of the product -RRB- must be un-installed before proceeding to install the new year 's version . But , not a word of this is mentioned in the installation/Users Manual.It seems the issue with Windows Firewall being turned on when installing has been resolved.I did finally manage to get this software to function properly , but only after countless hours with customer support and trial & error of my own . And one good thing that resulted was I was already prepared for these issues when I installed this software on my laptop . This installation went flawlessly.Last year I said I was switching to Norton 's version of Internet Security Suite . I should have listened to my own suggestion .
 This is horrible ! It slows my computer down to a crawl . Not recommended , except to perhaps do a stand alone virus scan .
 Says it all . If you have a standard XP pc you will be lucky to get this software installed . Four hours later , we resolved most problems but can not get the Privacy Service to install . McAfee do not own up to this common problem and the Web is short on resolution advice too .
 This has to be by far the worst software I have ever encountered . I purchased this software last week after my Norton -LRB- equally worthless -RRB- software failed to detect a virus and 37 adwares in my computer . I am very mindful of updating my security software and was very upset that Norton failed so miserably . So I gave McAfee my 60 bucks and went on to install . 4 hours later and $ 40 of phone support and still unable to install successfully , apparently , as per McAfees customer support , `` Our software has a lot of issues with defective discs , its quite common '' What !?!? She then directed me to free software I could download from the internet , so I paid 40 bucks for support for you to tell me where to get FREE help ??? Ridiculous . I demanded a refund for the `` support '' call and will be returning this software . GO with eTrust EZ Armor , less expensive , less space on your hard drive and much easier to use . Big brand names mean nothing .
 McAfee has been a good product over the years for anit-virus protection . However , the Spamkiller product does not measure up to their usual high standard . It is full of bugs and and should have been tested more before it was released . My experience with chat support on two different calls about different issues was a complete waste of time .
 I just got Office XP and wanted to learn the software , so I purchased this.This program keeps freezing on the `` Access '' tutorial , with no way to click on the other Office titles -LRB- Excel , PowerPoint , etc. -RRB- . I tried uninstalling and reloading 2x to no avail . Very frustrating.Clearly , this has bugs in the programming . I 'm going to buy one of their competitive publisher 's Office XP training programs -LRB- which will hopefully work ! -RRB- and return this.Also , like the previous reviewer , their `` toll-free '' number asks you to call a regular number - misleading advertising .
 Do n't waste your money on the 3 pack , it is not the deal it appears to be.Madagascar will not install . I have XP , so I bought this XP version . I feel robbed and am tempted never to order anything through Amazon again . I do n't have the time to go through the send it back routine . If I just buy locally , it is easier to return junk . And that is just what this disc is JUNK.The Shrek is good , Shark Tales is too difficult for the same age group though .
 First problem I had was that there was very little info . on instalation and `` how to '' . After instalation , regestration is required , I never got past this spot , message indicated program was regestered in my name , contacted support several times and followed all their tips and and passwords , still got errors when trying to use `` user name and Password '' , never was able to get on line , eventualy following all their instructions I was not even able to go to the site napster.com at all .
 Napster sucks hard compared to what it used to be when it was free ! Thanks MEtallica . This software suck bad and barely works .
 Almost everything in XP is a SERVICE PACK save your money !
 Okay , I tried to run Morrowind on this system which is plugged up around the school , and it would n't work . Because Morrowind is such a high-end game as far as PC requirements I figured as much , until I noticed they said I needed a Pentium 3 and I had a Pentium 4 . Anyway , Morrowind would n't run properly , even though it was advertised to work up to Windows XP . It at least worked , but it was extremely slow and had a problem since it was mouse based . In short , every time I used a menu , it took 15-20 minutes to select something as the mouse jammed and then skipped . The same was true for my DVD , and the DVD itself would jam in the middle of playing , whereas at home on my Windows 98 computer , all games and programs ran smoothly . This is only the first problem .2 -RRB- Bad graphical processingLike I said , the DVDs often do n't even work , or they lag in playback . Also , games do n't even work that well3 -RRB- Poor DOS handlingI tried to install this game called Daggerfall on my dorm computer , and the installation used DOS . The computer was Windows 2000 with XP `` enhancements . '' It blacked out and froze before it started . I tried XP computers , and they were just as bad . Then I tried a Windows 98 , and within 15 minutes , the huge sized installation was mostly done.True , there are a few things good about this :1 - > Faster download -LRB- maybe -RRB- 2 - > Built-in programs -LRB- including one that unzips files -RRB- However , number 2 leads to problem 4.4 -RRB- Limited programsThat unzip program may only do one unzip at a time , whereas winzip can at least try to do more . This program on the other hand , opens a separate window , insuring the futility of this endeavor .3 - > Faster 2-D / small-scale graphic programmingIf you want to play emulated games , sure go ahead , it will have no problems with it , but this too is a problem , as it speeds through stuff much faster than its normal rate was supposed to be . Anything computer rendered however , will likely lag on you.In conclusion , Windows XP is more of a virus than an OS , so one would be wise to avoid it .
 Sorry to gripe , but I have been using XP for a few months on and off now and I am glad I do n't own a PC , it kind of reminds me of `` Fisherprice My First Computer '' - Having struggled with this operating system , with it 's freezes and crashes and bad interface I really realised why I did purchase a Macintosh - Oh thank you Apple for OSX - an operating system that works.Better luck next time Microsoft .
 Where to begin with this tumerous mound of bloated software ? In the beginning -LRB- before all the security problems were found - and continue , sometimes several times a day -RRB- XP home ran well . Now , no doubt , large chunks of code have been patched , re-patched and entirely replaced.The result is this rotting pile of dung that goes sooooo slowly.Unlike other notorious monopolists , Gates trumpets his great innovation . -LRB- ... -RRB- . Each and every product of Microsoft is either a look back -LRB- often to Apple -RRB- or a buy-in . Each and every MS initiative -LRB- remember.NET ? ; remember XBOX ? -RRB- has been a failure . Gates spends billions to produce technological failures.XP is the most glaring example of this . Gates would do well to XPlode XP and start over .
 This program has almost EVERYTHING I hate about Macentosh . If you hate Mac computers , this is almost as bad !
 I have a love/hate with Windows XP right now
 I must say that I stay up with the latest drivers and peripherals and it just about brought my machine to its knees . My printer still does n't work and I have had to invest $ 250 to get my PC back up and running just to handle basic functions for now . As with all Microsoft products , wait a little while before you tackle this OS . You would be best advised to let all of us suckers help Microsoft fix the many BUGS in this software . You would have thought that Microsoft would have learned something about stable software releases and the need to test the most basic and popular drivers . And stability ... my machine crashes more now than it did on ME . Good luck !
 I have used all versions of Windows -LRB- since 3.1 to XP -RRB- and I have tried Windows XP and Office XP -LRB- I have used it for about 10 months -RRB- and all I have to say is that I had to buy more RAM and download more than 45 patches . It 's got lots of security bugs . Every month Microsoft discovers about 15-40 new bugs.Who can trust Microsoft products?I had problems with viruses and other staff as well.When you costumize the look of a specific folder -LRB- e.g.
 I bought this upgrade specifically to use remote desktop -- however it does not work . There are many reports on the web re . Remote desktop black/blank screen no login dialog box.I have used remote desktop on other machines & connections without problem but there is clearly a problem with many connections using the version in WindowsXP sp2 . Microsoft has not acknowledged the problem , produced a KB article or a fix for this yet . My suggestion is to avoid this until at least XP sp3 is issued . Concensus seems to think this is due to a poorly designed/implemented remote desktop protocol -- apparently it does not handle fragmented packets . -LSB- Some have found changing the MTU size from 1500 to 1400 using a third party tool fixes it for them . However this did not work for me . -RSB-
 This product is the absolute worst ... well let me be fair ... I 'm still unable to install the OS ... It 's been 4 days now I 've been trying to install the software and it continues to hang/not respond during certain stages of setup ... now I 'm to the point I ca n't even begin the setup ...
 the product crashed while I installed it.can ' t see the point of paying good money for an upgrade that doesnt work.Microsoft tech support put me on hold for one hour , seems they are overwhelmed with virus calls relating to their software .
 This produce is not worth your time at all . The inability to change the default blue , silver , and olive is quite annoying , and the only possible way is to find someone who has cracked Microsoft 's code.Then drivers are n't compatible with XP and cause errors like crazy . I could n't use my camera or a lot of my gaming things . My internet crashed 2-5 times a day and I 'd lose everything I was doing at the time . It 's almost impossible to FIND things like dial - up networking , keep is simple Microsoft.The biggest tick-off is the activation requirement , you should n't have to purchase multiple copies of an O.S if you had like 2-3 home computers , that 's crazy and then having to deal with people to do it . I frequently format my system -LRB- every 5-6 months -RRB- to keep it fresh and get rid of problems i may have had , and getting a new code every time would have been insane . Not to mention trying to format the system is a pain in the rear , my sister had to downgrade to 98 to format.I could n't connect to the net half the time , and when I did webpages loaded like i was on a 14k instead of 56 ! In short , stick with 98 SE , at least it 's reliable .
 I could say a lot of good things and bad things about Windows . But when you 're selecting system software , you do n't need a technical assessment . You need to know whether it meets needs that you have . Since I 'm reviewing the upgrade version I 'll assume that you 're running Windows 98 , ME , or 2000K . Maybe 95 , though a machine that old probably could n't handle XP.So , should you upgrade ? The short answer is , probably not . Some things about XP are better , some are worse . On balance , XP is just a little more solid than its predecessors . But better enough to justify the cost and hassle of upgrading ? Not by itself.If you just love fancy eye candy , then I guess you have to upgrade . For my part , I find that stuff distracting , and when I get an XP system , the first thing I do is turn it off . Besides , a lot of it does n't work with existing application software . Even some of the software that ships with XP , like some of the optional tool bars , do n't support the new look-and-feel . And do n't think of upgrading if your existing system is n't performing well with its existing version of Windows . XP makes more demands on the hardware , not less . If your system is n't up to your needs , then you need a new system . Which would include a full version of an Operating System . Should that OS be XP , or one of the alternatives -LRB- MacOS , Linux -RRB- ? That 's a subject for a separate review of the full version of XP . I may write that one soon.The one solid reason I can think of for upgrading to XP is this
 Just purchased XP . Tried installing it on a clean running Pentium 4 machine . During install , I experienced lockups and problems that were unexplainable , but after install was finally complete , lockups , lost data , incompatable hardware & software became the norm . Fortunally XP allows you to reinstall Win98 ! - which exactly what I did .
 just statement , It screwd up the sound on my computer , it is incompatable with just about everything and you have to spend days trying to find all the updates so your computer runs like it used to .
 Every time I turn around , something else does n't work with XP . I have replaced almost everything in my computer and around my computer . I 'm going back to 98 ... and that is not pleasant ...
 Kind of like driving a Ford Fairmont . It 'll get you there , but that 's about it , with a very good chance of crapping out on the side of the road . Plus , you get to proclaim that you 've got the taste of a herd animal.Fun !
 WOW , now ok whats happening ? I sugest this to everyone . If you are going to upgrade you computer you might as well buy a whole new one with everything else such as printers scanners ect ... I Got the windows professional and Home edition and they are the WORST ever nothing is compatable the sound does n't work it gives you the slowest network connection wizzard ! All your old programs do n't even work . I mean what is up ! The Hewlett Packard printer does n't work and I installed new drivers but no nothing printed . I would have to say all is new is the design and look . I suggest this to people who are going to be buying a whole new computer , and not networking .
 Our company purchased a new HP laptop that came with XP Home edition . We really wanted Win 98 but it only came with XP Home edition . We now find out that you can only connect to a domain with XP Pro . We are now forced to buy XP Pro . This is a rip-off win95 , win98 and me all had this feature Microsoft took it out of XP Home to force business users to purchase Pro . Microsoft is hurting our business !
 I ca n't give 0 stars , so 1 will have to do . My advise ? Go buy a Macintosh . I did and I 've never looked back .
 There appears to be a problem that is occurring to a lot of people lately , myself included , and relates to error messages related to the irprops.cpl file . The XP Pro `` upgrade '' I purchased does n't appear to be 802.1 b wireless network compliant as stated . The problem is referenced in several NG posts and in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article # 323183 , which does n't even try to offer a solution other than `` contact the manufacturer of your Bluetooth wireless technology device to obtain this update . '' -LRB- Mine does n't have one , of course . -RRB- XP Home Editon worked quite well , I 'm really disappointed that Pro screwed things up.Microsoft email support was friendly , professional , and persistent but unable to resolve my problem.XP also has a lot of auto-reminders stuff that pop up on your desktop just in time to break your concentration and are very consumptive of system resources . If you liked that microsoft assistant guy they built into Office a few years back , you 'll love XP ... it 's a classic case of over-engineering .
 My husband recently purchased this operating system for me because I begged for it . A couple of weeks later we bought a new laptop that had Windows XP Home Edition already on it ... First and foremost it significantly slows down the computer . It also takes all your files and rearranges , renames , and reorganizes them ; without giving you the option of if you even want this done . And EVERYTHING is done through this Wizard thing . Wizard this , wizard that . Why ca n't a simple dialog box pop up so I can make my adjustments ? And do n't even bother looking for the dial-up networking that use to be under Accessories , because it is GONE . It takes the most basic thing , and shifts it elsewhere , so even doing the simplest of operations becomes a chore . And another thing
 The version of the software was an OEM version that was only valid when installed on a new computer direct from the manufacturer . It required a volume licensing agreement which a stand alone user would not have.Apparently this company was trying to pull a fast one . Do n't buy anything from these people .
 Beware what you are getting into ; This is anything BUT smooth sailing ! As a Windows 2000 user my first mistake was buying the XP `` Home '' edition . Afterwards I found out from tech support that Windows 2000 users must instead buy the XP `` Professional '' upgrade . Why MicroSoft does n't explain this on the box itself in BIG letters is perplexing.My next mistake was finally buying the `` Professional '' upgrade . That is when I found out that Roxio 's CD creator is NOT compatible . Quick Time 3.0 is n't compatible either . Novice computer users will go through hell trying to download and install these upgrades . As an intermediate computer user I am still stuck on these installs.Once I got XP installed I found out that my sound card driver was not compatible with XP . My Steinberg `` Nuendo '' audio recording software will not open . Something about a `` Syncrosoft POS error '' . In conclusion I would recommend that one ONLY get XP on a BRAND NEW system . Try to do an XP upgrade and you will be pulling your hair out in frustration over the can of worms you 've opened .
 I innocently downloaded Windows 2000 SP-3 based on XP to the Windows 2000 installation on a multi - booting system.Then spent a week in hell trying to get the Windows 98SE installation back , after the so called improvements trashed both the Windows 2000 and 98SE installations.I can only imagine how much more damage the full upgrade would do.Microsoft 's track record on the number of times you have to re-instal Windows regardless of W3 .1 , W95 , W98 , W98SE , WNT & W2000 is not good.The conveluted way the Upgrade vs the OEM vs the Full Version CDs are not compatible with restoring of fixing an up to date system with out wipeing the drive is already monopolisticly criminal.The restrictions on the XP CDs are a joke.At the price they are asking wait a year and buy a computer with it pre-installed on compatible hardware with working drivers .
 If you have a computer with older peripherals forget it just buy a new computer with xp installed on it , I went back to my old ME Just becuase It was more stable with my 1 year old system . I wasted a bunch of time with this product . . now I have a new modem , video card and cd r/rw ... my computer is better than ever and it only cost me about 300 bucks ... oh and since you manually turn the system on and off . . my hard drive burned out also ... xp was the most frustrating experince ever . .
 After upgrading to XP pro , my display drivers stop working . Have spending `` chatting '' with Miscrosoft Support , but without success . Microsoft blames it on the hardware -LRB- OEM issue -RRB- . But Miscrosoft support were unable to explain how upgrading from XP Home to XP Pro can cause so much pain !!!
 I had Windows XP home and wanted to use the workgroup feature , but I found I needed the Professional version . I followed the steps to perform the upgrade of the Windows version , but I lost all the applications I had previously installed while performing the upgrade . Basically I had to install all my applications again . Then I found I was unable to use the workgroup feature without third-party software . I found a wireless laptop for less than the price of this software , sold the desktop unit and bought the laptop . I has Windows XP home and I am able to connect via the wi-fi router . I do n't recommed this product for the home user with a wireless network .
 Welcome to the Swiss Cheese of operating systems . I am tired of applying on security patch after another and having to uninstall my firewall and reinstall my firewall with each security patch only to end up with the same slow clunky system . In two or three years Micro $ oft might have a completely new operating system that totally obsoletes this one ... then again maybe not . *** IS THIS WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ? 2 - 3 YEARS OF MORE PATCHES ? *** I 'm going to buy an Apple and end this insanity .
 First let me say that I did n't rate this product 2 stars because of its quality . Read my review of Windows XP Home Edition and you 'll see that I consider Windows XP of being a great product.But this Professional Edition was a real bad idea . Who is supposed to buy it ? The current Windows 98/ME users ? Certainly not . They will settle for the Home Edition because it 's much less expensive and they wo n't need the few additonal features.The current Windows 2000 users ? Why should they upgrade again after just one year - they already have an almost perfect operating system ! The improvements from Win 2K to Win XP Pro do n't justify the high upgrade price . Windows XP has the internal version number 5.1 , Win 2K had 5.0 - anything else to say ? And the new UI -LRB- the only visible new thing -RRB- will annoy most professional users , they 'll switch it back and basically have the same OS as before.The current Windows NT users ? OK , it would be time for them to think about buying new software , but why did they not purchase Windows 2000 ? Because their hardware was too old to support it . So if they decide to buy new PC 's Windows XP Pro would be their way to go , and it will be pre-installed on every new PC in just a few weeks .
 This software is a nightmare , compared to Windows 98 . Hard to learn and configure - I did it eventually , but Dell Computers -LRB- another questionable experience -RRB- puts the software on their computers , so I was stuck . The software did n't like my NOT using MSN or Internet Explorer . I got no technical support from Dell on this issue . I finally got my Internet connection configured by going through my Internet provider , Earthlink . My school refused to buy Windows XP because of its problems , so I do n't have the same software to work at home . Any other version of Windows has to be better than this . Bill Gates got his revenge .
 Unfortunately I have to use this at work . It locks up constantly and security patches come every few days . Software that I need to run that does n't have a specific Windows XP version simply does n't run well under Windows XP . It is n't compatible though I understand that Microsoft had to make a break with the past if they were ever going to build a fully capable OS . It just gets old trying to keep my computer secure because they ca n't seem to learn how to prevent buffer overflows and the like and having to constantly save my work because a crash could come at any time.Either stick with the older versions of Microsoft OS 's or switch to Linux where you can get everything - office apps included - ...
 SuSe Linux 7.3 has better firewall , crypto file system , virus mail scanner and PGP encryption for e-mail . Also outperforms win2000 in many performance tests . Now that 's smart ! Bring on the competition !
 Windows XP is the worst Microsoft Product yet . After installation , none of my previous software worked . Laplink , Norton Systemworks , Easy CD Creator , WordPerfect , my printers , my DVD software , nothing works any more . I now have to spend -LRB- dollar amount -RRB- on upgrading all my software as suitable patches are rarely offered . Moreover , as I upgraded from Windows 2000 Professional I can not uninstall Windows XP . I can only reformat my hard drive and lose everything . What a catastrophe , the biggest blunder from the Gates software factory yet .
 I have to ask Microsoft permision before I can use the product I just purchased from them ? - Activation - they call it.Amazon.com has some great OS 's on here . instead of Microsoft buySuSE Linux , or Red Hat Linux -LRB- totaly American -RRB- or do n't buy Linux you can downlod it for freeca n't do that with XP
 As a network administrator for a large firm using UNIX , Windows 2000 Server , and Windows NT , I have been watching the development of XP for some time . I have used the RC candidates at home and in our network environment in order to better understand how this could influence our networking efficiency , security , and stability.Keep in mind these opinions are based on release candidates , and are therefore not necessarily indicative of behaviors in the official product release . That being said , there are some interesting features I would like to note :1 -RRB- . Security
 I was happily using Win2K on my home machine , when I was lured by the glitter of XP . Big mistake . Everything was fine in my Win2K world - performance , compatibility , stability ... but I was lured by the promise of integrated picture , audio and video utilities and the fancy new user interface . < Sigh > . And then I actually installed XP ... my video capture card no longer works , my 700MHz/30GB/256MB RAM machine now feels dog slow , advanced printer functions are gone until a new driver comes out , had 2 crashes during installation , the integrated apps for pictures , audio and video are not as good as the free-ware I can download and so on ... If you really must upgrade from 95/98/Me , I recommend going with Win2K Pro - at least for another year while XP `` matures '' .
 Mistake . I hope others have better luck with this OS than I did . I have spent most of my holiday trying to get my wireless card to work . On hold from MSFT for 5 hours ! Techs would cut me off often.May uninstall back to 98 SE .
 It is piece ... !! I almost ended trashing my system.Stay put with Windows 2000 , though XP has a greater look , W2K is much more reliable . . Pros : - It comes with a great appearance , CD writing capabilities , Firewall etc. . Cons : - It needs time to mature . . My BIOS is 2 years old , It takes atleast 2 minutes to boot as compared what Microsoft claims as 30sec boot.You need to upgrade Norton Antivirus and other software , scanners , Modem , NIC etc. . . It likes only hardwares that are manufactured in last 6 months or so.Believe me ... It does n't worth the trouble upgrading your Windows 2000 , if you have . . I hope Microsoft would soon come up with -LRB- un -RRB- service pack . .
 DO N'T SAY YOU WERE NOT WARNED
 The upgrade ended up warning me that half of my equipment and three quarters of my software from my Windows 98 would not run on this operating system.Buy a computer with it preinstalled or forget it .
 The preview version of XP can be expected to be slightly more unstable than the real version , but even accounting for that windows XP seems to be no better than win2000 , and just a squeak ahead of 9x . It inherited all of the NT 4 series driver problems , which have been toned down slightly but I still needed to manually install some hardware instead of using its automatic install feature . Not only that , but the increased complexity of the OS will create hundreds of new holes for hackers unless the user is very security wise . On the other hand , it has a nice user interface.And no matter what it tells you , you do n't have to sign up for MS passport .
 Windows XP is a fine piece of software and the first really significant upgrade to the Windows system in a very long time . but beware , an individual license is required for EACH AND EVERY computer that you insall plan to Windows XP on . So if you have a laptop and a desktop , you will need TWO copies . If you want to install on your office computer and your computer at home , you will also need two copies . You can try and obtain just an additional license as I did , but for reasons I still do n't undertand , the license I purchased did n't work with the media I had . Furthermore , Microsoft 's specialists on its product support and actvation lines were not knowledgabe enough about the process to help , so I was ultimately obliged to shell out the extra money for a second boxed copy . And getting a refund for those unusable licenses is not easy . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 I 'm very disappointed with XP . It is a memory hog , far too focussed on digital audio/video support -LRB- yet does n't have built-in DVD decoders -RRB- , not supportive of any driver software more than a few years old -LRB- and the drivers it has itself are VERY basic -RRB- , does not include IIS , therefore can not support Visual Studio or VS.NET in any of its forms . Furthermore it freezes up and crashes on the simplest of tasks -LRB- usually involving Internet Explorer -RRB- . This comes standard in most home PCs and unfortunately the upgrade is n't cheap . I 'll go back to Windows 2000 - it was far more stable and robust .
 Reviews here and elsewhere reported the XP either rarely crashes or never crashes ... I 'm sure I 'm having some type of driver/hardware conflict ... the Win2000 was a much more stable OS and XP ... my XP crashes about once a day , Outlook Express and Explorer crashes about 4 to 5 times a day , and the Internet connection via cable modem freezes every day . With Win2000 , my computer crashed maybe once a months .
 To make a long story short . If this program - in its final form is as bad as the preview I think I will stick to my WIN 2000 . While the ease of installation was a very easy from there on it was down hill for me.The program is presented with a very unfamiliar menu to follow and with grafics that I might expect to find on the Disney Channel or for kiddy play time proagrams.My copy dos n't seem to hold it 's Network settings from each shutdown to startup . All setting have to be reset on each start up . Many companies have not upgraded their code to the XP profile thus necessitation the purchase of new programs or upgrades at an additional cost.At least in the preview program tech help is amost non existant and I understand that MS will only allow limited calls without a significant charge . The cost of the program for use on one computer is high enough but if you have more tan one computer for this program be prepared to pay a hefty license fee . MS has also fixed it so that the program ca n't be run on additional computers without a license . So if you have a desktop and laptop be prepared to pay double for the program . Do n't forget the maintenance from MS tech at around fifty bucks a call or higher .
 First Off I would like to say that windows xp is great if you like crashes and freezups , constant errors , slownessok the only thing thats new basicly about windows xp is it has a new windows skin and has more crashes and lockups that any other os : warning
 I have never had so much trouble installing a program ! First , it told me that it had corrupted files and that it could not be installed . Once I got it to start the installation process , it stops -LRB- hangs -RRB- halfway through with no reason for the crash . When I went to the Microsoft website -LRB- spending at least an hour looking through a database of info that did not help me one bit -- but it did reveal to me that there are a host of other problems that pop up when you install XP which did not settle well with me , such as not being able to reinstall certain programs , vast program incompatibilities , etc. -RRB- , I finally find the article pertaining to my problem and it suggested that I remove all my drivers , sound cards , video cards , etc. in essence , take apart my computer , install Windows , then put the pieces back again ! Now I am adept at program installation , and can troubleshoot problems on my computer quite competently so I could safely say that I do know what I am doing when it comes to what should have been the installation of a simple program . This program made me feel as if I had a brain full of runny oatmeal . My advice to others who are wrestling with the question of `` to upgrade or not to upgrade '' is ... do n't . If you have Windows 98 , leave it , stay happy and sane . In the past couple of years I have had nothing but trouble with the PC . When it is time for me to get another computer , I 'm going back to the good ol' Mac .
 Linux is a better and cheaper operating system . A free download -LRB- such as Mandrake 10 -RRB- includes what would be thousands of dollars worth of software if it was a MS operating system . The GIMP , while not as polished as Photoshop , is also free -LRB- Unlike Photoshop for windows , which is almost $ 1000 -RRB- . In my opinion , I would rather spend $ 0.00 on linux and spend the money I saved upgrading my computer . I would go with Linux if I were you -LRB- even has an office suite that works with MS Office documents -RRB- . You wo n't regret it .
 MS win XP and win 2000 are known to cause hardware and software incompatibilty problems . So do not upgrade . Wait until your hardware and software is obsolete . Upgrading to new MSFT products is always a problem . SOme modems and CD recorders will become unusable at all with WIN XP and WIN 2000
 I am very upset mith Microsoft ! All this OS does is FREEZE up -LRB- 3-4 times a day -RRB- !!! DO NOT BUY THIS UNTIL THEY GET IT DE-BUGGED . I miss Windows 2000 and I miss my -LRB- dollar amount -RRB- ...
 Generally speaking , to get the best performance from any operating system a clean install of a full version is recommended . The best choice is to choose a full version of the product and enjoy the benefits of not being left with artifacts and leftover 's of your previous operating system which can lead to instability in certain cases . I would only buy this on a limited budget .
 What does XP stand for in Windows XP ?????? eXtra Problems !!!! From being hard to install to having to get all the needed upgrades for it once it is installed . Then it seems it likes to crash or close a window on me everytime I get online . If I wanted eXtra Problems I wish I had n't got XP
 Were they smoking some weed when they designed this product . First of all , it 's two separate applications . Second , you have to sync Quick Books to Customer Manager or vice versa and that takes a while . Third , it just does n't make sense . You can easily get frustrated using this worthless product . Why could n't Quickbooks have added this feature to its existing product without have to use it separately . Too many steps in a busy office environment is a waste of time.This is my first time writing a review and I feel so much better now that I know that there were other users who felt the same way .
 Ok , thanks - that felt pretty good ; I hope the idiots at Intuit are listening . This is by far the worst CRM program I 've ever used . I hate it , hate it , hate it . If I went into detail about all the things wrong with it , you and I would both be here for entirely way too long . One example of this program 's suckitude
 All the reviews here are dead on . This is NOT something I 'd recommend at all . Yes , it work on a very basic level without syncing to Quickbooks . But it crashes all the time and it has tons of quirks . Buy something else .
 I ca n't tell you how much time I have wasted . Do n't buy it!Customer Manager is full of software bugs and is a complete waste of time . For example , I was syncing to Outlook and something went wrong causing duplicate records to be added to Customer Manager some with the full data and some partial -LRB- 2042 duplicates ! -RRB- . Customer Manager has no tool to automatically merge and fix these , and now my Outlook and Blackberry do n't have the full information .
 When QB came out with Customer Mangager I was really excited . The features I need finally available . The concept fits perfectly with my business and it is very customizable . But beware . The program is buggy and creeps to a halt eventually requiring a complete removal and new installation to keep it running at any reasonable pace . I was hoping version 2 was better but now into version and 2.5 and I ca n't wait to get all my data into something that does n't hang my system up . Do n't waste your time and money on this program . Shame on you QB for the empty promises .
 This is an absolutely useless product . I was looking forward to pulling up email histories and seeing QuickBooks data right along side , but none of that matters if it does n't work . Forget the fact that I had to open it , it would freeze , I would end the program , and the reopen it to use it -- one day it just stopped accepting new emails . Two hours on the phone with tech support and they told me I had a problem with Outlook . I love Intuit products , but if you ca n't deliver this in quality form with the English-speaking support team I 've come to appreciate , then it 's best pulled off the shelf.MMK -LRB- a 7 year QuickBooks user , ProAdvisor , CPA , and disappointed customer -RRB-
 I am a loyal QuickBooks User . I tried Customer manager 1.0 but it was so buggy I had to drop it . I reluctantly upgraded to version 2 -LRB- I fought for a free upgrade and won -RRB- and it was only marginally better than version 1 . I really could use the functionality it promises , but I came here looking for reviews on version 2.5 since they are offering a $ 39.95 upgrade . I think I will hold off until I see more reviews on the 2.5 version . I really wish they would get the product working as advertised because I would love to have it work well . If it did it would be a big help .
 I hate to be so negative , but I spent several hours trying to make this software perform some very basic functionality , and then waited over an hour on hold -LRB- during normal business hours -RRB- only to be told that the software wo n't do what I need it to.What I needed it to do
 I have used Quicken & Quickbooks products since the early 90 's . I have purchased several add on products during that time.Quicken & Quickbooks started out as great products but have declined greatly in the last few years . They also offer extra cost products on many of their `` upgrades '' which were included in earlier products for free.Customer Manager is a different issue . I started out with version 1 . Description on box seemed to offer a usefull product . However , the program was so limited that it made more work than it eliminated . Like a fool I bought V2 when it came out because the concept seemed good & many improvements were promised . I was wrong . It has more bugs , hardly any real improvements than V1 . The feature for sending e-mails is worse than useless . It takes several steps to put it into history and often does n't work at all . You can see from all the other reviews that there are lots of other issues as well . I have experienced them as well .
 As insulted as we were to buy 5 licenses for version 1.0 , version 2.0 is still as buggy as version 1.0 . Total waste of time , money , and cdrom space !
 This is , on paper , an excellent idea and has lots of potential . Unfortunately , it SLOOOOOWS your system down to a crawl -- which is frustrating to the point where I do n't want to use the product.As I said , its a great idea for me . I have been searching for a product that could help me track my many projects without the overkill of a MS Project.It also has many annoying bugs that need to be addressed.The program has great potential and if it worked as it claims I would give it 5 stars -- but , it ca n't live up to its promises and until Intuit addresses these -- DO N'T BUY IT !! Too bad -- I love Quickbooks and am disappointed in this product , especially since this is version 2.0 .
 The price is good , but I guess you get what you pay for . It works fine for a while then it screws up and you ca n't use it anymore . You click on it and it gives you this garbage and it wo n't open . I had to uninstall and reinstall . Inuit was helpful , but it did n't solve the problem . I do n't understand how a big company can make such crap . We have no problems with quickbooks , but customer manager is just a waste of our time and computer space .
 I am very sorry to say that all the bad reviews are correct . I thought they were being to hard on Quickbooks . I thought that maybe , if you took your time and did n't expect too much , that the software could help you say organized to some extent.My apologies go out to all the reviewers . I was soooo wrong ! I spent hours trying to make this work for me . All I got was messed up customer records in quickbooks & outlook , which took me hours to fix.Even when using the program , there are problems . Example - I emailed an attachment by clicking on `` Email '' in the contact 's file , he could not open it . If I send the same attachment through Outlook directly , no problem . What 's the use in having that email ability if it does n't work.When you transfer names from Quickbooks to this program , the address goes under `` Bill To '' - OK . Now sync to Outlook - hey , there is no `` Bill To '' , so guess what - you get NOTHING ! So now I have 1800 names in my outlook with no info.I could go on , but you get the point . This program would be bad even as a beta version , but this is version 2 !
 Spare a thought for us international users , who ca n't even get the slow , unstable and featureless version 2.0 of the product.I am based in Ireland , and so require the UK version of this product to integrate with Quickbooks . Unlike the US version , this costs 200 euros per person , three times the price of the US version.To add to the insult , only version 1.0 is available in the UK . The difference is , version 1.0 does not synchronise emails . I know a team member sent an email , but I ca n't see it . This product has zero value . It is a shared address book.I contacted Quickbooks support -LRB- April 2005 -RRB- , and was informed that they `` are not shipping version 2.0 in the UK , because they only started shipping versin 1.0 in September . '' This out of date version is clearly selling like a dog , but they will wait until the shelves clear before shipping the 2004 version . With luck , that will be out of date by then too .
 I purchased this software after extensive conferencing with `` Quick Books SALES STAFF , all good and fine , they pick up the phone spend unlimited time with you . Tell you everything is fine answer all your questionsNow when you purchase the product there is the RUB !!!! # 1 the product does not work , in any shape or form . Tey as one might . # CSR is off shore so you are on hold over an hour . Than they tell you that even though you called the # on package , for some reason -LRB- heaven only knows -RRB- they are not the right department -LRB- if they are not the right deptpartment why do they put that # on the box , to call -RRB- , Then they say the right dept is # an other # and they transfer you . Well you guessed it , the `` other dept '' is closed.If they planned to make you miserable they could not have succeeded better.Take your money and not give you a thing for it , These poeple should have some serious competetion or maybe this is the American Way now.Good luck if you BUY anything FRom THEM !!!!

 UPDATE
 I used Turbo Tax for the past two years with no problems so when it was tax time again I bought the new edition . What a mistake ! After spending three hours trying to get the program to understand what the zip code for my employer was with no luck I gave up . Because of this I could not e-file . HELP is no HELP so do n't even bother !! I ran out and bought TAXCUT and was quickly and seamlessly able to e-file with no problems . I recommend it as hassle free . And yes Turbo Tax did insert a spy bot named cdilla into my computer that webroot spysweeper found!Don ' t waste your money on this year 's Turbotax .
 After years with TurboTax , I switched to TaxCut.Primarily because Intuit charges a premium to Mac users , and because of the spyware issue of two years ago . Now , they have corrected the pricing issue , Mac and PC software on the same disc . But they have added the problem of installation issues . And the spyware monkey is on their back again.While the spyware issue seems to be untrue , they are having significant problems with convoluted installation processes . Just as well to stay clear and try TaxCut instead .
 Almost every single piece of software we have nowadays is backwards compatible . A Word document created with Office98 should and will work with Office 2003 . Not so says Intuit . TurboTax can only open a 2003 Turbo Tax file through a process called `` transfer '' , and it wont open up any . tax files beyond that!I bought this product after I realized that I need a copy of my tax forms for the year 2001 . TurboTax 2001 did not have an option save a file in pdf format back then , but I still managed to find a copy of my records in . tax file . Since I have switched to a new computer from 3 years ago , I downloaded TurboTax2004 thinking that it would open up my tax records for 2001 . I was wrong . When I called for support , I was able to talk to a nice Indian lady who at first directed me to a TurboTax site which had a vault feature saving previous tax records . Unfortunately , that website started to keep records only from 2003 , so I still did not have the info which I want . So finally the support lady gave me an 1-800 number to call the IRS . From there I had to submit a form and pay $ 40 to get the info , which would take probably weeks to obtain.Featurewise TurboTax is pretty good . Unlike some cheaper products it has features such as error checking which can be important . However , I should warn that this software does have an annoying tendency to spam additional features as you go through the process .
 We used TurboTax for a couple of years then switched to TaxCut on the advice of friends . We were amazed at how much more money TaxCut saved us ! TaxCut is more knowledgeable when it comes to making the most of ones deductions . We are sorry we did n't switch last year .
 Do n't do it ! Most likely it wo n't install correctly . Many people this year , including me , simply can not run Turbo Tax . I spent hours on tech support TWICE , tried the `` fixes '' on the message boards at their web site , and still nothing . It simply will NOT run.Intuit used to be a good company with good products and good customer service and tech support . But that was 10 years ago . Now ? Lousy everything . I know more about their products than their tech support people . They seem to have been pulled off the street and given one hour of training.I may try Tax Cut but I 'm bummed about the review below that says TT is better than Tax Cut . If that 's true , TC must REALLY be lousy ! But what else can I do ? TT wo n't work on my computer .
 I bought TT and the accompanying state form from Staples . Staples online rebate system worked so well that I was really expecting good things . The program installed alright and no suspicion of coming problems . Unfortunately , now that I have my data in , I can not run the final check on Windows XP Pro . I contacted TT through the customer support and did have response within a couple of hours . However , the rep had me try several things that I had already gone through from the online help and troubleshooting . I tried a couple of things that he suggested ... they did n't work . I wrote back and got a new set of instructions . They did n't work . No matter what I tried , I could not get it to do the final check . Now I wonder if all the forms are correct so that I can file online . I had used Tax Cut several years ago and did n't care for the navigation in it . For that reason , I have used TT for the last 3 years -LRB- even dealing with the registration of 2002 . I 'm ready to dump this piece of junk and go back to Tax Cut or even better , file online thru IRS .
 I guess TurboTax is a * little * bit better than filling out forms by hand . I 've used TaxCut the last few years and found its interface fine , if not spectacular . I decided to try TurboTax this year because I got the Mac and PC version on one disc and I was n't sure which computer I was going to do taxes on yet . While both programs cover a lot of the same ground in the same way , I keep running into extremely frustrating aspects of TurboTax . For example : * Several times , I have been asked to calculate amounts myself . Did n't I buy software so I would n't have to do that ? * A few times I have been given cryptic choices on how I want my obligations computed . In TaxCut , these would always have a recommendation -LRB- `` We recommend not claiming the dog as a dependent '' -RRB- . * To get actual advice with TurboTax , it costs a minimum of $ 29.99 and you must sign up on their webpage . TaxCut provides enough answers to questions with the software that I 've never had to call their -LRB- free -RRB- advice line . * Some things just are n't included with the program . For example , I donated a lot of furniture to charity this last year . I had to compute the resale value for everything myself . There 's a utility for TurboTax which computes values for you . You can order it off the website for $ 20 -LRB- more than TurboTax costs -RRB- . None of these are show stoppers , really . But they are significant slower-downers . I definitely have n't saved any time and money this year because of purchasing TurboTax and in the past four years , I 've felt that I * did * save time and money by using TaxCut . And that 's the bottom line .
 This is a review of the Mac version of TT Basic from a first time user . My beef is with customer service , which in my opinion is part and parcel of the product.I 've had a problem getting the program to include deductions to a SEP IRA -LRB- Form 8880 -RRB- . Talked to a customer service rep who had no experience with the Mac platform , so he was n't any help . He promised a callback that evening , I 'm still waiting . Moreover , I got an email stating that they had tried to contact me but I was n't home -LRB- this after being on the phone with the rep for approx 30 minutes ! -RRB- . Emailed customer support again -LRB- restating the problem -RRB- and specifically asked the issue to be resolved by a person familiar with the Mac platform . Within 24 hours , got an email response with suggestions on how to solve problem . However , none of the suggestions helped . Seems there might be a problem with the program . However , I ca n't definitively rule out lameness on my part at this point . Hence , more calls to customer service in my future.For the most part , I liked the program and would have given it 4 stars . However , this issue with getting the deductions right and questionable customer `` service '' is very annoying.Bottom line
 In response to questions regarding TurboTax & Spyware.Judge for yourself before buying this product by doing a search using `` turbotax '' and `` C-Dilla '' . Look at the results from legitimate sites ... I will not purchase any product from any company who uses or has used hidden spyware of this caliber in their products . PLEASE do the same . Money talks very loud . Again , please take 5 minutes & judge for yourself . I chose 2 stars due to the fact I must select something & this is close to the mean .
 When I purchased Turbo Tax software basic , I had tried Turbo Tax before in the previous of tax years . When I first started out , I could definitely tell the difference from doing the job by hand . I received more money back from my return than I would have done so by hand using my state 's 1040EZ form . The program went well the first couple of years . Suddenly , this previous year , after a purchase from Wal-Mart I began to have problems : * Trying to install the software was a major hassle . The security code that came with the software purchase did not work and after weeks worth of e-mailings I finally got to install the software completely . * After the installation and performing all of the work and calculations , I STILL did not receive the kind of deducted refund expected from the bank -LRB- after paying bank charges and tax fees -RRB- which had taken over half of my refund.Turbo Tax Basic an excellent software ... asta la vista , baby ! I am going to Tax Cut this year !
 After following the customized interview for Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal , and State , I was asked if I wanted to e-file -LRB- which I replied `` yes '' -RRB- . It took all my bank and visa information , successfully sent my returns onto IRS for review -LRB- needed to wait 24-48 hours for acceptance/rejection notification -RRB- , but when it printed out the forms no routing number and account information was on the returns!Then I was rejected and asked to send through the information again . I did n't have to input a thing ... it was all there to begin with , just kept pressing the `` continue '' button . A promise was made that no charges would be incurred , but it also stated that there would be a charge of $ 14.95 for State e-filing . I opted to print and mail the returns.So , out $ 29.98 for e-filings that were rejected . We 'll see if Intuit will be prompt in sending my rebates . They have you jump through many hoops , therefore lots of room for errors.JillPortland , OR
 I 've happily used TTax Basic for four years - but this year the functionality is much narrower than in past years , forcing a Premier upgrade to get some of the stock and Schedule C options .2004 was my last year with TurboTax . Goodbye !
 Fewer features than last year 's version . Do not purchase this product if you sold stock from an employee stock purchase plan ! Company offers to sell you Premier for $ 40 to get this feature .
 I have been using Intuit products , Quicken and TurboTax , since 1992 and have been quite satisfied with the ease of installation , daily use capabilities and the extremely flexible data entry and reporting . This year I am appalled at the quality of their products and have , just now , been checking out the comparable Microsoft product reviews with an eye to switching horses . It does n't sound like Microsoft is any better.I am about ready to go back to paper forms for the taxes and an Excel spreadsheet for my money tracking . I refused to purchase their state tax program , last year and this , and , instead , used the on-line fill-in version on the state tax website . It 's free.I installed the TurboTax Basic 2004 and upgraded on-line and I still see little boxes with bright red X 's instead of the appropriate icons on many pages . I went through the import last year 's data and interview process , using the ` GUESS ' system to interpret where the red X 's were going to take me , then went to the individual forms and corrected information that the interview did n't bother to ask me about . I am assuming that the calculations for the data entered are correct but , you know what
 As of this year Turbo Tax Basic no longer supports employee stock plans , stock options , or simple schedule C functions . In order to get these you must buy the $ 69 Premier version . Worse yet , if you are a long time user of the basic version and do n't bother checking the product comparison , you do n't realize this until you have purchased and installed it . Very disappointing !!!!
 I have used Turbo Tax for the past 3 years , and have loved it . It was easy to install , pretty straightforward to use.So when I sat down to install 2004 , I did n't give it a second thought . However , the product developers probably need to go back to school on this one , and the manufacturer needs to issue a major apology to everyone who has tried to use this.I consider myself way above average on the computer skills side . I could not get the product to load on a Compaq with Windows ME operating system . I kept getting error messages to install a second disk . It only comes with one.I took it to another machine , and tried installing it on a Dell with Windows XP-Professional Edition . Here too , it would not install properly . It indicated that the installation was finished . However , it did n't install several files needed to make it work . It downloaded an update . You have to turn your computer off , then back on to install the update . The update would n't install . In fact the computer stalled . Had to reboot again , and start from scratch.Since I was unable to install the product on either machine , I ca n't tell you how it handles the routines of calculating your income tax . My guess is that it is very error prone . If you used Turbo Tax , I 'd pay an accountant to review your numbers to see that they are correct . Then I 'd send the bills to Turbo Tax.For me , I 'm now checking out other products.Since it wo n't install on either machine
 I had written a review on a previous version of TurboTax when that little program installed C-Dilla without my permission or knowledge . Never again , I told myself . I should have listened to myself!Imagine my surprise when after installing TurboTax I decided to run Webroot SpySweeper . Hmm ... my machine was clean prior to the installation so what could this one little program have done ? ... Plenty ! Right after the install , SpySweeper found 1 file and 26 instances of BonziBuddy splattered all over my system ! Are you kidding me ?? When will this company learn ? Actually , when will I learn to STOP TRUSTING INTUIT !
 WinXP home does n't come with , and wo n't run , PWS or IIS . Hence no pretty little ASP pages.Annoying as it usually comes prepackaged with PCs in a big shiny ` multimedia ' displays.Then you get it home and find it does n't do jack . : - -LRB-
 Do n't do it . If you are running 98,2 k or even ME keep them on your pc . XP has been touted as the ` new wonder from MS ' . Not so . If you know nothing about computers you wo n't even know what you are missing . But for those of you who do know your pc stay away . I would think that in a few years they might actually have it fully debugged , might ... I was in the marked for a new lap top and ended up buying a Mac . There were many factors but the main factor was the operating system . After spending much time working in XP I just could n't stand it any more . I use win2k at work and it 's great , stable , fast , a good extension to 98 , one of the best OS out there . When I heard Mac released a unix based OS , I jumped for joy and bought the Mac . You ca n't beat the stability , ability and control . It 's time for the MS marketing department to lay off of trying to control the entire pc world and let the user have a choice in what the user wants to run on their pc and not what will make MS money .
 I was extremely disappointed with your suggested dealer `` TEKDEAL INC '' . I ordered a Microsoft XP-Retail edition and received XP-OEM . The OEM version does not work and TEKDEAL with not honor a refund policy . I received poor customer service and received a worthless software . VERY DISAPPOINTED !! I do not recommend Amazon referring customers to TEKDEAL because you will get a RAW-DEAL .
 i actually returned this for a refund , i will stick with windows 98 se , much easier to use .
 I purchased a new dell computer to replace my laptop and of course it came with XP already installed on it . I was open minded and gave it a chance , but ulitmately , I reformated my hard drive and put windows Me back on it . Hopefully this review can help you decide if this if for you or not.-IF YOU HAVE NEVER OWNED A COMPUTER AND YOUR FIRST SYSTEM ALREADY HAD WINDOWS XP ON IT , KEEP IT , THIS IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU . -- here is why , this is a great operating system when all the drivers are compatible with it . Of course if your system came with XP on it , all the drivers are pre-installed and thus compatible . -- for those not on the technical side , your computer will be more reliable with XP on it because it does n't crash nearly as often as 98 or ME . -- it is pretty user friendly in that it does n't require that you have to read a huge book to learn how to use it . The tutorial in the begginning is sufficient enough to get you started and the overall use of the system is not complex.-IF YOU HAD A PREVIOUS COMPUTER AND WANT TO UPGRADE TO XP AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF WINDOWS IS BASIC , STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS XP . -- here is why , if you are upgrading your computer , you 'll find that a lot of your stuff that worked fine with 98 or me will not work with windows XP . You 'll have to download those drivers from the internet and if your modem is not working with XP , your -LSB- messed up -RSB- because there is no way you 'll be able to get onto the internet to download your drivers , unless you have a second computer and a way to transfer files from each other . -- overall it can get very complicated and fustrating to get everything to work the way it did when you had 98 or ME so it requires a fair amount of advanced knowledge to get things to work right . So unless you are comfortable with some advanced trouble shooting , stay away.-IF YOU ARE WINDOWS SAVY , HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE , STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS XP . -- here is why , the control you have over XP is very little compared to that of 98 or ME . The whole program is like an airplane that is always on auto pilot that ca n't be turned off . -- I for one was frustrated with that because I like to have total control over my OS and be able to disable programs , etc that I do n't want running or options that I do n't need which take up a lot of memory . With XP there is very little control over that . If you try to go to system configuration and look for the start-up tab to disable programs that load on startup , it 's not there , for some reason XP does not give you the option to disable those programs loading on startup . If you push ctrl-alt-del and disable them from there , once you restart windows , you 'll have to do it again . -- Be prepared to have some of your favorite programs or games to not work correctly with XP , I 'm sure enough has been said about that with other reviews . -- Expect some of the new drivers you do download to not fully work , ie . for example I downloaded an XP driver for my scanner 's make and model from their site , XP recognized my scanner and the diagnostic on it was successful , but a couple of my art applications did not recognize it . -- many things are forced on you . XP will force you to use that dumb little MSN messenger , which starts up everytime you log onto XP . You ca n't easily disable it unless you get into the regedit , but good luck . -- lastly is the activation protection , which you must do within 30 days or you can no longer user it . This is the worst feature about XP because if you are like me who is consistantly upgrading your computer , it will cause a problem . I reformat my hard drive at least twice a year to clean up old junk , with XP everytime you do , you 'll have to re-activate XP by calling microsoft or going online . If your computer came with XP on it , you wont have to activate it , but if you make a change to your computer -LRB- ie . hard drive , peripherals -RRB- , you 'll have to then activate XP . Microsoft put this in there so that people could n't pirate XP by swapping hard drive with a computer system that does n't requrie activation and installing XP from there and then swapping back hard drives . XP wont let you , you 'll have to activate XP once you put your hard drive back in because windows will start recognizing different hardware.Overall I gave it a low score based on my personnal experience . I did n't think it offered that much new . Sure it does n't crash nearly as much , but the minute you try install your peripherals , you may run into problems and then XP will start crashing on you . The last straw for me was XP would not work with my RIO mp3 player . I already sacrificed a scanner and webcam not working but no one can take away my music . When I switched back to ME , life was much better because everything was compatible again and I look back at my XP experience as just a horrible nightmare . XP is not break through , most of it consist of improved media -LRB- ie . media player or movie maker -RRB- but those are just programs and can be downloaded from microsoft . The actual inner guts of XP is nothing revolutionary that requires you to consider upgrading . In a year or so , everything will be XP compatible and you most likely will be forced to upgrade but for now , stay away until all the kinks are worked out and reliable drivers become available.-most XP incompatabilities were with USB peripherals , external hard drives , mp3 players and webcams -- XP seemed to do well with many printers though .
 This is the highly anticipated Windows OS that everyone needed to get . It truly does appear revamped in a lot of places . The desktop is less cluttered , the start menu is more organized , and there are extra things one can do with the folders they create . For example , putting a custom made picture or graphic to the folder icon itself
 I bought a new computer with XP installed , and I 'm not happy . There are a few improvements with XP , but it does lock up and crash randomly -- most disconcerting is how much it slows down your computer . My husband is running ME on a 1.5 GH with 256ram and his computer runs much faster then my XP on a 2.2 GH with 512ram -LRB- we have the same brand & type computer/chipset -RRB- . I 've also found many bugs , when setting up a network , it automatically changes the network card I select to my firewire -- to use the network card , I have to select the firewire ! All the online prompts for novice users that ca n't be turned off , are very irritating to experience users . Especially since you need to be an experienced user in order to figure out all the bugs and how to install all the updates to your old software programs . From my experience and from what others have said Windows 98SE is the most stable and fastest home operating system available.I recommend that people stay away from XP until a service pack is available to fix many of the bugs .

There is no easy way to get `` under the covers '' , it 's harder than a Mac OS to do any device customization . This OS simply has NO way to easily connect to a home network , with the possible exception of a home network running XP exclusively . It is clearly made for the single computer user who not only knows nothing about what 's under the interface but does n't want to know.Microsoft has lost their mission of making the machine easier for the user to access . With this version they 've made the interface a prison wall to keep you out -LRB- maybe in ? -RRB- rather than a dashboard to provide information and access.The `` ET call the mothership for authorization '' is a total loser too . The home user who gets their custom hardware-based code and changes their graphics adapter without calling Mama Microsoft first -LRB- and you must call and endure the required 800 number time on hold - the web site does n't handle `` I need a new code because I 'm about to change my hardware '' -RRB- will find themselves with a vegged out computer , requiring that they have to put the original hardware back in or reinstall from scratch . What happens if the original hardware goes bad and an exact replacement is no longer available ? You DID write that Microsoft 800 number down where you can find it , did n't you?I received this OS already installed on a computer I purchased online . I gave it my best shot for at least four hours , and did another 10 hours of research about it online . I then formatted my fixed disk and installed Windows 2000 . I have worked with , both professionally and as a home user , with Windows286 , Windows 3.0 , Windows 3.1 , Windows NT , Windows 95 , Windows 98 and Windows 2000 . Each has had it 's good and bad points , but each was always an improvement over the previous OS . Not so here . This is a step backwards from 2000 . The distribution CD is really pretty with that `` Windows '' hologram on the face of it . I may make it into a clock .
 I know your pain man , when I had XP on my system I tried using my HP digital camera . It did n't work . I tried it on all other computers ; it even workerd with Win95 ! Not XP though , I contacted HP , they said they support the OS ; it just did n't work . After about 30 minutes on the phone with HP -LRB- their tech support -LSB- STINKS -RSB- ! -RRB- We determined that I have to have the USB cable in the computer when I reboot but the camera could n't be connected to the other end . Then after the reboot I had to leave the camera in the view picture mode as I plugged it in . That was the ONLY way it would work . I bought an internal flach card reader soon after . Anyways I quickly formated my HD -LRB- my gamepad did n't work still , I was hoping it would be fixed in XP since it did n't work in Win2k . So I put back Windows 2000 and am perfectly happy . And my copmputers can see each other on the network again ! Yay!The advise I have to offer is this . If you are running Windows 9.x and have a 700mhz cpu and 256 RAM upgrade to XP -LRB- BUT UPGRADE TO PROFESSIONAL EDITION OR YOU WILL REGRET IT -RRB- . If you are running Windows 2000 you will just lose stability and wo n't gain added support . If you are willing to sacrafice system stability for `` hello kitty fonts '' be my guest but know what you sre doing . If you are running a sub 500mhz machine or do n't have AT LEAST 256 RAM check out Windows 2000 , its very nice and you wo n't get lag when playing solitare .
 I want to state that I do n't unserstand all the hype about XP.Windows 98 , Windows ME and Windows 2000 are commonly used by everyone and even companies ; for Microsoft to come up with a new OS which is not far behind Windows 2000 which came out around 99 ' if I am not mistaken . It would have been better for Microsoft to market XP five years from now.So now the flaws , I purchased a new pc , and was not offer a choice between windows 2000 or XP . SO I 'm stuck with XP anyway.I hooked up my all-in-one printer by HP to my pc ; XP installed the new hardware , I did a test print to make sure that it works , which it did , the very next day when I went to print a documentit started to print and then stopped printing . I made sure that the usb cable was connected and all the other connections , they were fine . I checked the device manager to see if there was a hardware problem , none . So each time I need to use my printer I have to delete the printer , restart the pc , then turn it off plug in the printer cable and turn the pc back on again , just so the priner will work ; OF course HP still has not came up with an updated device driver for this and they say that it could be a problem with the usb cable and to check the device manager.Now here is the thing , on my notebook it has ME and I DO NOT have any problem at all with the all-in-one printer ; ZERO.Plus the software that is already out there is not fully compatable with XP as well as all of the hardware that is already out there prior to XP coming out to the market.So hold off on buying XP , it is better off if you get eitherWindows 98 , ME or 2000 . One more thing the service patches for XP are on hold pending the legal issue between Microsoft and DOJ.I 'm planning on formatting the entire harddrive and installing either ME or 2000 .
 I bought a new HP 780 -- Pentium 4 / 200 GHz , etc. -LRB- a powerful computer -RRB- ; came with Windows XP . Running XP has been a BIG HEADACE ! As others have mentioned -- because Windows XP uses new/different codes , my HP all-in-one printer , fax , copier , scanner DOES N'T WORK with my new HP computer with Windows XP -LRB- apparently , HP is `` working on '' getting some new drivers out -- MAYBE before Christmas -RRB- . My HP stand-a-lone flat bed scanner -- also , DOES N'T WORK ! Windows XP , also , has a combersome interface -- made mostly for basic beginers who only use a computer for the internet . As usual , Microsoft has put in A LOT of spontaneous connections to THEIR products -- its like have a car that only runs on one brand of gas . I get anoid with screens that just `` pop up '' out of nowhere and promote some Microsoft Product . Again , XP is targeting AND CAPTIVATING the otherwise ignorant internet user . I , actually , checked into reloading my new computer with my old Windows ME -- which , I found , to be very good . With Windows XP , I feel I 'm being dragged into the Microsoft web -- where it becomes so sticky , you ca n't get out ! Finally , I 've checked , and they 're coming out with patches and fixes to the many problems with Windows XP -- the updates are `` supposed '' to be out in the second-half of this year -- hopefully , before Christmas -LRB- and , this time , that 's for real -RRB- ! So , WAIT for the fixes before you buy a new computer with the Windows XP operating system ; and , obviously , do n't go buy an Upgrade to XP until the bugs are fixed !
 XP Home Edition is an oxymoron . Based on my experience and most of the reviews I have read , I believe that your home computer is the last place you want to install XP . It appears that only new hardware and high-end applications -LRB- ... -RRB- will run on XP . Since , for home use , most people have older machines and typically run low-end applications and games -LRB- ... -RRB- then most people will be disappointed with XP.I put XP Home on the machine my wife and kids use as a trial . BIG MISTAKE ! Most of the games and apps . that my wife and kids use -LRB- ... -RRB- will not run on XP . I will say that my hardware was new enough that it all works -LRB- printer , CD-RW , graphics card , etc. -RRB- , but I did have to fork over more money for memory to even make the machine usable.My friends at -LRB- ... -RRB- use XP Professional at work and love it , but then again they have new hardware and work almost entirely using MS software.I think I 'll keep -LRB- ... -RRB- on my own machine and put it on the machine my wife and kids use as well . -LRB- ... -RRB- will run kids ' games and a home OS like Windows XP Home Edition will not . I guess all MS 's talented developers have been working on XBox -LRB- still waiting for meaningful reviews on that -RRB- . Save your money .
 Folx , allow me to submit something for your consideration . MS 's new product activation requirement is a baby step . This is the way things are done by organizations that want to affect entire populations . It 's never enough to get angry about , never enough to migrate away to a different OS , just slow , subtle creep.Product activation is to acclimatize you , the user , to the idea of routinely asking MS for permission before you run * your * software that you bought from them . The destination of this step is that MS will stop selling its products and start renting them out . You will pay a monthly fee to use windows , word , excel , whatever . You -LRB- your computer -RRB- will check w / MS -LRB- probably automatically over the internet , in the background -RRB- before any program launches . If you 've paid your dues that month -LRB- probably an automatic debit from your checking account -RRB- , you be able to run your program . MS admires AOLs -LRB- monthly fee -RRB- business model ; this is how they will get there.If you 're content with a future where you pay for software for the rest of your life , use XP.On the other hand , XP is more stable , faster , and prettier than previous versions . It still does n't work , crashes the system , and ca n't recognize many peripherals ; but it does work better.Two more points :1 . Prod . Act . checks your hw config ; if it changes too much , you ca n't run . The automatic fallout is that you can only run XP on one system , regardless of how many you own . It 's like buying a cd and only being allowed to play it on your home stereo , not in your car or discman .2 . Piracy . Risk and reward . The only reason people pirate OS 's and cd 's is b/c they cost more than they are worth ; people have a natural hatred of getting ripped off . If Windows cost the $ 50 -LRB- and a cd the $ 5 -RRB- that it 's worth , no one would try to pirate them , because the reward would not justify the risk .
 UPDATE : After about a year of frustration at Microsoft , and the XP flaming below , I finally , in desperation , did a BIOS update to the Intel Pentium 4 chip that 's sitting on the Intel motherboard . Instant fix.Turns out Intel publishes updates to the BIOS all the time . But be wary
 While Windows Xp is pretty to look at , the problems that came with it has made me regret buying it . First of all is the registration . I can hardly stand getting on my computer anymore due to all the registering , passwords , tweaking , pop up adds , ect . Secondly , out of 10 programs that I tried to load , three failed . Resident Evil 3 locks up , I could not install my scanner software , and a very important language program . All of these worked on 98 , absolutely no problems . If this is your first computer , get Xp , but do not upgrade .
 when i first tried it , i heard rumors about many software not supporting in XP , and they were right . It was fine when i got it , but after putting in some stuff i use , it went right down the drain . Windows XP has a new file system called NTFS -LRB- network file system -RRB- -LRB- it would be new if you used ME or 98 -RRB- , it offers more security and function , and less stability . The good news is there 's no more blue screen of death . The bad news is they replaced it with a plain frozen screen . Even though there is a compatability mode , you ca n't set it farther back than win 95 , so any win 3.1 or Ms-Dos software does n't work . They got rid of the boot-to-Dos option too , and the command prompt in windows has a response rate of about 1 second after you press the key . I use Win 98SE alot , and i think it 's more stable.Win XP home
 I mean it is almost impossoble to run complex programs with how much RAM it uses . In fact I have 192 megs of ram but the thing only has 45 megs free ! And my old PC has 64 megs of ram on windows 98 and it has 60 free megs of ram ! They need to make it need less requiring of RAM !
 Overall , I think that Windows XP Home Edition is just the 2 bestest operator Systems put together in this one . It will not play some of my favorite games , either ! It has a cool new 3D look to it , though , but I think that Windows Millennium Edition might be more compatible , but it 's your choice ! I just do n't recommend it to some older game players .
 Do n't waste your money . I upgraded from ME to XP and ended up having to Format and reinstall ME . I wo n't waste any more time reviewing a product that should n't be on the market .
 Forget it stick up with Windows 2000 , Me or 9xThis Software is Useless and demands lots of Money ...
 I received the wrong product , and can not get it exchanged.Therefore , it is worthless , and a lot of money was spent .
 Personally , I found that this was a trying experience from the beginning . First off , few stores even carry XP software , so that even locating the package is difficult . Thankfully there are on-line opportunities like Amazon to fulfill the dream.Physically installing this product was an even greater difficulty . I could not find this in a 3.5 '' format and had to upgrade my PC in order to be able to run the CD . After re-booting , I found that the CD was not mounted and that the software could not be recognized . I spent numerous hours on the phone with MicroSoft Tech support , only to determine that the system requirements were not fully explained in the promotional literature . This upgrade requires an extremely fast processor , at least 512 Mb memory , minimum 40 Gb hard drive . In fact , the system architecture and operating system are completely different ! Who knew ? I can tell you it is not recommended for the typical Apple II or Mac Plus customer.This is probably much better suited to the owner of a new Power Mac machine with the latest in video & IO features .
 After one day of evaluating XP , I 've discovered it ca n't play DVDs , ca n't run AOL , ca n't install a Windows 2000 compatible USB CF card reader , ca n't install a * Microsoft * mouse , and ca n't remember my settings and preferences . In short , the experience Microsoft has gained producing unstable , worthless garbage all these years has paid off , if their goal was to maximize user rage and disappointment.In 1980 , you could just plug in a joystick into a computer 's joystick port and it worked right away . You did n't need a CD , a license agreement or 30 + minutes of escalating frustration and hard reboots . With Microsoft XP , a new mouse can flick around randomly and click everything clickable immediately , filling the screen and taskbar with multiple copies of `` Desktop settings '' windows . XP 's `` troubleshooting '' can lead you through 15 screens with no troubles shot . A mouse is a pretty basic element of a computer system -- if Microsoft ca n't get this right , how can they hope to make something as complex as an OS work ? Oh yes , I remember ; Millionaires have no incentive to produce competitive , quality merchandise .
 Loaded with security flaws , this operating system is the worst yet . That combined with the fact that when new software is installed , XP deletes drivers which are needed for the OS to operate properly make for a terrible software package . So far I have had to do a complete reinstall on my computer twice because of this . If you can stand it , buy a Linux OS or a Mac ... it does n't appear that Windows is ever going to come out with a decent operating system .
 Do n't waste time with Home . Many productivity app vendors wo n't guarantee compatability with XP Home , and even Microsoft 's own Tablet PC software wo n't remote control an XP Home box -LRB- and boy are they pushing that for ... the home of all places ! -RRB-
 This upgrade is the most dispointing thing i have ever done.First this upgrade messed up my sound , after that i thought i was in the clear little did i know my problems just began . I have bought two games that will not work with XP and the compatibility wizard does nothing , I suggest not buying this upgrade and sticking with your current OS
 Almost everything in XP is a SERVICE PACK save your money !
 How do you feel if after paying for a home remoding project then the contractor asks you for more money if you want to use the bathroom or operate the garage door opener . After upgrading from Windows ME to XP , my HP CD burner is no longer working -LRB- you have to `` buy '' the upgrade software - CD Creator 5 -RRB- , Norton system works 2001 and Norton anti virus 2001 also require an update , DLink video cam has to be reinstalled , etc. ... `` XP '' means `` Xtra Payment '' if you want true MS eXPerience . If you want to upgrade , go with Windows 2000 , or better yet , buy a new GeForce video card .
 lies lies xp is not stable and it crashes at the same rate as win - me its obvious that microsoft dident try hard . The meaning of a new release is supposed to be better and go forward , with xp it just went backwards , by far 2000 pro was better . It seems that xp just sacraficed stability , power , and function for a nicer image . I mean it 's nice to have a fresh look and good media player but the power that allows you to do anything is ... uhh . Xp install is a pain in the but , With problems I dont have room in this form to mention.Over all i 'd say just go with win 2000 pro , but if you just want to leave microsoft 's bs and want 100x more power 0 viruses 0 total system crashes and more functional software go linux a FUNCTIONAL open source os .
 I do n't understand why Windows would make such a terrible product . It served me pretty well for a year , relatively error free . I did encounter one problem where it would take about 4 minutes to load one of my games which would load instantly at my dad 's house on Windows 98 , and my computer is better than his in all regards . Therefore my game should load even more instantaneously . But it does not . I also encountered the problem where my computer would not turn off 25 % of the time when I told it to . I would have to turn off the power on my power strip to turn it off , highly damaging to the computer . It also does not turn off when there is an internet connection active . That was just the beginning , however . Now , it freezes 50 % of the time whenever I run WinAmp , and about half the time freezes before shutting all the way down . It has also frozen me when on the internet . And now , a new game I have installed succesfully , will not even get past the loading phase of the game . My computer should be able to handle this game with ease , again my dad 's does . In summary , Windows ME is a more recent , inferior version of Windows 98 . DO NOT BUY THIS OPERATING SYSTEM !! I look forward to buying Windows XP , and if that does n't work , down to 98 .
 If you want an os with an X get a mac and stop whinging . OS X. 1 rules . I do own a PC with win2K and it runs great so dont call me bias . Pi is exactly 3 !!!!
 Windows XP has some nice features but it took away ALOT of good old features we are all use to , You cant control any hardware aspects or changes and The lisence is a pain in the Butt if you love to try out lots of new hardware . My opinion Win98 is just great and lets you control alot more than this new version .
 I think Microsoft has gone to far this time ! If you add new hardware in your PC , they think your installing it on another machine . This includes video cards , sound . If you are a gamer , DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT !!! hard disks , and any other perifrial are also considered a second computer ! Also , if for some reason you need to format you must call and `` ask permission from big brother '' To hek with this , I 'll never buy another microsoft product !!! -LRB- ... -RRB-
 Do n't even think about getting XP . I only gave it one star because you ca n't give a product a zero star rating . Remember those problems with 98 service pack 1 . This is 10 times worse . XP is supposed to repair errors as it goes -- Except it has over a dozen patches that you have to download . They have taken away support for Java and you ca n't use most of your hardware and software . Just throw it all away and plan on buying everything all over again . I Have killed two hard drives in installation and I want Bill , `` How much to downgrade to a previous operating system ? `` XP repairs itself ... When I have more than two additional programs in the computer , the computer freezes on shutdown ... hmmm.XP does load faster , however , when I installed NORTON Systemworks 2002 , my 1400 mhz computer with 512MB PC2100 DDR Ram loaded like a 486 trying to run a website.One last thing . It 's no wonder that Windows XP is the least expensive operating system available at Pricewatch ... Buyer be ware or buyer be stupid.Don ' t spend 100 's of hours trying to get your computer to work and no time using your computer ...
 I ordered this expecting full blown Windows Home , but instead got some cockamamie Hewlett Packard OEM disc instead . I 'm going to look into it ASAP , as a matter of fact.However , trying to put a positive spin on it , what I like about this version of Windows is how much less hard drive space it takes up than XP Professional . Unless you work for MS itself , I ca n't imagine what you 'd actually use XP Professional for . So ... so far , so good ! However ... Now I feel , and I 'm sure everybody who 's owned a computer for the last 13 years feels , that Microsoft is in sore need of some viable competition , which it HAD about a decade ago , what with Unix , Linux , DRDOS and OS/2 , but thanks to Microshaft 's octopus-like ways , most of these people are no longer with us ... gone the way of WordStar and TheDraw.Nothing improves the breed like competition ... just imagine how clunky American automobiles would be if it had n't been for Toyota and Honda from Japan -LRB- not to mention the electronics industry , or what 's left of it ! -RRB- ! Here 's hoping SunMicrosystems , -LRB- the only real threat to Miscrosoft left standing , -RRB- has enough juice to keep Bill & Co. on their toes so this edition does n't start blue-screening us into oblivion like Win95 and 98 did !! : - -RRB-
 I 'm what one might call a mid-level computer user . I 've been using MS products for about 17 years . I do n't write code , but I do a lot of work with computers.Anyhow , I just bought a new SOny RX550 computer with Win XP home edition pre-installed . First observation -- it recognized and installed new hardware , i.e. a hew hard drive instantly and without fuss . Great . Loved it.About a week later I got around to installing my scanner . Ahem . That is , I tried to install a relatively new , UMAX 6400 fire wire scanner . No dice . XP wo n't recognize the firewire card -LRB- discovered that the IEEE 1394 interfaces on the machine are not the same as the IEEE fire wire interface that the scanner uses ... hmmm ... -RRB- and so the scanner goes back on the old clunker with 98SE -LRB- but that 's another story ... -RRB- . Bottom line , scanner wo n't work with the new hardware/software combo . Sony and UMAX both told me i was basically SOL . Silly me for expecting relatively new IEEE 1394-based hardware to work with the new MS OS . Still , I give them credit for the flawless performance of the hardware that DOES work with the unit.Caveat emptor , folks .
 Microsoft has mangaged to take a mediocre OS and turn it into complete junk . It 's not really dificult to use for most normal tasks , it just makes them more frustrating . My real problem is the hardware compatability issue . So far my sound card and DSL modem will not work with this OS . I 've downloaded the driver updates and still the hardware will not work.Honestly , I 'd recomend sticking with Win98 se , or if you are just sick of Windows alltogether , try Red Hat Linux . Linux is not as easy to use as Windows , but it is much cheaper -LRB- some versions are free -RRB- and can be altered to suit your needs.If you want to give it a try I recomend buying Red Hat Linux 7 Weekend Crash Course , by Nabba Barkakati . It comes with a copy of Linux and will get you through the basics in no time , though probably not a weekend . A background in DOS or Unix would help also , but it 's not necessary .
 I was very * very * disappointed to find out -LRB- after the purchase -RRB- that not only does it lack a web server -LRB- IIS or Personal Web Server -RRB- but you CA N'T install one . You are forced to pay EVEN MORE for the PRO upgrade . What a load of -LSB- dissapointment ! -RSB- The 2 star rating would be a 4 or 5 if not for this fact alone ...
 In its early years , this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used -- including DOS , Win 3.1 , Windows 95 and Windows 98 . Aside from being incompatible with older hardware , XP Home Edition crashed frequently -- especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do . This was particularly unhelpful . As a writer , I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence , and at touchy moments , literally every few words.Most important , the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers . Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.True enough , the built-in firewall OUGHT to work . But in my case , hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months . With this software , I suffered repeated break ins , the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems . Even installing service pack 2 did not help.After the last go-round , I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru -- another story in itself -- but was still unable to recover everything lost.Throughout this six-month nightmare , I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program , including , more than once , service pack 2 . That , however , did n't plug the security leaks . My computer was completely compromised . In the end , I had to junk the machine all together.In my experience , Mac and Linux operating systems are both far superior.Now I 've got one Windows machine -- a laptop purchased in early 2007 at or around the release of Service Pack 3 -- to run a BioFeedback program whose authors , unfortunately , had not created a Linux version.Admittedly , Microsoft 's final XP service pack seems to have plugged XP 's most serious security holes . Still , after my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition , I forever swore off Windows as my primary operating system . Microsoft operating systems remain magnets for viruses and hackers -- to say nothing of endless bugs and technical issues -- and eons of otherwise unnecessary computer security checks and maintenance .
 I tried installing this on two different computers
 MS manage to change the Interface again . For existing users of Windows , this beast takes some time to get used to . I find myself constantly looking at help , looking for some stupid menu item . It makes experienced user feels like ignorant as the Windows beginners.Comes with many small programs , but many times , I rather pay for professional software than deal with more of MS -LSB- stuff -RSB- . All this unwanted features gets in the way of accomplishing my goals.Comming from Windows 2000 , I did not see much of speed advantage.Beginners of Windows may like all the extra featurs , but as an experienced user , I can not get any work done with this POS .
 When I bought my new dell machine this year , Windows XP was the only choice of OS I had and Dell assured me that XP is well received by customers.I had already heard the scary stories about XP but I was still not prepeared for the horrors that XP unleashed once the initial setup was completed . The look and feel it gives your computer is certainly different , but its capability to do multiple tasks while maintaining system integrity is seriously flawed.I do not know how this piece of garbage was released for public consumption.Here are all the positives and negatives I ahve encountered with XP in last 6 months : Positives : NoneNegatives :1 -RRB- Very unstable . Unless you only launch your IE or some other basic applications that come with the system , you are in serious trouble . The system becomes unresponsive and I have to cut the power and remove the battery to restart it . Sometimes -LRB- like just now -RRB- I had to restart 5 times before I could log in .2 -RRB- Incompatible with most software out there . If you want to install basic music software , virus protection , firewall etc , be prepared for further system issues at startup type . XP does n't handle anything but microsoft 's software .3 -RRB- No gaming support . Despite what MS claims , XP is incapable of handling most gaming software . It keeps crashing everytime you run a game with heavy graphics.CONCLUSION
 I have a fairly new Dell , but they will not support their system if you try to upgrade . As I found out trying to install Win-XP , there are likely to be incompatabilities -LRB- Antivirus programs , printers , scanners , video cards , etc. -RRB- , if you own a Dell do n't count on any help . Ironically , Dell says their liscencing agreement with Microsoft prevents them from supporting the upgrade , this may be the same for other computer manufacturers.Sincerely , Tom C.
 I 've been a Windows user for nearly 6 years , and I have to say I 'm very disappointed with WindowsXP . I had very high hopes , but after spending nearly two hours using the upgrade at a local Staples , I have to say all the rumors are true ; this thing is a extremely cheap imitation of Mac OS X. It 's so blatent , I 'm surprised Apple has n't sued yet . Let 's start with the `` Luna '' interface
 For the home user , this OS is not worth they money that buys you some stability at the price of performance . Some nice driver roll-back features , other new monopolistic features -LRB- cd burning -RRB- . Also , look to be calling M$ if you ever decide to upgrade hardware inside your computer because the system will be shut off . This being the first step to paying M$ a monthly tribute to use their mediocre software !
 I purchased Windows XP Home Edition upgrade for my Windows ME operating system . Following the instructions and recommendations , I inserted the CD and began the installation process . It sucessfully went through all the steps including most of the `` Finalizing Installation '' step , whereupon it stopped and would not finish . I could not exit installation , uninstall , or return to the ME system . Therefore , I had to shut down my computer and use the System Recovery software . As a result , I am out the cost of the XP upgrade , the cost of downloaded software which I lost in the recovery process , and approximately 8 hours of time between attempting the upgrade , recovering my original system and reinstalling software and files . Not to mention I have yet to re-download a recent upgrade to my internet service , which was also lost in the recovery.So , in closing , I ca n't rate the performance of Windows XP , I can only say I would have rated the upgrade version of this software 0 stars if that were an option .
 I currently and unfortunately own and use this operating system.I have owned and used other Microsoft Operating System software in the past and compared to them , Windows XP Home Edition stinks . Out of all of the past operating systems , I feel that Microsoft Windows ME is the best of the best . Windows XP is just a lot of hype and is not even close to operating systems in the past .
 Lots of new features come with the OS . this much is nice . My main gripe is that you ca n't upgrade your machine or move the OS to another machine without major trouble . Change more than a network card a couple of other items and your OS wo n't work . This is MS 's harebrained scheme to stop people from copying the OS.Whatever you do , make sure you do n't use this software if all you have is a dial-up connection.I will be avoiding this OS version as long as possible .
 The bugs in WIN 98 were finally worked out , unless you 're unfortunate enough to click on `` sure OK '' when Internet Explorer needs an update . I 've had to re format four systems in two months because of that illegal function in Explorer.exe or Kernal .32 . AOL or MSN can cause it to . I now have a Compaq running XP and it has so many Bugs , I get very frustrated ... and I 'm a very good systems engineer . I feel bad for an average user confronting these problems . Why does he continue selling a Beta program , testing and fixing it out in the Public after charging almost -LRB- $ -RRB- ? Then he will put the repaired product out as XP 2 and make everyone stuck with the problem ridden Op system pay for the upgrade.You will eventually get it running well with persistance , but I just want to do my work and get off the pute . I will give credit though for do it yourself home Network ease . I hooked in a DSL modem with a Router to share with my other computers and was ready for a long night of problems . It set up so fast and works so well I was shocked , even formed me floppy disk network setup for the WIN 98 beasts to be patched in.The low rating I gave is due to the very poorly designed multimedia programs included in XP . They are not at all intuitive , take many months to figure out and malfunction often . They also tend to be very CHATTY . Often you have to close out pop ups when working on something totally unrelated . If you use msconfig to close all of those programs at the start that bring your system resources dangerously low it asks you at every boot if you intended to change the setting , and then reactivates them on it 's own .
 I bought a new PC last Fall - Pent4 w/Windows XP Home - My printer does n't work anymore . I have to use my other PC w/ME for printing -LRB- and allmost everything else . -RRB- It does n't run the CD-ROM that SBC sent to install my DSL . I wrote a to do list using wordpad , it would not save . It freezes , crashes just like my old PC . My neighbor upgraded to XP-HOME , his scanner stopped working , his webcam stopped working ... What good is a `` superior '' , `` new improved '' operating system if it ca n't do the basic job that it is supposed to do - to OPERATE the basic components of a computer system ! I 'm going to ? downgrade ? back to WIN98 so my PC can finnally do its job . XP-HOME may be O.K. for those computer guys who can fix everything but if you 're in need of a turn-key PC that will work right out of the box ... fu-ged-a-boud-it !
 Every day my new Dell super duper , high quality , desktop crashes and burns . Every day I send `` error reports '' to Microsoft . When I sent a complaining e-mail , I was invited to their web site where I learned that , FOR A PRICE , I can get some pesonal attention for a new product which fails to provide the speed , stability , and efficiency of my Win 2000 program running on my notebook . Yes , XP does have attractive features re
 Windows xp is the greatest os there is but only if you never plan to use your computer for anything but xp . Everything you add to you computer runs slower . If you put on software to do something xp does n't like it in fact it fights with the new program to try to get you to use something ms put in xp . The operating system itself works -LRB- but has many flaws -RRB- but the intergrated software -LRB- which you ca n't uninstall -RRB- wo n't let you do anything you want to do -LRB- windows media player being the worst -RRB- If you like music or your cd burner stay away from xp .
 I admit it ... I was happy with Windows 98 but then someone stole our computer . The replacement came with Windows XP motto `` we think you want things this way , so do n't try to do what you want , we know best '' . If you 're a newby you might be happy with this approach , but XP has sucked up hours of time trying to be whipped into line so that it does what I want , in the way that I want it.For example : - it 's incompatible with ZoneAlarm firewall . Every time Windows updates , Outlook Express permissions on ZoneAlarm have to be reconfigured or you do n't get email . 98 did n't have this problem . - useful programs that I use on my Start Menu disappear if I do n't use them . So items used -LRB- say -RRB- monthly have to be hunted down , requiring more mouse clicks . This is an irritating functionality . - the Help function is crippled by comparison to 98 , unless you are willing to go onto the internet . With phone-line dial-in , this is irritating . - there is little guidance on setting up Identities for a new user of identities , and some programs will register and operate under some identities but not under others -LRB- unless you buy two copies of the program -RRB- . This means more mouse clicks , or duplicate configuration . - it assumes you want all of microsoft 's products to operate for you . In truth I want Word and Excel to never ever go on the internet , and I never want HTML or Word files to be my basic email mode . - it assumes that only Windows Media Player is the soundware of choice . - it takes a long time to close down , to the point where you assume it has failed to shut down . Advice
 We bought some retired friends a Dell system withthe new Home XP operating system . I spend more thana day trying to show them basics.They were having a tough time , and I developed a negativeimpression of XP.Some of the reasons : -- _ Too many _ ways to do things , too much info coming ata new user , popup messages end up confusing the user , and in some cases obscure important alternatives . -- The organization was not good for facilitaing work flow . -- The muli user login is a nice idea , but also confusingin execution . When are you installing or changingsomething just for this user , when for all ... -- Important functions are obscured -- A major negative move towards too manypossibilities and too much confusion relative toWindows 98 or NT the other Windows systems , that I amfamiliar with -- also , I see no reason to upgradefrom 98 , 2000 , or NT that I saw . -- Too many places where you would want to encourage usingthe right mouse button , something easy if you arefamiliar with Microsoft , but hard for beginers -- Fairly easy adjustment if you are a microsoft veteran -- Driver installtion was more difficult and confusingpartly because of a pop up messages you get if thedriver has n't been registered with Microsoft . -- The people I was teaching were intimidated , I wishedwe had bough them an Apple instead.Microsoft should reorganize their user interface / human engineering team , and start over . This is a movein the wrong direction .
 It 's a operating system ... That 's way too expensive.Yes , windows XP is better then the previous versions ... but so was Win95 better then 3.1 , and Windows 98 better then 95 , and windows 98 SE better then 98 , and Windows ME better then 98 SE . -LRB- well . . actually I 'm not sure about that one :p -RRB- And now Windows XP better then Windows Me.Frankly , where will it end?How many times does it take to get a decent operating system?Plus , when you upgrade , you 're going to find that many of the things you used with windows ME/98 wo n't work because there are no drivers out yet . For example my Studio DC10 plus capture card ... No drivers yet . But the company plans on it but keeps delaying it . I think companies are sick and tired of having to make new drivers every other year!In addition , Windows XP includes sub par programs for music , images , etc.They take up space , and are sometimes difficult to change away from your default program for a certain image type or music . When you can find free programs like winamp that do the job better , with less strain on your computer ... with less bugs.And , your going to have a lovely time with the activation system in place . Whenever you change your hardware , or even sometimes install new software -LRB- yes its rare , but it still waisted my time -RRB- you will have to reactivate it . . Wonderful waist of time!Perhaps it 's the subliminal messages to use Microsoft services like MSN messenger which I have yet to figure out how to uninstall . Or , a Microsoft owned location to print pictures in your `` my pictures '' folder . Or the MSN search page whenever you mistype a URL -LRB- let alone the pre-installed MSN services -RRB- . Perchance it 's the fact that the interface looks so similar to the new Mac interface that you can sometimes mistake them . Maybe windows XP just scares me ... Take my advice and stick with windows 98SE
 WinXP came with my new Gateway laptop . It 's got some nice features , like restore , but they hardly make up for my 2 biggest complaints . 1
 Almost everything in XP is a SERVICE PACK save your money !
 I too , survived that inexcusable fiasco known as Windoze ME -LRB- Millenium Edition -RRB- . About 2 and a half years ago , despite my having invested almost a grand and a half on a top of the line PC system with ME as my O.S. , I got daily system freezes , crashes , and error messages with Millenium Edition . Clearly , ME was a defective product , and Gates should issue a consumer recall and reimburse those who purchased Win ME . Perhaps there should be a class action lawsuit as well . Of course , civil e-mails and customer service calls to Microsoft were NEVER returned . Not once . Is this the ` respect ' that Gates has for his customers ?! Out of sheer desperation , and a need to be productive and to preserve my sanity and health , I was told by an ` IT guru ' that a clean install of Windows XP Home Edition would solve my problems , so I fell for it . Two hundred bucks later , I have tons of 2 to 4 year old Windows software and games that simply do n't work on XP , or cause system errors and crashes ! I am now back at square one , and faced with the prospect of having to throw out over $ 3,000 in Windows 98/ME software that does n't work well with XP !!! Where is the BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY that Windows is supposed to truly have ?!?! I 'm not running a 15 year old DOS program on here for chrissakes . All I can say , is after experiencing the various incarnations of Windows , and concomitant headaches this lousy O.S. is responsible for , my next computer is going to be a Macintosh . Gates has lost my respect and Windows business .
 What a resource hog ! My home PC was quite happily running Windows 2000 Pro , so when I installed this I was hoping for the same reasonable levels of stability and ease of use I had got used to with that operating system , with the added advantage of a home-user slant . But , boy , what a drag ! Not only have all of my once swift and slick hardware resources been sucked into some Redmond power vacuum , but the built in driver for my ATI graphics card is _ still _ not working correctly and Norton Antivirus continually fails to load.It 's been two years since Windows 2000 came out , and they 've actuallly succeeded in making it worse ! I would n't mind , if there was _ anything _ visually appealing about what is making my system drag its feet , but sadly all these bell-n-whistles simply serve to reveal the underlying clunkiness and awfulness of this outdated software.They tried to make it look like an Apple operating system
 My experience with XP has just been a disaster . It has horrible security issues , terrrible backwards compatibility , is hit and miss with non-Microsoft software -LRB- especially pre-XP software -RRB- and is unstable . It is such a junky operating system , I 'm junking it and going back to Windows 2000 . Everyone who buys XP and has a fast internet connection should realize from the get go how bad the security issues are . If you must have XP or if its pre-loaded onto the computer you bought and you have broadband , make sure you spring for a good internet security system -LRB- e.g. McAfee or Norton -RRB- and be prepared to deal with adware , spyware etc. etc. . If you have a lot of pre-XP software , be prepared to say goodbye to a lot of it . Some of it will work , but a lot of it will not . One other piece of advice -- do not set up separate user accounts . We did and XP crashed a LOT . We went back to a single account and its become more stable -LRB- though far from perfect -RRB- . All in all , this is Redmond 's worst OS since Windows 98 . One of my grad students has me about talked into jumping to Linux . I ca n't see how that alternative could be any worse , and it 's sure a lot cheaper ! Have n't gone quite that far ... yet . But it 's back to 2000 for me , and I 'm vowing never , ever , ever , ever , ever , ever , ever to buy into Microsoft 's claims about its `` new and improved '' products . If XP is the flagship product , this company has some serious quality control issues .
 I do n't understand why everyone I 've met says they love XP . A -RRB- It 's incredibly expensive , and then you also have to buy the Office library for hundreds of dollars too . In addition , fairly soon they 're going to start charging you to not upgrade . So you 'll have no choice whether to cough up money or not . That 's just not right.XP is praised for it 's security . Frankly , I would rather have other people hacking my computer than Microsoft . The latest version of Windows Media Player -LRB- that comes with XP -RRB- sends a list of what videos you watch to Microsoft . That is a total invasion of privacy.Also , the new design is actually very large and ugly . And you ca n't change the colors of the bars . Luckily you can choose to have the old style.Everytime Microsoft is about to release a product , they lower their standards to release it more quickly - they allow more bugs to go unchecked . Then after the release they go back and figure out how to fix those bugs , and send out Patches and Upgrades and such . That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard of.Other than the new bars , annoying shortcut bars in the My Computer , new start menu , etc. . XP is the same as ME.A * special * feature of XP is that it is more `` user friendly '' . It 's not user friendly , that just means that they hid the places where you can change your system . For example , to get to the Control Panel , I now have to go into My Computer , and find the tiny link on the side bar -LRB- which gets in the way BTW -RRB- . Before I just had to click on the link in the Start Menu . The first few times you try to go into Program Files , it has this big message `` These files are special and should not be deleted . Your too stupid for us to trust with the guts of your computer . '' -LRB- I am paraphrasing of course -RRB- , and you have to click on a tiny link.They are trying to make it so that we have no clue about what 's going on inside our computers , and they can charge exorbitant fees , and track what we do . In this new `` Computer Age '' , I vote we all use Linux . It 's easy , you just have to get used to it , everything is FREE , it does n't snoop on you , and all the programs are free.The only good thing about XP is the ability to remove all the desktop shortcuts into the start menu . Other than that , it 's a total flop .
 Once again , Microsoft has put out a product that is not ready yet . I resent paying $ 200 to be a beta tester for Microsoft . The install was going along smoothly until a report came out that said almost all of my devices might not work . I guess I should be thankful that I was informed about this before the new o/s was completly installed . I am not returning it , I am just going to wait until it is fully supported.The thing that bothers me most is that the devices that I use are not uncommon or obscure . They are mainstream things like a printer , scanner , router , cable modem , etc. . I purchased Win ME several moths ago and installed that instead . That seems to be the theme with MS , buy it when it comes out and wait until you can use it .
 Although much anticipated , this software will disappoint when released -LRB- with several unsquashed bugs -RRB- . Unless you are a home/hobbyist user , do n't buy this software until the service pack releases squash some of the bugs.Trust me on this one .
 it is maybe the worst windows so far my computer never stalled so much in the past not even with windows 98
 There are over 100 games which will no longer run or cause problems under XP and some of them are Microsoft games such as Midtown Madness II . A few others I have that do n't work are Star Wars Racer , Math Blaster , Print Master Gold , Nascar 4 . The workaround that Microsoft lists on this link also does not help in running these games . Overall I would rate my upgrade to XP a bust !! Good Luck with yours . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 ... I mean come on
 This might be a slick looking operating system , but I see a few problems with it : * Incompatibility with Linux means that you are locked out of literally thousands of free software programs available on that platform * Lack of source code means that if there is a problem , you depend on Microsoft to fix it . Or not . In other words , you do n't have much of a sayConsider instead a purchase of Linux such as Red Hat , SuSE or Mandrake . They are available from Amazon and have neither of the limitations mentioned above .
 I really think that the Windows Product line is going to be ending soon , ME was a disaster to use and the worst OS i 've come across . I 'd rather type out every command on a command line than use ME , XP did improve slightly , the actual networking support and the Multi-user code from 2000 is nice , but it is awful that to be able to get the Network functionality of 98 -LRB- IMHO the best windows really -RRB- you have to pay for the Professional edition . My other major complaint is that for -LRB- the price -RRB- you should get a lot more , honestly for a 30 $ cd distro of Linux you get a word processing suite , 100 + games , networking support , and oh yeah . . the source code to the OS . That and the fact that the GNOME desktop on Linux looks much nicer than windows , and you still have the multiuser support which Microsoft stole from * nix 's practially verbatim .
 In its early years , this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used -- including DOS , Win 3.1 , Windows 95 and Windows 98 . Aside from being incompatible with older hardware , XP Home Edition crashed frequently -- especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do . This was particularly unhelpful . As a writer , I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence , and at touchy moments , literally every few words.Most important , the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers . Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.True enough , the built-in firewall OUGHT to work . But in my case , hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months . With this software , I suffered repeated break ins , the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems . Even installing service pack 2 did not help.After the last go-round , I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru -- another story in itself -- but was still unable to recover everything lost.Throughout this six-month nightmare , I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program , including , more than once , service pack 2 . That , however , did n't plug the security leaks . My computer was completely compromised . In the end , I had to junk the machine all together.In my experience , Mac and Linux operating systems are both far superior.Now I 've got one Windows machine -- a laptop purchased in early 2007 at or around the release of Service Pack 3 -- to run a BioFeedback program whose authors , unfortunately , had not created a Linux version.Admittedly , Microsoft 's final XP service pack seems to have plugged XP 's most serious security holes . Still , after my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition , I forever swore off Windows as my primary operating system . Microsoft operating systems remain magnets for viruses and hackers -- to say nothing of endless bugs and technical issues -- and eons of otherwise unnecessary computer security checks and maintenance .
 Microsoft Co. is getting really invasive . I suggest users of this and other Microsoft -LRB- amnong other Cos. -RRB- products read the EULAs before clicking YES . Also note that Windows XP comes with no supprt for MP3 or DVD files , nor do any of it 's `` Updates '' . I wouuld also search the web for well known security holes and their fixes before installing deploying this product . As to the convinience this product affords , it is analogus that an unlocked door affords you at your house
 WOW ! I NEVER KNOW SOME SOFTWARE , AND ESPECIALLY THIS CAN BE SO HORRIBLY BAD !! FIRST OFF , I HAVE NO CLUE WHERE ANY OF MY PREVIOUS STUFF WENT , I FOUND 10 OF MY DOCS AND I FRANTICALLY SEARCHED EVERY FOLDER . MY MUSIC WONT RE FORMAT AND ALL OF MY DATA IS JUST NOTHING . THIS BROUGHT ME NOTHING BUT TROUBLE . I WISH I JUST STUCK WITH ME WHICK IS 1OOX BETTER IN EVERY WAY . IN THIS ONE THEY TREAT YOU LIKE YOU HAVNT EVER USED A COMPUTER BEFORE AND TAKE THE `` PERSONAL '' AWAY FROM PC . DONT GET THIS LOAD OF JUNK .
 I 'm not completely computer illiterate , but I get terribly impatient when things do n't work . After two years of Microsoft 's incredibly unstable Windows ME , I was ready for a change . However , I made a mistake -- and got ripped off -- purchasing the XP home edition upgrade . One of the problems is that not all the ME components get replaced with the upgrade edition , and so this affects XP 's reliability . The other problem is that XP is designed for a hard drive formatted for an NTFS file system , as opposed to a FAT32 format , which is what previous versions of Windows use . -LRB- I may have expressed that incorrectly , but the point is that XP is designed for a differently configured hard drive . -RRB- The upgrade edition does n't provide the option of reformatting the hard drive , because it 's designed to be layered on top of what you already have . To make a long story short , nothing worked very well , even after repeated attempts to install . The advice is to wipe the hard drive , install the full edition of XP from scratch -LRB- reformatting the hard drive for NTFS , which the full version will do for you -RRB- , and then reinstall all software from scratch . It 's time consuming , but the system will work much better .
 If you have a Windows 98 machine and it is running fine it is best to leave it alone . After upgrading to XP MANY of my programs no longer ran and required expensive upgrades to make them compatible with XP . I spent a few hundred dollars in upgrades with very little -LRB- if any -RRB- performance gain . In addition , my Intel print servers , which I purchased less than a year ago , do not and will never support XP . -LRB- FYI - do not buy Intel products if you require long term support . -RRB- So I need to purchase new print servers . After the upgrade I was rewarded with more blue screens -LRB- fatal errors -RRB- then I have ever seen with all of the previous versions of Windows combined . And this is for a standard off the rack HP machine . I ca n't imagine what happens to a custom built box . If you want to try the upgrade , good luck . Be prepared to send several hours getting your machine to run properly .
 Windows XP has a great new user interface , and improved multimedia capabilites , but it is just not worth the money that it would take to get everything to work with it . First , it wo n't recgonize your utility and antivirius software , making you buy a new one , then you have to buy an ethernet card for your cable modem , then you have to reinstall most of your programs to compete with the compatibility issues.Overall Windows XP is a good product , but it is either too advanced for the average user , or the average user is too far -LRB- 5-6 -RRB- months behind the times to find it useful .
 If the operating software you 're currently using is reasonably stable , do n't bother buying the upgrade . I did and I 'm regretting it in spades ! I have a Dell computer that 's running Win 98 SE on a Pentium III , 128 Meg of RAM and a 30-gig hard-drive . -LRB- It 's only a year-and-a-half old . -RRB- I 've called Microsoft tech support , spent hours on hold -LRB- a toll call -RRB- and been cut off twice . The installation is caught in some kind of an infinite loop , and my machine is now useless . I may have to remove the hard-drive and have it reformatted . This product may be OK if you buy it pre-installed on a new computer , but do n't bother buying the upgrade . It 's too risky .
 Let me first say that XP is more stable than ME . Outside of this , there is little advantage to this new OS . There are , however , a number of drawbacks . First , XP takes up massive amounts of space on your hard drive . Similarly , you 'll need to max out your RAM to make your system run properly . Secondly , it seems to be tailored to people who know almost nothing about computers , to the detriment of people who do get them . Finally , XP not only scams you out of the $ ... for the upgrade , but also to force you to buy new software that is no longer compatible with XP -LRB- and believe me , more of your software is incompatible than you 'd think -RRB- . XP reminds me of the old saying about buying a boat
 I got XP when it was first released . You STILL CAN NOT BUY SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE that is compatible with it ! Forget Games . There are practically none that support it . I got a Kodak Digital camera for Christmas & had to return it . I bought an HP printer/fax/scanner in December & they STILL do n't have drivers to support XP!If you never plan to get new hardware or software , XP is almost as good as Windows 98 .
 The number one problem I have with this OS is it 's invasive aggressive anti-piracy aspects . While I agree 100 % with Microsoft about wanting to stop all the WAREZ idiots from ripping them off - and even worse from profiting from their product , I * DO NOT * think this is the way to do it ! # 1 you have to call or electronically register this OS and it 's CD-KEY to get it to run at all . # 2 If your system configuration changes too much -LRB- I.E. new RAM , new HD , New CD-ROM etc. -RRB- then the OS will freeze up again and you have to RE-register it with Microsoft , getting yet another code to enter to unlock it . And you can only do that up to 5 times before Microsoft starts to demand you provide very elaborate reasons as to why you need to install it again ! -LRB- If you are like me and you tinker with your system constantly I am sure you can imagine the headache this will cause -RRB- # 3 If you try to run Office XP with this OS you will have EVEN MORE registration numbers you need to put in in order to get the two suites to unlock and work together!My Second major problem with this OS is overall , it really is n't all that different than WIN98/WIN2000 or ME . It is still basically the same OS , it may be a little faster to some people running much older systems , but for people with newer systems the speed does n't increase all that much . I would recommend more RAM for speed over a new OS * ANY DAY * anways.Does this OS have a good side ? You bet ! It boasts that it is WAY more stable than anything else released to date . PC WORLD Magazine even said they could get 19 APPS to run at the same time on a pentium I PC with only 128 MB RAM - without any crashes or `` blue screens of death '' , that is impressive . It also has lots of nifty stuff for those of you out there that like to tinker with lots of multimedia stuff like DVDs/CDs/MP3s / Movies Etc.Bottom line , it is HARD to find anything * BUT * the latest release of Windows in the stores these days . I prefer Windows 98 SE but good luck finding a copy ! If you are buying a new system that has the software and OS pre-loaded , you -LRB- ... -RRB- basically -LRB- have -RRB- no options anyway . But if you are a user that has a bit of PC knowledge and you handle your own upgrades and installs , I * WOULD NOT * recommend this OS upgrade , or the full version for that matter ! If you can find it use WIN98SE , or even better use Unix/Linux .
 Save your money . Buy a barebones if you need a new computer . Otherwise install `` Xtreme Pain '' on another drive . That way you can still access your hp devices , copy music CDs and use your favorite software from the 98 drive . Xp does have a prettier version of minesweeper and online checkers .
 Although I do like Windows XP 's functionality , if you are a Windows 98 user do not necessarily expect to `` upgrade '' to Windows XP without problems . I had reinstall all of the peripherals drivers and some do not work correctly still . A better choice is to buy Windows 2000 Professional -LRB- which is basically an updgrade Windows NT -RRB- outright . This upgrade has caused me a lot of reinstallation work .
 I found Windows XP Home Edition to be quite deficient in the area of accessibility and visibility for anyone with low vision . It is much harder to find and set font sizes and colors than in Windows 98 and several options for changing the way the display looks which are available in 98 are not available at all in XP . A big negative is the loss of 640X480 screen resolution , which is a great help to visually impaired users in Windows 98 . There is a built-in screen magnifier . No points there
 This is the slowest . Operating . System I have ever used . The first time I installed XP Home , I did n't see what was so bad about it , but when we tried installing it on our new Gateway Machine , it imedettly slowed all system operations down to a crawl . Even My brother 's laptop , which is a very Fast Machine , has XP pro , and it randomly slows down . Do n't get this operating system . It 's slow , buggy , and expensive .
 Windows XP is not the great value it is made out to be . One example is microsoft claims that every OS they make is faster then the previewous , Then WHY DOES WINDOWS 95 LOAD IN HALF THE TIME ??? That is only one example . -LRB- ... -RRB- . -LRB- ... -RRB- . Getting back to windows though , Why do we pay for `` upgrades '' to windows like windows 95 to win98 the only real difference is the msie active interface -LRB- which crashes more in my tests -RRB- and xp is even worse with activation , the only way to avoid activation -LRB- legally -RRB- is buying the corperate version -LRB- who has that money ? -RRB- -LRB- ... -RRB-
 Windows XP is impossible ! I just bought a new laptop , P4 , running XP , unfortunately . Most of my existing software - many programs I depend on for my work - do not work with XP , not compatible . Even some popular online service software does NOT work with XP . Windows 98 and ME are far superior . With XP , I have to consider buying all new versions of software ; unfortunately , many of the popular programs I use are not available in Windows XP compatible versions ! There is no simple solution , but XP -LSB- stinks -RSB- majorly !
 I was disappointed to find that Windows XP is not compatble with Windows 98 SE , which makes it worthless to me . I plan to file for a refund or perhaps credit toward purchase of Windows 2000 which believe is compatible ... Phil Braunpnbraun@swbell.net
 Microsoft has added the requirement that users do a minimal registration in order to use this or any other new MS product . This makes it so you ca n't move it from one computer to another and if you upgrade some of your hardware , you will have to call them and explain your story . If they do n't believe you , then you wo n't be able to use it on your new computer . Microsoft is getting very `` nervy '' with this next generation . It 's a good product , but it 's nothing you could n't get from Windows 2000 or better yet , Linux .
 I reluctantly upgraded to Windows XP because certain programs I wanted to run were not supported by Windows Me , my previous OS . It 's been nothing less than a disaster . I upgraded two months ago and have yet to restore the functionality I had before . I have n't had this many problems with compatability since my last girlfriend . Be warned
 Is it just me , or is Microsoft the only company on the planet that makes money despite it constantly treating it 's customer base to shoddy products , and hassling anti-piracy techniques that do n't work -LRB- trust me , there 's 30 page reports floating around online on how to break Microsoft 's piracy code -RRB- Windows XP is typical of Microsoft by requiring more RAM , more disk space , and a faster processor , although to be honest the code base it was designed from allowed for the product to run at a % 50 speed increase on current hardware . But of course with the revamped extras , such as digital media support and the like , the requirements were boosted beyond need . The code engineering is not impressive in this area , as many loopholes existing in current Windows products still exist in XP to be exploited .
 I was expecting microsoft to come with a better operating system than this . But this is a huge disappointment . First of all , not all devices are working properly . Looks like the operating system has the device drivers but none are optimized . Second , I have already reinstalled this operating system three times , reason
 After all the hype , and the steep price tag , I was expecting something a lot more revolutionary.All it is is windows 2000 dressed up with an annoyingly cutesy copy of the -LRB- much beter looking -RRB- Mac OS X. Bundle in a few apps -LRB- media player , etc -RRB- , that you can download for free anyway and hey presto , a ` very similar to the last one ' operating system.Oh , and do n't forget that you need a new PC with stacks of RAM to get it to run at a decent speed.Stick with Windows 2000 and if the interface really bugs you , download a free XP copy skin from the web .
 Finally a good upgrade easy download , Well I 'm telling everyone do n't believe everything that 's said about Windows-XP . I have Windows 98 . I thought that I could upgrade to xp . I tried 2 times to upgrade only to be stopped right in the middle of the installing process . My computer is barely 2 years old , and I 've never had trouble downloading a program , as I had trying to download this one . I know that sometimes programs freeze but I was hoping that it this one would n't . I wish that I could rate this a minus one . The only way this will work is if you buy a computer that has Windows XP preinstalled .
 The operating system is good . Much better than 95 , 98 and 2000 . The main problem I have with Microsoft XP is that if you have multiple system - you need to have a software license . Each additional PC requires a license . Maybe , I will switch over to linux OS .
 I just email Microsoft about this disappointing product . After 100 hours of attempting installation , I have finally given up . My PC is only 2 months old and has the new ASUS A7V8X motherboard . The installation `` Bombed '' . After over 100 hours of attempting and over 2 hours on the microsoft tech line , this product is going back . The question is
 For those that own the product and got it to install congratulations . Myself I have n't been as lucky . The installation process will not go beyond the first reboot without giving an invalid page fault error . By the way this is a 1.4 GHz Athlon , 1 gig of RAM , 80 gig hard drive & GEForce 32 Meg -LRB- DDR -RRB- AGP Video sytem with a 17 '' Flat Panel display , not an old relic ! There should be a zero star rating for something that flat out does n't run .
 This is a technology gone bersek with needless complexity and overkill for simple home user having one computer in his study room . Administrator , pass word protection , inability to download and save files if not logged in as administrator . . the list goes on and on . Duh ? If you screwup during installation , your password for automatic log in to your ISP provider can not be fixed easily . Try editing your pass word files . Fat chance . Each time you have to delete the old wrong password and type in your correct password . So much for automatic log on . Try changing your hardware even alittle bit , you have to call microsoft to re-register your software ... . You are better off with older version of the window operating systems . Atleast they left you alone once you made your purchase . Overkill and listening to the wrong users in product development indeed .
 It 's a shame we are all going to have to make this upgrade . I have been a consistent Windows and DOS user since day one in the early 80s . And I must say I am VERY disappointed with Windows XP . For all it 's touted to be , it is first and foremost an incredible pain to install . And once it 's installed , it does n't work very well . It 's advertised as nearly crash free . Bunk . I have had just as many hard crashes with XP as with 98 . Nearly every program I had on my computer with Windows 98 required a patch to download from a web site to make it work with XP . My older model HP Laserjet printer does not work with XP , though MS and HP say it will . I have to reboot everytime I want to print a document . My DVD player no longer works . I am considering buying a -LSB- ... -RSB- `` decoder '' which is `` sure to fix the problem . '' CD creator finally works , but with two reinstalls and the installation of two patches . My customised HP keyboard no longer works with the bells and whistles buttons it came with . When I tried to install the keyboard patch , I got a crash so hard I barely survived . When I installed WIndows XP it dumped all the communications protocols for my ADSL ISP provider . My ISP has no fix , so I have to manually connect each time I want to surf the web . The list goes on and on . This was an inconceived upgrade . If Microsoft had spent as much money on development as on advertising perhaps it would have been a better product . Buyer Beware !!
 Not only did this product not recognize my modem -LRB- after it auto-downloaded from Microsoft using this same modem -RRB- it could n't install it later -LRB- even after two hours of phone assist from Microsoft -RRB- Nor would this product read either my DVD drive or my CD drive . These three items were all purchased and installed -LRB- on Millennium -RRB- in the past 12 months . I had to uninstall XP to get back my internet accessabiltity . Do n't believe the hype on this product -LRB- like I did -RRB- - contact Microsoft BEFORE YOU BUY to determine if it is compatable with your current hardware or if you will be forced to replace it to meet the limitations of this product .
 I installed Windows XP Upgrade on my home computer to replace my current ME operating system , but have now uninstalled it . My advice is , if your current operating system is basically satisfactory , do n't make the move to Windows XP unless you 've made sure your older programs and hardware are compatible with XP and there is some feature you feel you really , really must have.In the words of the XP instruction manual , `` The Windows XP Setup program will automatically check the hardware and software already installed on your computer for potential conflicts . '' `` Potential conflicts '' is a nice way of saying that certain programs and hardware items may not work well or at all with XP , because it wants digital signatures , updated drivers or more.In my case , during the installation process , XP informed me that `` Setup has detected that some hardware or programs on your computer might not function correctly after the upgrade is completed . This lack of functionality can have an effect on things you might want to do , such as connecting to the Internet , accessing e-mail , printing , scanning , and playing sounds or music . '' -LRB- Wow , are n't those the things that most people use their computers for ? -RRB- After I completed the XP installation -LRB- which proved to be a very simple process -RRB- , I did in fact encounter considerable difficulty with a number of software and hardware items . As examples , XP was extremely cranky about accepting my cable modem and I could not get my printer to work at all , even after I downloaded a new driver from the manufacturer 's website . -LRB- Solution - buy a new printer ? -RRB- The XP installation also rendered my Norton Antivirus 2004 software inoperable , a problem which the Norton website recognized but had no solution for . I also faced problems with my CD creation and digital camera software as well the Outlook Express email software.I want to stress that all of these problems have solutions , but I eventually hit the wall `` installation fatigue . '' It just seemed that , every time I got a problem solved , two more would pop up - so I just gave up and uninstalled XP . I concluded that what I had seen on my computer screen so far in terms of new features simply did not outweigh the problems I was experiencing and the potential cost of new programs and hardware that would be compatible with XP.My main point here is that there is a lot of hype about the advantages of XP but no one tells buyers that it may cost you 4 or 5 times as much to replace hardware and software that is not compatible with XP , and that you may have to spend hours at problem-solving in order to get your computer functioning . Microsoft has a web link at www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/ that is supposed to provide information on whether your applications and hardware are `` XP-ready . '' This should be put in at least inch bright orange letters on the box so that purchasers will notice it and check BEFORE they tear open that shrink-wrap and lose the right to return the product for a refund .
 I rated Windows XP 1 STAR only because 0 STARS was not an option . While Windows XP may be a great system when it is factory installed on a new computer , it is a disasterous system for computer users whose current system 's use a lot of installed peripherals and non-Microsoft software . Do n't even consider upgrading to XP unless you are prepared to spend countless hours , and one hell of a lot of money , upgrading and reconfiguring both your existing hardware and software.Windows XP 's documentation states that some existing software and hardware might not be compatible with this new operating system . That is a gross understatement . I am currenting using a six-month-old Dell system with 1.2 Gig . Pentium 4 , 512k Ram and factory installed DVD Drive , CDR , and 56k modem . I also have a relatively new HP Scanner , and a Lexmark Z32 printer . The DVD , the CDR , the modem , the scanner , and the printer all are incompatible with XP . While the DVD and the CDR both would read conventional CD 's , the DVD drive would not read DVD 's , and the CDR would not write to new CD 's . I was able to find a free upgrade for the DVD drive , but had to purchase new software for the CDR . Similarly I was able to find a software fix for the printer , but will have to replace my scanner . While my modem will dial out and allow me to connect to the internet , I am unable to access/manupliate any of the modem 's settings so eventually I will have to replace it.AS for software , forget about any anti-virus software you own such as McAfee or Norton Anti-virus . Only anti-virus programs written expressly for XP will run on this system , and unlike previous Windows upgrades , McAfee Anti-virus software does not come bundled with Windows XP Plus . Also trouble shooting programs / maintenance like Norton System Works are gonners.I 've had Windows XP for about one month now and so far it has cost me close to 50 hours of my time and nearly -LRB- $ ... -RRB- just to bring my system back to the functionalily it had before I installed it.Why I did n't just uninstall XP and go back my old Windows ME ? Unlike previous Microsoft upgrades that archived your old operating system , uninstall is not an option with XP . Once you 've upgraded to XP you are stuck with it unless you chose to format your hard drive and start all over from scratch .
 I have a Compaq Presario laptop with Windows ME . I wanted to upgrade it , so I decided to buy the Windows XP Upgrade . I have another computer that came with XP built in , and I like that system a lot.Well , before I pulled out my credit card at CompUSA , I asked the manager if there are any problems upgrading from Windows ME to Windows XP . I was very specific . `` No problem ! '' he told me , `` It works great ! `` NONSENSE!Here is a list of hardware problems I had after loading Windows XP onto the laptop :1 . My touch pad stopped working .2 . My PCI bus started getting errors .3 . My wireless network card -LRB- D-Link GW-630 -RRB- stopped working.And these are just the things I noticed in the first day of using it!I spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps , uninstalling and re-installing the software , being put on hold , reinstalling drivers , restarting the computer over and over and over and over again . Six extremely frustrating hours!Finally , the tech support people told me to uninstall the software . They said I should return the software to CompUSA.Now for the fun part . CompUSA refused to take it back !!! After an hour arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great , all I got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product . Then the manager said my system must not be compatible . Well , I showed him the `` System Requirements '' on the box , and then I showed him what 's in my laptop . According to the box , my laptop is perfectly compatible.Then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from ME to XP . Well , it says right on the box that the upgrade is designed for systems with Windows 98 , Windows 98 Second Edition , and Windows Millennium Edition . Not only that , but I reminded him that I specifically said I was upgrading from Windows ME !!! I even gave the manager my Microsoft Case Number so he could see for himself the problems I had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me.In the end , I am stuck with software that does not work.Learn from my trials . Do not buy this software if you have Windows ME . Only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system .
 I purchased this upgrade hoping to improve my Windows 98 speed . Instead , it slowed down CONSIDERABLY . For example , it took about 30 seconds to close 1 of 2 open windows . Very aggravating!I took my PC to a repair service and they tell me that XP is only good for Pentium IV processors ; otherwise , Windows 98 is still better . I couldnt agree more !
 Once again I am amazed at the horrible programming and lack of compatability provided by the -LSB- people -RSB- at Microsoft . For a company with the revenue and power to introduce another operating system before they have worked out the kinks , it blows my mind.I purchased a new laptop with Windows Xp as the operating system , and I am lucky to have my computer lock up only twice a day . I am a computer programmer , and I can not understand how 1.5 gig for an operating system would not cover any problem the could occur . Equally as annoying is the error messages that pop up and ask to be emailed to Microsoft.Save your money on this product , they will have to be releasing an new version when they ... work on the problems . *** Be aware ** Most companies warranties will not cover your system if you laod a new operating system on you computer .
 I like to give any significant software package a little time before I purchase or upgrade to it . My hope is , after a few months , the various bug patches will be available to insure that when I get the package I can avoid the majority of headaches that come with it . So I waited until now to upgrade to Windows XP . The setup seemed very impressive as it offer a pain-free upgrade from previous versions of Windows , which assured me that the program menu , desktop items and other personal data would be safely maintained during the upgrade . After the 90 minute upgrade process completed , all of these assurances turned out not to be true . Further , Microsoft 's support for Windows XP was next to nil . While they had a phone number I could call for support , the people did n't seem to have a clue as to what to do with installation issues such as I had , further , I was placed on hold for long period of time as long distance charges accrued , while they touched base with other people who might know . Those people were apparently never found as I cumulatively spent up to 5 hours between brief assurances that they were still looking into it . Finally , I had to do the system footwork myself to find and restore many of my original programs , desktop items , start menu setting , corrupted registry entries , and email accounts/data ; all of which had been misplaced by the install , though fortunately not deleted . The Windows XP upgrade also left me immediately infected with an internet worm which I had to scan for and get cleaned up . The only reason why I 've not given the software 1 star is because once I fixed all of these problems with over ten hours of personal time , Windows XP now seems to be running pretty well . Though I do recommend a third party firewall like Zone Alarm rather than trusting Microsoft 's built in fire wall protection , which seems more like an oxymoron . If you go Windows XP , good luck ! You 'll need it .
 In all honesty , I can not understand why people are buying Windows XP.PRODUCT ACTIVATION ----------------------------------------------- ... Product Activation is not difficult , as some reviewers have pointed out , but I will not submit to being treated like a criminal in my own home having to beg mercy from some corporation to be able to use the product that I BOUGHT . Send a clear message to Microsoft that treating you , the customer , as an assumed criminal is going to lose your business.PRODUCT STABILITY ------------------------------ Windows XP is more stable than Win 95/98/ME . But so is Windows 2000 , without the product activation `` feature '' builtin . If you are tired of system instability associated with Windows 95/98 , upgrade to Windows 2000 . Be forewarned
 After using XP for on week , I have decided to leave MS operating systems altogether . I know the learning curve on the Linux OS will be steep for me but I am willing to deal with that , rather than deal with MS , their bugged software , and their arrogance in taking for granted that all customers will copy their software . I do n't like having to get their permission to add peripherals or to re-install the system . I say it 's time for people to make a thoughtful decision to not depend on MS 's arrogance any longer .
 After installing this piece of work on my computer I was unable to use my HP960C printer and none of the suggestions offered by Microsoft or HP did anything to remedy the situation . I could n't use Outlook Express because the Norton 2003 upgrade I had to install for XP fouled that up . I uninstalled XP and am back to ME . Good news
 Like many others , I installed the Windows XP upgrade and found that half of my software no longer worked . In order to get it to work , I had to spend more money for costly upgrades , such as a forty dollar upgrade to Norton Internet Security and AV . And that was just the beginning . So , instead of spending a quantum amount of cash just for a new look to my desktop , I opted to wipe my hard drive and reinstall Windows ME . BUYER BEWARE ! XP is not worth the time and money !
 I did n't want Windows 2000 . I did n't want ME . I certainly did n't want XP . I swore to my wife that no copy of XP would ever darken my doorstep . But then my computer went south , and I had to buy another , and -- guess what ? -- it came with XP pre-installed . Chalk up another victory for the `` innovators '' and monopoly.After playing the games for awhile , I deleted them . For reasons known only to Microsoft , half my apps stopped working , including my printer driver and IE Internet browser.Because the computer did n't come with the XP CDROM -LRB- they put them all on the hard drive nowadays . Very clever ; if your computer or its hard drive fails , just re-install from the broken hard drive -RRB- . After fighting with the computer vendor for a week , I finally got a system recovery CDROM . This weekend I 'll be wiping the HD and re-installing -LRB- ugh ! -RRB- XP.I 'd go back to 98SE if I could , but then half the hardware wo n't work . See , they 've got you.As far as I 'm concerned , the only value in XP is to Microsoft . Why did removing the games kill my print driver ? I figure , it must be so they can say to the Justice Department , `` See , we _ TOLD _ you it was all in one piece . `` Time was when software was designed from the get-go to be modular . This must be the only time in history where software is deliberately designed to be non-modular , to keep the government at bay -LRB- and thumb a billion noses at it -RRB- . The scary part is , the plan is working .
 I made the mistake of buying and loading XP on one of my machines at home . What a great product -LRB- not !!! -RRB- . No drivers for my video card , my CD burner , my wireless network , my HDTV interface , etc. ; ca n't upgrade my hardware as usual ; get to send M$ all kinds of info about my machine just to use it ; have to buy an separate copy for each of my 5 computers ... and the list goes on and on . Luckily I installed it on my `` test '' machine so when I now have to reformat my hard drive to remove this parasite I wo n't be losing too much . Just my time , money ...
 If computer literacy IQ > 50 , do not `` upgrade '' to XP . It is bad . Nothing is back-compatible and it has no useful features that 98 on up did n't already have . I can think of about a hundred better options , and one of them would be for the whole world to convert to macs . And I 'm an 11 year Windows user .
 My husband and I purchased an XP-equipped HP computer shortly before XP was widely released to the public . At first we were impressed by the smooth , somehow friendlier look that XP offered . Actually , XP worked quite well for some time , although there were several times over the course of the past year and a half where we had to restart the computer due to instability and such , which is frustrating , but expected for a Microsoft product.My main problem with XP is the fact that aesthetically it mimics what Apple has been doing for years , only it does n't have the same stability that Apple has had all along . In order to have proper virus protection , you have to buy third-party virus protection and pay to update it constantly ; with Apple this is never a problem.The main reason we brought a PC into our home was because of the wider variety of programs available for PCs than for Macs . There were several programs my husband and I both wanted to run , but could n't on our iMac . This was not our most wise decision . After a year and a half of relatively smooth sailing , our computer became so bogged down with spyware and adware that we had to reformat our hard drive twice in one week . After that our email never did work right ; every week Netscape would ask us for information , which we would supply , and then it would delete all of our old emails , even the saved messages . We ran virus scans , and there was none , but still it just had no stability whatsoever after that point.Now we have a Mac G4 tower running OS X - Jaguar that works beautifully , just as Mac has been all along . Some people are definitely put off by the higher prices of Macs , but they have none of the problems that Microsoft and XP have to offer and all of the benefits ; Apple has made great strides in recent years to increase compatibility of their machines with PC products . And if you simply must have a PC , go for a Mac and partition the hard drive with a section devoted to Virtual PC 6 instead , and run on Windows 98 if possible ; most programs written now are still compatible with 98 . You may spend more money at first , but the ease of use offered will be far worth it in the long run .
 I do n't seem to have to many problems with XP , until i tried to install my HP desktop 960c printer and my , Hp scanjet 5300c . I had to go to HP 's website just to download the software because the software that comes with the products is not XP verified . I do get serious errors alor on certain websites or playing certain games . I get a midi error and causes the system to shutdown and reboot by itsself . I tried to install XP updates and it crashed my system , changed programs and Word 2002 it changed some of the saved files to unreadable , ended up doing a system restore to get it out . System Restore is suppose to return the system to its last saved state , but it does n't always delete the stuff installed that is screwing up the system . It also restores folders that i had deleted with nothing in them . XP uses alot of ram , i run 512 dd ram on a p4 2 . o it alwasy uses at least 55 % of ram even when i am not using the computer .
 Avoid this upgrade like the plague . I have a PIII/1 GHz machine and upgrading to XP has drastically reduced my performance , particularly with intensive graphics . I 'm going back to Windows ME , so that tells you how bad this product is .
 I really did my homework on this product , but here I am yet again kicking myself for buying another Microsoft upgrade.I manage my own website as well as those of a couple of not-for-profit organizations . In Windows 98/ME I depended on Personal Web Server to be able to test out my modifications locally on my home machine , before uploading the changes to the real web servers . Since I do a lot of coding in ASP -LRB- Active Server Pages -- a * MICROSOFT * technology -RRB- , Microsoft Personal Web Server was the only product I could do this with.Lo and behold , Personal Web Server will not run on Windows XP Home edition , and in fact installing XP simply removed it . You have to buy the Professional edition -LRB- at twice the price -RRB- , which comes with it 's own version of PWS . Nor does Windows XP Home offer an alternative -- web server software will simply not run on this OS.I think MS has made a huge miscalculation here on this one . The news groups over the last week have been full of horrified postings when people discovered they were not longer able to support their websites.Admittedly , this is sort of a single-issue gripe . The interface of XP is lovely , there are a lot of nice new features . But the bottom line is , we need to be able to upgrade our OS in the faith that the important applications we ran without problem under the previous version of the OS will continue to operate , or that some alternative is offered .
 I tried XP Home on a desktop for over a year and it was nothing but headaches . A laptop running XP Pro in the same period , used the same amount of usage had less than a third of the problems . Shell out the additional for XP Pro or do n't waste your money , XP Home is garbage .
 1st , unlike other reviewers I do not like the `` look '' of windows xp at all . It looks like someone turned up the saturation of a bad cartoon . The startmenu pulls up a complicated box instead of the simple list of all the older windows . I liked the list of the older windows .2 nd Constantly asking me for microsoft passport passwords . It makes you miss constantly blue screening in previous windows .3 rd Pop up `` reminders '' are annoying4th various microsoft control measures that many writers have already talked about at length . Why should I call microsoft to ask permission to activate their software ? 5th less keyboard shortcut ability -- minor complaint.I used this operating system on school and work computers to the extent that I know that I do n't want it . Wind 2000 is just fine if you want a modern win os . W 95 , & w 98 are much more flexible if you like dos games . W 98 is getting awful hard to find , though . I do n't know anything about how it compares with Win Me . If choosing between w 2000 and XP , I would pick w 2000 . 2000 was a very stable OS and layed out fine.To say something good , I do like the `` biggerness '' of the icons , etc. . I like seeing things better .
 I just read through many of the reviews that claim XP does n't crash and is rock solid reliable . I did this after having just experienced my 2nd crash today . Well , I 'm stumped because , while XP performs marvelously for routine , -LRB- read
 Do not buy home edition . if you are going to xp to go to professional . many , many programs will not run on home and many do not have fixes out there . Like AUTOCAD ... Roxio.BEWARE ...
 Do n't buy the upgrade if you have a system over 1 year old , I upgraded from my system which is about 2 years old now , I have a Compaq , Compaq does not support my system for Windows XP , my plextor CD rom is also not supported , CD creator is also not support and I have to pay -LRB- price -RRB- for the new software , My Macafee antivirus is also not supported , Every vendor i talked to does not support XP and they want me to buy the new software for XP , You are better off buying a new system , it will cost you about the same .
 After installing XP , I got a number of messages stating that XP was not compatible with a number of applications . For some I had to go to the net to get patches from the manufacturer . Others -LRB- Corel WP office suite 7 -RRB- required that I fork out for an upgrade . Even with the `` compatible '' programs there were continual interuptive messages that something went wrong and that message would be sent to MSFT . I feel that I bought a beta version of something.I uninstalled XP and went back to 98 ... creating more problems.Thanks for nothing , Microsoft !
 I read all the hype about Microsoft XP and being the fair person that I am I gave it a chance . Big mistake . Sure it looks really great but unless you have a brand new computer dont bother upgrading because the system gets slowed down dramatically . My advise leave the dead end Microsoft PC Windows world and buy a Mac .
 It is absolutely remarkable the cheers that a seemingly reliable computer operating system can produce . It 's as if we were led to believe for years that even a modicum of stability and interoperability were too much to ask for . And we were . The government needs no better proof of why a monopoly is bad for consumers than to add up all the crashes , incompatibilities , and lousy performance results that Windows has chocked up over the past twenty years . Pathetic . Those in the know will tell you that Windows has kept a cottage industry of computer technicians and troubleshooters gainfully -LRB- and lucratively -RRB- employed ; to them , it has been the goose that laid the golden egg . A big , fat egg.Now we have XP . It 's only been out a short time , but it seems to be far more stable than its predecessors . It 's about time . It still crashes from time to time and gets buggy when you try to `` plug and play '' various peripherals , but those problems have n't led to system meltdown yet . Thankfully . But we should have had an operating system like this from Microsoft years and years ago . There is nothing technologically innovative or superior about Windows XP . It simply works pretty well and most people should be happier with their computers than they 've ever been . -LRB- Windows 2000 is essentially Windows XP ; I 've heard the same kinds of comments about it
 I still have not found a CD burning package that works without problems and I 've bought several . I feel it was a waste of time and money to upgrade to XP until at least the first service pack arrived . All in all , I should have stayed with Windows 98 . At least the software had matured for that version . I have had far more crashes and problems with the supposedly `` stable '' XP then I ever had with Windows 98 .
 I upgraded to XP from Windows 98 . Thereafter , the system regularly got hung up performing even the simplest of tasks -LRB- did n't know checking email could be so difficult ! -RRB- Like other reviewers have noted with their experiences , a lot of my peripherals did n't work anymore . Becoming increasingly disgruntled with the XP package , I have since gone back to a fresh install of Windows 98 , and am much happier with that . At least it works most of the time . My computer is more than equal to the task of running XP , but XP is nothing but trouble.Also not happy with having to call Microsoft every time I want to change hardware in the machine . I fix computers and like to change parts frequently . Did n't enjoy the once-over I got , for instance , when I upgraded my hard drive . Ridiculous.Why bother upgrading to something that is going to give you a headache ? Latest does n't equal greatest , and this is a perfect example.Rock solid this is not . Better than Millennium Edition but that 's not saying anything .
 I was considering upgrading to XP until I read the horror stories on this site ... I discounted some of the 5 stars reviews after reading a review about it : `` Stopping the fan from making noise '' -LRB- ? -RRB- I am one of the fortunate ones in that I did n't buy the software before I checked the reviews . The bad news for most of you is that it 's money out the window ... hmmmm maybe that 's why it 's called `` Windows '' ... Again thanks to all of you and better luck with Linux -LRB- That 's my next step after 98 if things do n't get better -RRB- ...
 I have used DOS , Win3 .1 , Win95 , Win98 and now this piece of crap OS . Microsoft 's only interest is making money , thats why they come out with a new release of an OS upon a new release of an OS . Each one just as buggy , insecure and unstable as the previous version.Anything coming from Microsoft just plain sucks.I have now switched from InterCrap explorer to Mozilla and from Out-Crash-express to Thunderbird , soon I will completely switch to Linux , a FAR better and FUNCTIONAL OS for a far better price , namely free . My next laptop will be a Mac.Dont waste your money , Microsoft designed software is garbage by definition . And for the person saying he can understand we are not all geeks
 Upgrading to XP has proven excrutiatingly painful . By the time I get used to this version and update all my drivers and programs , the next version will no doubt be released like a new strain of the plague . The law diminshing returns is upon us .
 Let me say that Windows ME was great with backwords compatibility . XP is better right ? WRONG ! This OS is very random on what it will run ! Even on programs that say they work on XP ! The reason ? Mainly because security updates will mess up a lot of them . Also with old programs it wo n't run well in the first place . ALSO even with all the security updates XP is very vulnerable . If you plan to get a new computer and want to use DSL I heard Macs are very good . Also people who use older OSes will have to learn how to do stuff again . Another problem is that XP is a BIG HOG OF RAM ! If you can find one get ME . XP is bad espiaclly for DSL !
 Yeah thats right windows xp home edition and professional was like wow when I saw it , but thats just it . It 's just to look at . When I first saw it i thought wow looks great and looks like it will work great too . Well , I was wrong ! I have had to install windows xp on my computer numerous times and frankly I 'm getting tired of doing so . I swear , I ca n't download a single file cause I 'm afraid it might distablize my computer or have a virus or something . The software is very glitchy , not to mention very unprotected . Even with the `` updates '' it still managed to catch a virus . Instead of windows xp firewall detecting my zone alarm firewall stop it from further destroying my computer . So , in all xp is a joke . I have never had so many problems with viruses , installing , etc. . It is very unreliable , unstable and also a memory hog . I have a p4 computer 2.4 with 512 memory and still it is slow ?!? I think those people at microsoft need to recall this crapware , because thats what it really is , and make a better os ! Right now I am considering on getting either Linux or maybe switch back to 98 or 2000 . At least with those os I know I wo n't have to reinstall everything a couple times a year !
 There are many people that enjoy a game of hearts -- I 'm one.I do n't know how Microsoft let this heart game out.The game plays like the cards are marked , the other players have signals and the dealer is dealing from the bottom of the deck.If Microsoft had any type of quality control , they too , may have asked , `` is n't this rather unfair ? `` I 'm giving it one star because the person that put it together knew there were four suits in the deck , although he forgot it was supposed to be fair .
 After the Millenium debacle I thought maybe Bill and the team would get it right . WRONG ! This version is the pits . It will not recognize so many programs I 'm running it is virtually useless . It offers nothing that I do n't already have . I do n't quite understand how or why Microsoft feels it is the Goliath of the industry and everyone must write to their specs . Even my Norton Utilities is n't recognized by XP nor the program I use to download images from my digital camera . All in all , I ca n't wait to sell it to someone who is a beginner and has no programs which will be in conflict with XP . I think they could have done a much better job writing this but then ... they just do n't care do they ?
 Save yourself the headache and avoid windows XP . It lacks anything that approaches consistency . Sometimes your peripherals will work but generally they will not and if they do it will only be after fork out more money to get a program that might operate on XP . Just because you got it working this morning does not mean that it will function an hour later . THIS OPERATING SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT READY FOR RELEASE . Microsoft is more concerned about its image that its ability . If they had put as much into fixing their errors as they put into graphics and marketing this would be a much better product , one that might be worth buying .
 The CompUSA sales representative who sold me the upgrade told me that upgrading from Windows 98 to XP was a simple upgrade . That statement was not true . Before the computer would even installed it , I recieved three pages of warnings about both hardware and software incompatibilities . Of course the store manager would not give me a refund . He stated that they had sold hundreds of XP upgrades without a single complaint . Since I purchased the upgrade , everyone that I have spoken to about the upgrade from 98 to XP told me not to do it due to the problems that users encounter .
 If you want your computer to run slower , this is the OS for you . It took me three days to install this hog , and it made a mess of my HD , then when I tried to connect to the Net , it crashed at least a dozen times . I just yanked it off my HD and re-installed my old system . When I tried to call MS to complain , I was put in Hold mode for over an hour . Save your money and time - do n't buy this piece of junk .
 Summary : DO NOT BOTHER with XP if you are already running Windows 2000 or other operating system that is running to your satisfaction . If you decide to go for it , you should be comfortable doing things like upgrading the BIOS , and changing settings in the Device Manager.My XP experience : I purchased the Windows XP -LRB- Home Edition -RRB- upgrade for its much-touted stability . The prospect of no more system lock-ups and Windows Blue Screens of Death made it hard to pass up.When I attempted to run the upgrade , XP gave me a message stating that there was a hardware conflict between my motherboard and video card -LRB- I never had a problem with this previously - the video card is an nVidia GeForce2 MX , and the motherboard an Asus P5A -RRB- . This &#65533; blocking issue &#65533; -LRB- XP-speak -RRB- would not allow the OS to install . I won &#65533; t bore you with the details , but after upgrading the motherboard BIOS , and going through it line-by-line trying find the &#65533; hardware conflict &#65533; I still had the same error . Time to get Microsoft support involved.I went to the Microsoft web site to get installation support . First I tried checking the FAQ and Knowledge Database . Any topic that seemed remotely close to my problem just bounced me to a page where I could buy XP compatible stuff . So then I tried to find actual tech support . In order to get into the tech support system , I was forced to sign up for a . net Passport . OK fine &#65533; now that I &#65533; m in the system what I get is a phone number in Washington -LRB- not even toll-free -RRB- . Finally I find an email address & submit my problem . The next day I get a response which tells me to call the long distance number that I saw on the website . Now I &#65533; m really mad ! My next irate email was answered by an actual &#65533; Tech Support Specialist &#65533; &#65533; finally . Well not quite &#65533; turns out tech support was not very technical and I gave up on them after a couple of weeks -LRB- yes weeks &#65533; it was typically 2 days response time from Microsoft , and I did not have time to work on this every day -RRB- . I finally solved the problem myself , with the help of the IT administrator where I work.So , after about 3 weeks I was able to install XP . I gave XP a score of 2 -LRB- rather than 1 -RRB- because once running , I have to admit that my system is much more stable than with Win98 , and I was pleasantly surprised to find that most applications seem to run a little faster . Would I do it all over again ? I doubt it .
 Microsoft has made a great line of operating systems greater , they advertise . They should have put down `` Helpful new bugs to increase your productivity '' on the features list . Microsoft is well-known for its security failures , but Windows XP is the worst . There are critical updates every week in Windows Update , making me wonder about my security . There was an update last week that corrected a problem about a security hole in Internet Explorer . They may keep correcting the bugs , but would n't it be better to make it with no bugs in the first place ? I will be switching to a Mac or Linux .
 I bought the upgrade thinking that they solved their previous bugs and I got disappointed . The way they do away with the crashes is this
 On a recent computer upgrade , I Purchased Windows XP . My ISP , CD burner , printer and scanner needed to have upgrades and patches to allow them to work . -LRB- They still have problems . -RRB- The system looks great and within it 's self works fine , just do n't try to operate something else with it.I 'm going back to `` 98se '' .
 Everything i have tried to install in my new computer -LRB- new DVD drive , new ATI video card , spiderman video game -RRB- says that XP is incompatible and need vendor drivers . Have downloaded drivers only to be told again that they are incompatible . System has crashed innumerable times , had to mail away for recovery discs etc. . All my friends have had similiar experiance . I suspect there is a another MS scandle brewing involving `` who gets to be MS compatible '' so they can keep their monopoly on home computing products . Meanwhile , the consumer is once again disenfranchised . Do n't fall for it - use win98 until they get this garbage fixed .
 I purchased XP as an upgrade to Windows 98 SE and had nothing but trouble in trying to get the bulk of my hardware to work with it . Either the drivers or the software for my Lexmark 5770 printer , Acer flatbed scanner , Viking Components USB Flash Memory Reader , Race Leader Force Feedback Game Controller and Satellite USB Modem all were incompatible with XP . These are all relatively new pieces of hardware , the oldest purchased new about 18 months ago . I was able to get a few of these devices to work with XP -LRB- after a considerable amount of effort -RRB- , but others would not operate at all . My guess is that when all the drivers are made to be compatible with XP that the operating system will work smoothly , but I 'm back to using my previous operating system for now . I wish that Microsoft was more forthcoming with information about the difficulty one may have with hardware and software compatibility before I purchased this operating system . I might not have wasted my money .
 Which is to say , XP is the Titanic . It sinks and it stinks , and all the bells & whistles ca n't cover it over.I bought the upgrade Home edition and overlaid it on a machine running Millennium -- a Dell Celeron . Ostensibly it reformatted my machine to NTFS from FAT32 -- however it preserved my entire collection of useless Millennium files . The first thing I found I had to do was go out and spend -LSB- price -RSB- on a new Roxio CD burner/copier because nobody bothered to mention that the version that came with Millennium would not work with XP -- and so the industry panders to Microsoft and lets them get away with this highway robbery.Since installation in January I 've had to reinstall the system on top of itself twice . It has developed a tendency to crash on any software it dislikes
 P4 1.8 GHz 1GB RAMI am a computer weenie , and have used the following Windows OSs ; NT 4 Workstation , MS Dos 6 , win95b , win98se , and now winXP Home.I have done 9 installs of windows XP Home and read 6 books on the OS , -LRB- and have 3 ordered from Amazon -RRB- , but I ca n't really recommend it.Why?It is too hit and miss . It is neither ` faster nor smarter ' as the ads continually pronounce . Even after disabling the services that should NOT be defaulted on , it is sluggish to the point of distraction . I keep studying and tweaking it for performance , but my other installations are all ` faster , smarter ` It does work , so I give it 2 stars , but frankly I have a tweaked to the gills Win98se installation , and an updated Win NT 4 installation that I still prefer to any of the XP installations I have.I also run Linux , -LRB- Mandrake and Gentoo -RRB- , and all of these are superior to this ` upgrade ' called XP , and I 'm judging them all on the same hardware , with all updates applied.It seems to me a complete patchwork of bloatware . If you have a very fast system its not too bad - but try as I can , I ca n't see any home user needing this.If you are administering a cube farm full of ` users ' , its probably the best system to be administering , but the features that make it good for a corporate network make it fat and slow for a home network.I would like to be able to recommend this OS , but for Home users its just too ponderous for too little reason .
 I have an aquaintance that did beta testing on XP and was very impressed with it . However he states that unlike previous Windows Operating Systems , this product can only be installed on a single system and should you `` upgrade '' the computer in a manner that will require re-installation of Windows XP you will not be able to do so without contacting Microsoft and getting a new `` code '' . Microsoft will determine whether or not you will be able to re-install . If they do not allow you to do so , then you 'll be forced to purchase another copy of XP . Also , this means should you have two systems -LRB- e.g. desktop & laptop -RRB- you will be required to purchase two operating systems . I think this is a big error on Microsoft 's part since most `` home '' users are not the problem in copy protection violations . A two hundred dollar investment for home use seems to be exorbitant .
 XP is one of the worst investments I 've made . It eats up memory badly , frustrating to install , and you have to reformat some of your currently loaded programs , and some of your programs may not even run again . I want '98 back . DEFINITELY NOT MADE FOR LAPTOPS ! Plus , if you want assistance from Microsoft , you have to pay $ ... and it 's hard to get assistance in the first place .
 I just spent 3 days installing ... uninstalling ... and reinstalling this product ... after the first install , my printer , scanner , dsl connection and Logitech camera would not work and I had several software programs that also would not work . I finally have the printer , camera and dsl up and running ... as well as Norton System Works after taking off 2001 and buying 2002 . I strongly recommend you only upgrade if you are having problems with W98 stability -LRB- as I was ... at least one crash a day and most often with MS products ! -RRB- . Best to buy it in new install and add programs you want , being careful that they are XP compatible ... and a lot are not .
 One thing I saw on a tech report on XP was that all the software that comes with it , could be considered a demo . While you don ; t have to pay extra for it , you are only getting a taste of the software . You do n't get the full version . Also I am not going to buy this , because i saw a friend 's computer that had , it , and i do n't think it is worth 200 dollars to upgrad3e my house . My suggestion , Wait a year or two , till they work out any bugs , and then the price will most likely drop a lot . Look at the price of windows 98 when it came out , and a year ago !
 Hopefully this review prompts Amazon to unhide their links to purchasing additional licenses to Windows XP Home Edition Upgrades . I have 4 computers and am faily pissed to find Bill Gates picking my pocket on licenses for each but then when my favorite retailer has no clue how to sell them to me ... . Welcome to the world run by microsoft !!!! NAH they 're not a monopoly !!!!
 I am an average computer user . I understand most of the jargon , and so I tried to install XP myself on my Gateway Profile . I really wish I had not listened to the talk . I upgraded norton Internet Security to 2002 . I tried to install my Amazon supplied XP . I found incompatabilities everywhere . Now I have no Norton Virus Protection . . I found it did not like my Linsys ethernet Card , which connects me through RoadRunner by Time Warner to the internet . Whoever you call -LRB- and Microsoft is really not an option -RRB- , they all want to ` pass the buck ` The only way I have been able to get back to communication is by uninstalling XP . I still have no Norton Internet Security.I know this sounds like ` moaning ' , but frankly , it is not easy with my Gateway system and Time Warner to get any help . When things go wrong , you really need a friend and XP friends are in short supply .
 I 've used XP Home and Pro versions on a brand new 100 % Certified `` Compatible '' state of the art Compaq system and as an upgrade on a one year old Dell Notebook 8000 Inspiron . After 30 years experience in computers dating back to Fortran and including dos , mac , linux and all versions of Windows including NT , I can only say , please be careful about the hype on this one . It looks nice and runs great for a week or two , but when the problems began to set in for me , they have been far more aggravating than ANY of the previous versions , except maybe Windows 3.1 . This operating system does n't work as promised . Even with all new hardware , all new software and all the security and update software installed , this is still just plain awful for serious work.It has a pretty interface and a few things go smoothly , but in my experience , things suddenly go wrong , now with no warning . After using XP for nearly three months , I 've had totally unexplained freezes , crashes , and applications that stop working and though not as frequent as in Win 98 and 95 , they are now much more severe and there seems to be no way to troubleshoot them -LRB- ie the elementary troubleshooters , support sites , and supposed `` error reporting '' functions are totally useless and end up wasting even up more of your time -RRB- . The fact that it was actually easier to get a handle on Windows errors and track them in earlier Windows versions leads me to believe that XP is truly the most flawed Windows yet . Now , the errors get `` swept under the rug '' ; for instance , your computer will look fine , shut down and start up but then an application is gone forever until you do a complete reload of the operating system and utilities -LRB- I 've had to do this now for the dvd drive , cd drive , cd-r program , networking , backup , system utilities ... even the touted Windows System Restore and more ... these programs just stop working anymore and you do n't know it until you try to use them ! Then it is too far past the inciting event to figure out why and you have what amounts to a more time consuming and expensive crash than you ever had with Windows 98 ... -LRB- I 've done 8-10 complete system restores now , each taking a minimum of 8 hours to get back to where I was , only to have to do it again a week or two later - no I am not kidding -RRB- . So if this is how well XP works with all `` compatible '' hardware and software on a new system `` Built For XP '' , I can only imagine how truly miserable it will be for someone with slightly older stuff . Though I have to say that the upgrade on the year old Dell notebook has actually been quite a bit better -LRB- but not good -RRB- than the new `` Designed For XP System '' . Then add on to all this that -LRB- 1 -RRB- it is a system hog -LRB- with 512k of ram it is far and away the slowest I 've ever used at say , printing an envelope or opening a word document -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- It is very very expensive , because no matter what system you have , you will have to buy more than what you thought to be able to work in XP -LRB- 3 -RRB- it is intrusive -LRB- 4 -RRB- it forces you more than ever to do everything the Microsoft way -LRB- which would not be so bad if only the stuff would work most of the time but try uninstalling Windows Media Player or Net.passport when you get XP if you do n't like being snooped on or having to use these programs . -RRB- I have nothing personal against Microsoft , but my advice , based on 30 years working with computers , DO NOT BELIEVE the Hype on XP . I ca n't believe that the people who love XP have used it long enough . Unless you have to buy a new computer and have no choice , I would avoid XP as long as possible . Some of the bugs will undoubtedly get fixed and it could be that the flaws are not as deep as they appear to be this early on in the game . But I very much regret the money , the time and the aggravation of going to XP , XP Pro , XP Office and XP Office Pro with so many serious flaws still present ... If you must get this operating system , one tip ... get Norton Ghost and image your drive when you have everything working to a separate partition or cd ` r 's ! I 've started doing this and it has significantly cut down on the time it takes to restore the system . Still it is not anywhere a hundred percent solution , because this system never lets you know there is a problem until you access a failed application - before that point , you may have imaged your disk and unknowingly saved a hundred errors without having any idea that you 've done so .
 after playing with XP , there are two things that really irk me .1 . the amount of ram this thing requires . are the extra bells and whistles really worth it ? why does windows have to become an even bigger ram hog ? 2 . the code thing you have to get from MS. i fear this may be a big mess , especially for people who like to add and fiddle with their machines .
 Unreliable , mediocre , untested , and highly annoying . I have had constant problems running software on XP . Quite often the XP updates make some software stop functioning . Using XP makes me wish I had a Mac . This is an incredibly lighweight software . My pc came with XP ; but if you 're looking to upgrade -- PLEASE DO N'T .
 Let me get this right ... The reason software prices are so high is piracy . So , if the anti-piracy is so great in Windows XP , according to Microsoft , why is the software price does not reflect this ? Come on Microsoft . . Lowering the price will cause more to upgrade , and if your anti-piracy idea is so great , than those people have to buy XP to upgrade also . There is no need to abuse people 's comfort in paying higher price .
 I do a lot of upgrades , and build my own PC 's . XP Pro is one of the best and stable OS 's I have ever used .
 As with all Microsoft Windows products , Win XP Home is overpriced , unreliable , and poorly advertised.It claims to be `` open systems . '' Unfortunately , many computers will ONLY run Windows XP . Therefore buying a computer with Win XP home may limit you when Microsoft makes its newest advancement , or if you choose to tell Microsoft to take long walk off a short pier and move to Linux.Windows XP is overpriced . Linux , for example , is free . OS/2 is also free . Mac OS is only around $ $ . Windows is $ $ . And if you want to network or do anything worth while , you need Win XP Professional -LRB- for businesses -RRB- which costs about $ $ $ more.As with Windows 95 , and 98 , XP is unreliable . It is written poorly , loaded with features , and contains all of Microsoft 's wonderful quality control . One thing I must say about it is that the Blue Screen of Death is gone , but only because Microsoft does n't want to tell you when Windows has screwed up . With Win XP , all it does is lock up ... it refuses to tell you why.Also , WinXP is fundamentally an NT platform . Therefore , it may not work well with DirectX games designed for Windows 9.x . Direct X 8.1 refuses to run on my desktop , and all games that require Direct X versions 7.0 and lower simply refuse to load.But , if you are in bed with Microsoft , as all people are , Windows XP is your best bet . It is more reliable than Windows 95 and 98 -LRB- which is n't saying much . -RRB- I suggest Linux , myself .
 Although I had initially eagerly anticipated receiving and installing Windows XP as an upgrade to Windows ME , I was soon chagrined to learn that this newest version would hinder more than help!I just happened to run an upgrade test prior to installing XP , and the result was five pages of `` blocking issues '' that would prevent the program from operating properly . There were hardware as well as software incompatibilities.The bottom line was , I 'd be a fool to mess up everything that was working fine , just to bump up to XP ! I might add my computer system is only eight months old , a Gateway 1.5 GHz machine with 256 MB of RAM , not exactly ready for the scrap pile.I was very , VERY disappointed that I had spent -LRB- money -RRB- for a program I ca n't even use . I do n't have the time or the money to do all the upgrades that the printout advised , just to run XP.So , just a word to the wise
 OK . XP would get four stars from me , if it were n't for the Activation Code issue . I did n't think Product Activation was bad until I read the fine print . I get 30 days . That 's for the life of the product . If you use 20 days at the start , and in six months you add some hardware , you now only have ten days left -LRB- The clock does not restart -RRB- . Once the 30 days is used XP is disabled every time three things are changed on the computer . Extra RAM and a new processor -LRB- counts as two -RRB- and I need a new code . I do n't think this is going to help the piracy issue , but it looks like it will be a big pain for the rest of us . Stick with Win98 or ME .
 I just bought a Dell Inspiron 8200 pre-installed with Windows XP home edition and it -LSB- is n't very good -RSB- ! the system keeps crashing and the problems are endless . I have another Dell system with Win 2K and boy is it A LOT better ! ... I am actually thinking about uninstalling the XP and installing Win 2K instead !! Also the XP is very demanding on RAM . I have 128MB of RAM and my system keeps running out of RAM and Virtual memory . Despite the fact that I only use IE and Word most of the time . The Win2K PC is not even half the specs of my new laptop but still works faster and smoother !
 Like some of the other posters have said , I feel that this is a good OS ruined by a bad activation scheme . I live in a house with 5 computers . Myself and my sister -LRB- who each have a desktop and a laptop -RRB- , and my folks who have a desktop . In order for us to upgrade to XP -LRB- legally -RRB- , we 'll have to buy 5 copies of Win XP . That 's ridiculous.Cracks are already appearing to circumvent this activation scheme , and I think , ironically , that in its attempt to discourage piracy , Microsoft will usher in a new generation of pirates . I 'm not talking about the hardcore guys who already do it ... I 'm talking about the casual user like my parents who will say `` I 'm not paying for each system 's OS ... how do I get around it . '' And * BOOM * ... they find out how easy it is ... and they never buy software again.Nice work , M$ . Anyway , I will probably purchase a copy ... but I will use it for all 5 of my systems ... hence my rating ... 1 outta 5 ; -RRB-
 XP was supposed to be the time when Microsoft 's home systems -LRB- `` 9x '' -RRB- and business systems -LRB- NT -RRB- came together . Well , they do , sort of.It 's Windows 2000 -LRB- i.e. , Windows NT 5 -RRB- , with even more work done to accommodate the home games and educational programs most often used on Windows 95/98/Me . You can install games made for Windows 95 or 98 , with settings to automatically change configurations for each program -LRB- e.g. to 640x480 256-color display -RRB- . This is a really nice concept , and it sometimes works . -LRB- Works for most old kid-programs tested , but not for all . -RRB- There 's also a lot of gratuitous graphics change in the `` look & feel '' , which is certainly different , but unnecessary , non-functional , and sometimes more coarse than sophisticated . It 's Rad , for young teens.And , of course , you get an update in the linkage to the latest Microsoft technologies , allowing them to deliver content over the web , and run the latest new programs . -LRB- You can also keep up-to-date update other operating systems , like Windows 2000 , without upgrading to Windows XP . -RRB- The worst thing for me is that , at least originally , it was advertised without any mention that the Home edition wo n't work on a home network that includes a Domain . It took a lot of researching to discover this simple fact . XP Home and Pro are the same software , but Microsoft disabled the networking function in the Home version . There 's no upgrade to Pro from Home , if you bought the wrong version . So I 'm stuck.If you have Windows 3.1 or 95 , it 's time for a new operating system -LRB- and perhaps a new computer -RRB- -LRB- NOTE
 While all the lemmings are unwittingly jumping into the sea of mass consumerism , I for one have taken a step back . I have always been a die-hard MS fan , supporting them in all their efforts in the past . As their customer service went from hard copy manuals to 800 numbers to a fee for every call made to tech support , I began to wonder . I began to get upset at having to wait for 30 minutes on my dime because of a bug in MS products . I paid good money for these products , should n't I get good service in return ? I feel like , `` Now that you 've purchased the product , go away '' . Invasion of privacy occurs every day . Perhaps , for some folks this is n't a problem . They do n't mind the constant spam . They do n't mind the phone calls at home on the weekends at odd hours suggesting that they ca n't live without another gadget . XP is another step in this direction . It was bad enough that I had to justify my last purchase of Office 2000 by calling MS when my laptop gave up the ghost -LRB- several times , I might add -RRB- . XP is even more intrusive . XP now wants to know the configuration of my computer in order to use software I purchased ? You 've got to be kidding . XP wants me to register within a period of time or the software ceases to work ? What if your TV or microwave or telephone stopped working because you did n't send in all those registration cards ? Would you continue to support these products ? Do n't think so . This type of strong-arming is unacceptable . Perhaps you remember Lotus ? It was a great product but people hated the copy protection - that 's one main reason people went to Excel . XP scares me into believing that I have to sign up for Passport to access to Internet . XP puts all my personal information in one convenient place ? Why , how much easier for the hacker to access my personal records . Interent Explorer wo n't let me change the default screen , again continuing to bombard me with MS products . Is this true ? Are you aware of how your surfing habits are being recorded through the use of these `` go between '' applications ? XP does not give me the option to record my music in MP3 format . XP continually assaults you with their offerings of their peripheral products - choking off your choices and killing off the competition . With no competition , they can continue to maintain their complacency at the expense of you and me . Democracy ? More like dictatorship . You probably are not aware of the ways your MS programs send out information without your knowledge or permission . For instance , I bought the new MS keyboard the other day . It asked me if I wanted to register . No , I do n't want to register a stinkin ' keyboard . Next thing you know , ZoneAlarm is letting me know that the keyboard as well as Explorer as well as Windows Media are all trying to send information out of my computer without my permission . For what purpose ? Maybe that 's okay with you but not for me . My computer is my computer ! I do not want less choice with expensive products that lull me into believing that they are feature rich . I will never use these `` features '' . Come on now , how many of you regular folks out there use even 30 % of these features ? Why should I spend more money on a dress shirt when I can get a superior product from Lands End for less money ? No , I do n't want commercialism rammed down my throat . No , I do n't want my computer to be reduced to a portal by which companies can come into my house at all hours and assault me with products I do n't want . What am I going to do ? Why , I 'm going over to Linux and Star Office . Excellent products that cost pennies compared to you-know-who . Yes , I 'll still be able to do the things I need to do - browsing , e-mail , word-processing , graphics and spreadsheets . And , would you believe this software still reads and writes MS files too ? So , I wo n't have compatibility issues that initially concerned me . What will I do with the money I save ? Well , I understand that NYC has several worthwhile charities I can contribute to . Strength and Honor I say , and long live competition and capitalism !
 It was only -LRB- ... -RRB- for the software . It was over -LRB- ... -RRB- in other associated emergency help costs . This is my $ 800 tale of woe so you might learn from it.Halfway through the upgrade on my 256MB 1Ghz Windows ME Dell the thing hung . Would n't go forward or backwards . I called Dell . Firstly , as I had n't bought the disk from them they told me I would be on my own from here on out . Secondly after they charged me -LRB- ... -RRB- to `` help '' they reduced my machine to a black screen with a c prompt and with the only option to either lose EVERY file I ever had OR save the files assuming I knew their names ... . via floppy ! So much for their eXPerts . Long story short the heroes at Millenium Technical Solutions in San Francisco -LRB- ask for Frank if you ever get in similar pickle -RRB- had me up and running eXPediently . Now I discover my Epson 1240U scanner does n't have XP drivers so wo n't work , neither does my 3Com Homeconnect webcam or my Roland Midi interface , or my digital camera interface . Oh and the CD burner that Roxio provides does n't work . So I have gone from a competent but somewhat unstable ME to a more stable and prettier but extremely dumb XP . Not exactly the warm embrace from the digital world I had hoped for.The morale of this sad tale is a -RRB- always backup before upgrading an OS . We all know this but rarely do it . I learnt the hard way . b -RRB- be cautious about buying from a non-OEM source if you still have some sort of service agreement c -RRB- If bad goes to worse get expert help and avoid the clowns on the help lines d -RRB- XP will be great when the drivers and bugs are worked out . But for right now its pretty mediocre . Looks like the all new Microsoft is a bit like the old Microsoft - promise big then follow up slowly .
 For the average web surfer XP is a big step up from WinME . If you just wan na surf the net , use Office applications , and do basic things , XP is the only upgrade to consider from Win95 or Win98 . XP Home -LRB- like Win ME -RRB- still lacks basic functionality if you want to do database to website connectivity that was present in 95 and 98 . For that you have to go to XP Pro . You can work around it in XP Home , but should n't have to . Salespeople do n't seem to know this , so tread carefully when buying an OS if you are looking for this functionality.An upgrade to XP may send you on a time consuming , frustrating , chase to upgrade your hardware drivers and software programs . You may find that you have to shell out $ $ $ just to keep the same programs working before and after the upgrade . I bought a system from Gateway , which came with an upgrade to XP . With the upgrade installed , the CD creator software that came with the machine does n't work and an upgrade is almost $ 100.00 . There are other things like a relatively new scanner that still does not work yet.The interface is different from previous versions , and makes you feel like you are in the middle of Super Mario Land.XP Home is more stable than previous versions , but it may require a bigger $ $ $ outlay for other things to keep it all working.Bottom line in this case was another $ 200.00 spent on XP PRO to get what I needed . Anyone want to play Monopoly ?
 Although Microsoft does n't say so , most older software will not run under Windows XP , including their own Office 97 . If you want to upgrade to XP , better plan on replacing all your older software as well .
 We got our hands on a WinXP Pro demo.The interface is nice , albeit a poor imitation of the OS X desktop . It feels like MS designed this for computer newbies but has made it more difficult for people who already know they 're way around . The menus have also become so cluttered in the process.Power users would probably turn off the Luna interface after the initial novelty wears off to make it really efficient for work . In which case , it offers no significant upgrade to Windows 2000 uers .
 Installing this upgrade cost me about $ 500 because it caused my hard drive to crash , so I had to replace it and pay a professional to recover my data.In general , if you need to run Windows XP I would strongly recommend getting the Full version and reinstalling all your software because the upgrade causes serious problems .
 i use my computer for mostly games and also for typeing college papers . i dont know all of the techinical details about the product so i am gon na keep it simple . for the most part there is a big improvement from the privious versions . but i own about 50 or more PC games and when i upgraded , about all of them are n't compatible ! 50 games is alot of money when your a college student ! now all of my games are useless . when microsoft came out with the windows 98 upgrade all of my windows 95 games worked great . now they are useless . besides the fact of games and other programs not being compatible with it , it is a very nice program . If you are not a gamer this is highly recomended . If you are a gamer stick with windows 98 , and/or windows ME .
 This is the second-to-worst operating system I 've used . It 's almost worse than Mac OS 9 . Anyway , this does n't really have many pros or cons . Sometimes you really like the operating system , and sometimes you want to throw your computer out the window . Microsoft really messed up.Pros : - The computer will tell you when updates are avaible-Most games are compatible-Good amount of card games to playCons : - Does n't work well with wireless internet-Freezes frquently-WordPerfect can drive you insane-Takes a while to start up-Saving pages on the internet does n't workOverall , Windows XP is n't very good . You 're better off with Windows 2000 .
 ALright I Have Always Been a Fan Of Microsoft And There ProductsI Have Two Computers One Is Running Windows ME The Other One Windows 98 now i tried to install windows xp on my computer that is running windows me and it threw up all kinds of errors like cab file errors all kinds of errors blue windows after i finally got it to install it ran real slow and crashed all the time my computer is a 700mgh 128mb ram computer ok it should n't have been slow after a few days im back running windows me and a few days later i tried to install it on my computer with windows 98 and the same thing happened
 Well Micro $ oft is trying to con us again.Most objective experts state there is no need to upgrade from Win98/95 to XP . In other words it offers no real advantage . While I am no fan of Microsoft , Win98 is ok and hardly ever gives me problems . Therefore I will go with the OBJECTIVE experts and when I upgrade my PIII I will get it preconfigured with XP until then well WIN98 will be just fine.PS . I dont know one person who has upgraded yet . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 Can you imagine buying a CD for your stereo , and then finding out that when you want to use it in your car you have to call the company for permission ? Only to have them inform you that for your car you 'll have to buy an entirely new CD?This is XP . After you pay good money and get the thing , you still have to ask Micrs `` can I use it please ? '' and if u ask too often , they 'll tell you to fork over more cash . It 's an insult - not only geared tword computer rookie 's wowed by good looking useless things , it prohibits the experienced from constantly upgrading , and handcuffs users with it 's copyright protection nonsense.This one 's right out of the Monte Burns school of software . I can hear BGates now ... Excellant !

 I have to say I am very disappointed with Windows XP . I have not have had as many problems with an operating system as I have with XP . If XP thinks there is going to be a problem , the system goes Blue Screen and restarts the computer . I have been trying XP since it first came out , and have not been having any luck with it.Half of my programs will not work with XP , if you play any games , do n't even bother getting XP . you will be lucky if it even will load up . When it does load up and you start getting into the game , it Blue Screens and restarts again.I have been trying and trying , I now uninstalled XP and went back to 98 Second Edition . I was just as disappointed with ME , but that at least did not crash anywhere near as much as XP . I would suggest either staying with 98 SE or go with 2000 PRO . I have 4 computers and I will stay with my Win2K PRO and 98SE . Until they come out with XP Second Edition , save yourself a lot of time and headache and do n't bother with XP
 Simply put , this program is NOT as advertised . This is NOT one of those programs where you just load it , and it works , &#34; automatically &#34; . No , in order to use this software , your computer MUST be plugged into the internet.The software will NOT even load , until it verifies an internet connection . I know , I TRIED loading this O.S. about 20 times , before I stumbled upon the section , where it says &#34; Check for internet connection &#34; . When I ckecked this , knowing I had no connection , the program told me it would NOT load , until I HAD a connection.I swear to GOD this is true . I am NO computer geek , but , with GOD as my witness , my computer said this program would NOT load until I was internet connected .
 I recently bought this upgrade for my home computer , loaded it up , got the other upgrades I needed for the dvd player and burner , scanner another 100 or so dollars . Then today I decide to put it on my daughters computer but I find out that you can only use it on one computer , I called Microsoft and they actually want you to BUY another XP upgrade , I was livid , lots of screaming but to no avail , so needless to say my daughter is still using ME editon . I refuse to give Gates another dime.HE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED MY NEXT COMPUTER WILL BE AN APPLE
 Hi : Disgusted with my recent experience with running MS Combat Flight Simulator 3 , I hoped to improve my experience with an `` UPGRADE '' . I wrongly imagined that Microsoft had seen the light and improved it 's attitude toward the -LRB- `` customer '' -RRB- ... offering a real product for a change , I know ... it was silly of me.My first step was to read customer reviews , my next step is to forget it.Recently , I wrote a customer review in which I stated that after many years of experience with Windows I have learned to distrust MS ; I repair that statement here by stating that MS has taught me to distrust them.Hard work is noble , unless that hard work is against the customer then it is not noble.The customer in this computer industry is called a `` USER '' , I believe it would be more honest to call him/her the used.Disgruntled , but sincere.John King AKA jhnkij@AOL.com
 Try before you buy Is what I say . . I have windows ME , but wont be upgrading for a long time I think well unless the next upgrade is better than this one.My parents have XP on theirs and it is terrible!come on Microsoft , are you really that desperate for MORE money ??
 Although the hype-up that Microsoft has given its operating system windows xp was huge , I think windows ME has so much more to offer.For one thing , XP is a control freak - by this I mean it will not let you install drivers for example if they have not been approved by MICROSOFT QUALITY STANDARDS . ... the drivers I tried to install came with the hardware !! I have found XP to be prone to crashes , and being a moderately experienced computer programmer and security expert , I have found many many flaws in its user interface.If you want a top-quality product , choose windows ME .
 When I first heard of Windows XP , I assumed it would be a memory hog , and I was right . Most of my software programs that I had installed before XP run unusually slow . I have to constantly restart my PC . XP has high graphic expectations also . About the only good things that come with XP are the new desktop themes , and some cool features . I would also not recommend this PC to all you gamers and big-time memory users out there .
 I purchased this upgrade hoping to improve my Windows 98 speed . Instead , it slowed down CONSIDERABLY . For example , it took about 30 seconds to close 1 of 2 open windows . Very aggravating!I took my PC to a repair service and they tell me that XP is only good for Pentium IV processors ; otherwise , Windows 98 is still better . I couldnt agree more !
 there 's the annoyance ... apart from that a good OS ... never crashes , rarely gets unstable . New media player does n't like MP3 's downloaded from the web -LRB- a piracy measure it seems -RRB- ... Okay for home use ... absolutely useless in a workplace.Suggestion
 Microsoft Windows XP does n't offer a significant increase in value over it 's predecessors . It is somewhat more stable , yes , but the trouble you will have to go to to `` upgrade '' is not worth it . The need for above-average computing power means that only people with relatively new machines -LRB- no more an about a year and a half old -RRB- will be able to really use it . As well , the fact that you need to re-register with microsoft every time you make a little change in your hardware configuration is a rediculous problem.All in all , unless you have a new machine , have the time to waste going through Microsoft 's upgrade procedure , and enjoy having to jump through hoops to let Microsoft know when you change your computer 's hardware configuration , avoid this `` new '' operating system .
 Possibly the worst Microsoft OS since Windows 3.1 -LRB- and that 's saying something -RRB- . Here are some of the problems I 've had : * terrible backwards compatibility . A lot of the software I have wo n't load using Windows XP . * Hardware driver problems -- XP could n't handle my HP Deskjet without some serious effort on my part . * incredibly annoying pop-up windows . There seems to be an inexhaustable supply of these things until you figure out how to turn them off . * if you 're connected to the internet via a LAN expect to be constantly bugged by your computer connecting to things you do n't want , did n't ask for and do n't need . * the -LRB- lack of -RRB- privacy features are appalling . I find the uninvited nosiness of Microsoft jaw droppingly sneaky . It 's Bibg Brother creepy . * the new design is like something from fischer-price . I guess this is more of personal taste issue , but I much preferred the Windows 2000/NT set up . * very pushy about trying to get you adopt certain software packages as your defaults -LRB- all Microsoft , of course -RRB- . Those who are n't computer savvy may could easily get hoodwinked and end up with something they did n't really want , or at least never consider -LRB- often better -RRB- alternatives.I could go on and on . Bottom line -- if you have Windows 2000/NT -LRB- heck , even 95 or 98 -RRB- -- do n't upgrade to this . XP was the final straw for me -- I use 2000 at work and loaded Linux at home . I 'm much , much , much happier with the latter than with XP .
 Since buying the upgrade of windows XP i have had to reinstallit 3 times - onto a clean hard disk - The first time it just disappeared and turned into a blue screen , with messages that hive files were gone missing ? 2nd time round the registery gotcorrupted and the last time it refused to boot , and not wantingto have to trall through another install i used the XP CD to try the recovery consol . This was as much use as a cigarettelighter on a motor bike . None of the commands worked , and even trying the help file was useless . There seems to be a seriousproblem with system restore in XP , and im fully updated with all the latest SPacks , and stacks of space on my hard disk alotted to SR ! Check dates will disappear and when you really need ST to get you back and running - it goes pear shaped ! I now running 3 restored version of XP completly backed up on a seperate hard disk using Power Quests Drive image.My experences with XP are ITS NOT RELIABLE . .
 I upgraded to XP and had the same problems that everyone else did with hardware . I totally lost my modem and had to uninstall every time I wanted to connect to the Microsoft site to get help on upgrading from Windows ME . Luckily I bought XP at Home Depot and they let me return the opened box without a question . I spent two days on the phone with Microsoft and on all of hardware vendor internet sites looking for help.After much frustration , I decided it was not worth the trouble . One note of CAUTION ! Since I had uninstalled and re-installed so many programs to try to get things working , I was glad to have the RESTORE utility on ME so I could return to my previous configurations . I was shocked to find that XP had erased all of my RESTORE dates . Be careful what you do to your old OS because if you go back to it , you may have to spend some time trying to get it back to what you had before the upgrade .
 As an owner of XP I can say that this is hands-down the worst OS ever . I think Unix is easier to use . But that is not all that is wrong . Microsoft has decided to punish us because we ca n't afford their insane -LRB- and asanine -RRB- liscense . Tip to Microsoft
 Microsoft 's Windows XP -LRB- Home -RRB- is a grotesque redefinition of `` bloatware '' , requiring 128 MB of memory to run , and almost 1 GB of disk space to install . -LRB- And , by the way , that space needs to be on the C
 I bought Windows XP thinking good-for-me . Then , I had to buy a new monitor and printer due to `` incompatibility . '' The woes did n't whoa there
 This operating system is without a doubt , the biggest piece of junk Bill Gates has produced yet . I am writing from a remote terminal as I was forced to reformat my hard drive after installing XP , and having to remove it to reinstall Windows 98 . XP will not allow you to open non-MS applications , saying you , as administrator , are not authorized to use it . This is legal , licensed software , that I paid good money for and Bill Gates prevents me from using it because its non-MS . The desktops are lousy , and not centered . The help files in XP are anything but helpful . I was for Bill Gates in his antitrust suit , but now I will foreward my complaints about XP to the Federal Trade Commission , and ask ... for a full refund .
 I have loaded this junk several times on a new Intel 1.6 pentium 4 board with a brand new hard drive . It only reboots with the original installation . Download Windows upgrade and it fails to reboot . Norton 2002 Suite installs and then XP fails the reboot . What 's wrong with this picture ? -LRB- ... -RRB- It has n't been this bad sice the upgrade from DOS 5 to 6 . Maybe I should have gone Apple .
 First and foremost , stay away from this product , because if you are like most of the other people considering XP , you are doing so because you have already plunked down good money on an earlier Microsoft OS that is n't meeting your expectations -- thus your search for an upgrade . With windows XP , this kind of activity -LRB- which I admittedly just went through -RRB- , gives new and poigant meaning to the phrase
 If you want to crash your system , lose all saved emails , lose all saved Word documents , lose your ability to print , and garble all photographs on your PC , including your screen saver , install the Windows XP Home Edition Upgrade . This was my experience when I attempted to install the XP upgrade . Motivated to purchase XP by Microsoft 's statement that the company would no longer support Windows 98 , I ordered the CD for the Windows XP Upgrade . Although with extensive assistance from Microsoft reps I have been able to recover my saved emails and Word documents , I can print nothing . My Heidi Klum screen saver now looks like an Andy Warhol painting . All photographs are now garbled . If I had it to do over , I 'd stick with Windows 98 .
 After installing it , I discovered that there are no compatible drivers for my printer and for my video card . So now I 'm stuck with a computer running a brand new OS that only lets me view the screen in 640x480 and 16 colors.What a disaster !
 XP Home does n't support IIS or PWS . Anyone wants to play with ASP/ASP . NET needs to pay extra $ $ to upgrade to XP Pro . This `` minor '' missing information from XP Home and Pro feature matrix give me the wrong impression that XP is a superset of W2K ... WRONG !!! -LRB- ... -RRB-
 XP is a solid step forward but I feel the need to inform people of something I 'm already coming across . If you do not have internet then XP is not for you . While you can dial the 1-800 number to activate xp , it is troublesome . I have in actualiy lived in places that do not have regular phone service , and in a location like that I could not load XP ! Now I realize i 'm a minority in the Big Money Game -LRB- tm -RRB- but it irks me as a computer tech to have YET ANOTHER THING TO FIX FROM MICROSOFT !
 I ordered the XP home edition upgrade thinking that it would solve some of the system lockup problem -LRB- s -RRB- I was experencing , it only created additional problems . I loaded XP on my SONY PCG-FX215 notebook only to find that , at the end of the 72 min . install , it could n't find the Conexant-Ambit SoftK56 Data , Fax Modem that came preinstalled in the notebook . It 's frustrating to think that the only way I can use XP is to install an NEW modem . The notebook itself is only months old ... I wish I could rate this product lower than 1 star .
 I upgraded to Windows XP after hearing the marketing hype that this OS was faster -LRB- increases your computer 's efficiency by 40 % ? -RRB- , less prone to error and random crashing , and had exciting enhancements like slideshows for My Images and a new & improved windows media player.I upgraded expecting to be impressed , and thus far , have been nothing but disappointed . * Half my hardware does n't work now because it is n't compatible with XP * If anything , I think XP has slowed down my system 's performance * I seem to get just as many errors as with 98AND * The UI has been over-simplified . Little contextual help bubbles pop up seemingly randomly , and -LRB- as of yet -RRB- I have n't been able to turn them off . One of these ` help ' windows always appears on the start menu , BLOCKING the link to log off.The slide show functionality is cool , but not worth the loss of my DVD player performance -LRB- for some reason , now that I 've upgraded I ca n't watch DVDs because quality is so poor , even though I was forced to purchase a -LRB- dollar amount -RRB- decoder just to make my player work with XP !! -RRB-
 Microsoft Windows Xp gives you so many new ways to use your computer . Some of the features are simply mindblowing . I like the crisp clean icons , The the unbeatable picture quality , And not to mention that cute search puppy . `` I love that little fellow '' . But the flaws in this operating system make you wonder . Are all of these usless features worth it ? It is not just the colors or the little Pup , Or maybe the so called crash proof operating system .90 % of my games do not work with XP . The other 10 % of them have video conflicts . People tell me to just upgrade these Hardware drivers . I should not have to . If Microsoft would pull their heads out of their ... and take their time to master the operating system before they release it maybe we would not have to.I have never seen a single piece of software or hardware that would not work with 95,98 , and ME . Xp tells you from the get go during installation that this and that has not been tested yet . Is it not their job to master the os before selling it to the public ? Thats like selling me a half cooked hamburger.I must say that nothing upsets me more than the Activate Windows deal . You are only allowed to install the operating system like three times or so . After that it will not let you activate windows anymore and your OS stops working after a waiting period of 30 days . Hell you bought the damn product with your hard earned money and you have a defective product after three installations or so . You then have to call microsoft and request a new product key . I had to . They did nothing but cram the licence agreement thing down my throat but they gave me a new key code after yelling at them.My advice to everyone is do n't waste your money . Go buy your wife a new ring or something and call it a day .
 If you play computer games like me , do n't get this operating system . This new Microsoft OS causes a lot of bugs to a bunch of old PC games and `` addons '' and `` mods '' that gamers make for their PC games . Maybe it 's because some PC games are old and Windows XP is new . But stick with an older OS like Windows 98 if you intend to use your computer for PC games only . I never had any problems with some of my PC games in my old computer , which had Windows 98 . Now I do with Windows XP when I bought a new computer .
 I did not believe the previous reviews and tried the XP Upgrade myself . The Hardware and Software issues between XP and Compaq can not be resolved without purchasing new hardware . If you really want to have XP , save yourself a lot of wasted time and money and buy an entire new system with XP already installed . Now I am faced with having to go back and re-install my existing hardware , software and drivers that I un-installed for XP . My best advice -LRB- IF you have a HIGH speed inter-net connection -RRB- is prior to buying XP go into Micrsoft 's site and download `` Upgrade Advisor '' . If Advisor shows Software and Hardware conflicts do n't try to upgrade unless you have a lot of time on your hands to obtain new drivers and possibly have to replace hardware .
 This is the worst windows program so far . What they do n't say is that it wo n't support many scanners -LRB- TWAIN -RRB- , other hardware and software . All in one print/scan/copy etc. units only partly work and the manufactures will not offer software upgrades . In order to not replace my equipment , I had to revert back to Windows 98 . It seems almost like a scheme on the part of Microsoft to disble outside drivers like TWAIN making the systems obsolete . It looks cool , but having to do patches on most programs is a waste of time and money .
 The registration factor : The thing in Windows XP that you should take into consideration is the registration factor . In an attempt to make piracy more difficult , Microsoft has instituted a new registration policy calledMicrosoft Product Activation , which will only allow you to install Windows XP on one system at a time . Uunder this new policy , you must use the CD Key code that comes with the software to install the operating system . You 'll then have 30 days in which to contact Microsoft , either via the Internet or by telephone , and activate the software.When you do , you wo n't have to give Microsoft any personal information , just your CD Key code . Microsoft will assign you an activation code , which you 'll then enter in the appropriate text box in the Microsoft Product Activation wizard . If you do n't activate the software within the 30-day period , you wo n't be able to boot Windows XP past a dialog box that prompts you to enter activation code.When you enter the activation code , it supposedly analyzes your system 's specific hardware configuration , generates hardware ID code based on this information , and then associates the activation code with this hardware ID code . If for some reason you have to reinstall Windows XP on the same system , you 'll be able to use the same activation code.However , if you purchase an additional system and want to install Windows XP on your new system instead , you 'll need to reactivate the software . While Microsoft says it 's possible to install it on another machine , it 's unclear how exactly this will work under its license agreement . Consumers should refer to the terms of their license agreement to determine whether or not it is legal to transfer a license to another computer . But in those cases where it is allowed , the product must first be removed from the previous computer . Users may be required to complete the activation on the new computer by placing a call to the Microsoft Activation Center.If you only have one PC and rarely reinstall the operating system , this really wo n't be a problem . However , if you have multiple PCs in your home , or you add Hardware later you wo n't be able to buy one copy of Windows XP and install it on all the PCs in your home . Instead , you 'll need to buy one copy for each system . Unbelievable !!!
 I purchased a new dell computer to replace my laptop and of course it came with XP already installed on it . I was open minded and gave it a chance , but ulitmately , I reformated my hard drive and put windows Me back on it . Hopefully this review can help you decide if this if for you or not.-IF YOU HAVE NEVER OWNED A COMPUTER AND YOUR FIRST SYSTEM ALREADY HAD WINDOWS XP ON IT , KEEP IT , THIS IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU . -- here is why , this is a great operating system when all the drivers are compatible with it . Of course if your system came with XP on it , all the drivers are pre-installed and thus compatible . -- for those not on the technical side , your computer will be more reliable with XP on it because it does n't crash nearly as often as 98 or ME . -- it is pretty user friendly in that it does n't require that you have to read a huge book to learn how to use it . The tutorial in the begginning is sufficient enough to get you started and the overall use of the system is not complex.-IF YOU HAD A PREVIOUS COMPUTER AND WANT TO UPGRADE TO XP AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF WINDOWS IS BASIC , STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS XP . -- here is why , if you are upgrading your computer , you 'll find that a lot of your stuff that worked fine with 98 or me will not work with windows XP . You 'll have to download those drivers from the internet and if your modem is not working with XP , your -LSB- messed up -RSB- because there is no way you 'll be able to get onto the internet to download your drivers , unless you have a second computer and a way to transfer files from each other . -- overall it can get very complicated and fustrating to get everything to work the way it did when you had 98 or ME so it requires a fair amount of advanced knowledge to get things to work right . So unless you are comfortable with some advanced trouble shooting , stay away.-IF YOU ARE WINDOWS SAVY , HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE , STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS XP . -- here is why , the control you have over XP is very little compared to that of 98 or ME . The whole program is like an airplane that is always on auto pilot that ca n't be turned off . -- I for one was frustrated with that because I like to have total control over my OS and be able to disable programs , etc that I do n't want running or options that I do n't need which take up a lot of memory . With XP there is very little control over that . If you try to go to system configuration and look for the start-up tab to disable programs that load on startup , it 's not there , for some reason XP does not give you the option to disable those programs loading on startup . If you push ctrl-alt-del and disable them from there , once you restart windows , you 'll have to do it again . -- Be prepared to have some of your favorite programs or games to not work correctly with XP , I 'm sure enough has been said about that with other reviews . -- Expect some of the new drivers you do download to not fully work , ie . for example I downloaded an XP driver for my scanner 's make and model from their site , XP recognized my scanner and I the diagnostic on it was successful , but my a couple of my art applications did not recognize it . -- many things are forced on you . XP will force you to use that dumb little MSN messenger , which starts up everytime you log onto XP . You ca n't easily disable it unless you get into the regedit , but good luck . -- lastly is the activation protection , which you must do within 30 days or you can no longer user it . This is the worst feature about XP because if you are like me who is consistantly upgrading your computer , it will cause a problem . I reformat my hard drive at least twice a year to clean up old junk , with XP everytime you do , you 'll have to re-activate XP by calling microsoft or going online . If your computer came with XP on it , you wont have to activate it , but if you make a change to your computer -LRB- ie . hard drive , peripherals -RRB- , you 'll have to then activate XP . Microsoft put this in there so that people could n't pirate XP by swapping hard drive with a computer system that does n't requrie activation and installing XP from there and then swapping back hard drives . XP wont let you , you 'll have to activate XP once you put your hard drive back in because windows will start recognizing different hardware.Overall I gave it a low score based on my personnal experience . I did n't think it offered that much new . Sure it does n't crash nearly as much , but the minute you try install your peripherals , you may run into problems and then XP will start crashing on you . The last straw for me was XP would not work with my RIO mp3 player . I already sacrificed a scanner and webcam not working but no one can take away my music . When I switched back to ME , life was much better because everything was compatible again and I look back at my XP experience as just a horrible nightmare . XP is not break through , most of it consist of improved media -LRB- ie . media player or movie maker -RRB- but those are just programs and can be downloaded from microsoft . The actual inner guts of XP is nothing revolutionary that requires you to consider upgrading . In a year or so , everything will be XP compatible and you most likely will be forced to upgrade but for now , stay away until all the kinks are worked out and reliable drivers become available.-most XP incompatabilities were with USB peripherals , external hard drives , mp3 players and webcams -- XP seemed to do well with many printers though .
 A little slower , a little more buggy and unstable , I 'm surprised it 's still sold when newer versions of the operating system are available .
 My computer at work has windows XP installed on it , and just from navigating around it I am so glad , that I did not waste my money installing it on my home PC.The only good thing about this OS is that its `` pretty '' . It LOOKS a lot better than windows 2000 and other previous versions , and also it seems to load a lot faster than windows 2000 . Which warrants my 2 star rating.The new set up in Windows XP is very cumbersome and sometimes downright confusing . For those of us that are familiar with Win 2K you will find that many things are not in places where we are used to them being . This is a small problem and im sure that I will become comfortable with it . My main gripe is the constant application lock ups in this OS for no apparant reason . For example if you happen to mistype a URL in Internet Explorer , then be prepared to have IE lock up for at least 45 seconds before windows decides to allow you to control IE again . Same goes true for Outlook . Sometimes Outlook will just lock up for no reason and either you have to wait it out , or just do a control-ALT-Delete to end the task which is believe it or not a lot quicker than waiting on windows . Keep in mind my inbox only has 20 messages since I just started my job Monday . Yet it still locks up and crashes for no reason . To add fuel to the fire sometimes applications will just terminate with fatal errors and come up with a message box stating `` sorry for the inconvience '' and an option to send the error report to microsoft . HA ! It looks like Microsoft expected this OS to have a lot of problems -LRB- and that it does -RRB- and are using the customers to find all their bugs for them . I would n't mind doing this for a pay check , but for free ? I do n't think so.I 've only used XP for 4 days and already having a multitude of problems with constant lock ups and crashes . I have n't had the oppurtunity to do software installations on this OS , and frankly I do n't want to , im sure that is also littered with bugs . As much as I hated windows ME , I think I am beginning to hate XP even more.If you have 2000 , then stick with it , do n't waste your money on XP .
 Do not upgrade xp unless your current OS is worse . If it 's not broke - do n't fix it . Never turn off your PC while xp is running - it may never reboot again - always let xp turn itself off . XP reports a failure and suggest you do a repair . The repair does n't work ... you must reinstall all over again . If xp stalls or refuse to respond ... wait ! If it still does n't respond , do a quick reboot - do n't turn off ! Do n't use the administrator Log In while online . Hackers can break in and they will - and take over your PC and steal your passport account info , etc. . The FBI has warned that xp security features do n't work against hackers and they do n't . XP may get rid of past problems but it also bring new problems to bear . XP is marginally better than Win ME ... but it 's not worth the price of ... If you can get windows xp for ... it will be worth the price ... otherwise the world 's richest man only wants to get richer . Windows usually sold for ... and you could get Win ME for ... -LRB- upgrade -RRB- ... so he slaps on a anti-copy activation scheme and charges ... -LRB- ... profit -RRB- for it ... thinking nobody can break the activation , so his ... profit can be a sure thing . As windows xp security features are useless against hackers ... what good is their activation system ? Go figure .
 I 've used every version of Windows up through Windows XP . When XP finally came out , I had to have it . If you have n't gotten it yet ... do n't bother . Get an Apple .
 Do not buy this OS.If you use Windows stick with 98 , 2000 , or ME.XP may look flashy and stable on the outside , but believe me it is not compatibe with 1/3 of my nearly new hardware -LRB- it all works in 2000 and ME -RRB- . It even crashed repeatedly when I installed a brand new harddrive . My new scanner would n't work , ever , and my printer was finiky , my graphics card -LRB- an Nvidia GeForce 2 -RRB- performed much slower ; all after a fresh install . And to top it off , the Remote Desktop feature was born from the Remote Access Security Vulnerablity in Windows 2000 . And here 's something swell , XP actively reports stuff to MS. I am well aware of this since I am smart enough to run a logged firewall . IE was the worst culprit , but since it is practically part of XP , XP users have to live with it.And it would seem as though CD 's burned with XP 's integrated CD burning software sometimes do not work in any other OS besides windows.I also noticed massive compatibility problems with older applications that were written for Windows 95 or 98 . And if you think XP SP1 makes it any better , you 're wrong . Contrary to what MS promised in court , the SP only hides MS 's middleware and leaves IE integrated even if you swap it out.And Windows XP hides almost all of the inner workings of the OS and computer from the user so that most people have no idea how to fix it if something goes seriously wrong . This applies more to sys admins than desktop users , but it is still relivant ; the easier to use an OS is , the more likely a company is to hire unskilled people to administer it , and if something goes horribly wrong they wind up paying a specialist to fix it.Is the higher total cost and frustration really worth it ? Of course it is smoother if you buy it preinstalled on a new computer , but most of my review holds true even then .
 OK , I 've had XP loaded on my machine now for a few days . So Far I really like it . My PC does boot faster , and even though it takes some getting used to I think it is a better OS than the 9x versions . This Operating System is definitely more stable and is also much more easy on the system resources.If you are considering this software I would recomend it assuming you can get over the hurdles I am about to list.Here are the things I really do n't like about this software :1 . Almost nothing I need is compatible . The Installation would not run unless I removed programs that had known compatibility issues , -LRB- ie . All of my antivirus and security software -RRB- Now that I have XP loaded I have two options . I can go back to my Old OS and normalize everything . Or I can Shell out my life savings on new software that is `` XP Approved '' Even Office for XP requires an activation code .2 . This OS is very expensive . Once activated you can still upgrade your computer to some degree without having to reactivate . -LRB- by a new copy and activation code -RRB- But for this Price ? You 've got to be kidding me ! Software this expensive should give a user unlimited use allowing installation on as many machines as are in his or her household without extra cost . Of Course some households qualify for a multi user discount , but from what I hear it 's a pretty skimpy discount .3 . Good Wizards and Bad Wizards . Yes , like a good Tolkein novel there are Good Wizards and Bad Wizards , and MS typically has bad ones . When you run the wizards they will do all the work for you , which is good for some people , But I want to know why some things are done the way they are done . The Windows XP Wizards make assumptions that they should not make . If you really know what you are doing , it wo n't be too difficult to figure out why your network suddenly does n't work when you enable the ICF -LRB- Internet Connection Firewall -RRB- feature.Basically this is going to be a very big money pit to any one who decides to upgrade . In an understandable effort to prevent/thwart Piracy , the Software company has taken measures to make sure that everyone has to buy their own copy as well as the upgrades or newer versions of the most commonly used programs in those machines.All in all I am not displeased with the new operating system , But I do not recommend it . It offers flexibility on our desktops but is very inflexible as a continued expenditure . If you buy it you will Pay much more than what the Operating system itself cost.Good luck in your endeavors !
 Your privacy and wallet does not matter to Microsoft . To top it all off , you must completely relearn Windows . Do n't ever buy this sorry product , and Microsoft will learn not to redesign their OS every 2 years .
 Do n't waste your money on this one . You 'll have to spend hours downloading all new drivers for everything attached to your computer . Like your printer , scanner , and everything else.And windows XP does n't offer anything to make it worth the hassle .
 Welll I received xp pro as a gift . Problem was they purchased the full version not the upgrade . After reading all the negative reviews and what not I decided let me ask microsoft if using the full version would cause bugs . It 's labeled for new puters only right ? Well they would be more than happy to answer my question ... unless I register it first.So I need to give them the product number and lose any chance I might have on a refund or pay ... to answer that question . Can I use the full version . Because my manufacturer has posted one thing and Microsoft another . Not even going to play the tag game with microsoft nor will I pay ... for the answer . I will send it back to my friend thank her for the gift and explain the option I had and why . It 's embarassing for me and the person giving the gift . But at least I know not to invest any large amount of money into microsft software if it 's not already on the puter I bought . do n't waste your money I have seen nothing but negative reviews every where .
 I BIN LOOKING TO GET WIN XP PRO AN YOUR PRICE IS AT LEAST 50 TO A 100 DOLLARS HIGHER THAN WHAT I < VE SEEN
 I purchased a package for window xp in may this year and just got a computer on which I wanted to use it . On Thursday Nov. 25 , we wanted install it but the boot disk # 4 was observed to be problematic and thus the whole installation was not successful.Please advice me.ThanksRev , Ndorleh
 Boy am I sorry to have upgraded to XP . After getting all the drivers and updates for XP ... Microsoft Excel hangs on file opens , the printer gets hung up , various blue screens ... , what a nightmare . You would think with all their brains that they would be able to deliver a consistent , reliable product , but let 's get real . People know that most technology stinks because these companies are more interested in shoveling out -LSB- stuff -RSB- than making their products stable . Give me VAX/VMS any day . Thirty years later and this ...
 Beware my friends of old -LRB- Xp Professional 2002 oem -RRB- copies with fake product keys being sold on Amazon . By the likes of PBJWorld . He lied and claim it was unopened.The key was made by a key generator . They want me to return it to the guy who sold it to me . Mircosoft now has the case . I gave them what they needed to go forward . He want me to return it , to make it disappear , I would guess this to be so . By the way , he refuses to deal with me . Shame on Amazon too , for letting this guy sell bogus software.Buy for only those you know . Amazon will not back you UP ! I for one will not ever shop on Amazon again . Burned by this . Never NEVER AGAIN . They lost me as a customer . Amazon make false statements that they care . They do not . I have told the truth . Pbjworld sold me a copy of Xp Professional that was not what they claimed . It had been opened , used and packaged with a fake key . Beware buyers of this site . Trust only those you know and no site that gets 5 stars from most buyers . No one 's that perfect . Amazon customer service sucks . There is no real support .
 We ordered this rice cooker on September 7 , 2009 . Delivery was to be about September 11 . On that date , we checked the Amazon site and found out that there was something wrong with our payment method . I followed directions , but was told to try again another day . I tried to cancel the order but was told it was being readied for shipment , and could not be cancelled . I kept looking around the site , and found another page that said there was another Undescribed problem . I went to a store and spent $ 45.00 more for one so I can cook rice , which is a staple of my diet . I hope that the situation resolves itself someday , so I can cancel the order , or if necessary , return the order .
 If you have a Hp Pavilion DO NOT UPGRADE to Windows XP will not work . I started the upgrade from 98 to xp and it gets half the way done and says setup can not continue because of controller restarting . So I put windows 98se works fine
 The reasons i bought it was that it supports dual processors and WMP8 . A wrong choice on my part . I can no longer can copy CDs to my harddrive , i get an error message every time i put in a CD . i 've reformatted and reinstalled XP Pro about 3 times so far and within a week WMP acts up again , restarting the computer and not able to copy a CD ... and the peoples at microsoft have not answered my email , and another thing ; what good is that error reporting , i mean it reports the error and then what ... are they -LSB- microsoft -RSB- planning to fix the problem or what ...
 I run a small company . I thought XP PRO would be a boon to our bottom line . What I found is that many legacy software applications failed to work properly with XP Pro . For the systems we upgraded we found you could not uninstall XP and go back to the previous OS . XP changes too much . Each PC or workstation had to be reloaded from scracth . Very time consuming and costly . Because of this , our next major upgrade will be to move away from the Microsoft platform . Most likely Linux Redhat or Unix .
 I just switched to XP Professional at work and have been rather disappointed . There appear to be numerous bugs . Several of my programs do n't run correctly -- even in the highly-touted compatibility mode . The weird structure makes accessing the desktop confusing and further buries some functions -LRB- sometimes you still need DOS , something they like to ignore -RRB- . The security enhancements have been really annoying -- plus they ca n't be that secure due to the numerous security upgrades they keep issuing . Fortunately , I did n't have to pay for my upgrade , but I 've be upset if I had .
 If you run : Adaptec EZ CD CreatorSymantec PC AnywhereYahoo Messenger -LRB- I know , not a big big deal -RRB- Then I 'd highly reccommend not going to XP until SP1.Too many hassles.I gave it a shot -LRB- TWICE -RRB- but its compatibility is very suspect.Back to Windows 2000 . You would think they would have software compaitibility worked out . Especially with EZ CD Creator .
 Windows XP works quite well , it represents a considerable improvement in stability over Windows ME . The new look is visually pleasing though a little childish looking . However , it has two large drawbacks
 I have Windows 2000 Professional and I love it . I 've only ran into 1 out of over 200 -LRB- ! -RRB- software applications/games made for Windows 98 that would n't work on it . I do n't know how many times I 've read on the net that something for Win 98 wo n't work on XP that works fine on my Win 2K machine . XP stability ? Got it already . Good graphics ? Run the same game or whatever on the same machine with Win XP and then Win 2K or even 98 and you wo n't be able to tell the difference in the graphics . Plus I wo n't have to beg M$ for permission to use their OS on my computer if I need to reinstall it.So do yourself a favor and buy a copy of Windows 2000 here on Amazon.com or ebay , spend less and not have to hope Microsoft does n't cheat you out of it like they have so many others when it came to re-activating XP .
 Consider Windows 2000 Pro . Stable , can use computer resources quite well . Add tons of bug fixes that come ready out of the box . Also add some new -LRB- mostly multimedia related -RRB- features and compatibility layers for Windows 98 and such . Your computer will most likely work really nicely with this software , even the old DOS games are rumored to work very nicely . Betas have been out for a while and they feel nice indeed.Windows XP series would get 5 stars straight if they did n't have couple very huge drawbacks
 XP Pro is just Win2k with a pretty GUI ! Thats it ! My school got it the other day . It 's not worth the money . Just look at the version number . its 5.1 . win2k is 5.0 ! Plus , -LRB- opinion -RRB- I find the `` Did you buy a pirated product '' notice annoying .
 Do not buy unless you have a PC with at least 600 MHz it slows down the computer to a great extend . Remember that none of the offers tells you that you can not use it on your PC and Laptop . You have to uninstall it before you can use it on the second Computer and than can not use the other computer untill you uninstalled it from the one you use . At the price a typical Microsoft system to rip you off.The program has a life off it 's own and decides in the middle of your using the computer that you should be doing something it thinks is usefull and keeps on interupting your thoughts.I have uninstalled it and find that WS 2000 is a much more usefull version . One day when MS has decided that after you pay for as program you can make your own decisions when and how to operate your computer it may be usefull to have the new features available.Almost none of the older hardware is compatable even with upgrades and those that can be upgraded dont work well with xp
 I recently go this XP Pro deal and I have to say one thing , AWFUL ! The only reason why I did n't give this 1 star is because of it 's new sleek design , other than that , it 's terrible . Half of the stuff I used to be able to run on Windows 98 SE does n't run with XP Pro . I have tried reinstalling , everything , no matter , it wo n't work . I get very angry with this ... now I can see why some people are so objective towards XP ! If you want a good OS , get 2000 ... XP is awful .
 I 'd personally would rather have Windows 98 on my computer than Windows XP . Windows XP is extremely easy for hackers to break in , unlike the other Windows . XP also has a firewall that does n't able me to have chats with people on programs like AIM , voice chats . If you are going to network the internet , do n't try , get someone to od it because the firewall once again ! Windows XP has alot of problems . Although you can get a patch to try to protect your computer from hackers at Microsoft.com . The only thing I thought was cool about XP , is it allready has a cd burning utility on it sao you may burn without having to download a program , unless your burning a game with a CD-KEY .
 I 'm sorry that I bought this item and ca n't wait to get rid of it . I was hoping this would be something like Windows 2000 but without the bugs . Instead I got a Windows 98 with prettier desktop backgrounds and more games . Let me explain myself , I 'm a network administrator and a computer technician and I can not stand how this operating system will not let me do some of the simplest system setup/maintenance tasks that I took for granted on any NT system . It took me 10 minutes to share a printer on a workgroup with an annoying wizard that did n't want to do it ; when it finally worked it shared it out under a different name ??! I still have n't figured out how to set file/folder permissions nor how to get rid of the fading effects for windows and popups and personalized start-menu options . The control panel is a joke compared to win2k . Needles to say I 'm going to return this and go back to using win2k . And no XP does not run anything faster on my computer -LRB- P4 1800Mhz , 512RAM , 128 VRAM -RRB- all it does is take maybe 10 seconds less to start up ... big deal . You could probably get it to run as fast as win2k if you figure out a way to disable some of the graphic effects and other silly features -LRB- but I could n't find it -RRB- .2 stars for good looksHope you find this useful . ~ MKGA + , Network + , I-Net + , Server + , MCSA -LRB- Win2k -RRB-
 The majority of computer users can go on using this insecure , unstable , and bloated product . Also , why pay ~ $ 300 for an OS when you can download one for free ? I have been using Redhat linux for years , now , with no complaints.I tried installing XP on another partition on my 1Ghz , 500M RAM Sony Vaio only to take it off again . It was dog slow and , quite frankly , insulting . Another review called it a Fischer-Price toy . How true ! The gang in Redmond , WA get to tell you how you are going to use their OS , dumb it down , and you get to pay for the privilege as well . And if you want a feature they do n't offer ? Too bad ; you ca n't have it unless thousands of other consumers want it as well . So much for innovation and flexibility.The most troubling thing about Windows is its lack of security . No wonder there is a class action lawsuit against MS for the lack of it . With such a vast majority of PCs running Winows , and its porous security , huge portions of the internet and connected computers are vulnerable to cyber-terrorism . Let 's get real
 Windows XP PRO . Does everything it brags about , but it 's what it did n't metion that really -LSB- ticked -RSB- me off . I bought this product , installed it , and it works great , so I decided to install it on my second machine . This is what makes this product -LSB- a rip off -RSB- . To install it on a second machine you have to purchase an additional license which costs you the same ammount of money as buying the product a second time . What is Microsoft trying to accomplish by ripping people off ?! They believe that by making it restricted by activation they can force people to give them more money . Well screw them , all they did was make me and the average user really -LSB- ticked -RSB- off ! O yeah , they also gave hackers a reason to pirate this software .
 This operating system refuses to install on my newly built system , with all brand-new components -LRB- 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 , Intel D850MV motherboard , 512 MB RAM , Western Digital HDD , Asus GEForce3 video card -RRB- . If I do n't press the keys fast enough during the setup program , it will freeze . However , even if I do get it to start the install , it invariably freezes during the transfer of files from the CD to the hard-drive . Windows 98 installs without a hitch , so I know my hardware is OK . Stay away from this one until they come out with a `` Second Edition '' .
 I have had XP for 6 months and it was working fine . I installed the Office service packs today and the whole system came crashing down ! I do n't know what MS is thinking , but they seriously need to get their act together . I would recommend to anyone considering XP to get an Apple .
 All my Intuit software runs on my old Pentium III 733MHZ machine , so I was VERY DISAPPOINTED after loading TurboTax 2004 Deluxe on the machine and it LOCKED UP trying to start the return . I uninstalled , then re-installed . No Luck ! I then tried to install on my Windows XP machine . It works -LRB- so far -RRB- , but I had to import by hand all information that should have been easily imported had it all been on the same machine . I have used Turbo Tax ever since they bought out Parsons Technology which , bar none , had the BEST tax software in the industry - Tax Edge . I had not looked at any of these reviews , because Turbo Tax has ALWAYS done a good job for me - really sorry to hear that they have outsourced their Customer Service to India - that 's where my programming job went ... but what can you do ; there is NO tax software that does the job any better , unless you obtain a copy of software used by professional CPAs .
 I just wanted to reiterate that this software absolutely does not work on macs . Not only that , but if you want customer service from Turbotax , they charge $ 9.95 for each customer service call . Go with Taxcut !
 The software is fine until you discover that there is NO LAW for income Tax on wages and salaries . The software suddenly becomes moot .
 I am not a person who usually leaves a feedback . But this software is so disappointing . To get to the point , if you have ESPP , definitely you have to pay extra $ 30.00 for ESPP module . ESPP is not complicated and difficult thing . ESPP is very common . And generally other tax software , such as TAX CUT , inclues the ESPP module . It is ridiculous to pay for that . I will never buy Turbo tax again .
 This is my last year for Turbotax . One of the `` features '' is the ability to `` Import from Quicken ... software '' . But , this does NOT work with Quicken 2000 . You ca n't actually get an online rebate through their `` online rebate form '' . You end up going to the online form , printing out the form , and mailing that in . How is that better than mailing in the coupon that is included in the box?And , as some of the other reviewers have noted , many of the nice features that were in the `` Deluxe '' version the past few years have moved into the `` Premier '' version . So every year you buy the `` Deluxe '' version you get less than the year before .
 Buying the Delux version I thought I would be able to do both my federal and state taxes - however , it cost an additional $ 30 to do your state taxes . Having a background in information design I found some of the questions a bit vague and not specific enough to give clear guidance . Wish I had kept the box - because i would have sent it back for a refund , if possible .
 I 've used Turbo Tax and Quicken for many years , and am sorry to say they just keep getting worse and worse . One of the best features of Turbo Tax Deluxe USED to be walking us through complex and confusing employee stock purchase plan and stock options . But I just discovered that in 2004 , you have to buy TurboTax PREMIERE , for another $ 30 , for this feature , that used to be in Deluxe!Also , I 've had some problems with importing data from Quicken and from financial institutions -- features I 've used for many years . Importing data from Quicken , Turbo Tax claims the cost basis and date of some fund sales are missing , but they were in Quicken . Importing from my financial institution , everything downloaded correctly , but was obscured by duplicate forms -LRB- primarily 1099-DIV -RRB- that had been imported from last year 's data . An obfuscation bug , if you will.But I ca n't believe they took a good , basic feature and bumped it up to Premiere !
 Do n't do it ! Most likely it wo n't install correctly . Many people this year , including me , simply can not run Turbo Tax . I spent hours on tech support TWICE , tried the `` fixes '' on the message boards at their web site , and still nothing . It simply will NOT run.Intuit used to be a good company with good products and good customer service and tech support . But that was 10 years ago . Now ? Lousy everything . I know more about their products than their tech support people . They seem to have been pulled off the street and given one hour of training.I may try Tax Cut but I 'm bummed about the review below that says TT is better than Tax Cut . If that 's true , TC must REALLY be lousy ! But what else can I do ? TT wo n't work on my computer .
 Bought this when a friend recommended it every so highly . Should 've known better . This product is DREADFUL ! I honestly wish I 'd have seen the reviews on Amazon before I made my purchase . Support is non-existent . The downloading just does n't happen . I 've already wasted 2.5 hours on this , the mirror site download would 've taken over 6.5 hours . I 'm going to file manually -LRB- thank GOD something told me to try this a day in advance of 4/15 -RRB- , and demand a refund from TurboTax . I 'll never buy this again . If I could give it less stars than one , I would .
 TurboTax is buggy and the support is terrible ! You can not update your state information after the initial review without manually editing the tax forms . If the field involves computations , you must do these manually after changing it . If you try to re-run the interview , it just brings you to the `` finish '' screen . I talked to four different people from TurboTax support about this . They say it 's a known bug and they have no plans to fix it . If I wanted to manually edit to forms , I would n't have purchased this software ! If you make changes to the federal , TurboTax state is n't necessarily updated . I received the following ridiculous suggestions from support
 Ca n't believe that the company is so deceived when stripping out the ESSP features from the deluxe version . The 2003 deluxe version was fine . My wife spent hours trying to figure out why her return did not sound right and finally found out that you had to buy the premier version for additional $ 30 . The hassle and frustration overweighted the benefit using the turbotax.This kind of company should die .
 None of the downloads or other Web-enabled features work through the firewall , and -LRB- unlike every other piece of SW in existence -RRB- it did n't even try . If it had tried , I could have told the firewall to allow it through . So I have to leave my computer unprotected while I am working on my finances , very bad . I told it to download one state but it downloaded another instead , and now wants me to pay $ 30 for the state I asked for in the first place . Customer service fixed that for me , thankfully . The program itself is easy to use , like all such programs , but in some combinations of filing status and income , makes huge errors in calculations . The explanations are a bit more helpful than in the past .
 HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM ? THERE IS NO `` CALCULATE '' BUTTON , AND EVERY TIME I CLOSE & REOPEN TURBOTAX , IT CALCULATES A DIFFERENT TAX -- SOMETIMES IT SAYS I HAVE A REFUND , AND AT OTHER TIMES IT CALCULATES A `` TAX DUE '' ! UNBELIEVABLE !
 I used this product last year and to my surprise this year 's product looked different . I thought I was in the twilight zone for my whole saturday afternoon to realize later that you need to upgrade to premier for ISO/non-qualified stock -LRB- which was included in the deluxe edition last year -RRB- . After the upgrade , the program did n't even work.Can anyone advise which product I should use ?
 I have been using Turbo Tax to prepare my taxes for approximately 12 years . They have had minor issues in the past -LRB- notable about 7 years ago -RRB- but they were normally minor and an update to fix the bugs was quickly forthcoming.I should have paid heed when the TT software three years ago installed spyware on my machine . I was going to switch but was assured by the Intuit staff that it would not be in the following year 's software . As promised they did remove the spyware.Now for the worse of the bunch Turbo Tax Deluxe 2004 has so many bugs it is unusable . I can not update from the web -LRB- this one got fixed , by downloading a manual update and re-installing the software -RRB- , I can not import last years tax data -LRB- this one the support staff has no idea about -RRB- and all the help screens are blank -LRB- again Intuit has no idea -RRB- . Can I depend on a software company that has such an apparent lack of concentration on the details of testing to prepare and calculate my taxes ? After all these years of consistently buying the same package from the same company -LRB- ChipSoft - > Intuit -RRB- , I am so toughly disgusted that Intuit is forcing my hand and making me switch to another tax preparation software package . Intuit as a company , should be ashamed of what they have released this year and if I was them I would certainly not be stepping up advertising for this buggy product .
 I purchased TurboTax 2004 Deluxe directly from Intuit . After 20 days of waiting and several hours with customer service agent who I could barely understood , I finally got the disk . I proceed with the installation process and it failed . The InstallShield Wizard closes when it gets to the `` Searching for Installed components '' screen . It does not generate error message . I get the chat support and the tech could not resolve it and tried to give me a pay support phone line , which costs $ 9.99 per incident ? After more research , multiple problems with update and State download . Back to my problem , I found a work around from a user forum . Intuit has posted a work around . So Intuit knew about the problem and still ship the product to customers . If you paid for a product , should you be expect to use a work around that requires you to delete the InstallShield from your computer ? I think not . get a refund and buy Tax Cut .
 Apparently they 've dumped support for NT but did n't label their product properly , listing NT on boxes I saw at the store . It is very difficult to figure it out on their support site . If you 're getting an error in install `` Could not load CustControlls.dll '' this could be why .
 I had quicken and I was quite annoyed the way things are presented there , so I was not thinking about buying software from the same company , but my wife happened to buy this TurboTax . I tried to install on my computer -LRB- win 2000 -RRB- and got some kind of script error when I tried to use it . I had a chance to reinstall windows 2000 and try to install it again . It still had the same error . We got a replacement of the software package , and tried again , and the same problem.Apparently , TurboTax failed to cover some of the basic windows installation setting - whatever difference might have caused the problem.Since we openned the package , we can not return it to the store we bought , and we have to get refund from intuit directly.I generally do not like softwares pretending to make the thing so easy and trying to lead the software user to see what they want to show . Nice 3-dimensional graph , sound effect does not mean anyting if the software is not flexible enough to show what the user want to see from their point of view , possibly from a slightly different perspective.I hate confusing wording at the installation when it is basically asking question if you want to buy another software of theirs . This kind of trick presented in the installation process , in general , makes my confidence on the software drop to the bottom .
 I have been using TurboTax for 5 years and it has always supported all types of employee stock plan transactions in the interview . Now , apparently we are forced to buy Premier if we want to have the same functionality .
 What a waste of time and money for everyone who has purchased Turbo Tax Deluze for 2004 . There is nothing easy about doing your taxes with this program . It is difficult to install and absolutely impossible to get the updates on-line or by ordering the CD . I agree with the customer who has said you should refund the purchase price to everyone who has purchased this program .
 I 've used Turbo Tax for the last 5 years , and found it to be excellent . For some ridiculous reason , though , this year the company decided to not include support for ISOs and ESPP sales in TT Deluxe . They expect you to pay an extra 30 bucks to have them calculate those . I guess they figure that it 's OK for them to rip you off if you benefitted from either of these . Ridiculous !! This may be my last year using TT .
 - Gives the appearance of the same value as last year 's model , but to get that value you have to send two rebates , buy the State version separately and send a third rebate for that.Dear Intuit , I have been a customer of TurboTax Deluxe for over five years . This year you chose not to include the state forms with the package , but made them `` free '' after rebate . You used the same `` free '' scheme with the electronic filing fee . You also raised the price of TT and offered a rebate , making the price appear to be the same as last year.I understand your accursed bean counters figured out how to pair these price increases with rebates to make it appear the customer is receiving the same value as in previous years . And they knew that many customers would send not in their rebates . A simple way to boost income without providing any more real value.But maybe it 's not so simple . I for one will not be buying TurboTax next year if it is offered this way . I am not willing to waste an hour of my time filling out forms , cutting UPCs , photocopying receipts , sending in three separate envelopes , all so you can squeeze more money out of customers who are less organized . I will gladly switch to one of your fine competitors who does not burden their customers with these schemes . It 's ironic that a company that advertises its products as saving you time imposes a marketing scheme that robs their customers of their time . When those costs are factored in , your product offers little value .
 Tutbotax is the most over-priced piece of software on the market , and is sold with sales practices that are malicious or borderline criminal . Instead of improving their product they try to mine their customers.If you use it to import prior year tax data , you may want to check on it a wee bit . Nothing like the program asking you to go figure out the AMT data from last year -LRB- helpfully pointing you to the g *** line where you can supposedly copy data from -RRB- . Perhaps you trust it to do the correct calculations when it happily creates two entries for each of last years ' 1099s -- but I really do n't need to get to know the IRS personally . So much for saving time when you have to go check the forms yourself . Did I say check the forms -- how silly of me -- the forms do n't show up , just the numbers -- sort of a reminder of playing Mario Bros in the dark when the levels disappear . So be sure you have multiple computers around so you can experiment.Deluxe -- which you buy to get a state download ? Sure as h ** did n't give me one . I take that personally , buddy . Anyway , feel free to lug your home PC to work so you can try out the code they give you over the phone -LRB- they are available , of course , during the time you spend at work -- between 8am and 5pm -RRB- As you know , everyone does their taxes at work where your understanding boss can help you reduce your future tax load by removing this year 's salary.And of course , rebates -- Scotty 's favorite s *** - you gift . If you get your jollies reading fine print , hunting for current forms on the web -LRB- yes Amazon , you adorable skunks , you aid and abet this nonsense -- I see you , you amateurs , I was able to read your forms !!! -RRB- and photocopying , this product is for you . In an exclusive Turbotax experience , you can re-experience that old glow of getting what is yours from a faceless bureacracy . While this used to involve doing your taxes by hand and reading all the tax guides , you can now pay a fee to private industry and retain the overall pain and paperwork . Enhance your manual dexterity by snipping your product packaging in an effort to isolate the magic UPC code that has helpfully been relocated to the absolute center of the side wall of your packaging . Improve your eyesight and short-term memory performing legal interpretation by parsing disjoint sentences from different pages of fine print . And experience that familiar old feeling of helpless defeat when you miss the deadline helpfully hidden inside the case that you did not open the minute you received the shipment.Intuit is going to get sued . I for one am sending a notice to a few state 's attorney general -- plus some vulture law firms . -LSB- BTW -- if you are thinking of Quicken -- well , be prepared to get screwed by forced upgrades . Never thought I 'd recommend Microsoft for ethical software practices , but run , do n't walk , to the MS financial software -RSB- .
 I bought this product because I have used TurboTax in prior years with no problems . This year they do have a buggy version for 2004 . They have decided to use Javascript this year in many of their screens . I suspect this is an attempt to integrate and share much of the code for the installed TurboTax and the Web-based Turbotax.After installing it and trying to run it I was getting a Javascript error on almost every action . Imagine my suprise when I tried to report the -LRB- confirmed -RRB- bug by calling their support number and realizing that it would cost me $ 9.95 , JUST TO REPORT THEIR BUG.Look at `` support -LRB- dot -RRB- turbotax -LRB- dot -RRB- com -LRB- slash -RRB- forums '' in the `` Error Messages '' forum and you will see a giant thread of users that are incensed that we users have to support this product not Intuit.Users have come up with a fix for now that requires editing one of the Javascript files with a hex editor . Imagine you 've just purchased a $ 39.95 piece of software , discover a bug that will cost you $ 9.95 just to find out there is no update yet and the only way to fix it is to get into the low level internals of Javascript yourself and fix it.Need I say more . Avoid this title and go with something else . This is not worth buying for that ten dollar rebate.Update 12/18/2004 - Turbotax has implemented what I believe to be an automated free web support to address the problem of no free support . They have also claimed that the $ 9.95 fee per incident may be refunded if they are at fault when you call in.Another note on these reviews . They do tend to be skewed towards the low side because people who have experienced problems are more likely to leave a -LRB- bad -RRB- review . There are quite a few reviewers that do n't express much but leave a 5-STAR rating . Someone with a last name that is the same as a senior product manager at TurboTax kind of tips their hat at what is going on here . So please take the 5-STAR ratings as what they are . Also take the 1-STAR ratings as coming from someone who truly had a problem and was angry enough to give such a rating .
 It is impossible to install TurboTax State 2004 on Macs . None of the keys for installing the State version work on the Mac , according to Intuit . Replacement Mac CDs will not be available until `` late January or February . '' Obviously , this also thwarts the use of TurboTax Federal since state tax liability is deductible from federal taxes . The `` solution '' is to buy the minimal TurboTax Basic which does federal taxes only and calculate state tax manually , or pay a preparer to do it . This sort of thing is an ongoing problem for Mac users with Intuit products .
 I used Turbo Tax for 2003 and I thought it worked fine.This year I had a slight problem with ordering ; I called the 800 number given for help.Out of the eight calls I made , all of them were transferred to India.I could n't undrestand what the people were saying and they did n't seem to understand my problem , very frustration.I did a lot of searching and got the number of corporate head quarters in California . When I talked to some lady there and explained what my problem was and that I could n't get it solved by using their 800 number , she in a very unfriendly and snotty manner told me there was nothing she could do and that I would have to use the 800 number.This company like many others makes it very difficult to get answers to problems with their product.No more Turbo Tax for me !
 My conversations with Intuit tech support and cust . service confirm the `` late January or February '' target '' for a Mac-installable multistate disc . Yet the company continues to shamelessly market the product without so much as a notice on its web site . They told me they plan to publish such a notice , but when ? In my view Intuit is a -RRB- incompetent for delivering a product to market that ca n't be installed ; and b -RRB- unethical for not pulling the product off the market , and even more so for stonewalling the problem . They have not learned the lessons of Tylenol or Watergate.I did n't use TurboTax last year because the 02 product was so problematic . Now the only competitor for the Mac has vanished , leaving this dodgy product and company the only game in town . Shameful .
 Purchased the Deluxe version that had a rebate and claimed to have the state included . Based on previous experience with TurboTax I knew it meant a download ... not a problem.Then the problems hit . First TurboTax did not recognize my DSL connection . The only help from TurboTax was to download the update file and manually install . OK , just a bump in the road.Then I go to download the state tax and it wants a creditcard . Why ? No mention in the hardcopy documentation , nothing on the outside of the box . Finally found the info buried in the help menu . Pay for the download then get a rebate . Wait a minute was n't this included . Purchasing state and submitting rebates is very confusing -LRB- I 've used the product for almost 10 years -RRB- . Still unsure if rebate will be paid , tried to call support 20 minute wait no answer . Tried online support via messaging given the brush off twice . Poor service and deceptive sales practice .
 Used TT all the way up until my 2002 taxes were a nightmare . If you read reviews then you know 2002s registration process made it absolutely horrible . So tried Taxcut in 03 and am back to TT in 04 . This product was great for use for E-filing but when I tried to print and file my Indiana tax return it has been a nightmare . No one at telephone customer service could help me and I am posting the online chat session since that person had absolutely no idea about the product she was supposed to be supporting . In short if you try and file by mail a state return you have a very high chance that the form in TurboTax is not the right form . I had mine sent back twice and finally downloaded the real from my states website and put the info in myself . Hope you enjoy the chat transcript :550 Eden
 I 've used TT for eight years with no glitches but now am one of those caught up in the update installation debacle . My TT 2004 Deluxe installed successfully in Dec -LRB- OS is Win 98SE -RRB- and went through one flawless update cycle to include getting my state forms but the second update releases -LRB- mid Jan -RRB- have caused major problems which Intuit appears slow to cure . While I found customer service responsive via email -LRB- within 12 hrs -RRB- their fix did not work for me and a reply to the msg got me a response of `` this is an unmonitored mailbox '' . A tour of their website 's user fora suggests the problem is widespread with a small number of users able to work their own fix by editing their registry and deleting all traces of the program/update files and going through multiple uninstall/reinstalls , defraging their hard drives , etc. . I use the program in part because of the ease in carrying over the previous year 's tax data . If you have n't bought the program yet and can hold off on filing , I 'd contact Intuit to ensure that a corrected version is available on CD and then act . Or , try a different tax preparation program .
 As many others noticed , the quality of their product has declined dramatically . The UI is uglier and more confusing , it 's hard to find your ways around the menus and features . Some controls do n't work , do n't react on user actions and there is no explanation why . It 's easy to chat with the Intuit tech support but it takes so much time while they scan their ready answer databases for answers.Their product is still not ready
 I purchased this product for a VERY SPECIFIC NEED . The product arrived within 3 weeks , which was good . I was GREATLY looking forward to using it . I have had so much success with my other TURBO TAX Products . I went to install it and start my use . I received a message reading THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE . I was stuck with a blank , unuseable , wasted disc . I have tried several times to contact the seller and the company , but get brick walled . Now , facing a time limit . I have to search for another product . No more TURBO TAX for me .
 As a tax professional , I would highly discourage anyone from taking on the challenge of doing their taxes if it involves more than W-2 's . Even with some of the most expensive software , information is not properly transferred to the state return , especially in WI where everything is behind , inbetween and many cases , manual adjustments need to be made . If you have children in college or are trying to maximize your deductions through self-employment or retirement contributions , or strategize double itemizing , you need a professional or a long time to read IRS and state Pubs . There is no magic box , but you can find a reasonable tax preparer without all of the fancy overhead such as the ones trying to sell you a guarantee that they did their work properly . Yikes ! In the long run it is better to really have PEOPLE than the sea monkeys in a box . Worst part is the IRS/states are so far behind , you wo n't even know if you messed up until about two years later !
 Whatever you do , do n't get this tax program . It took me forever to do my taxes on it . When I was finally done with my taxes , turbotax found an error and wanted me to download to fix the errors so I tried and that was a mistake . It would n't download anything ! The program kept telling me it could not find anything to download ! What really made me upset about turbotax is the electronic file . Turbotax charges you 14.95 for each tax form you want to send electronically and an additional 19.95 if you want to direct deposit ! For all the money I paid for this crappy program I am to get ripped off an additional fifty bucks !?
 Last year I had problems with downloading the state forms . This year they sent me the disk but I can not even purchase it , their web page keeps locking up . Called their personal assistance line and was told to try later . With all the time spent trying to get the software to work It may be cheaper to go to a tax preparer
 I have used TurboTax for years , and this version is just awful . It is buggy , and makes the tax return very difficult . I think they have become arrogant , because there are lot 's of incentives not to switch . Ie , it picks up information from last years return . I 've had it , though . I will never use TurboTax again . By the way , another product from Intuit , ItsDeductible refused to export to TurboTax ! Grrr . Nasty experience this year .
 WARNING
 I 've been a customer of Turbotax from the very beginning . This year has been my first bad experience . And it 's incredibly bad.I did not order this through Amazon , so please do n't associate this bad review with Amazon , the company.I ordered Turbotax Deluxe directly from the company on Jan. 7 , 2005 . I received confirmation of shipment on Jan. 13 , 2005 . Two weeks later I still had not received my product . I looked at my credit card statement and it had been charged already.I tried calling support and it was obvious that the support center had been outsourced to India . The people are nice enough . But they are just not given enough authority to do ANYTHING USEFUL!The first support call ended with a hangup after waiting for about 30 minutes . I did talk to someone . But they could n't find any evidence of my order . I called again the next day . This time they said that the computers were down and there was no way that they could track my order.A few days later -LRB- Jan. 26 -RRB- , after my temper had subsided , I called again . They found my order information . The lady said that she would put in a new order for me and gave me a new order number . She said it would be shipped Next Day UPS . I asked for a tracking number and could n't get one because she said the order needed to be processed.On Jan. 31 I had not yet received my order . So I called again . They said that the order had not been processed yet . I asked if they could expedite it . They could n't give me an answer . I asked if they could tell me when it would be processed . They said I should receive the product soon . I asked what ` SOON ' meant . The said a few days.You can see where this is going . It 's now Feb. 3 and I can tell by looking at their online support that the order has not been processed yet.I 'm having a hard time giving money to a company that helps me pay my U.S. income taxes and has support that is farmed out to a cheap labor Indian firm that has no way of helping me.CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PRODUCT !
 We have used TurboTax previously without too many problems , although updating the product has always been an issue . In previous years , the issue has been the amount of time and retries it 's taken to update the software . This time , we were nearly through with our return this year , when we got to a screen where we were asked if we 'd like to update the software . We said , `` Yes , '' and proceeded to lose all the information that we 'd just worked so hard to input . I contacted Intuit and was told that in order for the software to update properly , you have to turn off your firewall , turn off your virus checker , and not be connected through a router . That does not sound reasonable ; it sounds scary . There must be another product out there which is comparable to TurboTax , but which actually works the way it should without expecting you to expose your computer to risk the way Intuit apparently requires you to .
 Intuit releases the program full of bugs and omissions and periodically releases updates to fix this . O.K. Not ideal , but TaxCut does the same thing.However , this year , TurboTax not infrequently has a problem in the updates . The TT website suggests that you uninstall * everything * and try reinstalling from the CD and then updating again from scratch . Did that . However , an uninstall does n't really clean out everything and it still ca n't update . At this point , I just ca n't reliably use the program and I ca n't get the updates that are necessary to make the program work . Terrible .
 If you were like me and were expecting your normal Turbo Tax upgrade , will get ready for a surprise!The engineers in an attempt to make it look like a web application , have screwed the whole thing up . The program is no longer intuitive , nor does it nicely lead you through entering all the documents that need to be entered . You have to guess , which form is being entered . Are you entering 1099G , 1099-INT , 1099-DIV , will you 'll just have to guess?As a software engineer myself , I 'd fire the program manager for starts .
 This is my first and will be my last year using TurboTax . I have been using the H&R ; Block TaxCut software for almost 10 years , and was very happy with the product . It handled my home business exceptionally well , and did n't miss a beat in regard to my rental properties . During the last few years , however , we sold our rentals , closed the home business , and become a one-income -LRB- W-2 -RRB- household . Taxes , I thought , this year should be a breeze . I normally would not have switched , but it was time for me to update Quicken , and I wanted the rebate . There on the box read the claim that TurboTax imports from TaxCut . Great , saves me the time to type in all my accounts and personal information . This claim , however , turn out to be untrue . TurboTax found last year 's TaxCut file , but could not import any data.Secondly , the look and feel of the inquiry screens seemed unprofessional . I could not help but feel that the software was failing to ask all the right questions . Although I am 98 % confident that the results are correct , I miss the overall thoroughness of TaxCut .
 TurboTax for Mac does not import TaxCut data . It says that it does on the box , but it does n't . Intuit 's website confirms this . Beware the false advertising . I 'm sending this back and using TaxCut again .
 Turbo Tax really is not a very good product . You are just better off paying someone to do your taxes or if you have a really simple one , just do it yourself . Also , there are so many places online that are free . The deluxe version is complete BS , it does n't give you anything extra , you still have to download your files just like with the cheaper versions . The customer service for this company is TERRIBLE . I was charged three times on my debit card for e-filing . It took me three different phones calls , during my work hours , and being on hold for 20-30 minutes to get it straight . -LRB- All this while talking to a rude person who barely understands me and I can barely understand him -RRB- . Plus , the extra $ 60 they had charged me erroneously caused other transactions to bounce and I was charged insufficient funds charges from my bank . That was another phone call during my lunch to fix something .
 I 've been a TurboTax user since it was from a company called ChipSoft . I so regret it now and have done for several years . I ca n't change because my business depreciations were started with TurboTax . I tried TaxCut a couple of years ago and they did n't agree . So I figure I 'm stuck.This product has become more and more intertwined with other Intuit software and with Microsoft . I activated my version -LRB- not bought at Amazon but direct from Intuit -RRB- with my preferred browser , the excellent Firefox . The program could n't `` see '' my click to continue so I had to `` reinstall '' without having installed in the first place.TurboTax deluxe installs - without permission - a program called `` It 's Deductable '' which , when you click on it tried to get you started using it . Oh but if you look at the bottom of the panel , it will cost you $ 20 extra to use it . The application is full of traps like that.I ca n't use any of the Internet portions of TurboTax -LRB- nor of Quicken - I use H&B ; 2001 -RRB- because it insists on connecting with Internet Explorer . It does n't need to but it wo n't work with other browsers.As I say , I 'm stuck . I wish TurboTax would go retro and return to the days when it was a tax program , plain and simple . I trused it and it was easy and - dare I say it ? - almost fun or at least an adventure to do my taxes . Not any more . \ If you have n't used it before , look long and hard at your other options before purchasing TurboTax in any form .
 I have used TurboTax for many years . My current operating system is Microsoft XP Professional . This year , TurboTax Deluxe 2004 will not start . You will find suggested solutions posted -LSB- ... -RSB- One suggested solution is to Start-Run-msconfig and look in the Startup tab for conflicting software to disable . As of today , only 7 coflicting software names are listed.If this does not work , then the suggestion is to go into Microsoft Internet Explorer and clear the Use Java box.When you contact technical support , they will suggest that you disable all firewall , anti-virus , and anti-spyware software . After re-installing TurboTax Deluxe 2004 , the software will not start.So far , the only way that I have been able to start TurboTax Deluxe 2004 is to disable all software in the msconfig Startup tab . By doing that , you lose access to the Internet.As noted by other reviewers , one could spend many hours trying to fix this problem or buy different software . At this point , my guess is that the current list of conflicting software is incomplete with only 7 software names.You might discover that you have 20 or more programs listed in the Startup tab . By the time you test each one individually , you will have devoted more hours to fix Intuit 's problems than Intuit is spending.I have asked different technical support staff members if I can solve the problem by switching to TurboTax Premier 2004 . One informed me that he was unaware of this problem with Premier . Another informed me that the differences between the versions would not suggest this as a solution .
 As a 7 + year TT user , I 've got to say that 2004 will be my last year . After collecting $ 40 for Deluxe , they fleeced me for $ 30 more so that I could complete the ESPP section of my taxes . This was previously included in Deluxe , but no warning was given that they made this change -LRB- fewer features for the same price -RRB- . Plus I 'm tired of the terrible support and the annual rebate game they force me to play to get my $ 10 or $ 30 back . Will check out TaxAct and TaxCut next year .
 Unless your tax situation is extremely simnple , avoid Turbo Tax 2004 . My disc did not include IRS Schedule E and therefore it could not produce my complete finished return . INTUIT knew when it peddled the disc that it was defective , and toward the end of my return admitted that . Yet it omitted from the packaging any mention of the inadequacy . It was hidden.So far , Intuit 's support system has been useless about curing the defect.I have written to the Federal Trade Commission about what I think was deceptive marketing . Being what it is , the FTC will probably do nothing . Still , along with not buying TT next year , -LRB- which I wo n't -RRB- calling FTC 's attention to marketing practices is at least something a customer can do .
 DO N'T buy this product if you have stock plans from your employer . This does not support ESPP and employee stock options as previous years `` deluxe '' line . You 'll have to purchase the `` premier '' version . This really sucks . I think this is the last year I am going to purchase Turbotax .
 TurboTax 2004 has been significantly degraded compared with the previous year .1 . Extensive updates are mandatory in order to proceed with tax processing ; no selections or options are offered so that documents must be downloaded regardless of whether the updates are required2 . . Download time exceeds one hour on a 56K dial-up connection .3 . Download failed on the last of ten files as forewarned by the Intuit site ; script error . Recovery was incomplete and resulted in failure of the install wizard . This problem is featured on the support site with directions for reinstallation . The foregoing obviates any claim to time-saving benefits .4 . Quicken downloads are not error-free . No provision , for example , is made for categorizing IRA distributions , notably `` in kind '' RMDs .5 . Data windows for categories such as investments and charities , are so small that they are barely legible despite large unused screen area .6 . Errors , not discernable by TT , are cumbersome to detct and correct .7 . State tax returns can not be previewed or reviewed without hard-copy printing which produces many unwanted pages .8 . Dual or redundant data entry is not monitored by the program . The program simply advises you not to enter previously entered data .9 . User interface
 Wow , who bought TurboTax ? A group of kindergartners ? This used to be a premeir tax software oackage , but I would recommend a pencil & paper over this product today . IT DOES NOT WORK ! It ca n't do it 's downloads and blames that on firewalls/security -LRB- funny , even my free game software can download through my firewall -RRB- . This is the worst version ever , I will NOT buy anything from intuit/turbotax again . I will use HR Block next year . This is not worth the hassle . turbotax -LRB- not capitalized because they do n't deserve to be -RRB- owes us all a refund !!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE , YOU CAN HAVE MINE . -LRB- NO , SORRY , I WOULDN `` T WISH THIS ON ANYONE -RRB-
 I have used Turbotax for about 7 years , but am now going to go with Tax-Cut . The last two years my returns had calculation errors in the state return and I had to write the state a check both years.The Intuit customer service is terrible . I had a technical problem with the program last year and could not get in touch with anyone at Intuit - absolutely impossible to get service . No returns to my email . I ended up having to pay another $ 40 to buy a replacement product , and never got my money back from Intuit , never heard from them.Last year I bought Turbo-tax from their mailing , only to find out if I bought from the store I could have got $ 10 more off . Great way to treat return customers .
 Bad ! I just finished spending time installing , reinstalling , and trying to download the updates . There is one patch after another to fix problems with this software . I could n't get the updates to download and kept getting one error message after another . After spending more than 12 hours of my time with this lousy program , I am ordering Tax Cut today.I rated this software one star because this is the lowest rating that can be selected . It does n't even rate one star because I ca n't even get the software updated to begin using it !
 I am completely dissatisfied with Turbo Tax ! After spending a ton of money on the software , I can not even finish my return ! Turbo Tax updates do n't work , and there are errors on my return . After spending four hours on their crappy software , I called a friend who told me about this software called Bootax . The software is about half the price and I was able to do my taxes in 10 minutes ! Luckily , I bought the Turbo Tax software from Walmart and they let you return it for a refund . Turbo Tax has a lot of little kinks in the software and the company is more concerned with making money while adding less and less value for the customer .
 Pros : One of the two print functions actually works ! Only one gives you the option of writing to a PDF file in case you do n't have a printer connected to the computer you 've installed the software upon.Cons : If you go with Turbo Tax , here is what you will pay :1 . 30 $ for federal -LRB- 60 for all but the most basic returns -RRB- 2 . 30 $ for state3 . 30 $ MORE dollars for any other state you lived in during the year4 . 25 $ to Intuit for a electronic filing fee .5 . 30 $ to santa barbara bank and trust for being friends with Intuitleast total
 FAILURE . The program would not complete my return because of two updates , which would never download to my computer . The updates necessary were on form 8863 and merely included items on lines which differed from one form to another , but were successfully placed on the form from Turbo Tax . Since the update would not download , Turbo Tax Deluxe would not progress beyond the Error check function . I had to manually print and send the forms myself . I had to download a form 8863 from the IRS site itself , put all the figures in the correct boxes , and file that form from them . What a FAILURE OF A PROGRAM .
 I have used this program for just about 11 years , always on Mac . I have usually been able to make it work by liberally using the override . This year the program is so full of bugs that I called customer support . The first man was quite knowledgeable and helpful . But we were cut off before we could finish the conversation -LRB- I understand that is company policy -RRB- . I called back and got a lady who literally did n't know which side is up . When I asked about bugs in simple addition functions in the program , she said that what I really need is tax advice . When I persisted in asking about the program , she told me that she has an accounting degree . She did n't explain the relevance of that degree to her job of understanding TT software . I then told he , and I said that I mean this kindly , that she needs more familiarity with computers to do this job , she hung up on me . That was the only intelligent thing she did for me . This company has no conscience , that 's obvious . It peddles a worthless product and then hires shoemakers to fix the software .
 I bought TurboTax Deluxe , thinking it would meet my needs . It did n't , it can not handle Incentive Stock Options . So I upgraded online to TurboTax Premier . During that run of the program , it let me use the Incentive Stock Option features.Now it 's a schizophrenic mess . When run as administrator on Windows 2000 , it thinks it is TurboTax Premier , but it will not let me access the Premier features . When run as my normal user account , with or without administrator privileges , TurboTax thinks it is still Deluxe.There 's a knowledgebase article on their website that notes there 's a problem , and that you can solve it by starting a new return . So I tried that . Still does n't work , still thinks that it is TurboTax Deluxe , still no support for Incentive Stock Options.At this point , I know I ca n't trust it until their outsourced customer support slowly fixes my installation . There 's no hope that they can do that by tax time , they are surely totally overloaded now . So I 'm going to have to file for an extension with both state and federal . This is the first time I 've ever had to do that , and it 's going to delay my refund -- money out of MY pocket . Intuit should pay me interest!I 've had increasing problems with TurboTax from year to year , but this is the first time it has basically become totally trashed . Their quality assurance is getting worse from year to year , and I suspect that they are now such a monopoly that they really do n't care .
 I 've used TurboTax for years and ItsDeductible for the previous 2 years . The version this year that was purchased through TurboTax is useless . There is no way to enter dates for donations , so it just lumps them all together and puts them on 12/31/2004 . There is no meaningful support either . They have not replied to my on-line submissions and the `` Live help '' could n't help at all after I waited on them for 45 minutes . Also , since they did n't bother to send me a reciept for the order , I have no good way to get it refunded either . Some catch that catch 22 .
 It ca n't handle any kind of ESPP or stock option sales . Even if you try and enter those transactions manually it totally miscalculates your tax , potentially leading you to over-pay by thousands of dollars . If you have ESPP or option sales and want to stick with TurboTax , get the Premier version .
 The product keeps deteriorating every year . Issues I 've had : - This year 's turbo tax deluxe does n't accommodate stock options in its interview process . I searched the help section and was told that this was available in the premier version only . Needless to say , Turbo Tax does n't clearly identify this issue in its advertising & this is potentially fraudulent given that the 2003 product did accommodate stock option exercises . I tricked the system but walked away with a very bad taste in my mouth . I 've never heard of a program taking features away over time ! This is terrible . - Does n't automatically calculate the sales tax rate when you ask for the sales tax deduction . You have to find that info offline and plug the rate into the box & turbo tax will do you the favor of calculating that .
 I just received and installed TurboTax Deluxe 2004 . When I went to view forms , all that showed was the data entry -- no other info.When I went to customer support , there was only `` pay '' phone help or preselected topics -- none of which address the problem . This looks like a coding problem with software that has not been properly/fully tested , and the consumer has no way to either infom Intuit about the problem or to get help except to `` pay '' . The program needs to be tested fully before release , and if there are problems that are Intuit 's fault , there needs to be resonable ways to get things fixed.As is , the program is unuable , the only recourse is to return it .
 Confusing , buggy software -LRB- example
 This product is pure junk . You can not finish yourtaxes with this program . The manual update and theone click update do not work . There are 3 errors on my taxesthat can not be fixed without the update.I tried it on my Windows98 SE computer and my Xp . If you follow their instructionsto the letter , you will only waste hours and hours unloadingand reloading this pitiful program . I have used turbotax for5 years , so this version is very disappointing . The bestprogam out there was Tax Edge , but these knuckelheads boughtthem out . So what else can you use to prepare your owntaxes ????????? If you have to buy this junker , get it fromWalmart where they will refund your money .
 I agree with some previous reviewers . This software is BUGGY . Installation itself is not a problem , but excution is . When I ran it for the first time , to my surprise , on many pages different texts were overlaped . It really should not happen to a program that has been sold for so many years . I decide to wait for a while before running it again and hopefully there will be some patches or any sorts that could resolve the problem . It seems that they rushed to get it out before other tax reporting softwares this time .
 This is the first review I 've written on Amazon . Usually when I get bad service or a bad product , I just live with it -LRB- what 's the point of complaining about phone company service ? -RRB- . For some reason , my highly negative experience with the 2004 TurboTax Deluxe software has prompted me to let others know the truth about this product and its maker , Intuit . I guess it 's because I had a generally good impression of Intuit and their products before this . No more.I spent multiple hours trying to troubleshoot installtion problems with the software . Obscure error messages such as `` Could not load Trial Version DLL '' and `` Could not load prd DLL '' were completely unhelpful . As part of this , I spent a lot of time on Intuit 's website entering detailed problem info and trying to find answers in their knowledgebase . When that failed , I tried emailing back and forth with their Tech Support . This did n't produce an answer , but a couple of days after the last email I got this on my voicemail
 I have had it with Intuit . It is one of the most dishonest companies I have ever bought products from . The company 's Web site claims that customers get a free copy of the State return when they buy TurboTax Deluxe . Yet when you run the product and get to the state section , it says you have to buy the State product after all -LRB- $ 29.95 -RRB- . After a half-hour of wading through information on the Web site and the box -LRB- much of which is conflicting -RRB- , I find out that I have to buy the state package , send in a rebate form , then wait for 6-8 weeks to get my state purchase back.I 'm fine to not have the state package not be in the box . But at least they could have found some way to have us trigger a free download based on a license number or bar code in the shipped box . In any case , for Intuit to advertise that the state package is free -LRB- no strings attached -RRB- , then force me to pay $ 29.95 for that package , is completely dishonest . If they want to say up-front that it 's a rebate , that 's fine too -- but instead on the Web site they clearly make you believe that the state package is really free , wait for you to buy the federal package , then catch you once you 've invested significant time in using the product.What is really dishonest about this is that Intuit is making lots of money off selling this `` free '' product . First , they are taking everyone 's money for 6-8 weeks . Free is not free if Intuit has my money for 6-8 weeks and is earning interest off it . Second , they made it so hard to figure out how to get the State package rebate that many people -LRB- including one poster below -RRB- ended up buying the state package because they did n't know better . I would n't be surprised if 20 % of more of people who buy this package also pay full price for the State package too.I will never buy another product from this unreputable company .
 This DVD is poorly done . Not enough detail and not presented in a ` user-friendly ' way . Very un-professional .
 I got this software free with my computer . For the simple task of burning CDs , every time I 'm in the middle of dragging songs over to the Track Layout area , the system says it 's encountered an error and shuts the whole thing down without saving anything . I 've maybe made 2 successful CDs with it -LRB- out of countless attempts -RRB- , but not without some frustration and restarting a couple times . It 's horrible software . Also , there 's no way to edit tracks at all , like making songs shorter , fade out , etc. . So annoying . Do n't bother .
 Zero stars for this company 's products ! I was sold a product direct from them that was incompatible . I have spent hours in arguments over refunds , etc. . Sales reps and Cust Sevr untrained . They DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR COMPANY/PRODUCT ! BEWARE .
 I Purchased ` Perfect Image'on August 2 , 2008 -LRB- Order # 1019051984 -RRB- . Product received Saturday August 30 , 2008 . Four weeks to deliver ; not a good start.After installing the product on my office computer , the CD drive would n't read discs . Error was `` incorrect media '' . I tried using a USB DVD/CD , with the same results . I uninstalled the software , and the devices were once again usable.I thought I would give the product another try on my laptop computer . Product loaded ok , and when I backed up my laptop , ` Perfect Image ' indicated to log off and reboot for the changes to be effective.That is when the lap top completly failed ... on boot I get `` Operating System not found '' My laptop is totally wasted ... wont boot from any MBR order , and like my office computer , the CD drive is `` inop '' , as apperently is the HD.Changing boot order , etc to no avail . It is extremely fortunate that I did not shut my office computer down before removing uninstalling ` Perfect Image ' , or I would have trashed it as well.This is the worst software I have ever used , and I have been doing this for nearly 40 years . I am a EE with a Masters in computer Science , and have never encountered such a poor product , It obviously has serious compatibility issues .
 Does not support Vista 64-bit . I bought this at a retail store and the box says supports windows vista . I get the product home only to find out it does not support 64-bit vistas which is not on the box any where . Also if you need support over the phone its 24.95 the first 10 minutes and then a certain dollar amount for every minute after that . Does n't look like a very good company .
 I wish I would 've checked out Acronis TrueImage before I bought Perfect Image . This software is very so-so , and not anywhere near as simple and convenient compared to TrueImage . Furthermore , the boot/recovery program whether from CD or hard drive , fails to work 50 % of the time whether from not booting or not recognizing your hard drives . The boot program for True Image is slicker and much more polished and is nearly the same as the Windows version -LRB- done in a nice Vista style -RRB- whereas Perfect Image gives you a clunkier and less polished UI when booting directly to it.A major irritant is the product validation which runs every time and will render the software useless if there is any problem or computer hardware upgrade . Your only option is to contact Avanquest and they will get around to responding to you . You are forced to request them to update their validation database so you can run ` your ' program which is currently disabled . This process is quick , only 2 or 3 days to get it resolved.One major advantage of Acronis TrueImage is that you can restore files , folders , all you want from the same backup image . You just ca n't do that with PerfectImage . So on that feature alone , why pay the same amount for less ? Duh !
 Horrible program ! The interface is all in super geek engineer TERMINOLOGY . I have NO IDEA what I 'm doing or what anything means . The ` help ' files are pathetic - also in ` engineer-eeze ' so they are worthless . Ca n't find any help for error messages.Wouldn ' t matter anyway because I would n't have a clue what they 're talking about.Want to guess your way through an important task like backing up a hard drive ? Except you wo n't know if your doing that or one of several other flavors of backup operations . The program offers some different types of backups . I still have no idea which one I should be using , or what the difference is . Now the program is calling my hard disks `` invalid '' . Windows says they are ` healthy ' and they work JUST FINE . But I ca n't back them up because there is NO CLUE about what `` invalid '' means or what to do about it . $ 50 and lots of time down the toilet .
 I realize that my review is not about this product , but I think it is relevant to potential purchasers of Avanquest products . I do not know anything about this particular program , but have had considerable difficulty with Avanquest as detailed below.I purchased My Ultimate Organizer 7.0 via download and subsequent key.I am not making this up - the product displayed a message in Serbo-Croatian telling me the key had expired.Four hours later with Technical Support and the problem is still not resolved -LRB- despite erasing the program , reinstalling , trying different keys , searching the Windows Registry , etc -RRB- . It takes a full hour on hold to get a technical support representative and at the conclusion of the last session , I was told to contact Customer Service for a CD copy in the hopes that that would resolve the issue . Now Customer Service tells me Technical Support must send me the copy , although Technical Support says otherwise . I am out $ 30 for a program that is at this point , totally useless , and left adrift by Avanquest who has my money and refuses to help me.I would purchase Avanquest products with extreme caution . If you have a Technical Support issue , you will have to wait a minimum of 60 minutes on hold -LRB- no 800 number -RRB- , and then get fairly substandard service after that .
 I purchased Perfect Image 12 almost 2 years ago , with the intent of using it . I did n't have an opportunity to use it until just recently , when I wanted to install an SSD in my laptop . Perfect Image did a quick job of backing up the partition , even though the interface was a bit complicated to navigate . I backed up the partition to an external 500GB hard drive , installed the SSD , put windows 7 on it -LRB- to be able to install the Perfect Image software -RRB- and ran the software . It rebooted into a DOS program and started to restore . This was at 9 PM , and I went to bed . When I got up the next morning ~ 530AM , it was still running , about 50 % done and over 8 hours later . Needless to say , I was not impressed . I ended up doing a fresh install all the way .
 This software looks to be a pre windows-7 , and pre 64-bit version ... THIS IS A CHEEP SELL OFF OF OBSOLETE SOFTWARE ... $ 9.99 WOULD BE A FAIR PRICE .
 Buy one of their product once and the will hound with special offer E-mails twice a day for the rest of your life ! Unsubscribing from their mailing list does no good , the SPAM just keeps coming !
 Way too much for Vista . Slows everything down and took 13 hours in safe mode to do total backup .
 I have 64 bit Vista . Looked on the Amazon and Avanquest website , neither stated that the product does not support 64 bit.After it did not load , I called Avanquest and they told me it does not support 64 bit and they did not know when it will or if it ever will .
 the product is more for back ups than copying files . it couldnt even accomplish a simple task or migrating files to a new hardrive it crashed it and corrupted everything instead.i would recommend it for back ups only not for files migration .
 You have got to be kidding . Do not try this on a USB3 drive . It will not work . Can not believe that Avanquest does not trumpet this non-capability on their site . Sure it is in the small print , BUT the market has moved to USB3 .0 The interface is fine for me , but I need the 3.0 capability .
 If you want MORE STRESS with your tax preparation , just try using this worthless program.Last year I tried to download Turbo Tax for California and the program just would n't run correctly so this year I bought the CD . It does n't work either and Intuit 's `` help '' is worthless . The state program refuses to import some of the data from the federal program , and wo n't let me input the data either . So Turbo Tax keeps telling me I owe money when in fact the state owes me a refund . This is after I had to , once again , download interminable files because the state edition was released before it was ready.I will avoid this product in the future . It 's a waste of time and money .
 First off , the program does what it needs to do - pulling in your federal tax info and completing your state taxes.But the inconvenience level is high :1 > Product activation - it 's not hard to do , but if you wind up buying a new computer/rebuilding your current computer and then having to refile taxes , you 'll be stuck dealing with unhelpful Intuit employees who will want you to buy the product again .2 > Lots of updates required and the update download process is unreliable - took several tries to finally get all the downloads . I think it was 40 + files .3 > The big hassle of the rebates - I was pleasantly surprised to see that you could do the rebate online . But it turns out that it just prints a cover page -LRB- with a bar code , so it saves Intuit the work of entering your information -RRB- . You still have to send everything in plus the cover page - you even have to fill out the regular rebate form , even though you just filled out everything online.I 've been a TurboTax user for the past 5 years , but I definitely will try another product for 2003 .
 Here 's a quote from extremetech.com . -LRB- ExtremeTech & sister ; publication PC Magazine 're industry leaders . You 've probably heard of their most famous writer , John C. Dvorak . -RRB- -LRB- Note : Intuit-TurboTax-2002 's C-Dilla was n't different from other versions of C-Dilla . It just got lotsa attention because TurboTax * was * very popular software until C-Dilla became a part of it . -RRB- From ET 's article : `` Likely the biggest problem users have expressed , is the level at which the TurboTax licensing agreement is managed and protected with the SafeCast/C-Dilla technology . People believe C-Dilla infiltrates their system in a very insidious manner , and uses memory and resources even when TurboTax is not loaded . And some believe it has caused them serious compatibility problems with non-related CD writing operations . -LRB- PC Magazine and ExtremeTech will be conducting some tests next week to see if we can duplicate some of these problems -RRB- . -LSB- ... -RSB- or your customers still looking to exit TurboTax for good , the uninstaller at this link now fully removes components of SafeCast/C-Dilla that were previously mostly impossible to remove . '' ... If you 're planning on using this product at work , forget it ... your Info Technology manager will have a cow if he/she knows that you 're installing destructive trojan/spyware -LRB- C-Dilla -RRB- on the company PCs . If you 've already installed this software on a PC at work , let your IT manager know IMMEDIATELY , so he/she can take whatever steps are possible to remove C-Dilla . In the 2002/2003 version of TurboTax , a great protest rose up from prominent computer-industry magazines and users , which led to Intuit/TurboTax somewhat apologizing , and offering a program that uninstalled C-Dilla after you 'd uninstalled TurboTax2002 . -LRB- The original uninstaller did n't remove C-Dilla . -RRB- 2004 ... does it have C-Dilla ? I do n't know . It 's not out yet . Approach with caution .
 have to jump through rebates to obtain state product with deluxe . deluxe did not have necc coupon and had to waste 2 hours to finally talk to a person to figure out what to do next .
 Each year it gets a little more cluttered with advertising , & licensing garbage . Also , there are too many different products making it difficult to choose the right one each year -- wish they would just sell one product that did the job !! The software also seems a little less helpful each year . The `` Deluxe '' , `` basic '' & `` Premier '' software should be replaced by a single product -- this wasteful marketing -LRB- including various mail-in offers , etc. -RRB- just makes extra pointless work for all of us . The Premier verion is greatly overpriced and offers little beyond the basic and Deluxe models to justify its existence ... all of the functionality listed for this model should be included in the basic product .
 I have use Tubro Tax for a long time , but the value is dropping off quick . Might as well just get the `` basic '' version as the `` premier '' has even fewer features than last year . I was disappointed that they dropped the `` Tax Forcaster '' funtion from 2003 . I did not have any problem installing , but was forced to do a complete reinstall with an update corrupted the program . But the overall quality and value is declining . My advice is just stay with the basic if you do n't need to do the state return and hope the Intuit company takes notice and starts to improve their products .
 Since you automatically ASSUMED the problem is MY FAULT let me give you a little more information : I did enter my mortgage interest in the right area . I can READ instructions and you apparently did not understand my issue.And YES I did see the instructions stating `` If you had a HOME OFFICE and paid mortgage interest DO NOT enter your payments here . We 'll ask for that amount later when we cover your home offices expenses '' . Nowhere in my original review did I say I could not deduct mortgage interest for the home daycare . I simply said my problem was that it does not let me PRORATE the interest . When the program asked me for INDIRECT Home office expenses it asks for my entire home mortgage interest , but the IRS themselves and instructions clearly state to prorate this for part year businesses . Which was my case with my wife 's home day care -LRB- 93 days of 2004 -RRB- . TT lets you prorate it here however , the software always overwrites this value with the amount of mortgage interest you claim on Schedule A ; you find this out after you are directed to itemized deductions -LRB- Schedule A -RRB- and TT asks you to enter your deductible mortgage interest for the entire year of 2004 . When I type in the deductible mortgage interest here , the TT software then takes this exact amount and puts it back on form 8829 line 10b . In fact ANY value you enter here is carried over to form 8829 . The only `` calculation '' being done here is a `` copy and paste '' . There is no problem with real estate taxes -LRB- which I also prorated on form 8829 -RRB- . But for some reason Mortgage interest has issues.TaxCut does these calculations correctly , why ca n't TurboTax ? Also why ca n't you admit your software has a bug ? IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR PART YEAR BUSINESSES WHEN IT ASKS FOR YOUR MORTGAGE INTEREST PERIOD.I spent 3 hours on the phone yesterday with TT support and we walked through the interview multiple times and we recreated the problem on EVERY occasion . Even the nice lady I was working with AGREED that there is a problem here . Maybe you should spend a day at customer service and walk through customer issues , or better yet try this yourself to see what I am talking about , instead of always assuming the customer is WRONG.Better yet how about you email me , so I can send you detailed instructions to recreate the problem?I look forward to your response.And since we are on the subject of bugs , I found another one an hour ago : TurboTax gives a home DEPRECIATION credit for a business that started and stopped in 2004 . In my case the home day care that my wife had started 1/12/2004 and ended 4/2/2004 . I entered this information in the TT interview and TurboTax calculated a home depreciation credit of $ 119 . The IRS contacted me today and told me that I ca n't claim this credit . Since you will probably ASSUME I did something wrong here too , and that your `` perfect '' software is doing everything correctly , let me refer to you IRS Publication 946 . On page 6 under EXCEPTED PROPERTY , it states this `` Even if the requirements explained in the preceding discussions are met , you can not depreciated the following property.Property placed in service and disposed of in the same year . `` Here TurboTax is clearly violating this rule for my situation . This is a bug AND the problem stated earlier is a bug as well ; and you will find this out when home business customers come back to you to get their guaranteed reimbursement checks because the IRS audited and fined them.In my case TaxCut does all calculations correctly and covers all details , so I will use them from now on . On the other hand TurboTax ignores IRS rules and does not handle all of the pertinent details in special situations . I already returned TT to the store and exchanged it for TaxCut . Best tax decision I ever made .
 Using TurboTax Premier for Mac was frustrating . First , the program imported my information from Quicken , but the values did not match up with what the federal government was looking for , so I had to reenter everything . The program did not import my stock sales , which was one of the most time consuming aspects of my tax return.Big complaint # 1
 Big drop off in quality this year -LRB- Turbo Tax Premier -RRB- . I 've been using TT for many years now and this is the first year where they have n't improved upon the product , as a matter of fact , it 's a big step backwards . Looks like they 're trying to cut costs by consolidating the desktop and online versions into one product interface . Next year , for the first time , I 'll be taking a look at the other tax programs . Wake up Intuit !!!
 Turbotax premier 2004 has a problem that their reps wo n't admit to . Only one person a TurboTax agreed that theres a problem . This is despite the fact the the IRS themselves told me the TurboTax is not doing the right calculations.My wife started and ended a home daycare in 2004 , however TurboTax forces you to enter the mortgage interest paid on the home for the entire year , eventhough IRS rules for 8829 AND TT instructions itself say you have to prorate all indirect and business expenses for the months you actually had the business . TT has no problems doing this for Real Estate taxes however for some reason it does not let you prorate mortgage interest . If you enter in the prorated value yourself , then TT will calculate your full mortgage interest on Schedule A incorrectly . If you enter the amount of allowable mortgage interest deductible on schedule A , then TT will go back to your form 8829 and make the business portion of mortgage expenses incorrect.You can always override the values with the CORRECT ones , however if you do this you ca n't E-file . Meaning you either have to live with a smaller refund -LRB- 60 % smaller in my case -RRB- , or file manually.I called TurboTax , and she rep was unable to determine if it was a bug with the software , though she tried to deny it . I was on the phone for 3 hours with her . At least she was nice enough not to charge me $ 9.99 . Intuit really dropped the ball this year with their tax software . They label their software `` business '' , however , it only handles basic situations . Their software is way too restrictive to handle special situations -LRB- Like part year businesses -RRB- . What TaxCut does right TurboTax does wrong , What TurboTax does right , TaxCut does wrong . There is no other option other than accepting a smaller refund , or efile and not get all the refund you are entiled too . I see why so many small business owners get audited using crap software like this . At least these programs calculate the state refunds correctly , but then again state returns are so easy , my 4 year old can do it.AVOID TURBOTAX IF YOU STARTED AND STOPPED A HOME BUSINESS FOR PART OF THE YEAR IN 2004 . Oh yeah and to the TurboTax VP who ASSUMED I did something wrong . FYI , I did enter my mortgage interest in the right area . I can READ instructions , unlike you who apparantly did not understand my issue . When the program asked me for INDIRECT Home office expenses it asks for my entire home mortgage interest , but the IRS themselves and instructions clearly state to prorate this for part year businesses . Which was my case with my wive 's home day care . TT lets you prorate it however , the software takes ANY amount you enter in home mortgage interest and assumes that is what you paid for the entire year ; you find this out after you are directed to itemized deductions -LRB- Schedule A -RRB- is asks you for your entire year mortgage interest . This field is pre populated with the PRO RATED mortgage interest form 8829 . However when I type over that value with the full year amount , the TT software then takes this FULL amount and puts it back on form 8829 . The software does the correct calculations when I prorate real estate taxes , why ca n't it do the same with mortgage intrest ? Why ca n't you just admit your software has a bug ? IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR PART YEAR BUSINESSES WHEN IT ASKS FOR YOUR MORTGAGE INTEREST PERIOD.I spent 3 hours on the phone yesterday with TT support and we walked through the interview multiple times and we recreated the problem on EVERY occassion . Even the nice lady I was working with AGREED that there is a problem here . Maybe you should spend a day at customer service and walk through customer issues , or better yet try this yourself to see what I am talking about , instead of always assuming the customer is WRONG.Since we are on the subject of bugs in your software , I found another one an hour ago : TurboTax incorrectly gives me a home DEPRECIATION credit for the day care that my wife started and stopped in 2004 . IRS rules state that no home deprciation credit can be claimed for businesses that started and stopped in the same year . Since you will probally ASSUME I did something wrong here as well , let me direct you to IRS publication 946
 Intuit tech support is useless ! Ca n't get direct responses by e-mail . Ca n't find out how to get through by phone . Considering the potential personal financial ramifications that can result from problems with the software , THEIR LACK OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS CRIMINALLY APPALING ! Do not buy this software !
 The set up has been horrible . I 'm running Windows XP . Crashed my computer 3 times now.When I got to downloading from Quickbooks Pro for small business , software told me I must purchase a 2003 or newer QB Pro . Convenient link to purchase for $ 299 . That 's ridiculous!So now , if I ever get the software up and running again , I have to either manually enter my business records or spend $ 299 . Do n't buy this software if you do n't have to .
 Before i even started to do my tax on Taxcut , i had to import my last year 's return from Taxcut . I CAN NOT DO IT ! The Program keeps giving me an error message . It does not import Taxcut 2003 files ! Warning
 I do n't agree with the biased CPA below -LRB- ca n't buy judgement in a box -RRB- . I 've used TT for years and am an accountant . For MANY people it 's fine . Sure , if you are rich and have complex tax issues , you may need advice . And if you are self-employed you may need help coming up with more deductions which will save you more than you pay for the help , that 's fine . But for most people , with basic tax returns , tax software is fine.BUT BEWARE OF THIS YEAR 'S TURBO TAX!Don ' t do it ! Most likely it wo n't install correctly . Many people this year , including me , simply can not run Turbo Tax . I spent hours on tech support TWICE , tried the `` fixes '' on the message boards at their web site , and still nothing . It simply will NOT run.Intuit used to be a good company with good products and good customer service and tech support . But that was 10 years ago . Now ? Lousy everything . I know more about their products than their tech support people . They seem to have been pulled off the street and given one hour of training.I may try Tax Cut but I 'm bummed about the review below that says TT is better than Tax Cut . If that 's true , TC must REALLY be lousy ! But what else can I do ? TT wo n't work on my computer .
 I have n't used TurboTax in years . I own several apartment buildings and things got complicated . This year I thought I 'd give it a try , but TurboTax Premier was n't up to the job . In going through EasyStep , there is no way to enter when particular buildings were purchased ! That 's right - no way to account for depreciation ! Unbelievable . I chatted online with their tech support twice , and they could n't find a way around it.Someone who was n't paying attention would lose a lot of money by paying a lot of extra taxes.This is incredibly inept on the part of TurboTax . I will never buy anything from Intuit again.In my opinion , the program sucks.P.S . There is a money-back guarantee , but it ai n't easy . You have to chat with them online to get the address , and then return the CD ROM via UPS and pray that you get your money back . In my case , they gyped me on the refund by $ 26 . I am taking action against them . Sleazy company .
 I purchased TurboTax Premiere to help with first year of filing as a sole proprietorship . Overall , software is underwhelming . Actually useful help requires digging through the help menus , the contextual `` explain this '' button -LRB- ooo , and videos -RRB- proved useless to me . Usually they repeated the same text on the page , but slower and more loudly.Example 1
 Do not buy this product if you have tax schedules beyond the simple EZ forms . I have tried to use this software to handle 4 rental properties -LRB- a situation that is suppose to be the purpose for TurboRax Premier -RRB- . It took over 30 minutes for the program to incorporate last year 's tax form data , and then another 15 minutes to save the file . And I am using one of the fastest computers on the market -LRB- Macintosh G5 185 GHz 1 GB DDR SDRAM -RRB- . It crawls through each calculation . I can use a manual calculator and hand enter the information on the forms faster !! I do not know much about computer programmming , but it is clear that this software must have been written for only the simplest of needs.I had the same problem last year , but hoped that surely the company would have improved things ... . but no , it is actually worse this year!Use at your own risk ...
 Mr Meighan 's response that they answer 3700 e-mails/day is bull ! Apparently , their idea of a `` direct response '' is an automated reply that does nothing to adress your individual problem , but suggests generic fixes for simple problems . Me
 Received TurboTax Premier disc from Amazon . During installation , kept getting different installation errors . Intuit website posted SEVERAL options as work-arounds . Spent too much time trying to fix what ended up being a defective disc . On-line chat w / Intuit rep was frustrating , at best . Intuit would not ship replacment disc direct since Amazon is not an `` authorized '' seller . Amazon shipped replacement disc -LRB- took too many days , Amazon -RRB- . Response on Intuit 's website about TurboTax completely unacceptable . Defective product and not ready for market . Have used TT for 15 years - wo n't be using it next year .
 I thought using this product to figure my taxes was a breeze ! Then I tried to file . I could not e-file and to add insult to injury - the program would not allow me to file by mail!After DAYS of frustation , one rep finally admitted that there was a problem with this product and certain operating systems . I meticulously tried every fix -LRB- multiple times -RRB- and nothing worked!So ... it did a good job of helping me figure my tax , but it will not print in a font acceptable to the IRS . . which pretty much renders this product worthless to me .
 I bought this CD because the website version has been down very often recently . Once I loaded it I was amazed at the poor functionality and the lackluster value compared to the identical version available on their website . I honestly never really liked the web version either but the ability to port the data from previous years has been a plus , BUT this software -LRB- CD -RRB- version is the pits . There is no advantage to buying this for $ 30 more than just waiting it out for the website to work AND if you have never used it before , and the web site is not working , then shop around , maybe try the H&R Block web version . They never seem to have technical issues with connections or content like Turbo Tax and they could be considered a little more professional for what you pay for . Intuit just thinks they have the market cornered because they were one of the first web versions . I would say that after the poor performance I 've seen this year , I will not be a returning customer . Good luck on your return !
 Bummed I could n't find the home and business -LRB- guess their not making it anymore -RRB- This program would n't allow me to import information from previous years . I 've always been able to transfer from last years Turbo tax home and business forms . I had to re-type everything manually . No prompt to do it and when I went to the pull down menu I could n't prompt it to import data . Not user friendly , it used to be better .
 I have used Turbo Tax for many years . If you want to file your taxes this year -- choose another program . After completing my return , I tried to download final forms and updates and have spent well over 27 hours trying to do so . I have uninstalled , reinstallled , searched my computer for files , deleted anything related , gone to the support website numerous times . Finally , I did the only thing that may work , requested a refund and bought Tax Cut . Several people I know have had the same problems . I repeat , DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE !
 Last year -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , I used ItsDeductible for an entire year , keeping track of my donations of clothes , money , and other items . I was also able to use the software to keep track of my job-related expenses that are deductible -LRB- ie research expenses of a professor , job related journals , etc. -RRB- There was also a space to keep track of medical expenses . I loved it , and it saved me some money . I just received my new , * not * improved 2005 version , and suddenly , everything has changed . Basically , they made the software LESS useful . They have eliminated the medical expense and the professional expense sections , and now there is only the bare-bones charity donation record keeping . And even this has been drastically cut - many specific categories of clothing , for example , have been cut . Last year , I could be as specific as denim jeans or silk blouses - this year they are listed as `` women 's pants '' and `` women 's shirts '' with no variance in the price that they are `` worth . '' Because of this , I am pretty skeptical that this would pass an audit , so I am now keeping extra records of these donations DESPITE buying the software . I suspect that the company could care less - what are the chances of an audit , anyway ? It is probably cheaper for them to avoid refunds when consumers do n't achieve the promised 500.00 savings than it is to fear the IRS audits , which are few and far between . Final word - rather than improved , this new version is worse . I could do just as well with a notebook and a quick check on ebay for values .
 I just spent 1.5 hrs entering 80 items . Only half of my donated items were included in the ItsDeductible database . I had to manually enter the other half and estimate the value on my own.Even with items such as clothes , I had to just pick an item from the database . It was rare that my donated item actually matched something in the database.This software is not the cure-all that Intuit says it is . I should 've saved my money and entered all of my donations in a spreadsheet like I did in previous years .
 NOTHING TO INDICATE DEDUCTIONS THAT YOU MAY BE OVERLOOKING . NOTHING INDICATING THAT THE PROGRAM CAN ONLY BE USED TO TRACK DEDUCTIONS DURING 2004 , AND CAN NOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING IN ANY OTHER YEAR . REALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY .
 If ever they bring this amazing product back , buy it , just not from this vendor since they send the manual and the CDROM but I ca n't get past the setup screen because they did n't send the serial key to install the package . I 've been deceived .
 um seriously ? If you are too lazy to need a `` Button '' in order to turn off the internet on your computer . . modern day OS like windows 7 and even xp i think . allow you to `` turn off '' the internet by simply right clicking the internet connection button on the taskbar and disconnecting.you dont need to buy this product to do that ...
 I bought this software primarily because of two advertised features : Ability to import from DayTimer -LRB- yes , I have the old DayTimer software -RRB- All those print formatsSo ... it does n't ` import from DayTimer ' at all . You must export into a csv file , map the csv file to Anytime format , and then , Anytime will import your data , ignoring the detailed mapping you just did , so that addresses end up in telephone number fields , personal names in organization name ... and some data I never found at all -LRB- and this is just addresses ! -RRB- And the print ... well , my life is not scheduled in hour increments , half hour calendars suit me better . . and yes , you can select half hour increments . However , when you do that , you only get half a day!I 'm deleting this from my hard drive , and writing off the cost as an educational expense -LRB- Since I 've learned to be more careful before buying software -RRB-
 I have been looking for a good organizer to replace my outdated Lotus Organizer . I am looking for a quality organizer that is simple , practical and easy to use . Anytime Organizer does not meet any of the criteria listed . The best part of this software is the box . It has great illustrations , pictures and lots of hype . What set this software apart for being bad ? 1 -RRB- The manual is poorly written . Half of it shows you how to install the program . Should n't it be automatic and intuitive ? It has two pages of pictures of icons , with no explanation what they do ; 2 -RRB- The graphical interface is more like win95 software . The icons are poorly designed and do not utilize the full potential of XP technology . This sum up the whole story for this program ; 3 -RRB- Menu bars and icons are not adjustable . One size , one look fit all , you can not add , delete or move any of the icons ; 4 -RRB- Entering appointment
 Acutally , it should be zero stars , maybe even minus ten stars.I bought this worthless piece of junk application thinking it would be a suitable replacement for the Palm Desktop software I use now . Like the Desktop , it comes with an expense manager , notepad , task manager , calendar , contact manager , and such . It also comes with a wide variety of pre-designed forms . This is what really excited me.What the outside of the box DOES NOT TELL YOU is that the only things it will sync with on any of the PDA devices it claims to support are your calendar , to-do/tasks and contact/address book entries . The remainder of your PDA data will sync into the old Desktop application , forcing you to have to retain it . You can not import them into AnyTime.So , I decided to scrap AnyTime . This is where the next heartache begins . The uninstaller leaves the conduits in place that sync into AnyTime forcing you to have to uninstall the Palm Desktop as well to remove them.Help is non-existant as well . Individual Software will respond with apologies and tell you they will forward your request but no one actually helps you.My recommendation -- look elsewhere for an alternative to the Palm Desktop . I have n't found anything yet . I had thought for a few hours I had , but ... So , before you even try it , be sure to back up your data from your old desktop environment . My back up was two weeks old so you can figure out what I lost in the process of learning a lesson.To the buyer beware . Do not buy anything from Individual Software . Take it from one who knows , you 're making a major mistake if you do buy this application .
 First impression - not impressed.Further on - worse.I purchased this very inexpensive product -LRB- $ 7 or $ 8 -RRB- for one purpose
 I have been using Turbo-tax for my business for 5 years . This will be the last year.My first experience was trying to install this product . For three attempts -LRB- including restarting the machine -RRB- , all times it hung up after saying `` Installing components '' . Frozen . Then I went to the customer service site . Good luck.Intuit has horrendous customer service . You can not call them nor can you get answers . Their online library is weak in finding what you need . They say they have online chats but after waiting 15 minutes twice I gave up -LRB- who knew how long it would be ? -RRB- . Just as I was about to return the product , I found an article which said you had to disable your antivirus . Tried it , still did not work . Another article said to restart in `` safe '' mode your computer . This worked , and after 3 reboots it appeared to work on the install . To me this is absurd - I have never had to do this to install other programs , and I worry what it did to my computer in that mode.My other gripes with Intuit is that you have to buy state taxes from them since hardly anyone carries it -LRB- that way they get all the margin -RRB- , they essentially price-fix in the market -LSB- ... -RSB- If you want the original tax program , go ahead and try it . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I use this year after year because it ties into QuickBooks . The software is OK , but for the last three years I 've had the worst support experiences of my life . This year I did n't understand something on the mailing they sent me so I called them . The support person kept telling me in broken English to click on this , or select that . I kept telling her I was looking at a piece of paper and she just did n't get it . Last year I spent three hours in on line chat with a tech person named `` Bob '' because my software decided to uninstall .
 I have been using Turbotax business for years . Never was too happy with it , but it was OK and a good value compared to having a tax accountant do my return.This year they reached lows that I did not think possible :1 . Program does not work unless it updates itself after installation . However , it was unable to connect through my firewall and just froze . I had to reboot every time .2 . Called the `` tech support '' . Since I do n't speak ` Indian ' , and he spoke a barely legible English , we had a hard time understanding each other . His solution was to turn off the firewall . This is not possible since it is built into the router . He gave up . Asking for supervisor was useless . After 30 minutes on hold I was disconnected . That was espeially bad since other programs , including Quickbooks , have no problem connecting to updates through the same firewall .3 . I gave up and went to search their website for answers . Took me almost 30 minutes to go through a convoluted search and reach a download site that had the needed update .4 . Preparing the tax return itself was easy enough .5 . When I came to the State Tax Return I found out that it was not being sold at retailers . I could only get it directly from Intuit website . A link fron Turbotax took me to the website where I was told that it will cost $ 39.99 for the State . I went through the purchase process . ONLY AFTER they got my credit card number they informed me that price is actually $ 59.99 . No explanations . They got me in a corner and wanted more ... I tried to get to a live person to straighten this out - FAT CHANCE . Ended up paying and swearing that next year I will go with anybody but them .6 . When is Microsoft coming up with their version ? I never thought I would be rooting for microsoft on anything , but I would go to a great length to get rid of Quickbooks and Turbotax . Not because these are bad programs - only because of Intuits attitudes and incompetance.Longest review I have ever written . Really really upset ...
 If I could give it 0 stars I would!This was the first year that I tried TurboTax for Business . I had very high hopes . I needed some hand holding through the complexities of Corporate Income Tax reporting.In the past , I have been very pleased with the PERSONAL version of TurboTax and thought that the business version would be comparable if not better given the price that was nearly 3 times as much as the personal version.Boy was I wrong ! This software is the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever purchased . I was hoping to get a little extra insight into the actual calculations and be guided clearly through some of the deductions , income , and myriad other data input requirements . This product was nothing more than an automated IRS form . Literally , the software goes through the 1120 form and asks the same questions in the same order . If you are confused by the IRS form , you will get no help from TurboTax . When you need more clarification , the HELP button basically duplicates the words from the IRS Publications/Instructions . Heck , the program does n't even automatically determine whether you file the 1120 or the 1120A -LRB- Short form -RRB- based on your input . Something that would be quite simple to do . If you wish to change later to the short form , it wo n't even transfer the data to the condensed form . You have to reenter everything . -LRB- Assuming you can find where to select the 1120A -- I have n't found it yet . -RRB- Bottom line
 A horrible , buggy , user-unfriendly program . First , you spend several hours fighting with the installation and update process trying to get the program to work . Then , you spend more time -LRB- much more time -RRB- triple checking the calculations and having to override turbotax 's calculations in order to get the correct values to appear .1 . If you do n't have a decent understanding of the underlying tax rules and are n't familiar with the tax forms , you 're playing with fire if you go through the interview and think that turbotax is going to output a proper tax return . If you do n't know what you 're doing , see an accountant .2 . If you do know what you are doing , then save yourself the time , money , and aggravation and just do your it by hand - use the free fillable PDF forms that you can download off the IRS and state websites . That 's what I 'll be doing next year .
 My CD rom looks exactly like this one , and it will not open on my Windows XP . I do not think this is right to sell this because it is an old piece of software , and you have to get it updated , but how?Thanks , Nancy
 Old product . Works only with Windows 98 or older . Great for setting up scenes in 6 formats -LRB- Thanksgiving , farm , etc. -RRB- , tho . Beware for virus !
 No better than Mathematics Calculus 1 . Outdated in its slant on Calculus . Go back to the basics . Get a book !
 RoboDemo does a pretty good job of recording demos , but the company is so scared of piracy that they made the software impossible to use in certain situations
 This antivirus does not work well with windows xp . After downloading windows service pack 1 scanning slowed to a crawl half way thru and caused a major power drain on my system . Also causes banging and clanging of hard drive on disc defragmenter and causes slowdown problems at shutdown . I removed it from my computer and switched to Safeworld anti-virus and have no problems at all . .
 I never used this item , moved forgot it and then it was outdated and win wanted me to buy a full price new one . Does anyyone want it ?
 This product is too expensive for the little it does . It is a lame duck compared to Webroot Spy Sweeper . Ultra wincleaner one click is a far better product .
 Aperture 1.5 was great , but do yourself a favor and buy 2.0 instead . A much improved work of art and less expensive to boot .
 I 've owned this software since it 's ridiculously overpriced $ 500 1.0 inception . Even at it 's latest 1.5.1 $ 299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves . I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs , so I 've been devoted to Apple to say the least . I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer . I have been more than patient with this software . It looks great , up to Apple 's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs . And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money -LRB- much more than the cost of the software itself ! -RRB- , they will not provide support on anything except installation ... even if there software update is the source of the issue . As someone who has been such an Apple fan , I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE .
 I wanted to like this product . I really , really did . The quickie demo movies all made it seem like it was a breeze to use , but for me , the reality is very different.Out of all the Pro apps , this one has the most ill-conceived user interface . Even if you are very highly experienced with other raw conversion software packages out there -LRB- and I 've used pretty much all of them extensively -RRB- , very little is obvious , and the button tooltips are sparse and non-descriptive . Granted , it 's a complex product that does complex things , but I have a hard time believing anyone on the engineering team responsible for this heap has any professional photography or retouching experience whatsoever . Logic and Final Cut have even higher feature densities , and they still manage to put the controls where you expect them to be when you expect them to be there . The obvious difference of course is that Logic and Final Cut were both developed by someone other than Apple originally , and those people knew what they were doing.It 's also very , very slow . Think you 're going to whiz through adjustments like they do in the demo movies ? Unless you 've got a top-of-the-line Intel system , think again . Even with the loupe view active , on my G5 I get nothing but beachball cursors for anywhere from 10-30 seconds every time I touch an adjustment slider , and frequently the image just plain fails to update at all.Probably the single biggest Aperture flaw however is its arrogant solipsism . Even though everybody knows this is not supposed to be a Photoshop replacement , Apple seems to have gone out of its way to pretend that Photoshop does n't exist . Aperture can not read or display anything but the absolute simplest of Photoshop files , so if you need to do some localized adjustments non-destructively with layers , you can pretty much forget about round-tripping them back into Aperture . They 'll either display as absolute garbage , or as a simple white square with a text message alerting you to the fact that `` This layered Photoshop file was not saved with a composite image '' in multiple languages.And of course , it does n't support DNG files , tethered shooting or medium format backs , either . Is n't this supposed to attract the pros?I have no doubt that some people will love this app , but every time I launch it I find myself wincing . Lightroom is by no means a perfect product and I have a great many complaints about the way it does some things , too , but at the end of the day , it does let me get my work done pretty quickly . I can not say the same about Aperture , and its price tag is frankly just ridiculous .
 Forget about this product . Managing photo collections is a horrible slow-motion experience filled with bombs , unexplainable occurrences and incredibe inefficiency . This program was not ready for release and it shows in almost every phase of the application . The interface is terrible and the results are inconsistent and amateurish . This program DOES NOT run like the Quicktime demos which Apple shows . In action the most consistent feature is a spinning beachball as the application plods through even minor tasks . Check back again in two years when Apple either `` upgrades '' this to a real product or allows this pig to die a well-deserved death .
 I 've had this product for some time now and I can not make a good image . I have tested my memory and other hardware and spent a long time trying to get it to work . I just can not in common with many other purchasers . If you do decide to buy get a trial first and make sure you a are not wasting your money
 HyperSignJr - does not function on Windows XP or the CD is corrupt and their is no support from the Vendor . There others are all introductions to the products -LRB- Demo 's -RRB- so only a small amount of functionality is available in the product . There is more information available via the Web than there is in these products combined.The only product in this set that is usefull is SingingAvatar Illustrated Dictionary , but there are better free sites for learning signing.Overall , very disappointing - Sorry to say .
 I am trying to learn ASL becuase my daughter was born with hearing loss , well this program really sucks , it doesnt work to weel on my computer , and they sign sentences and you dont know what sign go to which word , super sucks , dont waste your money
 Omnipage Pro 12 loves to crash . So much so , that it is impossible to batch convert a folder of files to Adobe Acrobat . pdf `` image with text '' , which is the only really useful Adobe Acrobat format . Here we are in the year 2003 , and software developers still have n't figured out how to gracefully exit their programs when the unexpected happens . Ominpage Pro 12 simply can not deal with Adobe Acrobat . pdf formats well . Review the user groups on Scansoft 's website , and you will see two major problems with its Acrobat compatibility . The first is when using Scansoft on an existing . pdf image file . Importing the . pdf file , capturing the text , and saving the file as . pdf `` image with text '' -LRB- which is supposed to save the ORIGINAL image with searchable background text -RRB- causes the image to degrade . Do n't ask me why , but the image in the output file is not the same quality as the imported . pdf image . So to work around this issue , I started scanning our documents into . tif format -LRB- 600x600 -RRB- on our high speed scanner , and then importing the . tifs into Scansoft , for conversion to . pdf `` image with text '' . The resulting . pdf files were graphically sharper than when I had imported existing . pdf files . The big problem is that running the Omnipage Pro 12 `` Schedule OCR '' on the folder of . tif files , Omnipage Pro 12 simply crashes at random places in the conversion process . No graceful exit . No warning . To summarize , Scansoft 's Omnipage Pro 12 is inadequate to save files as . pdf `` image with text '' . It crashes . And this happens on both a Windows 98 PC and a Windows 2000 PC , so it 's not a PC-specific issue . Scansoft wants to charge you -LSB- a fee -RSB- to submit a problem form . Imagine , paying them to spend time fixing their own mistake ! This is a bad way to conduct business .
 This does not come with any real instructions , just a help section . I found it very difficult to do anything with this . I decided to just junk it and go back to paper , pencil and ruler .
 When I heard that Roxio was making this software suite , I was thrilled and the reviews were great . If you actually buy your music from iTunes , though , those songs wo n't show up in the mix . Music Magic Mixer wo n't read them because they 're in proprietary formats . This app would be much cooler if Apple had n't caved in to the music industry . If you find a workaround for the copy protection , you 're set for a great app that rediscovers your music collection for you . But that 's illegal.Since Podcasts are built into iTunes now , iPodder X is basically pointless , and the speech app is n't any better than TextEdit 's speech function . But CD Spin Doctor is a cool app , and Audio Hijack has its obvious uses . I 've been transferring music from a minidisc collection I naively built a few years ago to my Mac and Spin Doctor works great . If you only want one of these apps , though , you can just pick them up from one of the original developers for 25 bucks or so , but that 's not much of a savings , so you might as well buy this . In fact , you 'll likely discover a use for the apps other than the one or two you want .
 First off , I make very few purchases on line . Purchased this item based in a large part by the positive reviews in Amazon . When I received this item , I found that the programs it contained did not function as advertised . Found something better and have not used this product since its inital tryout . I wish I had not purchased it .
 The idea behind Easy Child is great , and if it were a better software program , I 'd be absolutely in love with it . However , in the 3 weeks I 've owned it , I 've had difficulty with it . Last night I finished up printing out last week 's reports , I went to bed , and this morning when I woke up wanted to print out the coming weeks ' worksheet -LRB- EASY CHILD would n't let me do that last night -RRB- , but OH MY I do n't have any installed printers -LRB- Windows XP says I have 2 -RRB- ! Apparently , Easy Child has a problem when it rolls from one week to the next . The first week I installed it , the product worked great until Saturday morning , when lo and behold , I did n't have authorization to use the software ! 3 days later and multiple emails to the help desk , I was `` authorized '' again.The product is inefficient -LRB- to print out reports for each child , the printer must be set up again and again -RRB- when it is working correctly , and is difficult to accomodate even easy modificiations to the system -LRB- for example , my kids are not required to do all Expected Behaviors for all 7 days of the week , but the Level Chart automaticly calculates weekly points and levels based on the child 's performing the Expected Behaviors for all 7 days . Thus , I must manually force the program to calculate the levels the way it really works in my house -RRB- Great idea , Bad Product .
 If I had actually received the product , maybe I could give a favorably review . The truth is many have tried to order to product to have it not work or just did n't receive it after ordering it . And worst yet , no one answers your calls or emails . The `` voicemail '' has been full or months at least . So they 've stolen my money , and I have no product or anyone to resolve it with . Also the BBB has given them an F rating . If only i 'd know that before I ordered . Please , lets not give them anymore money . Clearly they are still collecting .
 We are new fosters parents that purchase this software in hopes to help a foster child directly from their website.We got a temporary license that only worked for 3 days and the software locks saying a new license key is needed.So far , Encourage software has ignored all calls and email to send new keys.When we tried to get our money back , again no calls or emails responds , so do not believe the money back warranty.As far as we know as of March 2011 , the company is no longer in operation but still collecting money for software that does not work . This should be considered Theft so Buyers beware .
 I have raised five kids and am now helping raise two grandkids . This is by far the best program I 've ever tried . My grandkids ca n't wait to do their chores and earn their rewards .
 I have no idea if this product works as I ordered it directly from the company as a download . The download would not work . I attempted to contact the company via e-mail and telephone and was unable to get a response from this company . The telephone # is 1800-567-0046 . Try it and see . You will receive a voice mail stating at the end the mail box is full . It has been this way over a month . I would never purchase anything from this company again .
 I 've been around my share of software in my time , both on Mac and PCs . But I have never , ever experienced such a user-UNFRIENDLY bit of software as Peachtree Complete Accounting . Navigation is not at all straightforward , actually there is nothing about Peachtree that is remotely straighforward ! Even attempting to register the product was a nightmare.I was setting this up for the company I work for and it began to look like it was going to take a year just to enter all of the banking and vendor information . And unfortunately , Peachtree considers bills such as utilities , as a vendor , so you are forced to enter meaningless infomation such as Net Terms and SHIPPING just to be able to key in your electric bill.I could go on and on about how horrible this software is , but ... While struggling with this , I decided to order Quickbooks Pro and use them both so I could compare . Hands down , Quickbooks was just so much better in every respect.Now , I 'm sure there are some die hards out there who just ca n't say enough about how good this product is , but trust me , if you are n't a CPA and you do n't have the time to mess around with a poorly designed software package , just skip Peachtree , it 's not worth the aggravation .
 This program is very inflexible and rigid . On board Help files are very limited and I 've never dealt with another company who seems to care less about supporting their product as you can tell just by trying to find out where to write or call . Unless you 're paying the bucks for a support plan , you 're toast . However , given the price of the software , which is expensive , you 'd think some consideration would be given to users . If I ran my company the same way Peachtree support is managed , I 'd be bankrupt .
 We 've been using Peachtree for some time , but this will probably be the final year . For a relatively new release the large number of items in the Sage Knowledgebase indicates some serious issues with this release.My notes : Multi-user capacity is now down to a maximum of 5 users . Makes running an accounting department difficult . You will most likely have to have users share user names and passwords . Bye bye to any audit trail . If you consider your business larger than a small company - buy some other software.Installation is a pain and may the gods help you if you make a mistake . Data path errors can only be corrected by removing then reinstalling the software . Come on Sage . You have got to be kidding me here.Be aware that your machines will need version 2 of the dot net framework so install that and it 's updates before you tackle Peachtree install.You can not change Peachtree users while anyone else is in the system . You need exclusive access apparently . Of course , since you can only have 5 users disruption can only be minimal.Version 2008 is significantly slower than previous versions.In a multiuser environment installation of updates and tax updates can change your shared data . Always backup your company -LRB- ies -RRB- first.Version 2008 interface is horrible . I used to think the 2005 version bad , but would love to have it back know.If you need the Tax Service , be aware that you will be forced into upgrading Peachtree every 2-3 years .
 My client had me upgrade them from version 2004 to 2007 . 2007 worked the first time , then failed to run . 2007 also locked us out of the old version with a looping error message that required Task Master to kill . Sage technical support was unresponsive . I uninstalled 2007 and then 2004 worked fine . The client is considering conversion to another accounting program .
 The product might have been good if I would have received the product to try it .
 For about 5 ringtones after I bought this program it worked fine . All of a sudden I 'm getting `` fatal errors '' and the program no longer works . Nothing on my computer has changed . I tried all of the tips on the Xingtone website but nothing is working . Looks like I 'm going to have to give Magix a try.XINGTONE R.I.P
 This might not be a good investment if you do n't reside in the United States
 While its low price makes it appear to be a good purchase for a small business , it has a lot of drawbacks.To name a few :1 . Must be installed by someone with Administrator rights .2 . Must be run by someone with Administrator rights .3 . Can only run from a C
 I have to agree with the previous reviewer . It is almost impossible to make a correction once an entry is saved . In my case , I can not figure out how to change the account on a saved transaction The instructions in the manual do n't work because I suspect they are incomplete . So the only option is to contact the company for help and at a whopping price ! Some savings ! Do n't waste your money on this program . Buy Quickbooks or Peachtree and save yourself a lot of grief .
 the Pinnacle studio quick start software will not launch . I stayed on the `` preparing to install ... '' box for 13 hours and it never loaded . I did it 3 times I even asked someone else to check it just in case I was doing something wrong . the same thing happen to them.I 'm not happy with this product the only good thing about this is I only paid a few bucks with your company .
 Why is Amazon permitting this to be sold ? Peachtree will not allow software dated prior to 2007 to be registered , and the software self-destructs after 8 logins if it is n't registered , so in other words you are buying something you can only open 8 times !
 What has this go to do with putting Karaoke on an Ipod ??? That 's what I asked for .
 Beware ! This program is software snake oil . The description and sales materials make Search and Recover sound like it can recover everything . Unfortunately , it does n't live up to all the hype . I tried to recover files from a hard drive , a Secure Digital card , and USB thumb drive , and nothing worked!To make matters worse , even Iolo 's tech support has no idea how the product works . Before I purchased this awful program , I sent an email to Iolo asking them if the CD was bootable . It is NOT !! I only wish I had read the reviews here before I spent money on this piece of junk . You have been warned .
 It completely sucks . The software starts scanning and then gets stuck `` not responding '' , when I finally got it to scan it never found any of the pictures I recently lost , I tried to use the `` recover '' feature but it was not responding after it finished scanning . A complete pain in the ass , lost my money , never got the pictures or files I wanted . It scans things you have been looking at in the computer , so if you were reading about a movie or looking at some clothes recently , that is what you will recover .
 I agree with the other 2 reviews-this SUCKS ! I give it a -0 if Amazon had a score that low . I put the thing on a `` deep scan '' and waited FOURTY TWO HOURS for this P.O.S. to recover ... NOTHING ! It froze up on me too . All it did was come up with s -- t I already knew was there and traces of half-mangled temp file pix that I had already dumped from cookies and cache via Disk Cleanup . Gee , thanks for sorting thru my TRASH ! The C.S. Rep was dumb as a box o ' rocks , and even an old Tech like me could not show sympathy as I let her have it . She knew less about the product than I did after using it ! People
 This software does n't work at all . I had 3 partitions on my hard drive and accidentally erased 2 partitions . This software was only able to `` see '' the files on the unerased partition and could n't recover the other 2 erased partitions . I had better luck with R-studio recovery software and was able to recover 100 % of my lost data !
 WOW , I ca n't believe I did n't read the reviews before I opened the box.The only upside is I paid 19 , not 35 dollars . Other than that ... its a waist of money ... the other REVIEWERS nailed it right on the head , I have nothing new to say , just reinforcing their opinions .
 Installed this on two PC 's , lap & desk , does n't work half the time on either . Program `` not responding '' is quickly becoming the most seen phrase on my systems.It also has conflicts with some previously installed programs , and no solution or workaround is suggested . Other programs must be uninstalled before running S&M ; # 7 or even leaving IT installed as is just as quick to pop-up a conflict with ... message.Other reviewers are right , I suspect tech support is only a dead letter box -LRB- file 13 -RRB- . No help here . It promptly automates a blanket response , then forgets about you . It does however manage to send you daily emails about how good this product is . Thou dost protest too much.On the up side , this product is bound to improve the much sullied reputation of car mechanics .
 These are two unbelievably abominable products . Neither will install on my system , and the ongoing dialogue with their so-called tech support has done nothing to improve this situation . It is now mid-February 2007 . My problems began in October , 2006 -LRB- Search and Recover -RRB- and December , 2006 -LRB- System Mechanic 7 -RRB- . During the time that iolo tech support strung me along , my 30 day return window closed behind me . Since last October , I have incurred hours worth of long distance charges -LRB- because iolo has no toll-free support number -RRB- . Customer service stubbornly refuses to refund my money , and a certified letter to iolo 's CEO , Noah Rowles has yet to generate a reply .
 This is a USELESS 40 $ purchase which does n't even recognize the 7 photo files that ARE on my SD card , much less recover the ones I lost after I accidently changed the format . Getting my hopes up AGAIN with the promises of this program ... . after a rare cruise with and rare photos of my dad who has now passed away .
 I would give a nagtive -100 score if there is.A terrible product without any quality and customer suport at all , totally waste my hours of time . the most ridiculous thing is the manufacturer send me a CD with invalid key . IF THIS is not enough , the customer service is REALY A JOKE . They hide any support telephone number with email and links instead , while send out email , response back links and knowledge base links . A JOKE , no product key , send links is useless.This product should be sued for waste Customer time!THere is also blue screen crash for the install process . WHAT A inferior and junk product they provided . THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT IN MY LIFE TIME from BOTH quality and support view . I would give -100 score .
 I like Iolo . I have System Mechanic 5 , and it 's one of the best software titles in the world . SM 6 , however , is atrociously bad , beyond hope.Bury SM 6 , before it buries your machine .
 The program does n't do anything well . Even something simple like backing up the Registry hangs my XP system . Run any analysis , let it `` fix '' the problems and when you rerun the analysis it finds the same problems . Norton Internet Security flags several of its options as `` High Risk '' . Even if it actually fixed anything , it does n't tell you what it 's going to change before it does it and the logs show nothing . Stay away !
 The only thing worse than System Mechanic 6 is iolo 's technical support . Do n't inflict this plague upon your computer . Had I read Amazon 's reviews first , I 'd have stayed away from this train wreck .
 I ordered System Mechanic 6 software . I received the CD-ROM and loaded the software . The User ID and Serial number provided with the CD-ROM , did not unlock the software.Returned software , in exchange for another System Mechanic 6 . I received the second copy of System Mechanic 6 software . I loaded the software , using the supplied CD-ROM . Once again , the User ID and Serial number provided with the CD-ROM , failed to unlock the software.The bottom line , thus far , is the manufacturing quality control process is woefully inadequate.I look forward to the speed in which , the manufacturer corrects , this error .
 I was a user of System Mechanic 5 , which was a decent product , so I upgraded to 6 . This version tries to make it easier to use by removing most of the decisions a user has to make . The only problem is it makes BAD decisions . At this point I would not be surprized if I had to take down my entire system to get it working properly again . Frankly I do not understand the positive reviews of this product . My advice is to STAY AWAY . But if you decide to use it , before you do back everything up with a Ghost type product so you can completely undo the changes . Despite what Iolo promises , they can not undo all of the changes their software makes . Also , do n't use the Wizards , which sound great but will do all kinds of bad things if left to make their own decisions .
 Installed System Mechanic 7 on Pentium 4 laptop running Windows XP and it crashed the machine to the point the only way to bring it back to life was to system-restore to the nearest pre-Iolo restore point . Managed to capture the error codes and emailed them to Iolo tech support . Unable to elicit a response from tech support other than automated emails -LRB- half of which try to sell me the product all over again -RRB- . Left voicemails with customer support and even with the corporate receptionist . No response . No response to request for refund.OBVIOUSLY , MANAGEMENT IS UNWILLING TO STAFF TECH SUPPORT WITH ANYTHING LIKE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO HAVE LIVE PEOPLE ADDRESS REAL ISSUES . BUYER BEWARE !!!!!
 I bought the SW through ZoneLabs and for some reason the user and license key I got are useless to install the already-paid updates of this SW , even after following suggested fixes . I have sent 4 emails to customer service -LRB- no tel. is ever provided anywhere -RRB- and I have always received the same -LRB- useless for my case -RRB- canned reply with -LRB- useless -RRB- suggestions to fix the problem . The SW seemed to work fine when it worked but at this moment I have had to uninstall the product . I would not consider renewing or buying again from this company . The customer service is just AWFUL
 Screwed up my wireless and my scanner . Still can not get my wireless to work again after months of trying . Made no difference in computer performance . Did not fix any problems . File cleanup takes over 12 hours with only modest results . Do n't buy it !
 This is not the product ! System Mechanic 6 attempts to automate maintenance decisions , but the user is unable to tell what decisions / changes are made . When BAD changes are made , it is practically impossible to diagnose what went wrong . In my experience , it makes MANY bad decisions and the only recourse is to reverse the changes made . Sometimes this is not easy and it takes some clever manipulation at boot time , etc. . This software is not recommended .
 I have been trying to use this product for a week to no avail . I ca n't get any help throught IOLO 's 24/7 email help and the program is very non profesional . It will give a list of fixes it will make but doesn ; t give exact nature of fix -LRB- like what key or program -RRB- and will not let you individually select what to keep.After running the fix none of my roxio software would work and I had to restore my hard drive to get everything back to the way it was . It would find spyware yet would n't clean the spyware and after using numerous othe spyware programs came to the conclusion there was n't any to find . Also the biggest reason NOT to buy this software is of their refund policy . The give you a 30 day limping trial so therefor no refunds !! Stay away from this one
 After this product caused chkdsk to run so many times at reboot , I was glad to get this thing off my PC . Also , it does not perform according to options selected , removing items as it sees fit , and it does not propose individual actions before performing them , even though it claims it will . It does not log what changes it does make , and it seems to make no difference at all in my PC 's performance . It did free up memory , but it took so long to do it , it was n't practical anyway . If I could give 5 stars for junk , this product would earn them , rating first in lack of utility ; first in destructive performance ; first in lack of user control , first in lack of documentation ; and first in cost-uselessness .
 I had installed System Mechanic 5 Pro as an alternative to Norton , which could not handle multi-threaded systems . It was great . When version 6 came out , I installed it . Version 6 has been nothing but trouble .1 . I had to restore my OS from a backup because the system would begin their `` Boot time defragmenter '' , which I cancelled after 27 hours -LRB- by rebooting , the `` Hit any key to cancel does n't work not matter when you hit it -RRB- .2 . I had to disable the automatic update notification , because it would constantly nag me to install the same update I had just finished installing .3 . I tried getting some assistance from their proported 24/7 support team , and the only answer I would get is to install the update . When I called them on their non-anwser , they told me to wait a week for the new update . It still , after two weeks wants me to re-install itself .4 . As others have noted , the `` problems '' that it `` finds and fixes '' will be found to need fixing the next time you run the program again .5 . And , to add insult to injury , the company that handles their rebates , apparently lost my UPC code , and is refusing to process the rebate until I mail the original UPC to them . As there is only one of these , and it has been mailed to them , I am screwed.In conclusion , if you have Version 5 , stay with it . If you do n't have any version , get the Version 5 . If you get Version 6 , have a good backup of the boot partition .
 Nice eye candy . Nothing works properly . Slows system down . Most updates lock up . Always tells me I have major error on hard drive even though its brand new and runs perfectly . P.O.S. Buy System Mechanic 5 instead .
 This so called `` utility software '' is way beyond bad . It is a piece of junk -LRB- replace junk with a lot more colorfull words -RRB- . I bought this even though all the reviews tell you not to even consider it . Well I found out the hard way that they are all right . I have now spent many hours to try and restore my computer to get it to even work . DO NOT GET THIS SOFTWARE ! It will cause nothing but grief and regret .
 System Mechanic 6 not only hangs up its self , but hangs up my computer when it tries some `` analses '' . Also the company does not answer questions about problems -RRB- there are many -RRB- . Sorry I spent money on this product . Would like to know what to do .
 This will not `` fix '' anything , especially if you have anti-virus software installed . Your computer will lock up if you run this program , as it has done in previous versions of the software . DO N'T BUY !!!!
 I too agree with all the other product reviewers . System Mechanic 6 from iolo is a waste of money . If you have version 5 , stay with it , you 'll be better off . Most options/features do n't work , and you are nagged to death about how poorly your computer is performing . I have run back-to-back the ` Total Care ' feature of the program . It would fix the ` non-existant ' problems on the first run , reboot , and detect the very same problems again on the second run . This software is nothing more than eye candy , and represents software bloat at its finest . Also beware that this product will constantly detect any spam filtering software as a parasite . As a result you will be forced to re-install your spam filtering software , or re-enable it via the menu options . I have noticed that the software will crash on a semi-regular basis , and become unresponsive . This makes the software in my eyes nothing but a waste of your HARD EARNED MONEY ! I am running the current 6.0 -LRB- Q -RRB- version , so not much seems fixed as of yet . If you go to the iolo web site you will see the long list of version changes . They appear to be rapid fire , and suggest to me that this software was released way too early . Anyone who buys it now is nothing more than a BETA tester for their product , since they hope you will complain about what 's broken , so they can ` fix ' it . This was nothing more than a ploy by iolo to get this product on the retail market for the holiday sales season , bugs and all ! DO N'T BE TAKEN IN LIKE I WAS , SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT FOR A STABLE VERSION TO BE RELEASED .
 wont work out of the box and support is not able to fix it .
 I have been a very happy user of System Mechanic since version 3 . It kept getting better and better with every version , until this version came out . I have never seen a such an easy to use and useful program take as large of a nose dive from one version to the next until I saw System Mechanic go from version 5 to 6 . It is literally a miserable mess . Tell me SM6 creators , why is it the program wants to connect to the internet SEVERAL times a day ? Why have you added so many background processes to my start up that I have no option of turning off in SM settings ? Did you know you considered my nvidia video card software as malware and disabled it ? -LRB- ... -RRB- I miss the ease of the earlier versions .
 Adobe promised big things for inDesign . They delivered on most all of them . Unfortunately , in their desire to make this program all things to all people compatible , they made it slow loading and cumbersome to work with . Even a two or three page document can take many seconds to load . Stick with Quark XPress until Adobe can get this one right .
 After installing in Sony vgc-ra810 system crashed . Unable to find C : . Have been waiting two days for a legitimate answer from I0L0 and now have two case ## . Phone attempts are met with automated replys the same as the internet . The Amazon seller has been very helpfull so I can not blame him . If I ever get my computer running I plan on visiting all sites that support reviews with a word of advice about lack of HUMAN product support by IOLO . As for now I wanted to get this out to Amazon customers so I am using my neighbors computer .
 To be honest I wanted to include this programe with other programes I wished to buy but I changed my mind after reading the revews in the page , I didnt use the software but I trusted the users who talked about it
 I bought this software and immediately installed on my modern Gateway desktop computer with 512 Ram and CPU speed of 3.1 . I thoroughly tested the program , surprisingly this program is buggy and there are too many errors like the following :1 . It recommends to optimize the speed because it `` detected '' that it was slow , I ran the optimize speed component that came with it , and reran the program 's diagnostic program again , it is still `` slow '' . I think this is a bad design and not helpful , because this program if it detected the speed problem and corrected it with its optimizer , then when rerun the diagnostic the speed should have improved , from `` poor '' to good .2 . Many of the program 's components simply freeze or not responding , bad behaviored when ran , I had to ctrl-alt-del to tell window to end it . It is buggy , big , and fat ! 3 . After the `` optimizing '' of internet speed , my internet speed noticeably slowed instead of increasing speed , many sites or internet trusted sites simply did not display its content , wait , wait , and wait , which is the contrary of its purpose . Instead of 300 % faster , I possibly got 300 % slower.After struggled with it for 2 days , and losing too much time , I simply can not stand it anymore because of the freezing when running this program . I uninstalled it and regain the speed and stability of my Gateway desktop computer.Simply , one word `` Disappointment ! `` IF YOU HAVE AN ENEMY THAT YOU WANT TO HURT , GIVE IT SYSTEM MECHANIC 6 , THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO DO IT ! -LRB- A joke ! -RRB-
 All of us appreciate those of you who take the time to write your reviews . What 's become clear is that many programs function differently depending on what kind of computer you 're using . So , to help those of us who are shopping for a program , would it be possible for everyone at the beginning of their review to include the following info
 Loses its executable and requires reinstallation . I upgraded to SM 7 Pro same problem , after many reinstalls I had to buy again and am having the same problems with another computer . This software will cost you soooo much lost time and effort . After 7 months fighting this garbage software I am going back to Norton . I will suffer the 15 to 30 minutes slow-mo at startup with Norton , in favour of fatal errors with iolo . NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL !!!!
 I have had System Mechanic since it came out . Every new major version , 4 & 5 most notably , have had initial release issues , but version 6 just takes the cake.I tried to install it on an IBM ThinkPad running Windows 2000 ... blue screen and circular reboot of death . Next , an HP Athlon XP with Windows XP Pro . It installed , but as several others have commented , it `` reports '' the machine as slow or fair in safety . It ca n't `` see '' the Windows Firewall or the hardware firewall upstream at all . And apparently , any anti-virus scanner but theirs is invisible as well.Tried it on another HP desktop with a P4 CPU . Horrible `` reboot of death '' as well.On my Compaq laptop -LRB- also P4 -RRB- running XP Pro , it installed and ran fairly well with the exception of dubious reports.All in all , I am considering asking for a refund of my upgrade fee . This is unacceptable .
 I wish I had read the reviews . I downloaded the trial version of this software and it has ruined my internet connection . After installing it , I could not get my wireless to work , period . After uninstalling and restorting to a earlier point , I have wireless access again , but it is extremely slow . Speeds are clocked at 101.8 kbps versus the 1340 + I was getting before . I have tried various fixes and doing another system restore to a month before to no avail . At this point I am going to wipe my system and reformat , as their tech support has not gotten back to me . This software is terrible and would not give it to my worst enemy . Would give minus stars if possible . Shame on Ioio for making such a subpar product .
 Do n't waste your money on System Mechanic 6 PRO from iolo . I had been running version 5 PRO for a year with no problems . Then all of a sudden I was facing banner windows that said ` Upgrade to Version 6 TODAY ' , when using version 5 PRO . I like an idiot purchased version 6 PRO to eliminate the incessant ` upgrade today ' banners . I have had nothing but problems . Most features do n't work at all , and the one 's that do work poorly . I feel taken in , and have paid money to be a BETA TESTER for iolo 's software . Look at the rapid fire version changes on the iolo web site . It clearly was released without much in house testing , and most likely to get it on the retailers shelves just in time for the holiday season -LRB- CHA-CHING -RRB- . Do n't bother trying to contact them for help , they either wo n't respond , or give you ` canned ' solutions if they do . I personally have 4 trouble tickets with them , and not one reply in over two weeks . I wonder how many awards this ` award winning ' software will receive this time around . This software stinks beyond belief . Most of the features you are paying for , you already have included as part of your operating system . The anti-virus and firewall software can be had for free -LRB- or at low cost -RRB- just by using ` google ' . Want to eliminate spyware ? Use Spybot Search and Destroy , a free program that is updated at least every week . Google is your friend , you 'll find all the same software for free -LRB- or next to it -RRB- that iolo charges an arm and leg for -LRB- and this stuff works -RRB- . Great job iolo , you just shot yourself in the foot . I for one will NEVER give you another red cent from my pocket ever again ! I 'd suggest everyone to stay away from System Mechanic Version 6 PRO . Its purely eye candy , and software bloat at its finest !
 i get the same issue as Bruce on my 32bit AthlonXPremoving the file that bruce suggested DOES WORKi was getting RDR_FILESYSTEM BSODS
 I have used System Mechanic since they first came out , using 3.0 . I upgraded to 4 , 5 , and now 6 . I have a new hot rod system , with plenty of speed and ram . System mechanic -LRB- memory hog -RRB- will crash or hang my system . It runs in the background and does it tasks per scheduling , even though you may be right in the middle of working on something ... . like a hot game of Pogo Pool , in which event you would lose . I liked the added features of 5 over 4 , but do n't waste your money on System Mechanic 6 . Wait for them to work the bugs out and then only install if you have lots of ram and a fast system . Keep using system mechanic 4 it that is the case.Also , I rate this -5 but it does n't give you that option .
 I had Iolo 's System Mechanic 5 . Parts of it worked well , parts did n't . I would give that one a 3 but this one ? Nada land . Returned it immeidately after repairing my computer . Look out . Do n't buy this one . Iolo by the way was NEVER a help with SM-5 ... so did n't even try this time . There was a bit of arrogance from them with SM-5 . Other reviewers here are on the money .
 I have nothing but problems since day one , system keeps rebooting on start-up , and I have sending the manufacturer two emails request for help and did not receive any reply . Funny that you ask me to review this product , I just decided this week that I am going to buy a different Software to replace it .
 I downloaded M6 and it started doing it 's thing without even asking me . AFter it went through some basic changes I went ahead and click to correct the problems it found . I was getting ready to log on to the internet to register it , until I found out I no longer had internet service . No matter what I did I could not get my e-mail or internet connection . It 's a good thing win XP lets you go back a few days to restore your system before downloading M6 . I will wait for a patch or new version , because this one over fix problems .
 I ran the System Mechanic 6 demo on 2 of my 3 home computers before realizing that it completely disabled the ability to connect to these 2 computers using shared folders . After many hours spent trying to fix the problem , I finally got some help from a Microsoft Windows XP Users group forum on networking . The solution ? Download a small freeware program called `` Winsock XP Fix '' and run it - problem solved . By the way Iolo tech support never replied after 5 days - I am still waiting . I have long since uninstalled their software . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!
 I was sold this program by Dell after having several issues with my xps 1530 laptop . It is running Windows Vista and System Mech Pro 10 . At the onset the program seemed to work great . However , after owning this program for about six months , it has started to remove key items off of my computer . For example , I was recently trying to install a few items -LRB- adobe update of some sort -RRB- and windows came back with a `` windows installer access error '' . I then did a little research online to find help on the issue and stumbled on a link where people where talking about how System Mech Pro will remove important services out of the windows configuration . This was supposed to be the program that fixed the issues before you had them and not give you additional issues . BUYER BEWARE !!!
 I do NOT recommend System Mechanic . The application deletes necessary files for McAfee . Their technicians assured me over a month that the problem would be corrected ... it was not . I need virus protection more than I need their application .
 One of the options in system Mechanic is to defragment system files . I ran this and it estimated it would run for 30 minutes . An hour and 45 minutes later I clicked on the cancel button . My PC has been hanging up ever since . I am now to the point where I ca n't boot it up . System Mechanic , in its zeal for cleanlyness , also deleted the system restore points . So now I 'm dead in the water .
 I have tried this on a 32 bit machine . It caused all the problems listed below , in other reviews , and is a complete waste of time . I previously had System Mechanic 4 and was very happy with it . I sent a comprehensive list of problems to the SM6 support desk and got an inane reply that simply told me how to download and install upgrades . I have checked for upgrades and there are none . I have now requested that they ` try harder ' . I would not buy it again , no way ! I have not tried it on my 64 bit machine and do not intend to .
 I had used SM5 basic , but never really got the feeling that it was maintaining my machine . When it 's tools did run as scheduled it basically sucked up my system resources and rendered my computer useless until the tasks were completed.Bought SM6 Pro not too long ago . Initially it would hang while running certain maintenance jobs . Subsequent updates fixed this problem . Overall , I like the ease of use and it feels like the program is keeping my machine tuned up . However , it does so at the expense of performance . It takes programs noticeably longer to open and the tools are not customizable.The undo function is completely inoperable and the only thing tech support could tell me about it -LRB- after contacting them twice and finally getting a reply almost three weeks later -RRB- was that they were looking into it and the problem might be fixed in future updates.Another major problem is that the security program shuts my home network down . I can not access my main computer from any other computer in the house . The only way to fix this problem is to completely restore my hard drive from a saved image file -LRB- or else completely reload the computer from scratch -RRB- . SM6 could be a great program . Many of the features and tools are valuable and run well , but the ones that do n't wreak too much havoc . Overall , it slows your machine down , does not allow you to customize the way tools run , destroys your network and can not undo changes it makes to your system.Stay away from this product until iolo fixes these major bugs .
 I had a similar problem to L Bufkin 's . My XP home edition crashed & burned on contact with System Mechanic 6 Pro . I 'm still working with microsoft to try to repair the damage .
 On November 8th release n came out and fixed all my issues . I would give it a 5 star now but update immediately to avoid the prior versions.Bought a 3 license version . What a misteak . It crashes XP pro on any 64 bit processor . IOLO said it has not been tested on 64 bit processors . I had to fix the circular reboot myself . It caused the only blue screan I ever had on my pc . If you have this and a 64 bit processor delete iolofltr.sys file or it will not boot again . This crashes a small insignificant program but lets it boot . The other thing to avoid is the broken link repair or pc total care they crash every time . System Mechanic 5 Professional was a great product this release is horrible .
 About a month ago I installed System Mechanic 6 after picking it up on sale at Costco - went with a PC World review that this program is the second-best on the market.It did n't crash my system but I do regret even buying it at half price . As one previous reviewer said , this program does not play well on every machine.The pros : Easy to install ; does a relatively good job of cleaning clutter and defragmenting ; decent amount of optimization availableThe cons : Conducting repairs/cleaning takes FOREVER ; bit of a system hog ; Poor instructions and customer support -LRB- I 'm a tech writer by trade and the instructions for System Mechanic are terrible -RRB- The worst part about this program is it 's not reliable . Scan and optimize your system one time and it runs like a dream but conduct the same maintenance a week later and suddenly you 're having major lag and weird errors . I also hated the constant alerts - System Mechanic almost forces you to do regular scans.I just installed a new systems utility and found that while my computer was free of clutter and spyware thanks to System Mechanic , scans and maintenance go way faster with System Mechanic uninstalled.So in summary , System Mechanic does what it 's supposed to do which is why I gave it 2 stars . But there are far better programs that will clean and optimize your computer much faster .
 Previous versions of System Mechanic have been excellent , version 6 is terrible . Avoid this at all costs . One can only wonder what has gone wrong at Iolo . Most of the features hardly work or cause major problems , The software sets a new bar for the the term `` resource hog ''
 This product was highly recommended so I bought it and discovered like so many others that it 's full of bugs . Perhaps earlier versions were fine , but this one is awful ... it hangs almost every time I use it . Always says that work needs to be done when it just finishing doing what it was supposed to do in the first place and support does n't answer the phones . When you send an email , they give you the same answer every time that please check back for upgrades . I 've checked back for the last 10 days and there are none so the problems must be serious . I 'd stay away from this until they work out the bugs . No money back from this company either -LRB- or just the promise that there even is a problem and a date they expect it fixed -RRB- - they do not stand behind the product .
 I liked System Mechanic 5 better . Like others , I have the same problem with the notice , telling me repairs are needed on Drive C : . I let System Mechanic repair it several times , but it still tells me repairs are needed . I already defragged , ran check disk , did a comprehensive check with the hard drive maker 's utility , and it passed with flying colors.System Mechanic also has a tendency to freeze during some repairs.I have sent emails to tech support , and they updated the program twice . I emailed them a third time , and they never responded.So , obviously , they do n't care . They got my money . That 's the last time.System Mechanic 6 is a waste of money , in my opinion , and I wish I could get my money back .
 This program crashed my computer into a fatal error . I lost everything . i was able to fix the computer with a total factory reset but it was the worst PC decision I ever made was buying this . DO NOT USE , Do n't make the mistake I did .
 I have never used anything but Norton , but read the raving reviews about System Mechanics and bought it . It seems to do a lot of things , but nothing really well . It also finally ruined a harddrive installation , so I went and got a new bootable harddrive . After installing everything , incl my old Windows 2000 and all my other software , having everything set up , I finally installed System Mechanics 6 Pro , - and ruined everything . It supposedly fixed 243 errors . However , NOW I can barely boot the computer , I am unable to install or upgrade anything and the system is as unstable as I have never seen it before . in short everything is ruined and I have to start again from scratch with formatting my harddrive.Thanks guys .
 What an awful application ! There is ZERO support . I have send a dozen emails to these people and get nothing but automated returns directing me to the FAQ which I 've read through completely . They say they 're there 24.7 ... but not for the customer . The application just does n't work ! I had to uninstall the firewall to use my vista machine , the Anti-virus stops my outlook cold . The `` repair '' stuff just tells you there is a problem , but not what it is . Beware of having this software clean up the `` Clutter '' for you , it will just as likely erase your OS and its components . Look for better solutions from symantec or macafee or about any other company .
 Do not buy this product . Like most of the other reviewers here my computer degraded after installation . One reviewer said it best . It bulls through your system without giving you choices . Rather than fixing broken links it created them . A truly dreadful product .
 I 've used previous versions of this product and have thought them to be a little better than adequate . However , this version is extraordinarily poor in that VERY little information about what it is doing or about to do is provided before changes are made to your system . Iolo 's product management team that allowed this debacle to be released should be fired . I 've uninstalled it and suggest you stay away .
 I 'll chalk this one up to just laziness on my part -LRB- should have done my homework , first -RRB- . My hard drive -LRB- 120GB Western Digital -RRB- recently went south on me and I was unable to boot into my system -LRB- Windows XP Pro -RRB- . The drive 's SMART feature indicated an imminent failure and would not let me access the drive.I did a quick check on CNET and ZDNet for reviews on products that could recover data from a crashed hard drive . The top three seemed to be Norton SystemWorks , Fix-It Utilities , and System Mechanic Professional . System Mechanic being the top pick , I went out and bought it and a new hard drive.After painful hours of installing Windows on the new drive , applying upgrades , installing drivers , etc. . . I finally had a system I could boot . I slaved the bad drive to the good one , and started System Mechanic . Lo and behold , it did not see the bad drive . So I booted from the bootable CD and ran DiskMedic -LRB- or DriveMedic ... something along those lines -RRB- . It did see the bad drive , but only had two options to check . And it said there was no problem ! Grrr ... $ 70 down the tubes.I did briefly check a few of the other capabilities . The disk cleaner , registry mechanic , disk/file defragmenter , I think I 'll use occasionally -LRB- though I would n't have paid $ 70 for them -RRB- . I tried the Internet connection optimizer -- did n't notice a difference -LRB- I have cable broadband -RRB- . Have n't tried the remaining features , though they do n't appear to have much meat to them . I would n't use the firewall or anti-virus -LRB- have n't tried them -RRB- . For anyone interested , I did finally do my homework and came across a product called `` SpinRite '' . Been around a long time , has good reviews , and a loyal following . It was magic -- restored my bad drive to a working state and I was able to pull off all my important files . At $ 90 , it ai n't cheap , but I * really * needed to get my files , so it was a bargain to me . The SpinRite website is -LRB- www.grc.com -RRB- . Do a Google search on it first and read some of the reviews -- the LinuxJournal review gives a good overview of how you use it.Cheers !
 Usually mechanics fix things . In the case of System Mechanic 6 the idea seems to be to un-fix things . This software is buggier than a bait store and a waste of cash at best . At worst it 's a system destroyer.I installed this on a new , fast , powerful laptop and found it to be a complete disaster . Luckily , I always back-up all my info and since this was a new machine reinstalling Windows was but a mere nuisance . If anyone has plans to install this dog on a machine that 's not backed-up and has info you care about , consider yourself warned.On a positive note , I found customer service helpful . They answered my questions quickly and tried to remedy the situations as they arose . My guess is they 're saddled with a terrible product . Suggesting users revert to earlier versions of the software is proof enough of the troubles.I must say this is the first Windows software to ever cause me to reinstall from scratch . Glad I did n't lose anything ! Buyers beware and back-up .
 Let me start by saying I consider myself slightly above average computer smarts . I am no wiz but I know how to navigate my system and generally keep it at high performance . I bought System Mechanci because I was experiancing slower performance and could not fix the problem myself.Sadly , my problems grew worse after installing and running the software . Whatever it did to my system causes certain programs to try and re-install them selves at startup now . I never had any problems with these programs before using system mechanic . Furthermore , whenever the program updates itself , it has a 50 % chance of freeing and locking up my computer.What annoyed me most was the customer support when I tried to take advantage of the money back guarantee advertised on the box . Fist , the web address on the box is wrong . I had to call customer support to be directed to the proper web service where I basically filled a form out requesting more info . -LRB- why could n't I speak with someone over the phoine having already called in ? -RRB- It took 3 days to get a response to my e-mail at wich point I was asked to write back with my problem . I did so and after waiting another 2 days finally recieved a response telling me to send store recipt for refund . The thing is , by this time I was comming up close on the 30 day mark for this software . I had filed my complaint before the deadline but the slow response time kept me from completeing the process.I very strongly do NOT recommend this product . It will likly hinder your computer and customer service is pitiful .
 I had McAfee . It said it stopped a Trojan Horse , but a false alert got through and messed up my computer real bad . I called Dell , who did a great job fixing my computer without losing any info . They sold me System Mechanic Pro . Computer worked for about 3 weeks and then I tried to run a `` complete system analysis . '' About 3/4 of the way through the system just rebooted . I did n't connect these issues and tried to run SM again . Same thing . I called Dell , software dept could n't find anything wrong . By then system was rebooting every few minutes . They sent me to hardware dept , but by that time system would n't even stay on in Safe Mode , sometimes not even finishing reboot before starting again . Dell told me since I was out of warranty I should find a local tech , sounded like power source or mother board . Well , computer is now fine , they removed some stuff , found some small malware issues and convinced me SM was NOT a good idea . Although I 'd had the 3 year contract for a little over a month Dell refunded my purchase totally . They must be having problems with this program or I 'm sure they would n't have been so cooperative about refunding . Local tech now loading Kaspersky , got my fingers crossed .
 Bought System mechanic 6 pro online , it repairs but reports problems but you can not get information at all . None of the modules report what is being done . If you need assistance forget it , all you get from IOLO is go see the FAQ 's , I do n't think humans work there just a computer that generates emails . STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY !!!
 Save your money !!! I used the evaluation version of System Mechanic version 6 for 29 days and thought it was great enough that I paid for and upgraded to System Mechanic Professional version on the subscription option for $ 69.95 . I download the installer and ran it at 7:30 am on Sunday morning . None of the modules , I repeat NONE worked . I uninstalled . Cleaned out my registery and directories of all traces of this and the previous version and reinstalled , several time to the point that I gave up at 8pm the sam night . I search the online support and found no help . I wrote an email and as of today -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- have not yet received a reply . Their phone is constantly busy but I did get through last night at 7pm eastern time -LRB- they close at 8pm eastern/5pm pacific -RRB- and was transferred to tech support . For the next hour I listened to the message
 Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping , since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well.However , the `` repair broken shortcuts '' function does not work properly.For a variety of reasons I use a large number of Microsoft Word Shortcuts in my Folder / File system . System Mechanic `` repaired broken shortcuts '' on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target . Now I am pulling up documents which are similar -LRB- but are actually older versions which I have save to an auxiliary hard drive -RRB- or unrelated to the actual , correct target file . This has had severe productivity consequences , since I have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut.Contacting on-line Help was of no help whatsoever .
 Why buy Iolo System Mechanic when you can get malware for free?I installed Pro 7 and it gave many , many problems . Iolo did not respond to my emails so I uninstalled . Their uninstaller did not work either .
 Version 7 is a piece of junk . Slows the boot time to nearly 5 minutes . Internet cleanup completely ignores your settings for cookie removal ... deletes them all no matter how many times you `` protect '' the ones you want to keep . Does not recognize Zone Labs Internet Security Suite 's firewall or antivirus . Stay with version 6 if you must use an Iolo product . As for me , I 'm in the market for a reliable product .
 I ordered a program from Iolo and it was not what I thought it was . I never downloaded it and asked them not to ship by email and phone . I never heard back from them and I called many days in a row . Finally I got a manager who was rude and refuses to refund until he gets the program back . He indicated I should be glad I will get a refund at all as their sales are final . Be careful before you order from this company .
 I purchased this program a few years ago , dont remember it fixing anything for 50 bucks , got a new laptop , tried to reinstall it , serial number didnt work , called in , stayed on hold for 10-15 minutes , then rep told me it had a subscription for a year . What a joke , I didnt buy it for virus removal , I wanted to have it whenever i wanted to do a little tune up or troubleshoot something , I didnt wan na pay 50 bucks to use something ONE time , why wouldnt I just take it some where and pay 50-60 bucks , they promote this software as a `` use us instead of the PC repair guy '' . Run from this POS and download glary for free .
 I have used System Mechanic 4 for many years and like it . It cleans my registry , finds old shortcuts . Most importantly , it tells me what it is going to do before it does it.System Mechanic 6 will do tons of stuff to your computer , but wo n't tell you ahead of time what it 's going to do . It fixed 99 `` security vulnerabilities '' on my pc , without telling me what it was doing , or letting me choose which of them to actually fix . I have a firewall and virus protection that are updated , so I seriously doubt there were 99 things to fix . The program just bulldogs it 's way through whatever it thinks needs to be done . After various programs stopped working , I had to undo all the System Mechanic 6 changes , reinstall some software , and finally get rid of System Mechanic 6 . I think System Mechanic 6 is trying to make itself easier to use by sheltering the user from the intricacies of the program , but the result is a bloated program that tries to do too much , interacts with the user too little , does n't do anything well , and will most likely break your pc .
 Read the reviews of the 4 or 5 major system utilities -LRB- Systemworks , System Mechanic , Systemsuite , etc -RRB- . Guess what ? Depending on which review you read , they are all outstanding products , or they are all trash . Not a single product gets glowing reviews from everyone , and each product has lots of people who had major problems . What to do ? Do what I did . Just try one until it works.I have used Systemworks and System Mechanic on various computers over the years with pretty decent results . For the last couple of years I 've used System Mechanic with absolutely no problem . I just bought a new computer , and one of the first things I did was slap a copy of System Mechanic 6 Pro on it . The results ? Completely trashed my brand new computer . Not really a big deal since the computer is new and I did n't have much -LRB- any -RRB- time invested in new software installation . All my documents are on my old computer , so I lost nothing . I just did a complete disaster recovery and got back to normal.The next thing I did was install the Systemworks 2006/Personal Firewall bundle . Guess what ? Flawless installation . Have run all the diagnostics and checks . Absolutely no problems.So what does this mean ? If you try one of the system utilities and it trashes your system , just uninstall it , try to get your money back , then move on to another one . I am absolutely convinced that it is a total crapshoot as to which utility will work on your system . If you think about it , they all have about the same features , so the issue is not what they can do , but whether they are stable and will work on your system . System Mechanic did n't work for me . Systemworks does . Just the way of the world . If you tried to read too much into all of the reviews , you would never buy any software for your computer , because there are always horror stories from people who had their systems crashed.Off topic , but as an aside , it 's the same thing with other programs . I am into video editing , and trying to decide between Pinnacle and Roxio Easy Media Creator . Absolute horror stories from users of both products about how unstable these products are . So ... I tried the Roxio product , it works , and its stable . Good enough for me !
 l 've used versions 4 and 5 for years . I was extremely disappointed with version 6 . It is buggy and caused blg problems.The startup function disables startup files inaccurately and automatically . Tech support was unable to help me reverse the damage because the reverse function does n't work , according to tech support.The security function prevented me from accessing my computer because it closed ports . Tech support could not tell me how to reopen the ports . Another reason the lack of a reverse function is a serious problem.Tech support was unable to help me . Theyare obviously overwhelmed bc the program is so bad.After getting nowhere with tech support , I solved most of my problems by uninstalling version 6 . My private tech guy will solve the rest , I hope , next week.This is a below a beta version program . Version 5 is great . Version 6 IS NOT READY for public consumption.This program should come with a warning and a letter of apology . Do not use it if they give it to you for free .
 Had version 5 which worked fine , upgraded to version 6 professional which turned out to be a big mistake !! It consistently reports `` Speed '' and `` Fitness '' needs to be repaired , even after I have the Syetem Mechanic -LRB- allegedly -RRB- make the repairs . . Also , when I run the `` PC total care '' it consistently hangs-up and freezes . In addition , Tech support appears to be working part-time , I never get a response to the problems I 'm having . Another thing is that the : `` Virus Protection '' will not install with `` Norton '' installed on your computer . .
 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!! Their technical support is NON-EXISTENT ! I 've put in at least 3 help tickets with them and none have been answered . I called them and all I got was the `` press one for tech support . '' When I press one , I get a message that says to call the same toll free number I dialed that told me to press `` one '' ... . Horrible !! ***** CAUTION IF YOU OWN ADOBE PHOTOSHOP ELEMENTS ****** This piece of software erases key registry entries of Adobe 's and the only way to correct it is to completely uninstall Elements and then re-install it -LRB- I had to work this out with Adobe -RRB- It is VERY VERY frustrating.Within one week of installing the software , it told me that my one year was up and would not run the anti-hacker feature - again no reply from IOLO.Even after running their anti-spy applet , I was getting the `` winfixer '' popups . Their software said I had no malware , spyware , etc. . . which of course was not true . I downloaded spysweeper and it found the winfixer and MANY others which it cleaned off for me.In fairness , I think it does do a good job looking at you computer to see if there is any junk . I just do n't know what it is erasing and my computer has not been running correctly since it `` cleaned it ''
 I was a big fan of version 5 so I upgraded to version 6 without hesitation . Unfortuantely some of the `` optimization '' tools do anything but optimize your computer . In my case it appears to have disabled crucial software start-ups and deleted important registry entries . And although the manufacturer claims that these changes can be undone , they can not .
 Version p I just downloaded is improved from the CD I bought on Amazon when 6 first came out . Blue screen of death I got as soon as I installed 6 -LRB- each of 3 times -RRB- has n't come up with version p. Accepting repair recommendations no longer results in repeated notices to repair -- everything 6 rates in my computer shows up `` good '' now . 6 's making repairs but not giving any information about what it has repaired continues , and is unacceptable . After getting no useful Iolo tech response for a month , I got a good one within hours after posting a review this replaces . I still want an update that gets 6 to show what it 's repairing .
 I 've used SM4 and SM5 and liked what they could do for me so i was glad to get SM6 . What a mistake . Its big and bloated and at times made my computer unusable . I even tried disabling alot of the options but that didnt help . Dont waste your time with this software.btw the way ... 1 star is way too high of a rating for this product
 Installing SM6 on my Pentium 4,3.4 GHz computer running Windows Xp.Maybe it 's not System Mechanic , but ever since i purchased andinstalled SM6 on my system , it has repeatedly crashed . SM6 constantly corrupts my MBR -LRB- master boot record -RRB- and MFT -LRB- Master File Table -RRB- . IT also partitioned my drive with false data , SM6 reported to windows xp that my harddrive was bad.Just to make sure it was SM6 doing the corruption , i formatted and re-install windowx XP 4 times , SM6 four times , and each time after re-installing SM6 , in a couple of days my MFT and MBR were corrupted again.I had to completely uninstall SM6 , and format both my master and slave drives . I had to have Windows xp repair my drives . It is here where windows told me i had corrupted data , this data wasnot there until SM6 was running . Windows repaired the corrupted portions on my harddrive . My computer hasbeen running smooth ever since.I have since purchased Disk Keeper 9 Pro , PCDoc Pro3 .5 , Spy Sweeper and WindowWasher to maintain my computer.Disk Keeper Professional 9
 At $ 349 per copy , the authors of this software are very smart to not show their pricing on the product page.I have no idea if the product is any good at all as I refuse to pay an exhorbitant amount - See Cakewalk for a slightly less robust package at a more reasonable price.Shame on you for refusing to post your price - probably the only way you 'd get anyone to spend that much !
 Ok this look game looked good when I first started it . The graphics were nice and I was doing allright with the puzzles . But I am hearing impaired and I could not finish the game beacuse a vital puzzle involved matching sounds . Needless to say I was disappointed and frustrated . I wish the makers of these games would give some sort of an indication on the package just to warn people like me . I work hard for my money and I spent it on a game that ended up in a drawer because I was unable to finish it . It wasnt a bad game if I had been able to hear correctly I would have finished it and enjoyed it .
 Beyond Atlantis is a game in the spirit of Myst and Riven . Unfortunately , Beyond Atlantis does n't have what it takes to make a great game . While the graphics are very good -LRB- I wo n't say breathtaking , because they were n't quite that good -RRB- what makes or breaks this sort of game is the puzzles , and the puzzles in Beyond Atlantis are horrible . They are mostly inventory-based -LRB- i.e. , you have jump through some hoops to get an object that allows you to activate something or talk to somebody . -RRB- However , the puzzles just are n't logical . For example , why does one character only speak incoherently until I bring him a particular slab of rock ? Or why does clicking on some pictures on the wall result in the wall giving me a pearl ? This is never explained . Furthermore , there is no continuity in the game -- you never have any idea what you are really trying to accomplish . Now , there are some positive aspects to the game -LRB- very nice graphics , and a couple of good puzzles -RRB- but I suggest that if you play this game , keep a hint manual or a walkthrough handy , because without it the only way you will beat the game is just through dumb luck ...
 I found this to be an average puzzle-solving adventure game , much like many of the other games of the same caliber that are out there . I did , however , question the rating on the game . The game holds an `` E '' rating which states that it is suitable for any person age 6 and older . I believe that a young child would not be able to solve many of the puzzles and challenges in the game , unless they purchased a cheat book or went on the internet -LRB- like I did -RRB- to get hints for the puzzles . Plus , some of the creatures encountered in the game may frighten younger audiences , and a scantily-clad priestess in the Maya scene may not be suitable for younger eyes . You can use your discretion on this , but I gave the game a two-star rating .
 This game provides a real experience for a PC gamer - the graphics are terrific , and the whole `` mystique '' of the theme intices you to try it . But shortly afterwards , the frustration that sets in will make you sorry you did ! I am not into PC games as much as some of the other reviewers are , but I am an intelligent person that enjoys a challenge , and a diversion once in awhile . I picked the WRONG game for that ! This game required my finding a `` cheat site '' on the web so I could continue on with it , and I have needed to refer to it throughout my attempts at it . And the `` cheat '' info was not always enough to get me past an obstacle . There are very few clues for you to know what you 're even supposed to be looking for , ridiculous blocks along the way , and slow movements that only add to the frustration level . Find another game !
 It 's too bad Dreamcatcher Games ' games all have the exact same gameplay . I think they 're trying to re-create the style of Myst , but they do n't realize that there is a subtle art to making a game like this . The first rule they violate is to make the game possible to figure out on your own . They provide almost no clues for any of the puzzles -LRB- It 's impossible to figure out where to use the crystal ball in each place unless you try every single screen -RRB- . They make it so difficult you pretty much have to use a walkthrough . I was able to get through Myst without any help , but I did n't last five minutes in Beyond Atlantis.The only good part about the game is the way it looks . All the worlds look amazing -LRB- which is good , because you 'll be spending a lot of time in each one -RRB- . Unless you like to spend countless hours trying to figure out puzzles with absolutely no clues at your disposal , you should avoid this one .
 The problem with the puzzles in Beyond Atlantis is the complete absence of guidance about what to do with each puzzle and what you will achieve by solving it . There are a few which are intuitive but this is the exception rather than the rule . In an adventure game difficult puzzles are a good thing as far as I 'm concerned but they need to be logical and relevant to clues you have already seen or found rather than totally abstract and therefore requiring trial and error , which is how most are in Beyond Atlantis.I do not believe that even a seasoned adventure-gamer can complete this adventure without the use of a walkthrough , which to me totally spoils the experience and the sense of achievement you get from completing this type of game.Yes - I could not wait to get to the end , but for all the wrong reasons ! I did not enjoy playing this game whatsoever.I purchased Beyond Atlantis and Beyond Atlantis II at the same time , and after playing the former , was dreading playing it 's sequel , however my fear was unnecessary . Every complaint I had about Beyond Atlantis has been rectified in the later , making it a fantastic game with difficult but intuitive puzzles that can be solved with thoughtful observation of your surroundings . Whilst a little jerky , the graphics and sound are fantastic and enable you to become totally immersed in the story . I recommend that anyone considering this title , purchase the sequel `` Beyond Atlantis II '' instead , which whilst not as good as the Myst Trilogy is certainly one of the best games available .
 The only saving point for this game is the graphics ... I have to admit that some of them were absolutely astonishing . That out of the way , THIS GAME WAS A WASTE OF TIME ! Far too many of the puzzles were either too pixel-sensitive or too obscure to grasp the concept without tearing one 's hair out ! There was WAY too much backtracking to accomplish tasks , having to talk to someone on the other side of a world to finish a particular puzzle , with no hint whatsoever of having to do so . Necessary objects to complete puzzles often just blended into the scenery , almost as if they were not even objects . Also , vital clues to solving puzzles were stashed away in one , little , unobtrusive graphic that could have been easily missed . Cryo and Dreamcatcher seemed to spend all development time on the graphics , but relied too heavily on them instead of integrating the puzzles into them . Much like some of Dreamcatcher 's games , The Crystal Key -LRB- just as maddening -RRB- , The FOrgotten -LRB- the first in a series that seems to have been forgotten , thankfully -RRB- , and others . I just finished Myst
 After playing Riven and The Last Express , Beyond Atlantis was a sheer disappointment . Some of the puzzles were downright impossible and completely illogical . Granted Riven had some tough ones , but they were intergrated into the gameplay . In addition , the acting was embarassingly bad . I did n't even finish the game . The only motivation to complete the silly puzzles was to see the next `` cool '' scene . Bottom line , there are too many other games with beautiful graphics and engrossing plots as well . Steer clear of Atlantis !
 I enjoy adventure games , but since I 'm so busy I can only play a few of them a year , and so I choose only to play the best . Unfortunately this game does not fit into what I call `` QT with my PC '' This game incorporates annoying voice acting where the words do not match with the speakers mouthes , and I found that transitions to be slow and boring . The puzzles were alright though they were not very informative and there was n't much humor in the game . Overall , I just thought it was a good concept that could have been a better game , but just was n't exciting enough . ...
 What a dumb game . The beatiful graphics ca n't cover the fact that the puzzles are vague and more than a little frustrating , -LRB- even with a walkthrough ! -RRB- and that so-called selling point of 360 degree movement gave me motion sickness . The characters are peculiar looking and some of them undulate in an odd fashion , which , along with the corny dialogue , makes it hard to take seriously . In particular the Mayan women ; what is up with the British accents ? Had I known this was a Dreamcatcher game I would not have bought it . I was so wowed by the graphics I did n't even notice . I 'll never make that mistake again . I do n't recommend this game ; save your money .
 This game was so icky I did n't even finish it . The rendered characters all appeared to have some sort of unhealthy skin condition , and tended to rock back and forth while delivering their bad voice bits . The locations were pretty , but the node-to-node navigation was extremely frustrating . Some of the puzzles were n't too bad , but others were pretty far fetched . Between the creepy characters , the dizzying navigation and the inane puzzles , I just could n't bring myself to continue .
 This game has very good graphics but the excitement is not so high . This game is very theoretic and leaves you thinking . Personally , I would n't recommend this game just because it was n't as fun as I thought it would be . But hey , that 's just me ! It 's a good game if you 're in to serious philosphies and wonders about life .
 The graphics were great , but it was difficult to figure out where to go . The puzzles were exrtremely hard , and there did n't seem to be much of a point to the game . So , if you come across this game , think twice before being grabbing it off the shelf . However , if you like Puzzle games , such as Myst , then you would probably enjoy the shere boringness of going in circles around a stream or trying to talk to a giant spider , or pheraps you would like walking in a sheep 's field ? Maybe talking to monks ? Watching a fox chasing chickens always excites me ! And do n't forget the shadow outside the chinease gates , too scary for words , and remember that spinning the turtle in circles is the way out !!
 I bought this game because the reviews said the puzzles were as interesting and intellectually challenging as the 7th Guest ; but it is far less so . Too many of its puzzles require guess-work and do n't require logical analysis . Also there are too many `` jump-though-hoops '' steps , i.e. completely random use of an object , not based on any clue or information from any of the characters . In fact , to get the 5th level , I had to go to a hint guide to find that I had to go back through all four previous levels and click on one completely random place in each level . Yeah I want to waste my time , but I 'd at least like to use my brain while doing it .
 Were Can i find a walkthrough for this game ? i mean yesh it gives you no type of background info that would lead you to find the answer , at one ppoint -LRB- xilgalga rainbow thing -RRB- i started looking at the sky for clues , and that lil bat is uglier then snot , but anyways back to the walkthrough , please if u know were to get one from email me at firebat02@hotmail.com or pschofreak@hotmail.com -LRB- pscho spelled as it is -RRB-
 I have liked every game Dreamcatcher has ever released , but this one was a little tough to swallow . In typical Dreamcatcher fashion , the graphics are wonderful and the music is very relaxing and laid back . I think the reason for the calming music was the fact that this game is very annoying . Now . I consider myself to be pretty good at solving puzzle games , and if I get stuck , I call a couple of friends and we work these out together . But neither of us liked this game very well . the clues are n't detailed enough and many of these puzzles are repititious . You do n't know if you have done the puzzle right until the end of that sequence . Very annoying . when they speak to you , it 's like your speaking to Confuscious . Very hard to discern the clues they are giving . My suggestion is spend your money on another Dreamcatcher game
 Everything in this game is confusing , especially with no instructions . The game almost expects you to know what to do and how to solve clues . I struggled through this game for a long time and could not understand what was going on . The only thing I give this game credit for , is the graphic 's and exotic and ancient soundtrack , otherwise , this game is needle in a haystack !
 This is a collection of mostly shareware produces that require payment for full funcionality . There is alot of freeware also . Hard to navigate in the `` Dashboard '' , wish it had screenshots.Seller sent item out on time and was delivered on the date promised .
 I have used Turbo Tax for many years , but this is the last . The NJ state version has many calculation errors and bugs . Technical support says it unable to help , as the calculations are to complicated for them to understand . The program rounds up figures when importing from federal program . Beware of this program , especially if you paid excess UE & DI . Many other errors . No fix available . Avoid this product .
 I sent in all of my documentation for the rebate so that this would be free after rebate -LRB- as advertised everywhere -RRB- . They sent me a postcard saying that they needed my receipt . I do n't know if they do n't take the Amazon shipping receipts or if they just do n't want to issue rebates . I think that 's what they count on to give so much `` free '' software away - not issuing $ $ back to purchasers . This was the first time I 've purchased tax software and I wo n't buy this product again - ever .
 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ... BR > I live in Delaware one of the many states that the CD does not have complete on it but needs an update to work ! Imagine selling an unworkable product ... . First Intuit said Updates would be ready on Jan 30th , then on Feb 15th but here it is the 17th and nothing ! Customer support is non existant . The online people know nothing and the phone support is closed except during daytime business hours.SO BUY THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR OWN RISK BUT BE WARNED IT DOES NOT WORK AND IS NOT SUPPORTED !
 I need to file in three states , and I foolishly assumed that a `` 45 multi state '' package would do 45 states . It will do only one . Intuit 's response ? `` Yeah , it 'll do 45 states , just not all at once . '' It reminds me of the old joke about the shop keeper which had the sign that said `` open 24 hours '' . When he would close he would tell people `` Yeah , we 're open 24 hours . Just not in a row . `` YOU HAVE TO BUY TWO COPIES TO DO TWO STATES . Very misleading .
 The installation of the C-Dilla copy protection program as part of TurboTax is highly unethical software engineering . Why would Intuit want to harm all of their customers rather than just the people illegally copying their software?I have been a loyal customer of Intuit 's for the last 9 years . I have bought Quicken every other year and Turbotax & Turbotax state every year for the last 9 years . Now my loyalty as a long-term PAYING customer is rewarded with a 1 megabyte memory sucker running constantly on my machine . Of course , if the program is terminated or removed then I can no longer run their product ! I never agreed to -LSB- C-Dilla -RSB- when I purchased Turbotax , but I guess I should have read all of the fine print in the license agreement.I understand Intuit 's wish to cut down on coypright infringement , but my need to cut down on unnecessary system processes running on MY COMPUTER is what matters to me ! I ca n't wait to finish my taxes so I can uninstall Turbotax and get rid of C-Dilla ... . I do n't have a problem with the activation feature alone . It is -LSB- C-Dilla -RSB- constantly running in the background that I object to!I imagine that it will take years to build back their customer 's trust even if they decide to remove this nonsense from next year 's product !
 I 'm a longtime and until now a satisfied MacinTax and TurboTax user.Recently I bought the Windows version of TurboTax2002 , federal and state , as a gift for a resident of the District of Columbia who , as a new computer user , does not have internet access . Despite your advertisement several states including DC , are not includedThus , I have a state CD-Rom that is worthless without a CD-ROM update . I think that I should be provided one without charge , but ca n't contact Intuit Neither their 800 hotline nor live chat seem to work
 TurboTax works fine as long as it does n't crash and you do n't need the product ID to get it restarted . The customer service 800 number you 'll need to call to get the new product ID is a business-hours-only number and you have to be sitting at your computer to make any use of it -LRB- at work ? not at home in front of your computer ? too bad , ca n't help you -RRB- . And if you go to the Intuit support page and get text help from a person there -LRB- it 's like using a two-person chat room -RRB- they 'll give you another phone number , but it 's a toll number and you 'll be on hold a long , long time . So as long as you do n't let the program crash or delete your product ID number by scanning for viruses or spyware , you 'll probably like it fine . But if you have any problems , you 'll probably save time by just doing your taxes by hand . I 'd recommend ... anything BUT Intuit 's TurboTax .
 TurboTax use to be a good product but this year it is a disaster.The product seems only to exist to sell you more products and be aware many of the state products as of Feb 17th still do not work because there are no updates.Intuit has fallen vey very far . You can not even tab through screens anymore but must constantly point and click with the mouse . Customer support is also almost nonexistant . The people at support do not even know that updates are not yet available . PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR OWN RISK . YOU WOULD DO BETTER AND WORK FASTER WITH PAPER .
 I have been a loyal customer for Intuit 's product . When I found out the short-fall on its State Tax software and e-mail an alert to them . They did not respond , neither did they correct the mistake in order to improve the next year . So every year , I had to manually override it and get it done correctly . The mistake I was talking about is the `` Two-Income Deduction '' for Maryland filers .
 I have been using turbo tax deluxe on my dell lap top with windows ME for the last 3 years . This year intuit decided to add request codes and activation code so you can not use you disk on any other computer except the first one that you used it on . This is a great idea except certain version of windows will not let that info out to a software program such as Turbo Tax . Trying to contact customer support , no help , or technical assistance , spent over an hour , just gives your the run around and now its been a month and I still can not access the program I paid for
 Did n't advertise that you need to have 2002 federal program already installed in order for the state version to work . What a waste of time and money .
 was very easy for my daughter who was preschool age . She got bored really easy and did n't want to play . She stopped using it within the first week of play .
 Took less than 2 hours and was very broad in the training . No mastering going on here .
 I hate iLok . Period . As a record producer and studio owner I own hundreds of software titles . I try my best to use only legitimately registered software with proper licenses . Having to use iLok is not only a huge inconvenience , it is a disgrace . Because so many people have stolen the use of software , today , honest people are penalized by forcing us to use this shameful system . Companies like Synthogy -LRB- makers of Ivory Piano -RRB- should be shamed for penalizing the honest because of the dishonest . Synthogy has a full challenge/response system in place that worked from day one . For some reason , Mac users wanting to run Ivory with Leopard were required to change over to use iLok . I begged Synthogy for the ability to choose one or the other , since the challenge/response system was already in place . They refused . They jumped on the iLok Big Brother Bandwagon , no doubt , to alleviate Customer Support calls to support challenge/response . Suddenly , competing piano software sounded so much nicer than it used to ! Shame on you , Synthogy . I hate iLok !
 Buyer beware . While this program is prominently advertised on the CD that comes with the TMobile SDA smartphone , it is not compatible and only works with phones running Windows Mobile 2003 or phones such as the MDA . Although there appear to be Smartphone compatible beta versions running around , Microsoft denied their existence to me .
 Software is unpredictable and worthless with the Treo 700wx at least . Save your receipt you 'll probably need to return the software if you can .
 This should be built into hardware not another piece of software to run on resource limited Pocket PC . Put it on a chip ! Other cell phones have it why ca n't a pocket pc phone have the same . The audio quality is the same as what my first 386 based computer could generate in the early 1990 's
 My kids , daughter 8 & son 5 , both Power Ranger & video game fanatics , did not like the PR Time Force game ! They have the PR Light Speed Rescue , which is the first play station PR game , which they loved . They were able to fight as a team , two players against the villains . This one does not allow you to play together but against each other . Two players can fight each other as Zords , they say that 's boring ! They liked it for maybe 5 minutes , that 's it . The whole idea is to fight bad guys right ? It 's even better having another PR to help . They 'll play it alone but very seldom . They game itself , I thought it was pretty good , challenging and it had good graphics . But again , I think they should have included a two player game fighting against the bad guys instead of just a single player game
 Even though this game has 2 different modes they both use the same 5 -LRB- ? -RRB- games . Plus the cutscenes in between hardly make sense and Mr.Krabs does n't even sound right . This game seems like fun after you play some of the games but then the games ends and that 's it . I do n't reccomend this game .
 I should have known when there was no age rating given on the box that this game would n't exactly have a committment to quality . I 'll ignore the big pixel graphics , which are not even on par with a typical child 's game , and the fact that the voice of SpongeBob sounds nothing like it does on TV , and focus on the gameplay , which is stunningly unimpressive . I bought this game for my six-year-old son from somewhere other than Amazon , and paid a ridiculous price for it . In return , here is what I got
 I played this at my friends house and she is 8 years old . She loves it and said it was the best game ! So she begs me to play it . First of all there is n't really a challenge put to this game . Its really just a bunch of mini games that have no meaning to it . Although I did n't give it 1 star because There are 2 `` mini '' games that I adore ! The boating school one and the who cut the cheese . But the rest are BORING ! There really is n't a selection of `` mini '' games to choose from . It could just be that my friend was a hog and woulde n't give her guest a turn . But from what I saw and the little I played it was boring . I do have Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom on my Playstation 2 and that is what I call a fun game ! Get Battle for Bikini Bottom its way cooler !
 I am 10 years old and my little bro . is 3 . We are big fans of spongebob . I was the first one to play it , and it gets boring VERY fast.You have to play every game 3 times , and sometimes a bonus level before advancing . You have to beat 1 game before you can play others , and the voices of the characters sound nothing like they do on TV . You can beat the entire game in less than 1 hour.Boring for older kids , more fun for younger kids .
 Seeing pictures of this Spongebob game attracted me into buying it for 15 bucks , while at the same time , wasting those same 15 bucks . It 's called `` False Advertising '' . The actual gameplay became boring after a while , as the games were very repitous . Three rounds of the same thing
 First of all , I 'd like to say that I am 16 years old and love spongebob . I was n't expecting too much from this game since it was made by nickelodeon and most of their stuff is -LSB- bad -RSB- that 's thrown together in an hour tops.Even with my expectations set low , I was disappointed . It did n't take me very long at all to beat the entire game . . it is way too short . The games are monotonous and you must beat one to get the next . There are three levels in every game , and the last one takes a good 5 tries to beat sometimes , which is frustrating.This game may be ok for an 8-11 year old but not much younger because you have to have a decent attention span to keep interest long enough to beat the levels , although I 'm sure there are cheat codes somewhere on the internet to unlock all of the games at once.The graphics were pretty bad -- the characters did n't look right and the pixels were big , meaning the graphics were n't very sharp . The voices did n't sound anywhere near close to what the characters really sound like either.The reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is because of course I love spongebob and some of the games were cute and entertaining for a bit . Plus , like I said earlier , it would be much better for younger kids ... depending on what their attention span is like.It was only about an hours worth of mild entertainment and definately not worth -LSB- the money -RSB- .
 Do n't waste your money on this one . It is ridiculous to expect a child to be able to play this game by using keyboard commands . My daughter is 8-years-old and very computer capable . She found this game completely frustrating . I usually take my lumps in life , but this game was such a complete waste of money that I am writing to THQ , Nickelodeon , and the corporate offices of ... -LRB- the store where my daughter bought this software with gift money -RRB- with the hope that someone out there will refund her money .
 This game is way too frustrating for any age group . I played it with my 6-year old nephew and 10-year-old niece , and none of us can use the keyboard well enough to succeed.The game works like a Super Mario Brothers arcade of ladders and roadblocks . The problem is that the keyboard commands do not respond well and a mouse is not supported . If you do n't hit the spacebar-cursor key combination just right , you fall when trying to jump , and each time you fall , you must redo a very long sequence of moves to get back to where you left off . This becomes boring and extremely frustrating -- leaving the 6-year-old near tears , the 10-year-old banging keys , and me wondering how this game ever made it past the testing stage.THQ , the manufacturer , makes a lot of games for all the popular video game machines . Perhaps with a video game controller , this game can play well , but it does not translate to a computer keyboard .
 I have a brother , an autistic but smart one , and he loves rugrats and liked the `` all growed up '' tv special , so we thought this 'll be good for him , because he loves kids ' computer games , and it looked so easy on the commercial , so we decided to give it a try.It was extremely hard , and it took him a long time to memorise which key did what , and how to jump without dying . This really upset him , and I think I should give him Jumpstart games from now on .
 This game suffers from many issues including
 Looked like it would be great , but when I got it I saw on its label that it is a windows only product.Sure wish it was for Mac OS X as advertised . : - -LRB-
 I am writing with reference to Office 2003 Standard in both Upgrade and Full -LRB- non upgrade -RRB- versions.The upgrade CD would not accept the 25 alpha numeric ` product ID ' key . It would take 4 characters then jump to the next box . It would not allow you to return to the previous box and back fill the missing letter or number . In short , you could not ever enter the correct product ID . I ca n't say more about this version as I could not get past this point.The Full -LRB- non upgrade -RRB- version seemed more stable . It accepted the ` product ID ' key at least but that is where the problems began.The first problem I had was that in PowerPoint there was no preview . Sure enough , less than 30 days out and there was a critical upgrade to fix this problem.I went to the Microsoft Update page to download it . It failed several times . I then contacted Microsoft Technical support . This is a known problem and you must download -LRB- at least for now -RRB- all updated to your local hard drive and install from there . If they do n't solve this problem , its going to be a major problem when there are more than a few updates for Office 2003 available.I also started to receive ` run time error messages ' when I used Microsoft Internet Explorer . Microsoft technical support says this is not an Office 2003 issue , but an Operating System issue . Sure it is ! I did not have this problem before I installed Office 2003 . The resolution was to disable all Third Party devices -LRB- such as the Google tool bar -RRB- , and remove some other things as well.The new Outlook interface looks great , but what good is a great looking interface if it does not work?For some reason , email sent using Outlook 2003 is identified as ` Spam ' by several spam filtering programs , including Spam Assassin . I found this out when some people I was sending email to did not reply . I telephoned one of them and said they had not received any email form me . They then checked and found it in the ` spam ' folder . Here is the error message that Outlook 2003 generated : > Content analysis details
 While the rest of the world -- Asia , Europe , South America , you name it -- is switching like gangbusters to OpenOffice , millions of people in the US are still just assuming that you have to fork out a few hundred bucks every couple years in order to just produce a decent document . Which of course Microsoft Office in any version does . It does decent documents and spreadsheets and presentations . Fine . But for pete 's sake , you can do all that for free with OpenOffice.org and no one from Uncle Bill will ever come knockin ' at the door wanting to know where your licenses are . Still using Microsoft Office is like leasing your phone for $ 30 a month from the phone company when you can buy one for cheaper.Anyway , Microsoft Office 2003 has nice features but unless it can cure the common cold , there 's no reason to be paying all that money for it . The latest release of OpenOffice.org 1.1 has even better compatibility with MS Office , it handles the new formats , it runs on Windows and UNIX , and it prints straight to PDF . So what is anyone doing paying for MS Office ? Beats me .
 In mid-August I purchased a new 3-Gig P4 mid-range Compaq laptop with Windows XP Pro , a trial version of Microsoft Office and Microsoft Works pre-installed . Using the documentation provided on Amazon.com I purchased the upgrade version of Microsoft Office 2003 Pro on amazon.com . Here it is the mid-November and I 'm still trying to get the trial version to `` covert '' to the upgrade version I purchased . No documentation seems to exist , online or otherwise , and I dread the possibility of spending hours on hold to Microsoft .
 This whole thing is pure waste of money.Not just because OpenOffice is free and compatible as mentioned -LRB- though there 's always the point of liking the look and feel of an application , of course -RRB- but it has been reported to be awfully buggy , ressource-consuming and full of errors even in pre-release state . I do have the feeling that you guys from the US are pretty much misinformed -LRB- how about reading magazines ?! -RRB- . Here in Europe hardly anybody complaines having spent just a few hundred bucks and later recognizes that it was garbage in the package.The most sensitive disadvantage of all MS products is their permanent attempt to infiltrate your business in a certain way , herewith controlling you - just with a laughing face to `` steal '' the money right out of your pocket.The only thing you do whenever anybody supports MS products is to increase their influence and therewith prevent others to provide really productive tools - at a much lower cost , in most cases.With the new version , MS again tries to get into deep structures by setting up software environments that limit possibilities to predefined areas . The user is not free to decide independently . And this exactly is what MS does since its foundation . Things wo n't work which have worked before , structures and interfaces have changed so no one keeps the overview -LRB- which , of course , is a good reason for the next upgrade where the changes of the changes of the changes are called user input -RRB- , and so on . Especially MS office seems to be an excellent platform to test future strategies at the cost of users . This , in a way , happens quite anonymously because nobody will encounter all bugs at the same time.Microsoft does product testing while at the same time getting paid for it . That 's what I call CLEVER WORK !
 After being a hardcore Microsoft user for years and years , I 've recently discovered a whole new world through the GNU/Linux platform . Windows users -- go to www.openoffice.org . Download the FREE software , which is fully compatible with Microsoft formats , and if this does n't do the job , then you can shell out $ 300 + for the traditional product .
 If you want an alternative to MS Office , that is also compatible with MS Office , use Open Office . You can find it under the Google search term Open Office . It 's a free download , and just as good as Office 2003 . You get a Word application , a spreadsheet application , and a PowerPoint application . All are compatible with Office 2003 .
 If you are primarily a Word and Excel user , this upgrade is just not worth it . In fact , I find the typical autocorrect-type -LRB- assumes the programmer knows better than you how you want to format your document -RRB- additions more annoying than improvements to the program . This is overall a very good package , but I just wish Microsoft would leave it alone .
 Good
 You need to get out more . Just the fact that you are looking at this page and are thinking of upgrading your Microsoft Office makes it clear that you have a problem . Do n't believe the Microsoft advertisement featuring dinosaurs to announce `` Microsoft Office Has Evolved . '' It has n't . This is a mature product . It does n't matter if you use Office 1997 , 2000 or 2003 . They are all the same . The good , the bad and the ugly . It is all still here . Maybe a few bugs have been fixed . Most have n't , and ther are always new bugs . If Microsoft took the time to really improve the software , that would be one thing . But they do n't . Here is an example . You are in Outlook . You call up a contact and want to send that person a letter . You need to print an envelope , but there is no command to do so . There is no button to click . You ca n't right click anywhere to print an envelope . I am not making this up . Outlook has been out for almost ten years and multiple upgrades , and Microsoft still has n't gotten around to implementing functionality to print a single envelope . Your only option -LRB- the on-line support confirms this -RRB- is to perform a mail merge . This is an elaborate process that is designed for printing thousands of envelopes for a bulk mailing . It involves opening multiple windows and setting all sorts of settings . You have to go through the ENTIRE PROCESS just to print a single envelope ! What is more , the mail merge feature has bugs in it . It leaves blank lines in addresses that look atrocious , and it drops country names from addresses . It gives you options as to how you want country names treaed in addresses , but these all do nothing . Whatever option you select , Outlook leaves countries out of addresses when it prints envelopes.I could go on , but I wo n't . If you are using Office 2000 or even Office 1997 , you are n't missing out on anything . There is absolutely no reason to shell out $ 250 for new software that does all the same things in all the same ways with mostly the same bugs .
 If you use Access 2002 or earlier in your websites , do n't buy office 2003 because Access 2003 is not supported by anyone including bCentral , a Microsoft Company . I changed providers to bCentral after being told they did , then found they do n't , plus not to mention can not connect to their servers most of the time . As with any MS product , always errors.It has been a complete nightmare , I uninstalled 2003 and reinstalled 2002 and all my databases that I opened with 2003 are screwed up . It will take me months to fix a 1500 page website that is Access driven . Time I learned PHP or MySQL .
 The major flaw with this product is that it 's not clear which version of Office you can upgrade FROM.Note
 ZoneAlarm says that it will work with Windows ME , but it also says that it is optimized for Windoes XP . I have Windows ME , and installed Zone Alarm . My computer was running very slowly with some applications not functioning as intended . I ended up uninstalling ZoneAlarm .
 today ZoneAlarm renew failed for 18 tries , ZA refuses to have phone support the ultimate in tech service abdication . Za also failed to run once downloaded and can not find a manger or tech person to bother to address . the issue . They actually would like to charge us to answer tech questions even though they know they are having server failures.This once responsive comapany has joined the Big Oil Enron ranks in refusing to address customer needs .
 I run XPPro and after 10 days of back and forth with the customer service people -LRB- very helpful by the way -RRB- I still do not have the product installed . This is NOT , at least for me , a case of put the cd in the drive and all is well ! I have used the downloadable freeware versions and they preform well . No doubt this will also IF I ever get it installed . Right now it is a case of having to dig deeply into hidden files to do so ! Hopefully other users have better luck .
 After installing Webroot Spy Sweeper , 4 spyware programs were indentified . When a request was made to Zone Labs for assistance in the removal of these items , they would only refer me to Webroot and would not assist me because ZoneAlarm did not recognize the spyware at all .
 There is no customer service to help you install the product . If , you want help they will charge you . Can not tell if product is any good or not . I bought it for a present for my sister in law and it was a big mistake . Scammers , beware
 Though it does keep spyware and viruses off the computer , it also firewalls absolutely everything . It completely locked out my University email and would not allow sending of messages , viewing of address books , or many other functions . It came up as java/javascript errors but several people tried unsuccessfully to get it to work . It wasnt until I did a complete uninstall that I could get email to work again . Also , it is so sensitive that it asks permission with even obvious progams to allow . The little advisory balloons are annoying and definitely overdone . This was a waste of money product .
 If you are a software programmer who use Borland JBuilder , this suite definitely not for you because you ca n't launch JBuilder unless you shutdown Zonealarm .
 As on of the other reviewers said , go to their forum and do some research ! This is a buggy program that I could not get to install and work properly . It caused immediate blue screens , and had to be removed in safe mode . Apparently this is a common experience . Based on my experiences I can not recommend this program , which is unfortunate given how good their software has been in the past .
 After having seen the glowing review in PC Magazine and the mixed reviews of Amazon customers , I decided to reserve judgment till I 'd tested the program myself . Well , the verdict is in . Every time I downloaded ZoneAlarm into a computer , that computer would lose the ability to connect to my on-line service . Guilty as charged .
 Terrible Product ! I installed it and it made my MS Outlook crash several times a day . Twice I had to reinstall Outlook . Contacted their customer service about the problem . No help , they kept telling me how to reset my Zone Alarm account password . Obviously they do n't read their incoming emails and just send out some canned message . After several days of this , I uninstalled Zone Alarm and installed PC-cillin . I had no further problems with Outlook . I previously used Norton and never had my email crash with their product either . My recommendation , do n't buy unless you enjoy having Outlook crash and you like to reload software . Interestingly , when I asked for a refund they never answered my emails - go figure .
 The bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things do n't go as planned . Customer Service exists but their reps claim they ca n't do anything about your problem . Their manners are less than acceptable . Rude seems to be the `` in-thing '' at this company . As consumers , we have options ; one of which is to ge elsewhere . I am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned . It 's too bad .
 Do n't buy Zone Alarm if you use AOL ; they are not compatable . The pop-ups will drive you crazy and AOL wo n't work properly . Also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed . I bought it from Amazon and had to throw it away in a month ... no refund ; money lost . Norton is far better with AOL .
 Up until version 6 of Zonealarm , I would have given a hearty two thumbs up for this product . With version 6 , and Check Point 's take over of zonelabs , they have stumbled hard . Contrary to their assertions , Windows 2000 Pro and XP Pro are NOT fully supported . If you are a running a windows based network with multiple users , active directory , roaming profiles , this product will cause no end of grief for the client machines . New users will not be able to log on . Users will not be able to log onto different computers , unless you uninstall Zonealarm . Zonelabs tech support 's response is that they do not support these integral features to Windows . Instead they try to shift you to their ` corporate ' Integrity product , which is waaaaaayy too much product for most ZA users and waaaay to expensive .
 Installation is a PAIN ! I had been using an earlier version and needed to renew . I purchased this product in hopes of upgrading and not losing all my settings . Well , that did not work . I tried installing it many times but never got past the first window . I went online for support and found that others had been having the same problem and the only fix was to uninstall my old version and do a `` clean install '' . That was my last resort but I had no other choice except to go out and buy another product . That 's what I did and then it installed perfectly but I 'm back to the little window popping up every few minutes telling me `` so and so '' is trying to access my computer , etc. . So if you have hopes of upgrading and keeping your old settings , forget it .
 I purchased Zone Alarm Security Suite 2006 as a replacement for Norton Internet Security 2005 . I had been using Norton for several years but decided to change because of what I had been reading about the new Norton 2006 edition . Perhaps this was a big mistake ? Zone Alarm loaded easily enough and I was able to set all settings without any problem . However , after loading and starting up , all , and I mean all of my other applications ran extremely slowly from this point on . I have decided to keep Zone alarm in hopes a future update will correct this problem but I doubt that it can or will . I would NOT recommend this software unless ZA fixes this problem in future upgrades . Although it seems to do the job fairly well , it is just too slow and slows down every application I run .
 The Box is great looking but I never got a chance to see the program . I installed ZA Security Suite 06 on my 3yr old XP Pro , with a Pent4 ,2 G ,1 G ram and plenty of drive space then rebooted my computer as directed . Up came my welcome screen and then ... Nothing . After about 15 min . at welcome , I knew I was in trouble . My system locked up and had to manually shut down . On startup from a full shut down , I had hopes that would fix the problem but it did not . I rebooted up in `` Safe Mode '' to remove ZA . I have my system back up but will not try reinstalling ZA . In the past when I had problems with software not working on my system I would end up waisting time trying to get it to work properly . I 've even had to reformat my hard drive a time or two . Wasted time and frustration has taught me that `` if at first it does n't work back in the box it goes '' . Most user will probably not have any problems with ZA especially on new machines with little other software installed . After time , things associated with your installed software may have something that new software does not like or can not work with . Thus problems with compatibility arise .
 The individual components are very highly rated , but the suite is a resource hog . On a 3.4 Ghz overclocked Intel 630 machine with 1GB of RAM there is a considerable slowdown , especially if you have Outlook , Word and Google Desktop running . I was using Norton AV and ZoneAlarm free firewall with Spybot and the difference is noticable . Memory usage for Outlook jumped from 30MB to almost 80MB and it was not unusual to have 100 % CPU usage . I decided to unistall this product and use the old combination.I know that there is a known memory leak for Zonealarm Pro , I am dissapointed that they still have not fixed it .
 I have purchased this product in hope it will be faster then sluggish NIS , howether this was a mistake . It does not support Thunderbird ; it takes minutes to scan mail in Outlook Express after download . Sometimes OE just hangs up so it must be killed and restarted . CPU usage of zlclient.exe and vsmon.exe frequently goes up to 100 % and stays there for minutes . Next year I will try AVG .
 The last free version of the ZA program blocked my computer access to Internet . I followed all the instructions of their web page to unblock it , but it did not work . I downloaded the trial version before buying it , but nothing changed . I uninstalled it , but the song remained the same . Internet access blocked untill now . I uninstalled it from my other computers and ... no way to buy a program like this one .
 Does n't hold a candle to PC-Cillin . They 've slashed costs , and still not worth a cent . Its a resource hog and I 've always had problems with installations -LRB- I 'm an IT guy -RRB- . Trend Micro is the way to go , followed by Symantec in a distant second . Stay away from Avanquest and McAfee .
 I ordered ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 after a PC magazine review , I have a 3 month old HP Media Center PC . Th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice . Each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer . I lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe I decided to return it . I did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product . I am now using Norton Internet Security with no problems . I transfered it from an older abandoned PC.I mave been a PC user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software . This is one of the few programs I could not instal . I have used the free Zone Alarm Firewall without problems.ewb
 When I made up my mind to go for another Antivirus and spyware software from McAfee , I had many options . I drilled down further and concentrated on two porducts , Norton and ZoneAlarm.I visited many websites , read many reviews about them . I made my mind to purchase Norton . I came to Amazon site to purchase it . Mean while some pop ad came and it showed that some website have gave ZoneAlarm a good rating . Huh ... I went to CNET site and read about ZoneAlarm product . I just thought let 's take shot for this and I purchased ZoneAlarm.After purchase I thought I made a mistake by choosing this , but I was wrong . I found this software is pretty nice . This internet suite gives you virus/spyware/firewall and many other protection . It 's very easy install . Just remove your earlier one and install this . It works amazing . It prevents unauthorised access to your pc . It 's virus definitions are upto date . GUI part is also simple.Still I am giving 4 rating to this product because of two things :1 -RRB- While installation , you may get an error about some file . You will have to locate that file and delete from your hard disc . After that the installation is very easy . Since I am a software professional so I can figured that out . Non IT people may have some trouble2 -RRB- System scanning takes a long time.Except these two things , I did n't find any other problem with this.Nice product to purchase .
 I could not install from the disk , it must have a reading error . So I downloaded ZA Security Suite from their web site and did a CLEAN install with no problems . Then I registered it & downloaded some updates . AND that 's when EVERYTHING slowed down or just stopped working . I tried deactivating different features to no avail . I never did find an answer -LRB- the wait was too long -RRB- . So I 've uninstalled it and am using Windows firewall and Symantics Anti Virus software .
 If you want to do more than constantly tell your internet security who to allow access and who to deny , then pass this one up ! I 'm not a computer geek , but I 'm not a newbie either . I have successfully been surfing the internet for about 10 years with few problems . I bought this in January to replace Norton because it supposedly covered a few more things . It 's only July and I 've uninstalled from both my desktop and my husband 's laptop . I 'll end up paying double for internet/virus security software this year , but I just could n't live with Zone Alarm one more minute . Every 20 minutes it would ask me if I wanted to allow this program or that program access to the internet . Checking off the box `` remember this setting '' did n't make any difference because tomorrow it would be asking me the same question about the same program all over again . Yes , I want a security suite smart enough to know that it has to allow itself access to the internet for updates . I should n't have to tell it . Sometimes it was less clear what program was asking for access because it was only identified by an IP address and not even a partial real name . That left me trying to figure out if it was friend or foe ? I do n't have time for that.Additionally it s-l-o-w-e-d both systems down to a crawl for the first 10 minutes after boot up . If you dared to try to do anything during this period the whole computer froze up and you were forced to `` control alt delete '' to reboot . As I said I do n't have time for that . I just want to get on my computer and have it work properly.AVOID ZONEALARM !
