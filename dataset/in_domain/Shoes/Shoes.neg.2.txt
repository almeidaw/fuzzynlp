 The boots that 's are in the picture are not the boots I got when I purchased these . . They run very big and I was very mislead . .
 These boots smelled so bad , I had to get rid of them . The rubber smell is so strong it made the closet they were stored in smell , too .
 I can hardly walk in them with them falling off . I ordered a size 10 and expected that they might be a little larger than the average 10 , but these are huge ! boots fit like they are a size 12 . very disappointing
 I hate the boots ! I purchased a pair for $ 110 in October of 2012 . After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder . Regardless of the floor surface ; carpet , concrete , or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder . It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem . I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $ 15 . Thanksgiving goes by , then Christmas , then New Years with no word about my shoes . Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes . A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland . I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again . I am out $ 125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 I got these for my ranch . Liked when I first got , but it sprung a leak and they are only 3 months old ! not happy about this and will not buy this brand again !
 Seems like good construction - but ridiculously oversized . I ordered one size smaller than I needed and that was still just too big . Had to return them because they were n't really wearable - what a pain ...
 I purchased these to work in hot wet conditions so I wear shorts and a tee shirt while grinding concrete countertops . The surface inside rubs against my calf and burns a raw spot there . I have to stuff cloth inside to prevent chafing .
 When I received this product , it was not quite what the picture entailed . There were quite a few differences . They ran a size and a half roughly too large . Not a huge fan of this product . Not happy with them at all . They 've been used once and now are just sitting .
 I purchased this boots for same price I would find it at Walmart , but I tjought I would get some better quality . . Wrong!I returned this items 3x times , and every time was a manufacturer defect with either left or the right boot . Finnaly I asked for a refund . Anyway , I went to Walmart and I bought a pair of rainy boots made in Canada , good quality for less money.I understand to get it wrong for the first time but 3x times to receive bad products ?! I was very dissapointed .
 Ah , just a suggestion ... they might sell better if you include the size !!! DUH !!!
 Not lined and the leg opening is not big at all if you have large calves . Had to get a bigger size just to fit the leg opening , but now the shoe part is too big
 it fits perfectly as a size 14 . my foot is a size 11 or 12 . it smells . it does n't seem like it will last more than a few months if you do hard work outside . i would n't recommend it . but for 19 , it 's the best deal on amazon.i took off the boots 40 minutes ago . i 'm in my room , and i can still smell the boot smell from my leg . it 's making me nausea . i got the boots today too .
 Much too wide at the top and too wide at bottom . My foot just swam around in it. , It fit more like a size 8 . I have even had size 8 's that fit better . Guess this is made for a rally wide foot .
 i ordered 2 pairs of clc rain boots , my boyfriend loves his there perfect but mine the size 8 i got a complete different brand that are nothing like the boots i ordered . there a very hard material which makes it hard to even bend your ankles and are veryyyy uncomfortable !!! compared to the size 11 there a very flexible material and are very comfortable . theres no way you can tell if there sending you the boots you ordered , even my reciept says clc rain boots but there not clc brand boots im very unsatisfied !!!!!

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 Ordered these in an 8 , they appear smaller than a 6 . Ridiculously sized .

 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .

 I bought these boots and wore them less than 15 times . The rubber cracked where the ball of foot bends when you walk . This made them useless as rain boots . Very cute , but if they do n't do the job , what 's the point ?
 Yes , the boots are super cute and garner a comment and smile or two when wearing them out . However , when I stepped in a puddle last night and felt water sloshing over my heel only to discover that BOTH PAIRS had large rips in the back seams , they unsurprisingly were n't too adorable anymore.The real rub is that this is my second pair of these boots from Western Chief in the past three years , because I replaced the first pair for the exact same tears in the exact same place , after only wearing those for a little over a year as well . Had they been -LSB- ... -RSB- , I would have begrudgingly abided by the `` get what you pay for '' mantra , but for close to -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks I expect a lot more durability , Western Chief .
 I got these boots a year ago ... super comfortable and cute , but by Fall both cracked ! Very dissapointed for the money ! I really would like another pair , but I ca n't justify the money when they 're probably just going to do it again !
 Within the first couple of months , the materials started to separate on the heal of the left boot . Now that they are about 7 months old , they are all but shot . They have been used for simple chores and only once made it to the wash rack before they started leaking . While they garnered a great amount of amusement , they are not comfortable for the flat-footed individual and the shape does not allow for insole inserts . Cute but not very functional .
 I unwisely ignored the warning signs in the reviews and ordered these boots because they were so darn cute . The first time I wore them they split up the back seam and the paint began to come off the ladybugs eyes . Unless you just want them for their cuteness , skip this brand altogether !
 These were huge ! And they looked like the paint had come off the face and someone had tried to repaint it . Definitely not worth what I paid for them .
 I bought these for my daughter for her birthday 5 days ago , they were $ 45 and she just called to tell me they cracked already ! They are very cute but NOT durable !

 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .

 These boots have a high tongue , the purpose of which is to display DeWalt advertising and perhaps to imitate basketball shoes -LRB- which is what `` high performance '' may mean -RRB- . Protruding from the trouser cuff , the tongue exposes the wearer to invasions , such as poison ivy ; to cold air ; to water ; and to other dangers , such as barbed wire . -LRB- I tried cutting off the tongue off and sealing the cut with duct tape . -RRB- Further , the boot is fitted with laces that are designed for a taller boot and that are made of a cheap material , so neither do they hold a knot , not is it possible to tie the laces safely to prevent tripping . I consider the boot a complete waste of my hard-earned money . Made in China , the boot devalues the DeWalt name , which was once associated to good products .

 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .
 great when I got them but after about one month all the white started turning yellow and after about 3 months they started coming apart at the seams , particularly where the black meets the white turned yellow . They were not expensive but certainly should have lasted more than a few months ... very , very disappointing !!!!!
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .
 I also found the product too tight . Specifically , it seems very narrow at the back whereas there is still more than enough space in front of my big toe . I found the tongue pinching the top of my foot as I walked . I only bought online , so maybe it would 've helped to try on a slightly larger size in-store .
 These boots are extremely narrow , I have narrow feet but these are still impossible for me to keep . Also the shaft is too big , I guess it 's because I have skinny calves . Plus there is no cushion on the footbed , I only walk on the carpet at home but they are already not comfortable to walk at all . The 2 stars are for the looks . I am sending them back right away .

 It looks good but hurt my feet . I have never wore it after 20 minutes . The bottom was too heavy and the top is too little to hold onto your feet .
 They look good on the screen , but in reality the leather is stiff and cheap looking . I 'm a consistent size 8M with average arches , toes , etc. . These felt too small in the toe area , and after a few minutes , my toes felt cramped , and my big toe hurt . I tried a few more times , then I ended up donating them . Not worth it .
 Even though I used the pull-down menu to select an X-Small - I still received a Medium Shoe Tree . They are far too huge to be useful to me for shoes . I 'll just hang them in the closet to protect my sweaters ...

 So sad ! I 'm barely a 9 and should have ordered a 10 . At least . But they fit my friend who wears a 7.5 perfectly , so no harm done .
 I do n't think that I have ever worn these shoes . I ended up not liking the style and they are n't very comfortable . If you purchase these shoes , I recommend getting a heel guard .
 Have worn these shoes for year . Am only sorry that they do n't come in wide and are no longer in stores .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 Having worn Birkenstocks for over 10 years , these are by far the most comfortable with the cushion insole . My problem lies with the fact that the soles of the shoes keep seperating from the microfiber shoe.I had them glued back on after only 6 months . Now they are seperated again after 6 months . There must be a problem with this kind of material not adhuring to the rubber soles . Do n't get me wrong , I love these shoes .
 I am a seasoned `` A '' level volleyballer . Been playing since high school.I bought these on a whim , after my asics wore out . The shoes look really nice and as noted on the instructions enclosed are designed differently to assist volleyball specific jumping.The shoes indeed made my take offs feel perhaps more controlled and a bit more powerful . Other movement on the court was fine as well . The problem though arose after I finished playing , my feet hurt for days afterwards.I have flat feet and so perhaps this is unique to my condition , so unfortunately the shoes are currently sitting idle in my closet .
 I 've never had a more uncomfortable shoe . They hurt my feet and my lower legs and I now have three black toenails from these shoes . The company says your feet have to get adjusted to the shoes and I did give it a go for about three weeks , leading up to a tournament -LRB- I play competitively , 3-4 times a week -RRB- . But I could n't take it anymore and went back to my old shoes for the tourny . Was such a relief to be back in my old shoes . Totally regret buying these shoes and now I 'm stuck with them since I wore them for a few weeks . Maybe others will have a different experience , but I 'll never buy these again .
 Have worn these shoes for year . Am only sorry that they do n't come in wide and are no longer in stores .

 This shoe is just as adorable as it is in the photo . What was n't advertised when I bought them , was that these are basically a driving shoe . You know -- skinny suede sole with nubbies on the bottom . Plus , the weaving is very delicate -LRB- which is beautiful -RRB- . I have been very careful not to wear them anywhere where they would get wet . I even passed my turn in line for a bathroom stall because the floor looked damp . In other words , more cautious than one should have to be with shoes . With all that care , after four wearings , the bottom of one shoe is beginning to wear through the little woven straps of ultra soft leather . If these shoes had the sole of a shoe rather than a slipper , they would be my favorite pair of shoes . Now that they 're falling apart , I ca n't wear them -LRB- looks tacky -RRB- . Outside of a long car , plane , or train trip , I doubt they 'll see daylight again . Sniff , sniff , tear .

 These socks are a gift to my dad who 's diabetic and when I opened the socks , they looked absolutely AWFUL ! They had strings coming off everywhere on them and runs in them ! How do you send expensive socks that look so bad ? Think twice about getting them from this seller
 I purchased these socks based on Amazon buyer feedback . They appeared to be of good quality and fit well . However , upon the first washing , the elastic/lycra in the socks broke down . When I took the socks from the dryer , hundreds of broken elastic strings were protruding from the outside of the material . They are now worthless after a single use . I strongly recommend avoiding this product .
 The shoes are comfortable but the structure of the shoes does not provide support for the sidewalls . They are constantly trying to rollover and your feet are trying to slide off the soles . At a cost of $ 49 , I expected much higher quality construction . When I replace them , they will quickly find a new home in my trash can . Bad purchase !
 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe . The leather was very stiff and thick . I knew it would irritate my foot in walking . The size was right -- the fit was wrong .
 I got these shoes in the taupe suede and thought they were adorable until I tried to get them on my feet . I wear a 10W and have no trouble with other Naturalizer shoes , but this is a Mary Jane , and although the shoe would be wide enough for my foot , the strap is not ! The button does n't unbutton , and even with the elastic band stretched as far as it will go , I still could n't get the shoe on . My foot is wide but not especially fat or tall , but even so the strap is about 1-1/2 inches too short . I am tremendously disappointed , because there is no way to extend the strap -LRB- or remove it -RRB- without ruining the look of the shoe . Maybe a narrow foot will have no issue with the strap , but if you wear a wide size , forget it .
 These shoes may work for people with lower arches . The strap is nonmobile , and with absolutely no flexibility caused problems . I got these shoes for a wedding but when I slipped my feet into them the right shoe tore . The only reason I am giving this two stars is this . Naturalizer tends to be a good shoe , and the quality of the left shoe was decent.I have very high arches , hence my disclaimer , this shoe is for the low of arch . For any foot I recommend an insert as with all dress shoes the interior is slick . I have serious foot issues having had gangrene in one of my feet -LRB- and yes I still have my toes , the shape of the top is very comfortable if you can get past the strap .
 Son bonitos y se ven fashion ! pero cuando caminas , se salen del pie , en vez de zapatos , parecen sandalias o chancletas . Incomodos y faltales . No se puede caminar con ellos .
 Well , I was very excited to get these shoes because I had seen them in the mall , and they looked super cute , but I had never tried them on . Now , I have big feet , a size 11 , but pretty much every pair of 11 's that I 've tried on/bought have always fit.Anyway , I decided to purchase these , because I needed a nice and simple black pump . When they came in the mail , I ripped through that box so quickly -LRB- I was really excited to get them -RRB- , and I think I spent a good couple minutes trying to cram my foot into this VERY narrow and tight shoe . I thought , `` It 's okay , they 'll stretch out . '' So I walked around the house in them for a bit.Two things I noticed :1 -RRB- The point of the toe is so long , that when you walk , the empty part of it actually bends , leaving a bit of a crease . It seemed like this crease would only get deeper and deeper , making the shoes much less attractive .2 -RRB- I went to walk on the carpet , and I slid around all over the place -LRB- just so you know , I have a LOT of experience walking in 3 , 4 , and even 5 inch heels/pumps -RRB- . It was very awkward , and something I have never had a shoe do before.And beyond all that , they just plain hurt . They felt like I was cramming them into a size 9 . I do n't think that they would have ever been comfortable , broken in or not.Sadly I ended up returning them . I really wanted to try to make it work , but for $ 67.00 , I had to LOVE them . They looked great online , but not on my feet .
 I love the look of these but they are very uncomfortable and run small . I ordered an 8 which usually fits but was tight in these shoes .
 These shoes came as a rec . from a friend who swears by them . As a girl who has to dress in business professional attire everyday for work I was excited to try these . I have not even had them for 2 weeks and the metal is already worn through the heel , mind you I am 5 ' 11 '' and thin . I have shoes from Target that are better made than these ! The heel looks chewed up and the bottoms are almost worn . I am not on my feet a whole lot so I ca n't see why these shoes would already be as worn as they are , except for being cheaply made . Other than that , the out side of them looks nice ... but if I could return them I would . Not impressed BCBG !
 I 've bought these heels several times the last time I bought them I was very dissapointed when I received them . They are not the same material feels different definitely not as soft as the ones I 've bought before like I said I 've both the same shoes before . It says they 're BCBG but I do n't know I 've bought them before and they do n't feel the same not as comfortable as before . Months after they are still in my closet -LRB- almost new -RRB- and now I find myself looking for them again . It is how I came across this review I had written . I 'm glad I recognized my renew since I wrote it before I actually got the heels thinking I would like them . I 'm definitely not buying them from here again .
 I have purchased many BCBG Katchen Shoes on line from Amazon . This is the 3rd pair of this shoe I have purchased in the last three years . I wear them as daily work shoe.Unfortunately , thie entire sole of this last pair came off within 3 weeks of wearing them . It was neither snowy or rainy . It was surprising as this shoe has always performed very well for me and BCBG is top quality . I wonder if Amazon had very old inventory in stock where the glue on the sole was separting.I was quite disappointed . But if you can get a normal quality pair , they are great . They look good and are very comfortable . I have never had an issue in the past and would still recommend them for women working in the office .
 i bought these shoes and they lokked great but the were too small and my toes hung ofver the edge . so if your a size 11 do n't bother . but if your smaller than just order the next size up .

 the front wore out quickly because it was being dragged on the floor . as a kids shoe I would expect to last longer . had a hole in the top front within 3 weeks .
 The straps on both shoes broke the very first time worn . Spent the rest of the day at work wearing broken shoes .
 I have a hard time finding shoes to fit as I have a small foot . I was thrilled to see these shoes at Amazon and quickly ordered a pair -LRB- I already have a pair and they are so comfortable -RRB- . After almost 2 months , I received a note that the order had been cancelled because they could n't obtain the shoes . I was very disappointed . Plus I had ordered something else that qualified me for free shipping and I was n't even given the opportunity to make that up . Very disappointed .
 Gave one star because no stars was not an option . I 've been waiting delivery of this item for quite some time ; received e-mail that it was back-ordered . It 's been months , where is it ?
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .
 Ok , I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother . I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color . I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes . Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones , The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2 . WTF ? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time . Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift . The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA .
 A few years back -LRB- though it seems like forever ago -RRB- , I was in graduate school for anthropology . I was the studious type and had gone straight from college to grad school , so I 'd never had time for a girlfriend . Sure , I 'd had my dalliances , but when it came down to it my only sustained love was anthropology . It was Spring Break , and I 'd gotten a grant to travel to the Oaxaca region of Mexico and study the indigenous Zoque tribe . Figuring I 'd need a sturdy pair of sneakers and impressed with the rubber shell toe design , I ordered a pair of Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoes -LRB- White/Black -RRB- on Amazon . They arrived the morning of my flight.That day I flew to Mexico City and then took a bus to the city of Oaxaca , where I transferred to another bus to get to the base of Monte Alban . I then climbed Monte Alban to reach the peak , where I 'd read the Zoque tribe could be found . At this point I 'd been on my feet for nearly 16 hours , but I had nary a blister or even a foot ache to speak of . I was beginning to really like my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . But they were caked in dirt and I was getting tired , so I decided to take a break at the summit . As I was about to wash my sneakers in a puddle of water , I heard a rustling of leaves . I looked up and all of a sudden 10 Zoque warriors were surrounding me , spears drawn . I knew a few Zoque phrases from my studies , so I told them , `` Tuk ` ay Tum , '' -LRB- `` I am your friend '' -RRB- but perhaps my dialect was off because that only enraged the warriors more . Soon , the Zoque Chieftan had his spear within an inch of my throat . At that moment , I was certain I would die right there in my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs.But just then , a female hand grabbed the spear and threw it on the ground . I looked up , and standing in the golden sunlight was the most beautiful girl I 'd ever laid eyes on . Her tawny skin glistened like a lake on a cool summer night , her jet-black hair was so soft it made horses jealous , and her eyes were like two perfect almonds . `` I Almika , '' she said , gesturing toward herelf . `` I Dan , '' I timorously replied , awestruck by her beauty . `` Why joo here ? '' Almika asked innocently . `` Study , '' I answered . `` Joo study Zuque ? '' Almika continued . I nodded in the affirmative . At this , Almika 's eyes beamed with excitement . She said something in Zuque that made the warriors lower their spears.Relieved and relaxed , I strolled with Almika toward the Zuque encampment . Between her limited English , my limited Zuque and some hand gestures , we were able to communicate with one another . I learned that she enjoyed weaving and playing traditional Zuque songs on her ocarina , and more importantly that she was looking for a man but was having trouble finding one in her tribe . It was important to her that a man be brave and strong , as many men in her tribe were , but she also wanted a man who was cultured and could show her the world beyond Monte Alban . It was clear to her that I was worldly , but in order to win her heart I knew I 'd have to prove that I was brave and strong . So that night as I fell asleep on my straw bed in the encampment , my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs still caked in dirt , I resolved to show her that I was tough.I rose early and quickly learned that the Zuque men were setting out to fetch firewood . I waved to Almika and then followed them into the woods . Fortunately , I 'd had some experience gathering wood for the fireplace at my parents ' country house in Massachusetts . So I quickly noticed the dry pieces of wood , which impressed the Zuque men . When we returned to camp at midday , I had a haul of firewood in my hands as I espied Almika roasting a cob of maize over a tiny flame . `` Better fire '' I said , and threw some of my wood onto the fire . The sudden burst of flames frightened Almika and she dropped her maize on the ground . Without flinching , I picked it up and held it near the enlarged fire . When it was perfectly crisped , I proudly handed the cob of maize back to her . Beaming , Almika bit into the maize and exclaimed `` Ees tasty ! `` The rest of the afternoon was spent helping the Zuque men fix up one of the elders ' adobes . My repair skills honed on D-I-Y projects with my Dad at our country house in Massachusetts came in handy here . I impressed the Zuque men by patching up a small hole in the roof using some Trident chewing gum I 'd brought in my backpack . When we returned to camp at dusk , the men relayed tales of my handiwork to Almika , who smiled and locked her piercing brown eyes with mine . She walked toward me and we sat on two boulders around the fire during the communal tribe dinner of rattlesnake stew , flirting and laughing all the while.As dinner was winding down , I had my arm around Almika and was about to suggest we take things to an empty hut on the periphery of the encampment . But just then , we heard the shriek of a Zuque child . I looked over and racing toward us was a gigantic jaguar galloping at full speed . Instinctively , I grabbed a bow that was lying next to me and loaded it with an arrow . I 'd learned archery at day camp near my parents ' house in Massachusetts . My parents did n't want me to go because they thought the camp was run by a bunch of ne'er - do-well Hippies , but fortunately I convinced them to let me go . I pulled the bow string back , and released . It was so dark I could barely see what had happened . But then I heard the noise - first a whisper and then a full-on chant `` Dan ! Dan ! DAN ! DAN ! DAAAAN ! '' and when I looked closely , I saw that I 'd hit the jaguar squarely between the eyes ! Almika ran up to me and gave me a bear hug . I held her and just wanted to be with her , but jaguar blood was everywhere - on my arms , on my legs , and on my already dirt-caked Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .
 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 I suspect this is standard footwear at Guantanamo , assuming these are n't banned under the Geneva Convention . Aside from the look of this shoe , I can not find one redeeming feature . These are far inferior to much cheaper shoes I 've had in terms of comfort , craftsmanship , and fit.I 've mostly worn Ferragamo loafers for the past several years , but I thought it was time to ditch the gaudy buckles and go for something classic and conservative , so I chose this design . I was fitted at the 5th Ave AE store in New York City , and I ultimately ordered 2 pairs online the following week - one in black calfskin , one in burgundy calfskin.They were uncomfortable at the store , but the woman helping me insisted that massaging the heel cup and just wearing them a few times would break them in . This is false . I literally could not walk the one block to my subway stop for the first 3 weeks wearing these . I actually took cabs to work hoping I would n't find a pool of blood in the heel of my shoes each evening . I stomped on the heel cup and tried to use a shoe tree to stretch the area of the toe box that was crushing my pinky toe to no avail . It 's now two months later and they are still horribly uncomfortable . If there is so much as a wrinkle in my sock or the slightest seam , the shoe is unbearable , and the heel continues to chafe.The toe box actually feels stretched out now that they 've broken in a bit . This is far far more pronounced in the burgundy shoes , which broke in a bit easier , perhaps because of a slightly different tanning process ?? Who knows , but now the shoes that once seemed too tight in my forefoot are too loose , and my foot feels like it 's slipping off the footbed if I so much as step on uneven pavement.The sides of the shoe right above the exterior pucker with each step . It seems the heel cup extends a bit far toward the instep . Combined with the strap of leather from the upper that keeps the front stiff , the leather in between the two has no choice but to pucker outward , which I find particularly interesting since all of the leather is remarkably stiff except that one area.The soles are soft , which I sadly does n't seem to make the shoes more comfortable , but it does manage to pick up every grain or pebble on the floor . I 've never thought gravel or pebbles to be a problem , but somehow everything is a problem with these shoes.On the black pair of shoes , the creases on the left and right shoe are very different . While the right creases normally , the left puckers upward and bulges out . I might attribute that to inconsistencies between my feet , but since the burgundy pair does n't have that problem , it seems to be inconsistency in manufacturing.Overall , the quality is so far inferior than I imagined . It 's inconsistent , stiff in the wrong places , and without a doubt the least comfortable pair of shoes I 've ever worn . I deeply regret waiting and waiting for them to break in - it would have been wiser to get my money back . I am extremely disappointed in these shoes and recommend anyone considering buying them be absolutely certain about the comfort prior to purchasing , and even then , perhaps it 's better to seek an alternative .
 I found these to be less than comfortable . The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour .
 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!

 I have bought two pairs of Drams for myself and one for a friend and they have all leaked the liquid , not from the screw caps . It is the most comfortable and cushioned Reef flip-flop yet , but `` the Dram is not worth a damm ! ''
 Was so excited to get these . . ordered a pair , fit great , but RIGHT foot leaked , because it was missing the seal , returned to get another with the other shoe leaking this time ... also , cheap plastic , pain in the but to fill , and it barely holds one shot ... cool - but bad design
 I thought these sandals were the sweetest thing when I first got them 2 months ago . However , in the past week the flask on both sandals cracked . They are very comfortable and if I were to buy another pair of reefs i would go for the original sandals or the fannings . Please beware when spending $ 50 on a pair of sandals with a flask .
 These sandals are basically well made sandals - nothing fancy , other than you can sneak alcohol into a concert in them . Unfortunately , each sandal only holds about 1.5 ounces of liquor , or a total of two weak drinks . If you are really desperate enough to need the buzz , let someone else drive and drag you along . If you really want the age-old secret , here it is - fill a small `` clean '' cooler with ice and vodka with your unopened orange juice inside . Nobody can tell .
 I bought a set of these and they 're a cool novelty , being the guy who has flask sandals . There 's a couple problems though , one sandal leaked all 1 shot of booze out . The other sandal , even after many washings with dish soap , still make whatever alcohol I put in them taste nearly unbearable , even when poured into a mix . Not worth any amount of money spent on these , do not buy them .
 I ordered these back in May of 2008 , and these are still very comfortable and mostly in one piece . The only problem with these were within the first couple of months of wearing them , the container inside actually cracked and broke , rendering the whole `` idea '' useless.You 're paying the extra dollar for the gimmick of being able to carry liquids in your shoe , but if the container is n't durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of everyday life , then I ca n't recommend these shoes.And even if the containers were durable enough , their capacity is very limited .
 I have several pairs of Reefs ... hands down the best sandals out there . . but I will be darned if these things leaked after the first fill up . . didnt know till I was headed to the Pearl Jam concert ... filled a little Jamesons in there . . and put them back on ... drip drip drip ... other than that , they are a very comfortable sandal ... but reef makes better utility sandals ... the bottle opener ones , stash box , fuzzy and the golf ones are way better and useful than the flask ... shop around ...
 First , let me say that I 'm a fan of Reef sandals and own several pairs but these sandals disappointed at every turn . I know the flask is a novelty but less than 1 oz . per shoe ... Really ? Come on!The bigger problem arose after only several days of wear when the plastic -LRB- flask part -RRB- on both shoes cracked and crumbled , so even if I did want a drink fit for a lilliputian it would not have been possible.I know what you 're thinking ... And no , I 'm not fat , this is just a terrible product that should have never made it to market .
 It was not the kind of sandal you expected , the finishes seem to be for women and not men .
 The idea of having your flip flop hold some ounces of liquid is a fun idea , however , after wearing the sandals for almost a month off and on , the container shattered and the area that is right under your arc became very uncomfortable . I would stick to the sandals with the bottle top opener .
 This is exactly why we now have TSA agents making everyone take their shoes off before boarding a plane . . honestly , why would you sell these ?
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 I found these to be less than comfortable . The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour .
 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!
 I absolutely love the look of these shoes and I did receive lots of complements on them.However , the first day I wore them they hurt since there is no give or elasticity where the band goes across the top of toes so side of feet dug in.The back did n't seem to be a problem 'til the 2nd time I wore them and I ended up with a HUGE blister on my heel which I am still treating with neosporin and another blister on the toe area . I wish there had been more elasticity to them.These shoes can not be broken in . They either feel good from the get go or not.The problem with this is they can not be returned since they were worn so I gave them away to a friend visiting from out of state.If she ends up with the same results then nothing is lost on her part.Just thought you should know .

 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .

 I ordered these because they looked like very cute ballet flat type of shoes , and they had good reviews here and elsewhere . When I got mine ... they fit horribly . Uncomfortable to say the least ... I had the Return label printed , the shoes reboxed and back in the mail within 20 minutes of getting the box open . Its too bad that they did n't fit me , because I really like the design .
 So I returned tham and am waiting for a refund on my bank card statement .
 My boyfriend saw these KSWISS Albury Ii Mens shoes and liked what he saw . However , they showed two different shoes . When you search for this shoe , it brings up a white shoe , but when you click on the link to select your size and buy the shoe , it shows a totally different shoe . What is shown has dark gray on the side around the toes , a red emblem of Kswiss , yellow/gold on the bottom of the shoe and dark gray on the tongue of the shoe . When I got it in the mail , it was a white shoe . I called amazon and explained . They appoligized and said they would take the incorrect picture down . Shoe buy said they dont have the shoe shown and that it may have been a older version of the shoe that kswiss no longer sells . I am returning . I was very dissapointed and I doubt if I 'll buy Kswiss again .
 Although they Iook great , I am quite disappointed with these boots . I was not aware of how tiny my legs needed to be in order to be able to zip these boots up . Should have sent them back , but thought I could lose enough weight before I &#34; needed &#34; to wear them ...
 Returning these shoes was heartbreaking but , there was no way around it . The shoe repair shop said they could not stretch them enough to fit comfortably . I bought a size 10 in burgundy and the size is like a 9 . They are very beautiful , sexy , and well made shoes . I wish designers would get a clue and make clothes and shoes true to size .

 I purchased these shoes a month ago , and though for a quick walk around try out they were fine , I quickly learned that they are constructed very poorly . The rivets that hold the sole in place are too large and protrude into your foot , which is absurdely painful . Unfortunately , I 've found that Kenneth Cole products -LRB- like many others -RRB- have gone done hill in terms of quality . Maybe it was just the pair that I owned , but I 'm not willing to try them again .
 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .
 I ordered these shower shoes because I had recently had surgery and wanted to be sure I did n't slip . These slippers are slicker than the tiles . If that 's why you are buying -- do n't !
 These are comfy - they protect your feet in the shower - and are completely impractical for travel.They never dry out ! When you 're traveling and using these shoes for communal showers - you need material that dries quickly . I even held them under hand driers and blow dryers when available -LRB- often for a long time -RRB- and squeezed them in towels to no avail . They were still soaking wet . Packing a pair of wet shoes that stay wet is just a breeding ground for bacteria and general grossness.Get a cheap $ 2 pair of foam flip flops - they 'll do the job , dry fast enough and are cheap enough to toss when the travels are over .

 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .

 Well , I ordered this boot because the price makes it a fabulous bargain , and it looked good in the picture , but honestly , after trying it on , I ca n't think of a situation where I would wear it . It 's not waterproof , it 's not sturdy or heavy enough for cold weather wear ; snow and salt would probably ruin it in a hurry . The sole looks sturdy in the picture , but it feels very thin , and feels like you are walking barefoot . As far as looks , it 's very trendy and fashionable . If I rated it on looks alone , it would be 5 stars ! A couple more negatives
 Let me start by saying ouch !!! I saw these shoes and they looked great . Rockport is suppose to be the most comfortable shoe ... These ae not.I do not have a wide foot so I would never consider bying a wide shoe . If you foot is not pencil thin and you really want this shoe buy a wide.Also if you have a high instep this shoe is not for you .
 This is the third pair I have bought over the course of 5 + years . I order the brown/brown color.First pair was 5 stars , the next 4 stars . This one three stars
 I 've worn Timberlands of various kinds since the mid-1970s . They used to last seemingly forever , but a pair of boat shoes I bought in 2008 was worn through at the heels in a year , and my next pair was shot even worse after a few months , plus the inner soles decomposed in a matter of weeks . Both pairs , however , showed little wear on the upper leather , and the stitching remained intact . Unfortunately , excellent uppers on crummy soles still makes a crummy shoe . No more Timberlands for me .
 These shoes cost about $ 90 and Timberland can not even cough up the $ 2 to waterproof them . To add insult to injury , the footbeds are as thin as a piece of paper.One could buy Rockport , Nunn Bush , Florsheim , Deer Stags , etc. all for a lower price and all of them would be more comfortable and waterproofed !
 Fit is loose . Outer soul is very thin and flimsy . Looks cheap for this brand . I ended up buying a `` comparable '' shoe from Docker , that was much more comfortable , with far better looks and durability .
 This was my first time buying shoes online . I got the shoes + they were too big , I wore them about a day to see if I could get used to them , but I could n't because they were slipping off too much . I emailed Footsmart about this , informing them that I have wore them . They emailed me back saying go ahead and return them . So I paid for the postage + everything , but I did n't get the money back and they had the shoes for about a week now . So I contacted them again , now they are saying they ca n't give me a refund , because the shoes have been wored , but I stated that in the email . I ask for a supervisor to give me a call back -LRB- because the rep said she was n't able to help me with , that a supervisor would have to get involved -RRB- . That never happen , after me calling back four times , I demanded to speak to a supervisor , without having to wait . The supervisor pretty much told me that the email I had from them , saying that I could go a head and return them , was useless . That the rep that sent the email back to me , probably misunderstood me . I have it in writing that I can return them , so up the ladder we go . Be very careful ordering these shoes through .
 The shoes themselves are comfortable and I would be inclined to buy another pair if not for their tendency to squeak . Both shoes squeak when I lift up the heel . I have read other posts about J&M shoes having similar problems . For a $ 200 pair of shoes to squeak is not acceptable . I should n't have to try powder , vaseline or WD-40 to alleviate the noise in a pair of shoes that are supposed to be of high quality . I have contacted the company directly and we 'll see if they respond .

 I have never been able to wear these more than a few minutes without a lot of pain and blisters . It 's too bad because they are so cute !
 Shame on you Mr. Cole , for letting such a product come out in one of your lines even if it a lower priced line . The shoes feel like they are made out of hard plastic and the leather cuts into your foot . My suggestion is to stay away !
 i bought this to hold my pumps in place when packing a travel bag very tight , wanted to avoid the toes getting smooshed in the bag . I got these assuming that the back end that presses on the heel side of the shoe would be adjustable , but its not . It 's extremely firm and way too long for any woman 's shoe , so it had to bend to stay in place . THe metal is very strong so it 's hard to get in palce , creates a lot off excess volume becuase of the metal bends upward . It 's just awkward all around and not very useful .
 This shoe is pretty and stylish , but not true to size . I ordered a medium width . The shoe fit OK except for the heel , which was way too narrow . I had to return them .
 i was looking for nice plain low heels.i trusted the hushpuppies brand . needed 11 ew . to narrow and bottom of shoes were slick . a plus size girl could slip and fall in these real fast . i returned them . i suggest cloudwalkers instead .
 This is a very cute shoe , especially the style and the height of the heel . However , it is not made of leather as advertised . This makes a difference to shoppers as myself , as shoes made of manmade materials do n't breathe well.Also , I ordered a Medium-width shoe , but this style runs extremely narrow . I have never had to buy a Wide-width shoe in my life and am consistently the same size for dress shoes . However , these are more than uncomfortably tight on my foot.It 's too bad , because the seller mailed the product to me in record time . Their customer service was also very responsive when I contacted them to return the item . Overall , I would not give the seller a negative rating , but would caution people interested in purchasing this product as they may need to order a size up -LRB- esp . in width -RRB- .
 I looked all those nice reviews but I was disapointed when the shoe came . It is pretty but has a slipery sole . And it is not leather as advertised .
 Shoe is advertized as a leather upper . When it comes it is clearly marked as `` ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS '' inside the heel . Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15 % restocking fee for a `` damaged shoebox '' to 50 % for `` trying-on wear . '' Seller is a rip-off . Do not buy ! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use .
 The product took 2 weeks to arrive since it was originally shipped to wrong state . Then , I received the wrong color . Size ordered fit at least two sizes smaller than same size from any store . Even when color and size were wrong , I had to return to store at my own expense . Poor custumer service . I will not buy from this company again .
 Not the best fit , and not the best color . I wear them occasionally but not often . My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles .
 Other reviews were right that these seem to run a little small . Both a little short and maybe a little narrow too .
 The look of this pair of shoes not really nice looking as display picture ... It 's hurt my little toes ... I return it right away ... Recomend for those who want a comfortable shoe and this is not the right one for you .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 Lovely to look at with a great big problem.The heel on the shoe was plactic and wore down after the first wear . On the second wear the heal became slick and I feel down in the street and hurt myself . I threw the shoes away because they were hazardous . Rubber heels would have saved me a great deal of pain anc scares .
 The shoes looked wide in front but upon trying out , my toes are squashed and it can be quite uncomfortable . Nontheless , the heels are nice and presentable . Can only be worn for a short time .
 The slippers were well made and even looked comfortable , but the size was far too small for the size it was described as . If you are a size ten in shoes plan to order at least size eleven if not twelve . I expected them to perhaps be snug and to stretch over time but I felt like a circus act to try to put these on . They obviously went back .

 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 Be aware that the inside part of thong is missing . In other words , the top panel of the sandal does not span the foot totally . I thought it looked odd and is n't apparent from the pictures . Also , the stiffness of the leather on the panel dug into the top of my toes .
 I love most Donald Pliner shoes . These were cute in the picture but ugly on the feet and not that comfortable .

 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck

 terrible friction against lower achilles tendons ! the shoes do not seem to be ergonomically designed . or at least i do n't recommend wearing it sockless .
 Item looks nothing like picture and it hurts the heels of my feet as well as the back of my foot .
 These shoes dig into your lower Achilles tendon whether or not you 're wearing socks . Very uncomfortable . I ca n't even wear them .

 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .

 Poor craftsmanship , Reminds me of &#34; 99 cent store &#34; merchandise . A couple of years ago , this was a good product , when purchased through a department store . And it does not even come in &#34; Hi &#34; anymore .
 Against my better judgement , I did not take the advice of other reviewers for this product , and took a chance . What a mistake ! First off , these sneakers do not have any official Reebok logos . No tag on the tongue , no insignia on the side . There are phony imprinted stickers that say Reebok . The size was not even close . This must be the smallest 11.5 in the world . Never had a problem with any 11.5 from any manufacturer . The material is cheap and the product is not worth anything at all . STAY AWAY !
 My husband has been wearing this style of Reebok for years and years . We have ordered them from Amazon before and got the correct shoes . However , the two pair I ordered this time were fakes . Instead of the stitched logo on the back there is a decal , also , instead of the sewn label on the tongue , there is a decal . The fit is not the same . We will not order these from Amazon again unless there is some reassurance they are the real thing . The picture is correct , the shoes , sadly , were not .
 We have ordered this same shoe before and have been very pleased . These however , were very substandard for a Reebok shoe . The tongue on one shoe was even with the top of the shoe and the other was at least 1/2 &#34; above . The flat part on top of the toes where they sew it together , one was much wider than the other . Do n't know what happened here , but let me say this , they were no match !! Sent them back
 I bought the exact same shoe that the picture is showing on eBay , known as the Reebok BB 4600 . When I found this on Amazon , I was hoping to get myself a re-issue of what I bought on eBay . However , I just recieved the package , opened it and found myself a pair of Reebok BB 4600 ULTRA , which is a completely different shoe than the picture is showing . This is NOT the BB 4600 the picture discribes . Does n't even look alike except for the colorway , which is white . . Do n't waste your money on this .
 the mid stinks compared too the old high-top iseemed to me it was sized abit smaller . if you liked the 4600 high top you 'll be disappointed in its &#34; replacement &#34; 2 thumbs down
 I really liked the look of the shoe ... but it kept rubbing on the heel when I walked around . Do n't know if it is a size issue ... but unfortunately headed back for a refund .
 Both shoes are marked 9.5 however the left shoe is 1 1/4 inch smaller in length . Both shoes show poor stitching quality and one shoe string eyelet is missing on the right shoe . Though not marketed as second quality , I consider them to be . Be warned !
 these sneakers are definitely NOT what is pictured . My husband and his best friend thought they found the perfect sneaker when I showed them this picture and I wish I had read all the posts . This is definitely a bait & switch tactic . We ordered 2 pairs thinking we got THE sneakers they wanted but what we received is a substitution . This is the 2nd time I have been let down by -LSB- ... -RSB- .

 I ordered a size 12 Wide as that is the size that fits best in my other Stacy Adams shoes . But I had to return these because there was no way I was getting my foot in these shoes . Where the tongue goes down and forms the top of the shoe is extremely tight and narrow and I could not get my foot in it . Had to return them for a refund .

 Hello . I bought a pair of Ken Cole Reaction Sim-Plicity Oxfords -LRB- Brown , size 11 -RRB- and have found them to be of very poor quality . I 've had them for 3 weeks , and both shoes ' upper is tearing away from the glued-on sole . I do n't abuse them -- this is just from walking.I wrote the company an e-mail , and it has n't been personally returned after 2 days -LRB- though the automated response assured me it would be -RRB- . I then called 1-800-Ken-Cole , and the customer service representative told me to return them -LRB- I pay shipping -RRB- , and in 4-weeks or so , I 'll get a repaired/replaced pair . So I get to walk around in flip flops or buy another pair in the interim ? Ken Cole presents itself as a mid/high-end clothing company , but they are most certainly not . They should have directed me to the nearest retailer for a replacement pair.So I have the following observations :1 . The quality of these shoes is not consistent with the $ 100 they cost .2 . Ken Cole does n't stand behind their products like other mid/high-end companies do .3 . I will never buy another clothing article from this company .4 . I will never buy shoes on-line again ; rather , I will buy from a reputable retailer like Nordstrom 's . Thanks for reading . I feel a bit better now !
 I bought these when I bought the suit I wore to my wedding . I squeaked all the way down the aisle . I squeaked at the reception . I squeak on my way to work . I squeak whenever I go to the copier . I squeak whenever I do anything in these incredibly poor quality , blister-inducing , noise-making , overpriced shoes . I kept them past the return time frame because I figured they just needed to be worn in . Two months of wear and they still squeak nice and loud whenever I move , they still hurt my feet , and they scuff VERY easily . I took them back to Macys today and they told me to try putting felt on the areas that rub together causing the squeak . For nearly $ 100 I shouldnt have to make a trip to a craft store so that my shoes dont make noise.In short
 The quality of these shoes is very disappointing . I have had a few pairs of different Kenneth Cole REACTION 's over the years and they just do n't hold up well -- and I work in an office all day . And when I contacted customer service they were very unsympathetic . For the price I expected much better quality . Do n't waste your money on any Kenneth Cole shoes .
 I got lucky with a pair of clearance Kenneth Cole New York shoes from another online store a few weeks ago , and these shoes looked really nice , too , so I thought I 'd take advantage of the markdown -LRB- $ 35.99 -RRB- . I needed another pair of dress oxfords for work.Unfortunately they have that cheap , fake plastic look to them . Maybe these are OK for a high schooler dressing up for prom , but not for a business environment . Even worse , they dug into the tops of my ankles when I tried to walk in them.Maybe I am one of the few nay-sayers , because people really seem to love these on zappos , but I would recommend something else .
 The shoes literally fell apart . First it was the glued-on leather part on the heel . I repaired that and a few days later the whole sole of both shoes just fell off . I only got to wear these shoes maybe 6 or 7 times before they fell apart and I was inside for most of the time I wore them . I do n't feel it is even worth it having them repaired and I am never buying another pair of Kenneth Cole shoes in my life . I 've owned shoes of innumerable brands and have never before seen a product this poorly built .
 This is only the second time I have worn these shoes and the sole is already breaking away from the shoe . Extremely poor quality , especially for the price . Do not buy these shoes !!!
 No one can argue it is a very good and professional looking shoe . The issue I have is both of my shoes are coming apart after less than 2 months . I work in an office and wear them inside all day . The front of my right shoe is separating resulting in the front flopping . The left shoes glue had come off on the side to the point where I can basically see the underside of my foot . Also , my boss had purchased the same shoes in a different color and he could n't wear them because they squeaked every time he walked.Save your money and buy a different pair . I had a pair 3 years ago that held up wonderfully they must have changed their manufacturing techniques
 I purchased these shoes and they squeaked so loudly , I had to return them . They are not of any minimum quality . Very disappointed .
 Shoe shipped to me with two different size , one is 8 and another is 9 . I have received refund yr corp released.I 'm very satisfied with your reply .
 i weared it once and craked on me , super cheap quality and made me look fool at the partydont recommend it to any one , i also didnt get a refund yet , which im going to contact my credit card for this
 These shoes are beautiful and elegant , but quite hard on the ankle . Not comfortable at all , contrary to all other Kenneth Cole shoes I had .
 I have owned many Kenneth Cole shoes in the past and these are by far the worst shoes i have ever owned . The fit of these shoes will leave your feet blistered and in pain , do n't waste your money on these shoes .
 I am using these shoes for 2 months and its quality is quite bad , I 've never bought shoes so bad , look like cardboard , so little time they have used seem to take positions for longer than 1 year , I do n't recommend this product cause they are really bad , I hope the store or brand to respond but definitely I will not buy Kenneth Cole again
 The shoes are good looking enough , but they squeak too much and , as other reviewers have mentioned , are stiff and dig at the back of your ankle as you walk .
 Very disappointed , very hard leather , shinny look ok for a prep school teen but not for me . I own several pairs of Kenneth Cole shoes and this is the first time that I had to return because that was no way I could wear it . On the plus side , Amazon price and shipping time always the best ...
 Website description says leather . When you actually get the shoes , you will notice on the tongue they clearly state man made upper . For $ 70 + , these are a rip-off . I can get fake leather shoes that look almost identical to these and are about the same quality for $ 30 at any of those shoe warehouse type stores . Returned immediately .
 This shoe is so ugly i bought it without looking at top view , the look like Bozos shoes when you are walking , the sole is horrendous , makes too much sound and the back of my foot is destroyed . You have been warned .
 I usually love Kenneth Cole shoes , but these ones look and feel really cheap . I bought mine on the end of November and they lasted me a month and a half and they already broke . The sole came off by the heal and there 's no way to fix them . Really disappointed .
 Have had a pair of Kenneth Cole New York 's that I could not be happier with . They no longer make them , so I thought I would give these a try . Not even close to the same level of quality . The entire shoe is synthetic . Synthetic uppers were not real leather , and the finish scuffed right off the toes the first day I wore them . You ca n't repair the scuff , because it pulled the color right off the shoe , and you ca n't put shoe polish on synthetic material . Very displeased with the quality of these shoes . Will not be buying reactions ever again .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 Pros
 Product did fine on the first two shoe stretchings , then the entire thing fell apart . I bought it because it was stated that the shank was metal -LRB- thus more durable -RRB- and would last longer than the others that were plastic.Not a high quality product , another Made-in-China wonder , not !!
 Needing a shoe stretcher , I ordered this . While I thought it good at first , within a matter of a few weeks , it broke so that I can no longer widen it -LRB- to stretch it out width wise -RRB- . If you get it through Amazon , you can not return it for an exchange but only a refund -LRB- if the fault of the return is not Amazons -RRB- . Had I ordered it directly from the original sender , I would have been sent a replacement . Caveat .
 I used this with the recommended stretcher spray , but the results were disappointing . The ` pips ' supplied for additional stretching in specific toe areas are inadequate , and badly , if at all thought out . The hole placements are limited to someone else 's idea of where my shoe/s would be tight.I contemplated drilling new holes at the appropriate points , but as the shoes returned to their previous state within a day , it 's probably not worth the effort . Maybe someday when I have nothing better to do . . After following their recommended procedure -LRB- with spray , left for 24 hours -RRB- several times in each shoe , I 've given up this exercise as futile . . at least for this pair of shoes , for which I purchased it in the first place1Good luck .
 I opened the package and tried to expand the shoe stretcher and it opened , so I put it in a shoe and tried it again ... now , it would n't open - just kept spinning until it hit the end ... then worked it back the other way - still did n't do anything . Thought I would try the length , and that worked . I do n't know if I got a lemon , but after reading other reviews , I think this product is pretty cheap . I 'm going to purchase another set of better quality and try this again.Oh , and it says it comes with excellent instructions ... mine did not . Just came in a clear plastic bag . Not the most enticing packaging .
 They sent a men 's size , so I sent it back . The second one came in a men 's size also , so I kept it and It broke within a month .
 major disappointment !! The action of the screw that spreads the toes to create stretch is so limited that it will only stretch a shoe 1/4 inch - and that 's if it fit the shoe tight like a glove . Then the action is only at the tip of the toe - none at the width or ball of foot .
 The good . Worked on a pair of running shoes I boughtThe bad
 The internal cam screw that is suppose to force the halves apart when screwing did not hold and instead first ripped further up the wooden channel and then eventually sheered and broke.Very lame design using plastic for pressures that need steel . Avoid this one and look for another more durable product made with steel .
 Where are the instructions ? I just received the Pro Two Way Shoe Stretcher . It came on time and lookedjust like it appeared on the web site . The description on the web site -LRB- see below -RRB- says it comes with excellent instructions . There were no instructions included . I am requesting the instructions ! Please!I am giving it a poor review , but will follow up with another review if I receive the advertised instructions.Pro Two-Way Shoe StretcherWoodBeech wood construction , Steel-threaded rod for width stretchingComes with excellent instructions , Stretches length and widthFits for right and left shoe , Three complimentary corn piecesPain relief for bunions , hammertoes , etc. , Available in different widths for men or women7 different sizes , Not sold in pairs
 This product is awful . It broke on the second use . I went out of my way not to over tighten anything . There is a long partiality threaded rod -LRB- piece with the hook on it -RRB- that ends in a plastic spreader . As you tighten down rod the friction applied to the spreader causes it break lose internally and push the rod all the way through the spreader . Causing a failure . -LRB- very poor design -RRB- . Something like a BB on the end of the rod would have worked . The BB would have kept the drill through effect of the rod from happening -LRB- The end of the rod is so ragged I cut my finger just trying to get the spreader back on -RRB-
 The product looks OK , however I ca n't rate it highly as I was expecting to stretch my 4E width shoes with it . It simply is not large enough to stretch wide shoes . It may work OK with narrower shoes , but I would n't know .
 This item arrived with some plastic already broken off . The stretcher was still usable , and I needed to stretch a pair of shoes right away , so I decided to keep it . The stretcher worked fine ; I was able to to make my shoes more comfortable one at a time . However , after stretching only 3 pairs of shoes , the screw inside got stripped and now the stretcher is stuck in the closed position ! I am purchasing a more expensive stretcher as I write this review . I have learned my lesson about cheap shoe stretchers .
 this product came with no infomation on how to use ... It only stretches lenthwise and not widthwise ... which is what I was buying it for
 I bought these and after stretching 1 pair of shoes it literally broke apart!I do not reside in the USA but had them shipped there since I would be there for a week . By the time I used them and realized how bad they were it was too late to return!DO NOT WASTE YOUR $ $ $ $ ON THIS
 product failed , poor quality . reordered from another supplier , received two -LRB- 2 -RRB- shoe streachers for the cost of one -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- from amazon .
 I assumed , perhaps wrongfully , that it would help stretch shoes . I do n't know if I am just not strong enough to use the device , but I has not worked thus far . However , my eighteen month old daughter loves to turn the knobs and drag it around .
 HelloI order a shoe stretcher for my husband from another company -LRB- via Amazon -RRB- and we got 2 , Left & Right ... but WHY OH WHY did you only send ONE stretcher?And for the more MONEY than what we paid for the men 's pair .
 I used these on a new pair of shoes that were too narrow . This product did n't work for me . The shoes are still too tight . I also agree that after a few uses the product starts to fall apart . I got `` snookered '' by the old `` As seen on TV '' marketing scam ...
 The product seems pretty good , but there were NO instructions and it took a while to figure out how to use it .
 Have had this stretcher for less than 60 days and after stretching only 2 pairs of shoes it is now completely broken beyond use.Threading is stripped and it will no longer screw open OR closed . It 's frozen stuck halfway open.Next time I 'll invest in a more expensive stretcher and hope the quality reflects the larger investment .
 I wish I 'd opted for a more expensive , higher-quality unit . Issues I 've had with it :1 -RRB- The threads for the heel piece are plastic . When I got serious about using them to push the toe piece in deep , I broke the plastic . That feature is only good for setting it in position and keeping it from sliding back , not for pushing it forward with any significant force .2 -RRB- The main threads are steel , painted black . As you use it intensively , the paint gets ground off , and the debris from it clogs the threads . I found that I was able to recuse it by taking it out , washing the threads with WD-40 -LRB- or something similar -RRB- , and putting it back together . I had to do this several times , but now the paint is gone and the threads work fine .3 -RRB- If you need this , your feet are probably wide . But if you buy one listed for size 10 -LRB- for example -RRB- , it 's sized for a normal to narrow size 10 width . So you need to buy one much bigger . How much bigger ? Hard to tell . You 'd think a reputable shoe stretcher company would list the maximum and minimum widths it goes to . But they do n't , even on the more expensive model . I did find one e-bay seller who lists the width range , in inches , so you can compare to your foot and have some confidence it will do the job . You 'd think a company whose main business is shoe stretchers would do that too . I 'd measure mine and let you know , but I 've since modified it to try to make it go wider , so I ca n't anymore .4 -RRB- When I tightened it hard , the plastic wedge that widens the toe broke.The good news is that despite all these problems , it did help improve the fit of a few pairs of shoes.I opted for this cheap one , partly because I was n't sure that stretching would work for me . Stretching works , and works well enough that it 's worth buying a better stretcher than this . The `` Premium Professional '' model from footfitter seems to have much better reviews and looks like better construction ... but I 'm leaning towards buying from someone on ebay instead because at least he lists the widths with the product information , and it 's a little cheaper .
 Listen to the reviewers that complain about this product ! My feet inexplicably grew a little this year , so I thought this product would help me stretch some shoes a little to accommodate my slightly larger feet . However , as the interior part of this is made of plastic , it broke on the second pair of shoes I tried to stretch and now one of the two stretchers is completely unusable . I would not purchase this product again !
 Disappointed in these characteristics :1 -RRB- Price for one is similar to others where you get 2.2 -RRB- Device too narrow so when the screw is turned to widen , it does not stretch enough .3 -RRB- The internal screw tip that spreads the halves wears in to the wood making it widen even less .
 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS PRODUCT DOES EVERYTHING AND MORE BUT WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS AND NEVER HAVING THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT TO USE BEFORE , I CA N'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT TO SAY SEND INFO ALONG WITH THE PRODUCT THEN MAYBE I WILL WRITE A DECENT REVIEW UNTIL THEN A WASTE OF MONEY
 This shoe stretcher broke the second time I tried to use it . The screw that widens the two wooden halves of the stretcher to widen your shoes is stripped . You can turn and turn the thing to no avail . I had purchased another shoe stretcher from Foot Smart that I mistakenly loaned out then was n't able to get back , and that one was far superior to this one . I like to order from Amazon because of the convenience and I also get free shipping on Amazon Prime , but in this case should have just ordered another stretcher from Foot Smart and paid the shipping fees .
 The product is pretty flimsy . It does the job but sometimes when turning the knobs to stretch/retract , it just spins and spins without actually moving . Quite annoying .
 I purchased one of these stretchers in December 2011 . It has only been used on one pair of shoes . Yesterday , the threaded shaft that stretches the shoe lengthwise mysteriously snapped in two . Unfortunately , this par for the course for shoe stretchers these days . Too many of the load bearing parts are made of plastic that falls apart before you can put enough tension into the leather to actually stretch the shoe . Why does n't anyone offer a decent stretcher at a reasonable price ? My wide feet are desperate for something that works and lasts .
 When tightened , the rod end damages the shoes . It has a rough end that pokes thru the end of the stretcher and into the shoe . I 'm looking for a better quality stretcher .
 Was hoping to expand my shoe wardrobe by fixing several pairs of shoes that are now just too tight in a few places.I recall reading in some customer review that this was for a pair of stretchers . How can I expect to stretch a pair of shoes with just one stretcher ? By the time the second pair is done the first is already back to square one.Though said to include instructions I have none . When I try to get the heel part to stay put it always seems to come lose.I ca n't tell if it is broken or I am doing something wrong.At $ 16 something a pop plus shipping it would be better to get a more expensive model that includes two stretchers , instructions and better craftsmanship .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 I admit it

 I was looking for a nice pair of shoes that would also be comfortable to walk around in . During my second time wearing them the sole of one of the shoes came completely off while I was in the mall . The other sole was coming loose as well . I was disappointed in the quality , especially for the price .
 Very well made , cute , but not much room in toe area . Toes felt almost crushed and ended up returning the shoes .

 I return this iteam right away when I just tried it on ... it totally hurt my toes b/c the head is narrow so it made my toes really hurt .
 I ordered these boots as a part of a party costume -LRB- NCIS 's Abby Sciuto -RRB- . I placed the order a week earlier and payed for express shipping as I was not willing to take any chances . But apparently that was not enough ... they mixed up my order and sent it by ground !!! I received the package 10 days after I ordered it and shipped it back without even giving a look a it . So I 'll not be able to provide a review of the item itself but their customer service was so apologetic and efficient after the fact that they earned at least 2 stars .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 I purchased these boots since most of the reviews were good . However , the boots , as cute and sexy as they may be , are painful after a few minutes ! I even purchased inserts as an attempt to get my money 's worth.I still wear them , but not very often and certainly not anywhere I have to walk .
 I have not received my shoes until today . Whare are they ?
 I love Keen shoes , but this style is useless . The elastic strap to hold it on your foot does n't stay tight for more than a minute and anytime you change from sitting to standing to walking the strap loosens ! Otherwise , the comfort is good and the style is cute , but since you ca n't walk in them , that 's moot .
 I love the way these look , however , the are not comfortable at all ! These will probably never &#34; break in &#34; . In the few years that i 've had them , I think i 've worn them twice for very short periods of time and they hurt my feet due to the material not having any give . If they were made of a softer material , then they would be great . They fit true to size as well .
 Run about a half to one size bigger so order down . The toe is not a round and cute as it appears in the picture . It has more oblong elongated shape . I ordered the dark leather . It seems pretty stiff . However the sole is fairly well cushioned and made out of flexible rubber so over all comfort looks OK . Mainly , I returned them because they were just too big .

 I ordered these shoes because Clarks ' are supposed to be quality , comfortable shoes . However , these have left blisters each time I have worn them , have a wobbly sole , and are not that attractive on .
 Bought these because they had good reviews ... they are are hard as rocks . And now I 'm stuck paying to ship them back . But they 're THAT bad
 I suspect this is standard footwear at Guantanamo , assuming these are n't banned under the Geneva Convention . Aside from the look of this shoe , I can not find one redeeming feature . These are far inferior to much cheaper shoes I 've had in terms of comfort , craftsmanship , and fit.I 've mostly worn Ferragamo loafers for the past several years , but I thought it was time to ditch the gaudy buckles and go for something classic and conservative , so I chose this design . I was fitted at the 5th Ave AE store in New York City , and I ultimately ordered 2 pairs online the following week - one in black calfskin , one in burgundy calfskin.They were uncomfortable at the store , but the woman helping me insisted that massaging the heel cup and just wearing them a few times would break them in . This is false . I literally could not walk the one block to my subway stop for the first 3 weeks wearing these . I actually took cabs to work hoping I would n't find a pool of blood in the heel of my shoes each evening . I stomped on the heel cup and tried to use a shoe tree to stretch the area of the toe box that was crushing my pinky toe to no avail . It 's now two months later and they are still horribly uncomfortable . If there is so much as a wrinkle in my sock or the slightest seam , the shoe is unbearable , and the heel continues to chafe.The toe box actually feels stretched out now that they 've broken in a bit . This is far far more pronounced in the burgundy shoes , which broke in a bit easier , perhaps because of a slightly different tanning process ?? Who knows , but now the shoes that once seemed too tight in my forefoot are too loose , and my foot feels like it 's slipping off the footbed if I so much as step on uneven pavement.The sides of the shoe right above the exterior pucker with each step . It seems the heel cup extends a bit far toward the instep . Combined with the strap of leather from the upper that keeps the front stiff , the leather in between the two has no choice but to pucker outward , which I find particularly interesting since all of the leather is remarkably stiff except that one area.The soles are soft , which I sadly does n't seem to make the shoes more comfortable , but it does manage to pick up every grain or pebble on the floor . I 've never thought gravel or pebbles to be a problem , but somehow everything is a problem with these shoes.On the black pair of shoes , the creases on the left and right shoe are very different . While the right creases normally , the left puckers upward and bulges out . I might attribute that to inconsistencies between my feet , but since the burgundy pair does n't have that problem , it seems to be inconsistency in manufacturing.Overall , the quality is so far inferior than I imagined . It 's inconsistent , stiff in the wrong places , and without a doubt the least comfortable pair of shoes I 've ever worn . I deeply regret waiting and waiting for them to break in - it would have been wiser to get my money back . I am extremely disappointed in these shoes and recommend anyone considering buying them be absolutely certain about the comfort prior to purchasing , and even then , perhaps it 's better to seek an alternative .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .

 I could n't use your product because I have ordered a wroug size . I wanted a size based on 9.5 UK but I ordered based on 9.5 US size . Now it is samaller than what I wanted .
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 Well . . it does hurt at the back - usually , Aerosoles are so comfortable , but this is an exception . . in a bad way .
 These shoes are unlike typical aerosoles - they do n't fit very well -LRB- somehow the foot sits really high and the surrounding area does n't support it -RRB- . Do n't look great either .

 The sizing on these skates is entirely off !! Such a disappointment to receive them just in time for my daughters birthday to find that the size 5 is actually a youth size 4 -LRB- sizing on tongue says Adult 5 , Youth 4 , European 35 -RRB- . Knowing that Heelys run small I intentionally ordered a size up too . Had to order a completely different style from another site . I still do n't understand how an adult 5 is a youth 4 ...

 The quality of Propet shoes is not as good as I expect . The shoes are very heavy and stiff and they look clunky also .

 I wore these only once . I wear a woman 's size 11 and need a wide and deep toe box , so for sport shoes I often purchase men 's size 9 . The toe box on this show is too narrow for my foot and the ankle too high .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 The shoe fit fine , but lack comfort . The styling is plain and the shell is hard to the touch . After wearing Nike shoes for half my life , this shoe is far from comfort . I would n't buy another pair .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .

 I had to send them back 2 times because the sizing is n't correct . I had a pair preaviously that were the same size and fit fine . I is like these were made in China .
 two months on foredeck they were sliding all over the foredeck.sailing shoes they are not.they sit in the cupboard but may use for walking the dog
 Did not fit well . My foot slid to far forward and it really tore up my my foot where the piece goes between your toes .
 This shoes are not stable at all . When you walk the heels moves . They run supper big . I am a size 9 and I had to buy in a size 8 .
 My daughter 's feet keep sliding out the front of the shoes . The size is just right but since the shoes are `` elastic '' they do n't keep the feet in place . I keep seeing all my daughter 's toes outside the shoes and have to slide her feet back in place just to repeat it again and again over the use . Not worth the money !!!
 Extremely uncomfortable , never used them . This was the first and last time that I ever bought sneakers online . I learned my lesson - sometimes the old-fashioned way works !
 This is a very cute shoe , especially the style and the height of the heel . However , it is not made of leather as advertised . This makes a difference to shoppers as myself , as shoes made of manmade materials do n't breathe well.Also , I ordered a Medium-width shoe , but this style runs extremely narrow . I have never had to buy a Wide-width shoe in my life and am consistently the same size for dress shoes . However , these are more than uncomfortably tight on my foot.It 's too bad , because the seller mailed the product to me in record time . Their customer service was also very responsive when I contacted them to return the item . Overall , I would not give the seller a negative rating , but would caution people interested in purchasing this product as they may need to order a size up -LRB- esp . in width -RRB- .
 I looked all those nice reviews but I was disapointed when the shoe came . It is pretty but has a slipery sole . And it is not leather as advertised .
 This shoe is pretty and stylish , but not true to size . I ordered a medium width . The shoe fit OK except for the heel , which was way too narrow . I had to return them .
 i was looking for nice plain low heels.i trusted the hushpuppies brand . needed 11 ew . to narrow and bottom of shoes were slick . a plus size girl could slip and fall in these real fast . i returned them . i suggest cloudwalkers instead .
 The product took 2 weeks to arrive since it was originally shipped to wrong state . Then , I received the wrong color . Size ordered fit at least two sizes smaller than same size from any store . Even when color and size were wrong , I had to return to store at my own expense . Poor custumer service . I will not buy from this company again .
 Not the best fit , and not the best color . I wear them occasionally but not often . My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles .
 Other reviews were right that these seem to run a little small . Both a little short and maybe a little narrow too .
 Shoe is advertized as a leather upper . When it comes it is clearly marked as `` ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS '' inside the heel . Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15 % restocking fee for a `` damaged shoebox '' to 50 % for `` trying-on wear . '' Seller is a rip-off . Do not buy ! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use .
 I purchase these boots and there was black polish on the boot spacers , no card board insert in one of the boots to keep them from bending but it did have plastic stuff in the top . I think these boots were worn and returned . Did not understand why they needed to polish the boots before sending them out . I paid 300.00 dollars and I do not want reused boots
 i dont understand why the image doesnt match the product ?? is this the Dixie boot or that other shoe ? I wont order because I dont want to end up with the wrong shoes . Please fix
 This boot has always been a favorite for my husband so I ordered him a new pair as his old ones were quite worn . We received them and oddly one show was smaller than the other so I contacted the seller and was told I needed to ship them back for an exchange . As instructed I shipped them back only to deal with lots of dead end emails to the company . Almost 30 days later and I emailed them again and was told that they were sorry for the confusion but would just refund my money ??? I am not sure why they did that but I am glad I continued to follow through otherwise I may have been out of the shoes and the money I paid . Buyer beware and order through another company that stands behind their customer service !
 I 've always liked Skechers and have owned several pair and styles . But , the last pair of boots I bought did n't last long . The soles came unglued rather quickly . So , I spent a little more and purchased the Sergeants-Enlisted boots and the first time I tried them on , the lace hooks bent . After tying them -LRB- carefully -RRB- the second time I put them on , I wore them for about two hours . When I took them off , one of the lace clips fell off . I returned them for a refund as the price certainly exceeded the quality . It 's not likely I 'll buy Skechers again ...
 I wear a size 7 , and these boots were at least a half size too small , possibly a whole . I returned them and will not reorder . They do n't look well-made and I 'm afraid they wo n't hold up well .
 although I greatly enjoyed wearing these boots on the first day , the second day I had to return them to the seller due to the first hook on the right broke . The bottom part snapped when I was pulling on it to make sure it was a little tight before looping around the other side . I do n't know if it was just the pair I got but i was very displeased with them lasting only till the second time i put them on . The seller was very helpful in making sure I got a refund and paid return UPS slip to return them immediately upon hearing about my problem .

 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 I agree with the previous reviewer . I tried these on at the Clarks ' store and found them way too floppy . The straps are too loose and they just wo n't stay on . It feels like you 're walking around with small life preservers lashed loosely to your feet . Pass on this style and try another version of Clarks Indigo footwear -- the rest are great !
 Unless you have really fat feet , do n't buy them . I wish Clarks did a recall on these shoes , it 's dangerously loose !
 I love indigo by clarks expecially this exact sole !!! Sadly tho this particular shoe was a huge disappointment . It is adorable looking and like I said has my favorite sole by indigo but the strap around my foot was too tight and the toe strap was strangely loose . Do n't let this one shoe if you have never bought indigo by clarks keep you from buying other shoes . I love all my other shoes by them !!!!

 I purchased a pair of these Adidas men 's size 8 1/2 . They fit fine and I like the way they look . However when I first put them on , both shoes , but particularly the right foot was very uncomfortable . The problem was that they hurt the arch of my foot . I know that some shoes need a break in period , so I 've been wearing them as much as I can . Now after about 3 weeks , they are better but the right foot is still uncomfortable . It feels like it is pressing up against the arch of my foot , and it really is kind of painful . I really like Adidas , but unfortunately I can not recommend these sneakers , because they remain uncomfortable .
 UPDATE
 I should have known better when I bought these . I guess part of the blame lies with me because I was looking for a cheap tennis shoe and I got what I paid for . They 're comfortable enough , I guess , but I could n't play tennis in them more than once because they soles were almost completely smooth after playing in them . I was sliding all over the court . Not good and I have n't worn them since.If you 're just looking for a shoe to wear around casually , these would be fine . If you 're looking for a shoe to actually play tennis in , definitely look elsewhere .
 I do n't expect that these shoes made by Adidas are such low quality . They did n't last for a month . After wearing a few times for playing tennis , a hole has already developed in the left toe 's area , cheap rubber bottom .
 I had the same problem as several people before me - after 10-12 matches the front part of the right shoe worn out and the hole in the sole started developing . This is definitely below my expectations since my previous Adidas tennis shoes lasted for almost two years.The shoes were on a heavier side , but size was not a problem , I got the shoes 1/2 size bigger than I normally buy.My advice - do n't buy these shoes !
 These shoes are absolutely awful and would never get them again . I play doubles and was only able to use them in three matches before my foot ripped through the front . Absolute garbage , do not get

 Nice materials . Not much support in the footbed , sandal runs loose . I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I 've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible .
 although I greatly enjoyed wearing these boots on the first day , the second day I had to return them to the seller due to the first hook on the right broke . The bottom part snapped when I was pulling on it to make sure it was a little tight before looping around the other side . I do n't know if it was just the pair I got but i was very displeased with them lasting only till the second time i put them on . The seller was very helpful in making sure I got a refund and paid return UPS slip to return them immediately upon hearing about my problem .
 This boot has always been a favorite for my husband so I ordered him a new pair as his old ones were quite worn . We received them and oddly one show was smaller than the other so I contacted the seller and was told I needed to ship them back for an exchange . As instructed I shipped them back only to deal with lots of dead end emails to the company . Almost 30 days later and I emailed them again and was told that they were sorry for the confusion but would just refund my money ??? I am not sure why they did that but I am glad I continued to follow through otherwise I may have been out of the shoes and the money I paid . Buyer beware and order through another company that stands behind their customer service !
 I 've always liked Skechers and have owned several pair and styles . But , the last pair of boots I bought did n't last long . The soles came unglued rather quickly . So , I spent a little more and purchased the Sergeants-Enlisted boots and the first time I tried them on , the lace hooks bent . After tying them -LRB- carefully -RRB- the second time I put them on , I wore them for about two hours . When I took them off , one of the lace clips fell off . I returned them for a refund as the price certainly exceeded the quality . It 's not likely I 'll buy Skechers again ...

 My son loves K Swiss , it 's what I have always known him to wear , so when he sent me a gift card I thought I would try a pair . The shoes looked great when they arrived but the first time I wore them which was to a meeting , I notice they hurt my heels . I was shocked to also find that my heals were bleeding . I did get to return them which I am grateful .
 For all the hype , I was very disappointed when I received these in the mail . Very lightweight and cheap looking . Reminded me of those $ 12 shoes you find at the grocery store . Not really comfortable . A total waste of $ $ . What 's so bad is I had a pair of shoes half this price that put these to shame .
 Shoes are made in China and look and feel cheap . Way overpriced . Ordered my correct size , and yet my left lower leg and foot were hurting with these . Shoes scratched at the back of my right foot . The only difference between these overpriced shoes and some $ 35 Drugstore pair are that the heels are more elevated in these . Depending on the type of arch one has it may or may not be comfortable to someone . My EasySpirits are better than these . Will not purchase again .
 My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years . When she received her latest pair , it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed . These 61/2 d 's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds . The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long . Quality control very poor .
 I ordered the same size -LRB- 10M -RRB- I 've worn at least 5 years . Shoes too narrow , especially in the toes . Really scrunched them up . Wo n't try another size , as I 'm afraid they will also not fit . Also , shoes not nearly as cute as in photo.I wear orthotics , so most slip-ons do n't work for me . Because of my arthritis , I 've been trying to switch to shoes with velcro straps , instead of ties . Very big disappointment . Now I have to deal with returning them , too .
 I like velcro type shoes , but this was too tight when I use the velcro to close it and cause major itching on top of foot . It restricted air to top of foot and when I took feet out of them it cause red pressure/look on top of my feet -LRB- major itch -RRB- . These shoes are the first to make my feet itch at the top soooo badly . Do n't recommend these . I tried them out twice for walks and now I 'm stuck with these shoes . Going to buy some other shoe now .
 This sneaker was a big disappointment . Ordered wide and they hurt . Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great . I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie .
 I bought these shoes at regular price , in my regular size , at another website . When they arrived , they were clearly too small , either cut skimpily or missized . The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened . I could n't even walk in them . I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand , in my regular size/width . No problem.Later , when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com , I ordered them again -LRB- the price was so low , how could I not ? -RRB- , this time a half size larger . STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe , a bit snug for the ball of my left foot , the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff , awkward , and clunky . At best , they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time . A flexible , supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that , IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size , anywhere .
 Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several , however this particular model # 3902 runs large . Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size . My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes , only the sizing . Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct , they do !
 The sneakers arrived in great condition , packaged well , so I do n't fault the distributor at all . BUT , when I put the shoes on my feet , they were like boats . I still have an identical pair of Propet 's -LRB- same model # / size -RRB- and they fit but are worn out . Probably a quality control issue at the shoe factory .
 I usually love Merrell Jungle mocs however the pair I ordered are too wide , so they are not comfortable . Now I could have sent them back but chose to try to wear them . I remember now that the smoke colored ones fit differently than the brown ones it seems .
 I have several other pairs of Merrell shoes . This style was not true to the size of the other Merrells I have had . They were too big and I had to return them .
 I have purchased this exact product for at least 10 years for my daughter , as she loves them . For some reason even after returning and trying again , these did not fit . She has NOT lost weight , her foot has not changed . She just kept walking out of the heel but the length was ok . We returned them AND had to pay for shipping again . WeJungle Moc Nubuck Kids by Merrell are very disappointed . A few years ago she told me she felt the quality of them changed for the worse , did n't last as long but she still loved them . NOw it seems she will have to find an alternative . So sad .
 The suede jungle moc shoes are the most comfortable shoes on earth . They are just like walking on clouds . Only problem is I received the wrong shoe and UpFootGear are not helpful at all and have now passed me on to a distributor and are now ignoring me . What a shame for Merrell to have such a poor customer service company representing them and their fantastic shoes .
 I bought these because i experience back pain after my baby but the material burns under my feet , I can not wear them when shopping which is when its needed most . They are so expensive i thought it would be worth the purchase .
 I have just received my Birkenstock Gizeh Patent Leather sandals and you can imagen the disappointment when I opened the box to find they are not leather as advertised but PVC . I have Black Patent Leather Birkenstock and they are real leather , as far as I ` m concerned this is a case of false advertising . Other than that they are as per normal Birkenstock ` s.
 This pair of shoes is very uncomfortable . I have worn Birks for years . The bar between the toes has no give or flexibility to allow for different shape toes . It digs into my big toe relentlessly . I ca n't find my shipping receipt to return them or I would . They are cute but unwearable .
 They may call themselves Patent Leather but when I ordered and received mine from Amazon , they are clearly plastic uppers or what they call birki flor . Come on Amazon , you can do better than this .
 This photo is really nice of the shoe as in person , they are horribly ugly . Also , the black is super shiny patent leather , not muted like in the photo . Why would n't they make a matte black one anyhow ? It baffles me -RRB- . The photo is also deceptive as the strap over the foot is not down the middle but rather off to one side . Also , the leather digs into the foot and , unlike most Birks , it 's not a comfortable shoe . That 's a lot of coin for not so much of a shoe . Total bummer - needless to say , I returned it .
 I never recieve Item from Amazon.com.When I placed my order , I chosed the one day shipping for $ 3.99 . I did n't recieve the item the next day or three day later . I contact Amazon.com about my order , and they could n't tell me what happen to my order . I was so upset and disappointed , because I order from Amazon.com before and never had this problem . To make matter worst , while I was inquring about my order with customer service the call got disconnected . Take my advise choose standard shipping for your orders .

 These are so comfortable on the bottom of my foot but so uncomfortable on the top . I wore them for a few days on and off then wore them all day walking around NYC . My feet are still punishing me for it over a week later . The plastic thing between my toes hurts , but not as badly as the little button which connects the plastic to the upper part of the shoe . It left bruises between my toes ! I 'm hoping this is the breaking in period , but every time I put them on it hurts . I have plantar fasciitis , so the arch support is a god-send , but I may not be able to make use of it .
 I own around five pairs of birkenstocks including a pair of birko-flor gizehs purchased elsewhere a few years ago . They are my only & last pair of birko-flors I will purchase.The footbed is the exact same as you would find in the full leather version . The synthetic upper -LRB- i.e. birko-flor or birkibuc -RRB- does reduce the price rather significantly but the sandals will not wear the same or last as long as the leather version . The synthetic uppers crease in an odd , unnatural fashion once they are worn in and the surface color will start wearing off . The synthetic upper is difficult to clean or polish . -LRB- Maybe this is not as big of an issue with the shiny plasticky upper ? -RRB- Also , the footbed is lined in suede , so I know it 's not some sort of moral reason people are avoiding the leather uppers ... Bottom line , yes , they 're comfy with the classic birkenstock footbed but if you plan on actually using these sandals long term , stick with the leather uppers & avoid those with birko-flor/birkibuc in the description . The real leather wears well and literally can last a lifetime .
 I am disappointed with the lack of comfort . The soles are too stiff . I have walked on the carpet , and I keep hoping to like these shoes . I feel mislead because I always heard that this brand would be the ultimate in comfort .
 These just arrived , and I ca n't believe how ugly they are ! Just as clunky and unattractive as more `` traditional '' Birkenstocks . Return , return , return !
 These shoes are like wearing rocks ! As much as I love other Birkenstocks these ones are to be avoided at all costs . The plastic between your toes jars with every step . They bruised my feet within one painful hour of wearing . Seller did not respond to my request to return . In fact once seller had my money I never heard from them again !
 Birkenstock Gizeh Birko-Flor Thongs are wonderful IF they come in your size . Seven is way too big for me . I need a Birkenstock size 5 ; however you fail in offering the smaller sizes.Many of the women who shop on Amazon are n't as large as the average woman . If Amazon ca n't offer our sizes then , what 's the point of shopping here?Interestingly enough Betula - Licensed by Birkenstock - does considerately offer the smaller sizes.I know it 's possible to acquire smaller sizes in Birkenstocks , just not on Amazon .
 I had been looking forward to this sandals , but was unable to wear them because they were just too narrow . I do n't really have a wide foot , but I found these to dig into my feet at the sides . Had they been a flat sole , it would 've been okay , but the fact the it 's sort of indented makes them an uncomfortable sandle unless you have a very narrow foot . I was deeply disappointed .
 These shoes are great if you want to walk for years in them and they 're so durable you could wear them every day but the problem here is that they last for a long time . This is the problem . They are shoes that are hard to pair with anything that is n't almost floor length and their bulkiness means that you have to wear flowing or wide-legged bottoms . They are a little pricey for what they are and the only real market they are suitable for is retirees . A shoe that is difficult to wear and uncomfortable for many buyers . Do n't buy them unless you 're sure you can wear them every day
 This shoe feels hard and tough so it wo n't fall apart anytime soon , but the sandal is not comfortable . For the price , I suppose I could have gotten much worse . If I could turn back the clock , I would have purchased a more expensive Birkenstock sandal and received one that is more comfortable . Not every Birenstock is made the same .
 This is the second pair of Birkenstocks I purchase . My first were great , comfortable and lasted a long time until they got stolen.It only took a few months for the front and sit clips to rust . The clips of my first pair were plastic while those of this pair were not . I emailed Birkenstock twice to see if they could be fixed . Never heard back from them and ended up throwing them away.I still purchased a third pair . They are not rusting but the black color on the front and side clips are is pealing off.Unfortunately that will be the last pair of Birkenstock I 'll own .
 This pair of shoes is uncomfortable because the thong bar digs into my big toe . Also , the color is darker than it appears on the computer screen . I was disappointed in the brown-ness of the color and was expecting more of a golden bronze . Not as neutral as expected .

 It looks great on the picture . When I recieved I was disappointed ... This shoes is very uncomfortable . I do n't recommend .
 these shoes were said to be an 81/2 but were at least one size too large - so I was not satisfied as I had to pay for shipping 2 times and ended up with NOTHING !

 Nice looking boots - I got them in the mail yesterday . I wear size 11 1/2 for every other brand and can sometimes comfortably wear a size 11 , but these are waaayyyyy too tight . I am going to need to send them back for a larger size . I am going to try a size 12 , but am afraid that they 'll still be a little small .
 Shoe is advertized as a leather upper . When it comes it is clearly marked as `` ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS '' inside the heel . Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15 % restocking fee for a `` damaged shoebox '' to 50 % for `` trying-on wear . '' Seller is a rip-off . Do not buy ! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use .
 The product took 2 weeks to arrive since it was originally shipped to wrong state . Then , I received the wrong color . Size ordered fit at least two sizes smaller than same size from any store . Even when color and size were wrong , I had to return to store at my own expense . Poor custumer service . I will not buy from this company again .
 Not the best fit , and not the best color . I wear them occasionally but not often . My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles .
 Other reviews were right that these seem to run a little small . Both a little short and maybe a little narrow too .
 This shoe is pretty and stylish , but not true to size . I ordered a medium width . The shoe fit OK except for the heel , which was way too narrow . I had to return them .
 i was looking for nice plain low heels.i trusted the hushpuppies brand . needed 11 ew . to narrow and bottom of shoes were slick . a plus size girl could slip and fall in these real fast . i returned them . i suggest cloudwalkers instead .
 This is a very cute shoe , especially the style and the height of the heel . However , it is not made of leather as advertised . This makes a difference to shoppers as myself , as shoes made of manmade materials do n't breathe well.Also , I ordered a Medium-width shoe , but this style runs extremely narrow . I have never had to buy a Wide-width shoe in my life and am consistently the same size for dress shoes . However , these are more than uncomfortably tight on my foot.It 's too bad , because the seller mailed the product to me in record time . Their customer service was also very responsive when I contacted them to return the item . Overall , I would not give the seller a negative rating , but would caution people interested in purchasing this product as they may need to order a size up -LRB- esp . in width -RRB- .
 I looked all those nice reviews but I was disapointed when the shoe came . It is pretty but has a slipery sole . And it is not leather as advertised .
 I remember when Converse meant quality but not anymore . I purchased these for my son and in just a few months the literally fell apart the whole leather shoe came apart from the sole on both shoes . The leather is still in new condition so they were not abused in any way just poor quality .
 I am in the process of returning the shoes because two weeks after wearing them , the rubber `` bumpers '' started to pull away from the base of the shoe and then completely split .
 great heel , great price , great looking boot , shiny , but ca n't zip them up ! cost $ 15 to return so ended up keeping and ca n't wear ... shame .
 I ordered these shoes because Clarks ' are supposed to be quality , comfortable shoes . However , these have left blisters each time I have worn them , have a wobbly sole , and are not that attractive on .
 I bought this shoe for halloween and did not ware them due to the pain they caused . The front of the shoe was too short and my toes were squashed . Cute shoe
 Cute shoe but way too narrow . I have regular width feet but I could barely squeeze my toes into the straps . I attempted to wear them one day in hopes of stretching them but that I was a huge mistake . I should really return them but I 'm terrible at getting around to returns . Maybe I 'll take them to a shoe stretch . Bummer deal .
 Boots look like they 're work boots ! Not leather ... and that fact not mentioned in description of item .
 It 's not too heavy and it 's warm enough for mild winter but if it 's below -10 C , I 'll stick to my Sorel boots.I got medium width and wore these boots with thick wool/acrylic socks . However , even with my thick socks , the boot shafts were too wide . I have to fold my already thick socks to make my calves really thick enough to fill the boots.How do you maintain the suppleness of synthetic boots ? I do n't know if being worn only a few months of the year and being kept in storage the rest of year is detrimental to synthetic shoes . My Snug boots have creases and cracks on the upper right where it bends when I bend my feet . I have a lot of other synthetic material flats and boots but they do n't have cracks.I 've noticed that when I walk on slushy snow -LRB- we have lots and lots of snow here -RRB- , my feet gets wet . I finally poured water into my boots to find out where the water is seeping in . My boots were dripping water like mini waterfalls . There was water beading up from the creases/cracks on the upper and water flowing out of the joints between the upper and the sole.Guess I 'll have to reserve wearing these boots only on DRY winter days .
 Nice looking boots - I got them in the mail yesterday . I wear size 11 1/2 for every other brand and can sometimes comfortably wear a size 11 , but these are waaayyyyy too tight . I am going to need to send them back for a larger size . I am going to try a size 12 , but am afraid that they 'll still be a little small .
 I got these shoes much cheaper than what they are selling today . Wore them once and they pinched my toes so badly . They 're very cute though .
 Nice materials . Not much support in the footbed , sandal runs loose . I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I 've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible .
 My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years . When she received her latest pair , it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed . These 61/2 d 's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds . The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long . Quality control very poor .
 I like velcro type shoes , but this was too tight when I use the velcro to close it and cause major itching on top of foot . It restricted air to top of foot and when I took feet out of them it cause red pressure/look on top of my feet -LRB- major itch -RRB- . These shoes are the first to make my feet itch at the top soooo badly . Do n't recommend these . I tried them out twice for walks and now I 'm stuck with these shoes . Going to buy some other shoe now .
 I ordered the same size -LRB- 10M -RRB- I 've worn at least 5 years . Shoes too narrow , especially in the toes . Really scrunched them up . Wo n't try another size , as I 'm afraid they will also not fit . Also , shoes not nearly as cute as in photo.I wear orthotics , so most slip-ons do n't work for me . Because of my arthritis , I 've been trying to switch to shoes with velcro straps , instead of ties . Very big disappointment . Now I have to deal with returning them , too .
 This sneaker was a big disappointment . Ordered wide and they hurt . Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great . I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie .
 Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several , however this particular model # 3902 runs large . Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size . My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes , only the sizing . Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct , they do !
 The sneakers arrived in great condition , packaged well , so I do n't fault the distributor at all . BUT , when I put the shoes on my feet , they were like boats . I still have an identical pair of Propet 's -LRB- same model # / size -RRB- and they fit but are worn out . Probably a quality control issue at the shoe factory .
 I bought these shoes at regular price , in my regular size , at another website . When they arrived , they were clearly too small , either cut skimpily or missized . The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened . I could n't even walk in them . I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand , in my regular size/width . No problem.Later , when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com , I ordered them again -LRB- the price was so low , how could I not ? -RRB- , this time a half size larger . STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe , a bit snug for the ball of my left foot , the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff , awkward , and clunky . At best , they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time . A flexible , supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that , IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size , anywhere .

 Unfortunately , these shoes are just a little too metallic for me . They did n't look so `` shiny '' in the picture . I feel a little like the FTD Florist man when wearing them . -LRB- The gold ones are even more so ; I ordered those first and sent them back ... -RRB- I do n't wear them as much as I might if they were just plain brown .

 Just received my shoes today and when I opened them they looked like they have been worn . The material of the shoes has wrinkles in it kind of like it 's melting off , and one of the shoes has a crack in it . The actual design is cute , but it was a huge waste of money .
 I just realized that high heel shoes with open toe like these ones are not so attractive.On side view , they make your feet look too small -LRB- short -RRB- for the height . It looks funny specially worn with long jeans . . I did n't like it , it 's not my style .

 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .
 I would never buy these again . After only one week of my son wearing them the whole bottom fell off one of the boots . Absolutely not happy with them at all . After spending the money I did on them I have to go out and buy him another pair .
 I purchased these boots at Mills Fleet Farm , usually known to sell quality products . These boots should be pulled off the shelf right now ! I paid $ 47.00 for these boots and they are worth $ 5.00 . I have had them for one month and walked thru the snow covered forests 15 days out of that month . The imitation leather , `` yes that is what these boots are made of , what a JOKE '' is coming off , the interior fabric on the inside of the imitation leather is breaking down and the interior of the boot where your feet are placed is also completly breaking down . Do Not waste you money on these boots period . And if you shop at Fleet Farm tell the manager to not sell these boots . MADE IN CHINA GARBAGE
 These were used for casual everyday dress , not work and it took all of 2 weeks for the sole to separate from the boot . Crap !
 This was my first and my last Birkenstock purchase . The soles are very hard and uncomfortable , especially on concrete . Also , I ordered what seemes to be the correct size for me , but these were at least a full size too large . These sandals are wearable , but I usually wear a pair of sandals I picked up at K *** 's for only $ 15 . I was very disapointed with this purchase .
 Birkenstock Unisex Arizona SandalI received 3 pairs of these sandals , ALL THE WRONG WIDTH . I loved the leather of this style of sandal that i ordered -LRB- but had to finally settle for the synthetic leather one to get my right size , i was very bummed out as I did n't think a consumer just had to settle here on Amazon -RRB- , but the sandals were marked incorrectly at the Birkenstock FACTORY . I only learned this by calling Birkenstock directly ; they were very kind and filled me in on the details I outlined below : When the little foot print image is FILLED in on the lining of the sandal and on the box , that means they are `` narrow '' and not the `` regular '' width which would have an OUTLINE of a footprint.I wish you well for all those that purchased the sandals , you had better check out to see if you have the actual right width for your feet . Amazon was very kind in helping me return the 3 wrong pairs sandals and shipping out the other pair of sandals overnight that just arrived today.The only NEGATIVE with Amazon -LRB- which was the seller -RRB- was that I received a generic terse email today from Amazon saying that they felt I might be abusing the return privileges and threatened to close my account . I can not control their warehouse inventory and as for the other items that were returned , it was due in large part to safety seals being broken or missing or no proper food labels on the food items . I do n't know about other people , but I would most certainly not use a eye medication or consume a food product with a broken or missing safety seal . I hope Amazon and I can get past this , but if we ca n't , I wish them well and there are plenty of other merchants that will want my business .
 Forms an excellent shoe , but I did not feel comfortable when you usedSumma I advise not to buy itThanks Amazon
 I was able to track the progress of this item , and it took almost two weeks AFTER the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped . I also paid for 2 Day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me .
 hello we ordered arizona birkenstock leather classic straps but you send me synthetic straps it your misstake cause you published that its leather on web ! I am allergic to that synthetic strapsplease be in tuch for this soon thank you Rachel
 My wife , a long time Birkenstock wearer , convinced me to buy a pair shortly after we first met - I opted for the Milano . So I bought into the cache , supressed my Yankee frugality and opened my wallet for more than I ever paid for ANY shoe previously . Ca n't say they were very comfortable but I let them grow on me . That first summer was great , and I came to enjoy wearing them . Then I had to fork over more money to have them re-soled , which cost about a third of the original price of the sandal -LRB- the profuse scolding I got from the ` authorised ' repairman about not sealing the cork was free -RRB- . And that 's the way it was for about 4 years then the cork bed fell apart -LRB- despite my conscientious efforts at maintaining them -RRB- and I bought a new pair and repeated the process all over again for another pair , then I gave them up . Sure I wore them all the time , but they did n't get any more wear than any other shoe I 've worn . And no , I 'm not prone to scuffing my feet when I walk . Is it really that much to ask for a sole tread that can stand up to normal wear and not erode like its made out of cardboard ? That 's what I would expect from the $ 20 Walmart knock offs - which , by the way seem hold up better than the real ones . And using rubber cement to seal the cork - really ?! That 's just stupid . So I wore my second pair into the ground which did n't take too long , and found a much nicer -LRB- and cheaper -RRB- style sandal from a local store , which have stood up incredibly well for the better part of three years . Now all of this is n't endemic to just the Milano , my wife 's Arizonas have experienced the same things.Of course your mileage may vary , but be forewarned of what can happen . How much is the Birkenstock cache REALLY worth to you ?
 Bought shoes from FootSmart through Amazon . Shoes did n't fit . Customer service at vendor would not provide return postage because the item was purchased through Amazon and not directly from footsmart . Cost me $ 11.00 to return shoes . I will buy from Zappos from now on .
 well , i tried to order a pair of black sandals , and a pair of brown sandals , each from a different website due to price differences . while the description says `` hunter brown '' , the ones i recieved are clearly black . so , no i have two pairs of black ones . recommend to call vendor to verify color prior to ordering .
 Although the surface looks ok , when wear it , you feel the material is to hard , uncrediable hard . If you are tough guy , you can try that , otherwise , leave it alone .
 Generally , I like Birkenstocks , but they have one SERIOUS drawback . The soles shrink in high heat . I had my Birkenstocks in the back seat of my car . I parked in the sun on a hot day . The soles of my Birkenstocks shrank approximately 1/4 '' from the edge of the leather on the sides and about 5/8 '' in the toe and heel . The sole also partially separated from the upper . Yeah , I guess for the future I wo n't leave my shoes in the car when I go inside , but ` cmon , a pair of shoes should be able to handle a hot car on a normal day . Like , what ? I 'm not supposed to take Birkenstocks on vacation ? Or only wear them the whole time ? What happens if I want to go on a hike when I 'm on vacation ? I guess I have to pack my Birks on my back . Ca n't leave 'em in the car . None of my other possessions were affected on the same trip . Grrr , Birkenstocks .
 I ordered the correct size , according the chart provided . They were waaaay too big . As in unwearable.On the plus side , Birks are great shoes , the product was as described , except for size , and it arrived on the day promised . I love Amazon , and use it a lot , but this one was a failure .
 If , as advertised , you want the ORIGINAL FOOTBED - which is NOT the `` Soft Footbed '' - then these are NOT what you want . I ordered them expecting the original foot bed and received the `` Soft Footbed '' version instead . This was not mentioned anywhere in the ordering process . Pick size , pick width , pick color and material , but no options regarding the footbed . So now I am packaging them up and sending them back , which is a waste of my time . Yes , I am annoyed because I think this is deceptive . Amazon should get it right . The reason they are cheaper may very well be because , in general , people do n't want the Soft Footbed , so they are trying to get rid of them . So now you wo n't be confused or fooled .
 I had to send my first pair back they were too big . Yesterday I received my birks they were very dusty and I do n't think they are leather like the first pair , they scratch easily . The color is not solid it looks faded . . I would retun them but do n't want to spend the money again shipping them back . I would not recomend purchasing anything from this company . Very disappointed .
 When the shoes arrived -LRB- in good time -RRB- I was very pleased with the appearance . But immediately upon trying to wear them , it was obvious they were too small . I hoped they 'd stretch out , being soft leather , and wore them for a couple of hours . No change - one was still hurting my foot considerably and limiting blood flow to that foot -LRB- very literally -RRB- . While wearing them , I opened the Sportsman 's Guide catalog sent with the shoes . They were on sale in the catalog enclosed with the order for $ 5.00 less then what they charged through Amazon . Even worse , the catalog -LRB- NOT their Amazon ad -RRB- specifically says these shoes run small and that they should be ordered size larger than the customer normally wears . That is clearly the case , based on this pair - yet they did n't have the courtesy to include that caution/recommendation on their Amazon ad and then charged $ 5.00 more to purchase them through Amazon . This is my second experience with Sportsman 's Guide and both experiences were among the worst I 've experienced in life -LRB- and I 'm old enought to be an AARP member -RRB- . This will be my last purchase from them . I should have learned my lesson the first time , but I believe in giving someone a 2nd chance to show good faith and improvement . Sportsman 's Guide has had their 2nd chance . It 's a real shame , because the shoes are otherwise very nice . If you choose to do business with Sportsman 's Guide through Amazon , order these shoes size larger than what you normally wear - as their own catalog clearly states .
 I saw this here in a boutique in n.y.c. . It seemed like a nice grocery bag initially.It was authentic and I thought the price was alright but I was sorry to have purchaced it after several weeks.I use it for ruff and tumble and the cloth got stained and scuffed and I gave it to the Salvation Army hoping maybe someone might like it and fix it up.Its best to do some reading reviews before buying stuff .

 These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes . They are now made in China and are not the same . The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside . A lot of products are finely constructed in China , for example Apple Computer products . Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version . It 's all about supervising the manufacture , not the fault of the Chinese factory . I own a pair of the former version and the current . They do n't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them .
 I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years . The shoes have been very comfortable and durable . In fact , I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new , despite showing moderate sole wear . With this purchase , I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half ! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them ... they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition .
 I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago . This pair , although priced lower , fit nothing like the first . They were much narrower with a thinner sole . I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China . Buyer beware !
 The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years , however , the two new pairs -LRB- black and brown leather -RRB- were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $ 130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe . The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks . The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China .
 Clarks Men 's Natureveldt , purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month . Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product , awful service .
 I have worn Clarks for over 30 years and those shoes were made in England . These Chinese copies do n't measure up in any way with the originals . In fact , I have sent my shoes back for a refund and are resoling my old Clark 's thru Resole America for 72.00 . The key difference was the foam , comfort air insole inside the bottom of the shoe ; it did n't have the give or immediate fit as was promised . Sadly , I have keep looking for alternative brands that might measure up to these original Clarks .
 Shoe needs more padding . There was none on the tongue and it chaffed .
 I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes , only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered . I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out . I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive . But , no shoes . Finally , after repeated email inquiriea , I received a blunt response saying essentially , `` We TOLD you we do n't have the Chestnut colored shoes '' . I will not order from this company again as it appears they do n't have good internal communication .

 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 I ORDERED THE 11XX AND THE `` XX '' WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING 4E . WHEN IT ARRIVED , THE BOX STATED `` XX '' BUT ALSO SAID `` 5E '' WHICH MADE THEM TOO LARGE.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST .
 I 've been buying these Propet Scandia Walker men 's shoes for years , so I have a lot of experience with this shoe . I always buy 10 1/2 XE -LRB- US 3 E -RRB- and they have always been GREAT , until I bought these 2 pair from Elite Hero . I always bought them before from a major US retailer , but they did n't have them anymore . The difference was astonishing . They were very TIGHT , and the materials looked inferior -LRB- but not enough that I can initially cry foul , the proof should come with wearing -RRB- . Also the leather upper is VERY hard on these now . Elite Hero has assured me that Propet has told them that Propet had not lowered the quality of the shoes -LRB- one of my first concerns along with were they knock-offs i.e. fakes -RRB- . I have contacted Propet 3 times , but have not received a reply yet . Another question that I have , is since they are China made and other Companies have complained of Chinese manufacturing NOT putting in the specified materials , could there be a manufacturer issue . Specifically has the manufacturer , without Propet knowledge or approval , changed the materials or shorted the materials -LRB- e.g. smaller than specified shoe size -RRB- to save on cost and improve profit ? The leather upper is now VERY hard , the sole appears to be of similar material as before , but inferior . And there 's the tight fit .
 Do Not Buy this Shoe!Runs small , leather stiff . Not suitable for seniors.In addition , there is a service charge for restocking.I will not buy from this company again.Jo in Carlsbad , CA
 Bought a 12 EEE , which is fine for length and width , but the top , over the arch , is not big enough . Most lacing shoes can open enough for my foot but this one does not . The problem with shoes that one does n't try on first . But , I think that as I wear these more they will work out . Just unusually uncomfortable right now is all , but I do n't think that they should be . Also , they are pretty heavy for low quarters . That 's one ding for tightness over the arch and another for weight.Edited because these are just not breaking in . They hurt my feet rather badly . I 've worn them almost daily since they came , so ca n't just send them back . Probably donate them .
 Ordered a size 8N in blue , received a 9N in black . What more can I say?The seller has no quality control .
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON -LRB- SHOEFLAKE -RRB- AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE . FORTUNATELY , I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO . HOWEVER , I AM OUT $ 60 + DOLLARS .
 Shoe appeared to be the wrong size.The shoe was a bigger size than what was stated , more like a factory reject .
 I have worn the Liberty Loafer for many years . These run wider than any others that I have -- in the same size . I will not order these again .
 I have worn the Enzo Liberty loafer as my primary shoe of choice for many years , and have owned at least 15 pair . I always knew I could depend on this shoe to fit my foot as if it were hand-made for me , and to be comfortable from day one . Unfortunately , the quality of this shoe seems to have deteriorated while the cost has steadily gone up . This pair is not the soft buttery leather I have grown accustomed to , but feels extremely stiff , does not conform to my foot , rubs my ankle and cuts into my instep . I will not be ordering these again , and am greatly disappointed .
 These would not stay on my son 's feet . The faux-fur lining is very slick , and the slightest wriggling will knock them loose.These may work for a kid who 's very , very still , but if they like to move and kick , you 'll be lucky if the first bootie stays on long enough for you to put the second on their other foot .
 The sizing on these skates is entirely off !! Such a disappointment to receive them just in time for my daughters birthday to find that the size 5 is actually a youth size 4 -LRB- sizing on tongue says Adult 5 , Youth 4 , European 35 -RRB- . Knowing that Heelys run small I intentionally ordered a size up too . Had to order a completely different style from another site . I still do n't understand how an adult 5 is a youth 4 ...
 Eye glasses pocket is way too small . Glasses hang out at least 2 inches . Cell phone pocket only big enough for small flip phone . Thin leather strap has a feminine look about it which casts the whole bag as feminine . Needs a broad leather strap , stronger metal clasps , and bigger outside pockets .
 I bought this man bag and the zipper has already broke.So I either buy a new bag or have the zipper replaced which will cost as much as the bag did.This is the first product I bought that did not last .
 I bought another one of these bags for travel . I already have one -LRB- real leather -RRB- that has served me well and has plenty of carrying capacity and I really like it . The `` real '' one cost around $ 100 and was well made . This cheap knockoff is poorly made . One of the straps broke the first week when we were in Europe . The other strap came apart the 2nd week . Also , one of the zipper `` pulls '' broke off soon after . I threw the entire bag away after returning home . Look elsewhere , because this is `` junky . '' The design is good , but that is about it .
 Product does not look the way pictured on Amazone.Quality of leather is cheap.Used two type of leather texture on front pocket.Quality of zip also not good.Quality of should strap is also not good.Avoid buying this one .
 It 's time for Amazon to put a stop to it . The word leather means nothing now . I searched for cowhide leather , since the word leather brought up fakes . If the other reviewer had not told us , I might have bought this , another inferior product . It 's time for us to HOLD AMAZON RESPONSIBLE !
 The cell phone and eyeglass pockets on the bag would not snap close . Items in these compartments are not secure and will fall out of bag . Company should make sure that all compartments work properly prior to shipping out product . Would not recommend purchase of this product to other interested men or women . This was a waste of my money . I need another bag that has all working compartments .
 The zippers on this product are the cheapest available and after 2 weeks of moderate use , one has already failed !
 I ordered these shoes because I simply liked the way they look . However there are no half sizes ... I wear 11 1/2 and I got a 12 , they are too big , and I figured the 11 would be too small , so now I wear them with thick socks and its not that bad but if you wera a half size I dont really recomend these make of shoes
 These shoes ripped where the tongue meets the side wall after normal wear of half an hour . Returned to Eastbay . Still working on refund . My son has a similar pair of globe shoes that ripped in the same spot after several months .
 These are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever had . I missed the return window . Now I am stuck with this junk . 1 -RRB- when you walk they sound like your wearing cowboy boots -LRB- loud -RRB- . 2 -RRB- the inside is NOT comfortable . It feels like wearing plastic shoes . 3 -RRB- the foot opening is way to large , your feet slip out and they look like women 's slippers . -LRB- i checked and they said `` men 's '' -RRB- . Get some DC 's . They are much better . -LRB- P.S. . Who cares that they come in a cigar box ? I would 've preferred good shoes in a paper bag -RRB-
 Globe shoes wear out too fast , both pairs wore out with the lightest casual use . Please make your shoes better quality !
 They 're nice looking shoes but the seam around top of the toes ripped alot . I like how they look but they 've ripped a lot idk if i 'd buy them again .
 One of the LOWEST & CHEAPEST quality shoes I have EVER seen !!! Any positive feedback -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- must come from an employee or someone with VERY LOW standards ... DO NOT BUY !!! They WILL NOT last very long !!
 The wrong color was delivered , but the seller was very helpful in returning and refunding my money very quickly . I would have taken an exchange , but the color was not in stock . I would do buisness with them again in the future .

 I climb at the YMCA twice a week and before buying these , used 5.10 's with great success . These looked like a good entry-level shoe . However , the grip is terrible for indoor holds . It creates black marks on the wall and slips often . I almost seriously injured myself several times . I definitely would n't take them outside . 5.10 's have much better / more reliable grip.I thought maybe I just needed to wear them in , but after two weeks the grip was still coming off and causing my feet to slip .
 I was shopping around for a nice shoe for a little while , and I found this one at a great store called Soccer Plus in Palatine , IL . I bought the shoe and used it to kick a ball around with some friends . By the end , the back of my ankle had a mark from the friction . Next time I used it , I ran on a treadmill . When I finished and looked at my sock , it was covered in blood from that same area . I 'm not sure what the problem was , but I think it was the artificial material and the lack of padding . I would n't really recommend this shoe . Find one with better padding inside .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 This shoe is a beautiful green . Comfort and quality is lacking . It cuts across my bunion and I was unable to take even 5 steps in it . The toe box is very small and the heel is very wide . This is not a shoe for mild bunions . After taking it off and wrapping it back into the box to return I noticed the stitching is not done very well . The green almost looks as though it is painted on . The bottom side of the shoe the green just stops and the shoe is a cream color .
 Overall construction is good however the side top edge does not have a cushion for the ankle bone . This caused an abrasion under the ankle . Product was returned and credit was issue in a satisfactory manner .

 The item is described as fitting a shoe size 9.5 - 11 U.S. Mens . However my foot is a size 9 , and I tried to get this overshoe to stretch over my size 9 tennis shoe and it would not stretch far enough .
 After investing time and effort into finding a pair of cleats he would like , I order them instead of another pair he had chosen only to find out 2 days later that they were out of stock . I wish all vendors would learn to only post what you can actually deliver .

 I think these shoes are the cutest things , so I bought them , unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I could n't keep them , amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund .

 I ordered a pair at 6 1/2 WW -LRB- EE -RRB- . For that size and width , according to standard sizing charts , the sole should be 3 3/4 -4 '' wide at the widest . These are 3 1/4 '' . According to standard size charts , that would be a C width at most.It 's really too bad , as these appear to be very attractive boots otherwise . Why bother advertising and supporting widths if your widest size is so narrow .

 I owned these boots for about a year . I did n't wear them daily . Just on hunting weekends or cold/rainy work days . The 2 rubber soles on the bottom completely separated when I was walking the other day . I have boots that I wear A LOT more than these that I have had for years . I tried to contact Georgia -LRB- aka Rocky -RRB- boots and never received an email back from them . After 2 weeks of not hearing back I called Georgia boots to tell them about my recent problems , they will not repair any boots they sale and would not replace them because it was less than a month outside of the 1 year warranty . I will never buy another pair of Rocky or Georgia boots again . STAY AWAY . Poorly made product and HORRIBLE customer service .
 I bought these boots in October as a gift for my husband after he wore them for 2 months the lining started rip , I 've been trying to return them to the seller papa shoes for 3 weeks , I have not received an email or phone back from this company . I would never buy from them again . I have bought from amazon several times and have never had any problems until now , very frustrated .
 These are the worst New Balance Shoes I have ever worn . I have been wearing NB for approx 5 yrs and these make my feet hurt so bad at the end of the day that I ca n't hardly walk in the evening . I should have sent them back but 30 days already passed by . I tried them and then waited a couple of days and tried again and every time my feet hurt so bad . I do n't know what is wrong with this model but the sole is like concrete and not the same kind of flexibility like the others also the heel does n't have the same cushioning either . The other that I have worn was the 574 and the 574 . It seems like the higher the number the worse the shoe gets and the price goes up as well . Now I have to find another brand of shoe to wear for work , I need an all black shoe .
 when clicking on the product at you site the image kept changing from a shoe string to velcro . The walking shoe category I went to was velcro shoes . But I received tie strings instead . Had to return at my expense t6o New balance who shipped out the correct product but the wrong size . Still have that shipment and will again have to return .
 I had ordered velcro fasteners and received regular lace sneakers . I will be returning them . The service was good ; just not what was ordered .
 The American made shoe looks good however they tend to run a 1/2 size smaller than labeled . The shoe 's tongue was also shorter than those made outside of USA in the past . Not satisfied with product fit . Have always worn New Balance shoes .
 Usually New Balance shoes are comfortable , although they do not run true to size , I usually take an 8 1/2 , but I order my NB 's at 9 1/2 . This walking shoe and the 575 both run narrow and hurt my feet as soon as I put them on , and after 30 minutes or so , my feet are numb . Perhaps a larger size might help , but they do n't offer a wider size .
 Ordered the Velcro New Balance shoes . Upon arrival they were not velcro at all . Just shoe laces . What a disappointment ! There seems to be a general lack of truth in advertising these days .
 I live overseas and when I have a planned trip or my husband 's colleague goes to the US for a business trip I would order stuffs online . I ordered a size 7 shoes and what was deliverd was a size 6.5 . I have no way of returning or exchanging it since I do not know when I will be back in the US.Otherwise the shoes looked good , durable and a good price .
 I 've had several pairs of MW575 and MW574 in size 10EE . I always was able to just put them on and in about 2 hours they were broken in and felt great for months . I purchased 2 pairs of MW576 thinking they 'd be the same , but they were very uncomfortable , even after 2 weeks . The bump in the middle of the forefoot was so large that it annoyed me with every step . Even though this shoe looked to be the same length , I was crowded in the toe box . I even tried new insoles but they were even more uncomfortable.I called New Balance to find out what was going on and they informed me that the MW575 was made on the AL-1 last , but the MW576 changed over to the SL-2 last -LRB- making it a completey different fitting shoe -RRB- . New Balance was very responsive and allowed me to return the 2 pairs directly to them . They sent me a pair of MW926 in black and a pair of MK706 . The MW926 was OK for a while -LRB- even more stable in the heel -RRB- , but still not as comfortable as the MW575 , and after about 4 months have become very uncomfortable . The MK706 was both too short and wide in the midfoot and heel so I could n't stand them for more than an hour . New Balance has suggested I try the mw845 so I 've ordered a pair of those to try . I 've also tried on a variety of NB and other brands at local stores , but have n't found anything that fit like the MW575.I 've come to rely upon my New Balance shoes for consistent fit and to get me through the day , but this new model was an extreme disappointment . I do n't understand why NB took a great product and ruined it for me . I have to give NB kudos for making a wide range of sizes and for good customer service . My complaint is that NB gave me something great then took it away . This is a cardinal sin of customer service.The bottom line is if you liked the MW575 do n't count on the MW576 as a replacement .
 These shoes appear to be very well built however there is no cushion in the heel area of the shoe . Walking in them is very uncomfortable .
 I sent these shoes back and was charged a restock charge . I ordered a men 's size 12 which I 've ordered on line for Reebok and Sketchers as well as slippers and never had any problem . These ran small and were too tight .
 I walk and hike a lot & New Balance shoes are consistently the best I 've found . -LRB- They used to be very wide , but now they have a more normal fit . -RRB- Like all New Balance shoes , these are extremely well constructed , with excellent stability & support . But these particular shoes have virtually no tread at all , and what little they have will wear down quickly & become slick & unsafe . I 've seen this lack of tread on other New Balance shoes as well & I ca n't understand why they do this . These shoes are a nasty fall waiting to happen . Most New Balance shoes have good deep tread and provide great traction . Those are the ones I buy .
 You 're better off leaving the broken laces on the shoes . These laces are very thin and cheap , do n't pull too large as they will snap apart .
 These shoelaces do not stay tied -LRB- have to double not each time -RRB- , and yet when I try to untie them , they frequently catch on themselves and get into ridiculous knots that require me to take the shoe off before solving . DO NOT BUY . Get real shoelaces from a shoe repair shop .
 These shoes are beautifully crafted , but poorly designed . I have an undemanding foot and have never had any issues with off-the-rack dress shoes not fitting correctly . Until I bought a couple pair of Kennetts . These shoes could be used as torture devises . It honestly feels like I 'm wearing the shoes on the wrong foot . While they look fantastic -LRB- sitting in my closet -RRB- , I do not recommend purchasing without trying on first . I 'm disappointed because I really wanted to like these shoes -LRB- and not be out $ 300 + -RRB- . Oh well , live and learn .
 I love the old Quark Liberty , but this one is so disappointed me , size is too small , the shoe is too narrowed and too tight .

 Cute shoe and the price was great but they looked cheap . I am normally a 7.5 , I ordered the 8 because 1/2 sizes were n't available . It turns out they were too big . My feet were practically sliding out of the shoe . I returned them . You get what you pay for .
 I ordered a pair at 6 1/2 WW -LRB- EE -RRB- . For that size and width , according to standard sizing charts , the sole should be 3 3/4 -4 '' wide at the widest . These are 3 1/4 '' . According to standard size charts , that would be a C width at most.It 's really too bad , as these appear to be very attractive boots otherwise . Why bother advertising and supporting widths if your widest size is so narrow .
 Item is not what I expected.I probably should have known better going by the price , but for that I could have gotten somethinng a lot better at any shoe store in my area .

 Comfortable slipper . Top construction is well made and put together but sole material wore out too quickly wearing the slipper around the house and outdoors on occasion to walk out to get the sunday newspaper . Would not purchase these slippers again .
 These shoes were MUCH smaller than the stated size . I wear a 13 and a half shoe , but knowing that house shoes need to be loose , I ordered them in a size 14 . They were SO small , I could n't force my feet into them . And if the seller -LRB- different than the manufacturer -RRB- really had a `` bend-over-backwards '' policy as they state , they would offer a fedex or UPS label so I could send them back for free . / This is exactly why I dislike buying cloths from the internet or by mail-order . But , it is getting harder and harder to find local stores that have the larger sizes -LRB- even big and tall stores -RRB- . I guess I 'm just screwed .
 I wear a size 10.5 D . After reading other reviews here saying these shoes are &#34; true to size &#34; , I ordered a size 11 . I received them and they ar at least a full size too small . This is the last pair of house shoes I will try to buy on line . I know from trying them on in store that you just ca n't trust their sizing . I do n't know why that is , but i 's been the case ith Every pair I 've bought . I happened to be able to give this pair away or a Christmas present instead of having to return them . That said , I regret buying them ... wo n't try it agin .
 I ordered these for my Dad for Christmas , but he was n't able to get his feet in them . They were very small .
 These were sold as mens size 11 , both my son and my husband wear a size 10 1/2 shoe , neither of them can wear these slippers . They are at lease 1-2 sizes too small . The shipping was slower than advertised as well . The slippers themselves are solid and warm with a sturdy sole you can wear outdoors without fear . The only problem is they are much smaller than the marked size .
 cloth on bottom sole not good for hardwood floors , knobs on bottom of sole with cloth glued to them offers even less area for grip . doubt the knobs will be comfortable , but time will tell . solid build and warm for ankle and once fabric on sole wears out and offers some grip -LRB- what where they thinking ? -RRB- it might be comfortable but will definately be warm , if it doesnt make feet sweat ... -LRB- just got them so unknown , but looks like the dearforms inner fabric , sorta . -RRB- if not for the knobs and cloth on bottom , this could get a five .
 I threw them out ! the most cheaply made piece c. . p I ever had . Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
 Having read another review that said these slippers ran small , I ordered the next size up but it was too small . I returned them for the next size but they are out of the next size bigger . This is the only style slipper my husband likes and it is impossible to find them anywhere .
 Do n't order these unless you have tiny little feet . I ordered a size larger than my husband normally wears and he could n't even get them on . If you order them , you better try TWO sizes up than normal .
 normaly this would be my size.could barely get my foot in them . i think this was the only size available.looked well made but jusy wouldny fit . gave yhem to the needy .
 The slippers were ok except the opening is too small to get your foot into it without considerable effort . That made the slippers unusable for me .
 I tried on these slippers on precisely one time , then returned them to the box . They were n't horrible , just not real comfortable , and I got the feeling they would n't be particularly warm . But to be fair , I did n't wear them long enough to judge their thermal efficiency . I just did n't like the feel of them.For my money , better to pay a little more and get better quality .
 Good Quality ... But opening for foot way too small ... My huband couldn &#34; t get his foot in the slipper ... Other wise nice slipper shoe
 I ordered the recommended one size up . The toe box length and width is tight , but the back half of the slippers and sides are a bit loose . A full size increase to a 9M from the size , which I ordered -LRB- 8M -RRB- would be too large and the sides would definitely be too loose . As other reviewers noted , these slippers do loosen up and I hope that the toe box becomes more comfortable . The 3/4 '' rubber raised soles appears adequate . As I write this review , my feet are becoming quite warm , after about twenty minutes , with my athletic socks.After an hour , my feet are roasting in these slippers . Would I purchase again ? Difficult to say , if the toe box does n't loosen up for comfort .01 / 25/2012 UpdateI replaced this pair from DSW -LRB- Designer Shoe Warehouse -RRB- with two pairs , which fit . My feet were never comfortable with this pair . Would not recommend .

 I normally love Naturalizer shoes , but these were so uncomfortable that they actually physically hurt to wear . I think the design of the shoe is too narrow towards the toe so your feet end up extremely squished together . It was so bad that I do n't think even a bigger size would have helped so I sadly returned them .
 20 OctThe leather is fine ; so is the style . However , I got an 8 1/2 wide Naturalizer Women 's Fuller loafer and the shoe is wider in the heel than toe . The heel looks bulky and slides even with adhesive pads inside the heel .

 Very uncomfortable and cheap looking shoes . The promotional pictures looked very stylish and I made a complete fool of myself by getting coaxed into buying these shoes . Personally I expected better quality from Adidas .

 Ordered a size 8N in blue , received a 9N in black . What more can I say?The seller has no quality control .
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON -LRB- SHOEFLAKE -RRB- AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE . FORTUNATELY , I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO . HOWEVER , I AM OUT $ 60 + DOLLARS .
 Shoe appeared to be the wrong size.The shoe was a bigger size than what was stated , more like a factory reject .
 I have worn the Liberty Loafer for many years . These run wider than any others that I have -- in the same size . I will not order these again .
 I have worn the Enzo Liberty loafer as my primary shoe of choice for many years , and have owned at least 15 pair . I always knew I could depend on this shoe to fit my foot as if it were hand-made for me , and to be comfortable from day one . Unfortunately , the quality of this shoe seems to have deteriorated while the cost has steadily gone up . This pair is not the soft buttery leather I have grown accustomed to , but feels extremely stiff , does not conform to my foot , rubs my ankle and cuts into my instep . I will not be ordering these again , and am greatly disappointed .
 I do n't know if I just got a bad pair but within 4 months of purchase , these shoes got a huge hole in the inside upper heal portion . And the shoe also completely lost its shape . I 've had these shoes before for four years and they were very durable . Perhaps a different vendor ?
 Do n't do it . These are not what I thought they would be . They are cheaply made , definitely not the old Adidas that turned out such great shoes years ago .
 I am not a soccer player , but I liked the style of this shoe . When I recieved them I thought the tongue was ridiculously too big and just looked silly . The arch support in my pair was like having large ant mounds in the soles of my shoes . After wearing them for work for 8 weeks , the ant mounds finally broke in a little bit , but now the heal feels wore out . I would not recommend these except for maybe wearing them for short stints with a pair of jeans to cover the silly looking tongues .
 really pretty bad . hurt my feet . get terrible grip on anything but concrete . held up for a long time on the outside , but not on the onside . only other good thing to say os that they look kinda cool .
 I have owned two pairs of these shoes and lost both of them after the glue connecting the rubber and cloth parts came undone , and I lost the heels . Otherwise they are comfortable , although the arch is somewhat lacking !
 These are true classics . I remember not liking them when they first came out decades ago , but I ca n't remember why . Anyway , the shoes are really comfortable and fit true to size . This is a VERY subjective thing to comment about - fit . If the proverbial shoe fits , wear it . And for me these fit . Cheers .
 This shoe are supposed to be made out of leather -LRB- it is what I had before for similar prduct -RRB- , this is a man made materials , and are not what I expected . I am disappointed with this product , it seems to be an immitation of real staff .
 I have owned a pair of samba classics since high school . Loved them ; until this pair . It turns out that when they changed the tongue label to blue it became printed on crappy foam . And it squeaks ... All of the time ... After three days of expecting this to stop , it has n't . I am returning them -LRB- and now I have to find a new shoe ... -RRB- , bummer !!!
 I have experienced both these pairs . Breakdown : CLASSIC : adidas Men 's Samba Classic Soccer Shoe - Larger tongue - easier to slip on/off - medium/enhanced arch support . If you wear air-soled running shoes , you probably wo n't even notice . Personally , I 'm NOT A FAN . - The arch support has changed in the last 3 years -LRB- the last time I bought this pair -RRB- . Be warned!ORIGINALS : adidas Originals Men 's Samba Reflective Sneaker - Smaller tongue - Old-school arch support -LRB- meaning flatter/next to none -RRB- . I have worn nothing but Chucks and older Sambas happily for many years , and identify with the barefoot-running crowd , so for me , flatter is better . - Harder to slip on/off , but once it 's on , it fits like a glove ! - Yes , they squeak like everyone says . Does n't bother me , but then again I 'm not a movie usher , burglar or otherwise occupied in the skulking arts.Some people will prefer one over the other . For me , the clear winner is ORIGINALS .
 These shoes look great and have amazing style . Unfortunately , they are cheaply made and have zero comfort/support . I remember having an old pair of these that were amazing ... something is n't quite right about these new ones . Its really too bad , they look cool but are torture to wear . Returned .
 I received my pair of size 13 shoes quickly after ordering . Upon trying my shoes on I noticed that the left shoe did n't fit at all like the right shoe . Upon inspection of the shoes I noticed that both shoe claimed to be size 13 as posted on their tongue tags . Next I put the shoes sole to sole and notice a dramatic size difference . The left shoe was 1 to 1.5 inches smaller than the right shoe . I do n't know how this would happen and must be a problem with quality control with Adidas . I have bought other shoes from Adidas but have never had this problem . Buy this style with caution .
 I purchased two pairs . One pair was fine , on the other pair the left insole was n't fitted corrected so my foot felt twisted when I had the sneaker on . That pair got returned and on the replacement pair the right insole does n't feel like it is fitted correctly . I can feel the arch part of the insole against my foot whereas I do not have this feeling with the first good pair or even on the other shoe of the replacement pair . Very disappointed .
 seriously &#65292; these shoes make you clumsy the bottom of this shoe will make such a loud noise with the field &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281;
 It is a cheap soccer shoe with little support . the tongue extends about 1 '' past the last lacing hole and digs into your ankle , one inch is also not enough for it to be bent back over the laces so it is sufficiently awkward and was enough for me to return the shoe . unfortunately no free returns so i 'll be shopping elsewhere for my indoor soccer shoes . typically i wear a size 13 , however these were about a size too large on me so i 'd wear a 12 in this shoe . i have a pair of asics running sheos , lotto cleats and new balance cross trainers that are all 13 .
 I usually like Adidas shoes and I have a good collection . this one is an extreme opposite of what an Adidas should be like.First thing
 This is not for playing soccer . Do n't get fooled by the word `` classic soccer shoes '' that they use on the web . The shape of this shoes is just like a normal sneakers and not suited for kicking the ball . Just do n't buy this shoes .
 I ca n't believe the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this shoe . This shoe has no arch support . I 've played two pickup games that are n't too serious and I could barely walk after each one . They absorb no impact when you run and even though I tied them as tight as I could , blisters will still forming.The one positive thing I 'll say about them is they get much more traction then my regular sneakers on an indoor basketball floor so I can change direction better , which is part of the reason I get blisters because I cut/change direction very fast . -LRB- I get them with regular shoes , but I was hoping these would stop that -RRB- I suppose if you 're playing on grass or fake grass they might be ok but any hard surface I would avoid these sneakers . Also the extra long shoe tongue is annoying and looks bad folded down . -LRB- on the white sneakers at least -RRB- I went back to my tennis shoes , I 'm getting rid of these .
 I bought these shoes because I wanted something I can wear around town and also play soccer with the shoes . Believe me , you are going to wish you did not buy them if you kick a soccer ball with them . I dont know what and `` indoor soccer ball '' feels like but I tried these shoes on two balls that I have because at first I thought one of the balls that I had was too hevay and hard but it turns out it was the shoes , after kicking 30 yard shots my foot was hurting so I put on my cheap spaldings from walmart and they felt better , now I realize Im going to have to return them and buy some real soccer shoes that are hard so I can kick 30 40 yarders all day long without hurting my foot like I did with these shoes . . my email is rickalex21@hotmail.com if you have any comments send me with a subject of `` amazon adidas mens sambas '' .
 The shoes arrived with a security theft tag on them that said if we tried to break it is would leak ink all over the shoes.After many attempts to contact Bealls unsuccessfully , they finally responded about two weeks later ... too late.We spend a half an hour but carefully removed the tag . Shoes are great , Beall 's is awful.Not ordering anything from Beall 's ever again .
 Dumbest . Shoe . Ever . The SQUEAKING ruins them . Not only is it LOUD , it gets LOUDER with wear . You will sound like an IDIOT when you wear these shoes . Inside , you can hear them at least 15 yards away . Outside , unless a bus is passing by , you still hear them when you walk . Plus , the QUALITY IS BAD . The insole on the right foot is peeling away after less than 2 months . The left is mis-shapen so that my middle toe creeps to the far left of the shoe , causing severe discomfort . Mainly , THE SQUEAKING MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT . Who 's that guy with the loud shoes passing me by in the hallway at school ? YOU . Who 's that moron whose shoes make so much noise at the gym ? YOU . Who 's that guy whose foot hurts b/c he tried to work out in his Sambas ? YOU . I bought these so I could do martial arts , but the squeaking is just irritating and distracting -LRB- thank goodness I 'm not trying to be a Ninja ! -RRB- , and the discomfort renders them useless in a work out after about 15 minutes . OH , and did I mention that the stylish and slick blue Adidas tag on the tongue disappears as the tongue rides down to the inside of the shoe , rendering the logo invisible and the shoes even more uncomfortable ?
 I found these shoes by searching the women 's option for running shoes . The name may say Unisex , but there is no indication that the sizing is 100 % male . Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.When the shoes arrived here , they were huge . I tried to return them , but Amazon considers this to be MY fault , and planned to charge back any shipping , promotions and coupons against a possible refund . I had done very well using a coupon , a sale , a `` buy $ 80 worth of shoes and get $ 20 off instantly '' promotion and Amazon prime , so my `` refund '' would be less than nothing.That 's right -- if I return the shoes , I owe money . Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women 's section of the site might be men 's shoes instead . Yeah , that seems fair .
 Amazon represented these as women 's shoes but when I received them they were men 's . It turns out that the company no longer makes these shoes for women but that is how they are clearly listed on Amazon.Even though this was Amazon 's fault , and I sent plenty of support documention , I had to pay $ 9 to return these shoes and was not reimbursed or even acknowledged.I will not order through Amazon again !
 The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product , but rather the company that I purchased them from . I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift . Unfortunately , they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place , so he was unable to wear them , and since they were an online order item , it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return . The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label , so my son could return the original pair . When I spoke to my son last week , he had not yet received the return label . I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item . I am very unhappy with this purchase .

 This is a very attractive shoe but it lacks any type of support for the arch or ball of the foot . The footbed is very hard . It is an attractive round-toe style which I really liked . Too bad it would be very hard to wear over the long haul .
 Good delivery , easy return , beautiful shoes , but they do n't fit me . Soft , nice leather , very nicely made . Gaped a bit widely at the front , at the ball of my foot , when I took a step . But , I doubt it was the shoe , think it is my feet .
 The size is correct for me but since it is not very comfortable and the scrap is hard so I have to return it .
 I was desperate for a new pair of work shoes ; I have purchased this Mary Jane from Propet before however the sizing on this was so wide it gapped when I put it on with thick socks . Had a hectic schedule at work and missed the short return period which was barely thirty days . Better to go to Zappos .

 I was spellbound by the Clarks Wallabee the first time my older sister came home in them . Since that time I was hooked . I was a 14-year-old nerd with size twelve feet and I was stupefied by my first pair of Clarks Wallabees in sand suede , which set my folks back the incredible -LRB- for those days -RRB- sum of $ 55 . Since then , through my teens and twenties and into my thirties , it was Wallabees , Wallabees , Wallabees except when it was thong sandals by Birkenstock or other first-class manufacturers , that is , only `` shoes '' that were at least as comfortable as the Clarks Wallabee and arguably , perhaps , sexier . Oh , I had Wallabees in every color of the rainbow , which , back then , consisted of sand suede ; oakwood suede -LRB- that 's the darker suede with , arguably , an olive cast -RRB- ; black butter-soft leather ; and brown butter-soft leather . My mom and dad wore leather Wallabees
 I just received these shoes . They appear to have been worn in the past and returned . They are all scratched up and it looks like that fact has tried to be covered up . The box smells like shoe polish and there is polish on the cardboard and wrapping around the shoes . These were advertised as new shoes . I 've never had this sort of experience with anything I 've ordered from Amazon . I plan to return promptly . Very disappointed .
 It is absolutely ridiculous how out of size these shoes are . They are atleast 2 sizes bigger than a normal set of shoes . I reordered a size smaller but didnt work . When I went to order the size I thought were correct Amazon would not allow me to do so . The price has increased from $ 84 to $ 111 ... RIDICULOUS !

 Est delivery date was 12/13 - 12/16 guess what date it is today ... 1/3/11 ... . it was going to be a nice Christmas gift for my son-in-law . . I was hoping for 2010 . To many other good companies out there to use this one again .
 i 'm very dissisafied with my crocs . they send the wrong size.so i 'm stuck with them .
 tengo mas de un mes que pedi mis cross y aun no me han llegado necesito saber q paa con ello por favor denme razon de ello ya q los tengo cargados en mi tarjeta y todo gracias
 Maybe I 'm too concerned about fashion , but there are shoes out there that are just as comfortable , and dont make me look like I work in a hospital . I see people wear these every day and I cringe when they walk by . I guess theyre good for people maybe 70 and older who need orthotic shoes and cant wear sandals to the beach .
 My non-Croc-type of footwear are more comfortable and better made than the real Crocs I bought recently ! Quite disheartening .
 I have worn Crocs for years . They are almost a must for diabetics . The ones on this page are made in China . The cheaper quality is immediately visible , the sizing is off and the last -LRB- shape of shoe -RRB- also appears different . I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice .
 I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden . when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch , I could n't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear , but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks . I WO N'T wear them again ...
 Sorry . I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe . I will be returning , which I am bummed about , and , have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift .
 I begin by saying I have worn Crocs `` Beach '' Men 's XXL for many years . They have always been excellent shoes ... UNTIL , I PURCHASED MY MOST RECENT PAIR . The first thing you notice is they are MADE IN CHINA.Without question the shoes from China are smaller . To the point of even being tight . The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased . The front part of the sole is not as thick . Overall , it feels like a cheap imitation . I may NEVER buy another Croc shoe .
 We received the Crocs , which are my son 's favorite shoe to wear . However , when he wore them to school the next day , one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school . We are hoping to return them and get a new pair -- that will last longer than two hours .
 Croc strap broke the first time it was worn . Not pleased with this product at all .
 I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs . I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big , how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs ? Had to send back and pay for shipping , not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website .
 I was very dissapointed with this product . I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada . These were made in China . They are not the same quality at all . These are not cushioned like the others were , they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada . These are NO better than the cheaper `` knock offs '' you find in dollar stores .
 I have bought several prs of crocs , but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small .
 I ordered size 8/9 since i wear a size 8 1/2 shoe , they fit my husband who wears size 11 . To top it off I ended up paying $ 6.00 for the return shipping . It will be the last time I order shoes from them .
 Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
 Left shoe middle strap shorter than right shoe . Too bad , beautiful otherwise . Just ca n't wear . Still waiting for replacement .
 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .

 This bag looked great in the picture , and the reviews were good . However , these were the issues I had with this item . The first things is the the netting on the end pocket is very thick -LRB- the rope used could be much , much thinner , this thick rope is cumbersome and unnecessary -RRB- . Also , the spaces between the netting is way too large , anything I put in the pocket , just falls right through onto the floor , such as keys -LRB- not a good thing , unreliable pocket -RRB- . Also , I expected some kind of side pouch/pocket with several little compartments inside , for like a gym card , jewelry or pad lock . There was none . Only the two pockets . The zippered one on one end and the horrible netted pocket on the other side . This bags is not very functional , could be a lot better but really missed the mark .
 I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product . I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for `` breaking in '' the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process . However , I 've worn these slides for 2 + months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks . I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them . Maybe some day they will be `` broken '' .
 hola escribo para publicar que el dise & ntilde ; o de esta sandalia es de muy mala calidad en menos 2 1 mes se rompio . Es una perdida de dinero comprar este producto . saludos.Hello I write to publish the design of this sandal is very poor quality broke about a month . It is a waste of money buying this product . bye
 I have had these massage sandals by a few different manufacturers ... the little nubs on these which are what massage your soles ... started breaking within a few days of wearing them . . I have had some that lasted a year before breaking down ... Do n't buy these !
 I am way to lazy to write a full review , so heres the basics , those things on the bottom hurt , and they store dirt , , yuck !! Get nike !!
 these flip flop are cheap they were ripped after a month of wear ? if you want good sandals that will last for a year or more youve got ta buy leather sandals that are glued and have the soul stitched together ? like these ... -LSB- ... -RSB-
 This sandals were nice looking while new , then after a month or maybe less they started to disintegrate . The little rubber things that massage your feet started to appear everywhere in the floor , the adidas logo is starting to dissapear . I would have to guess that this sandals are replicas or maybe adidas quality is not so good today . Now I need to buy another pair of sandals , but what brand ?
 I do n't know about this seller but the $ 9.99 on amazon -LRB- which does n't even exist right now -RRB- has terrible quality . All of those painful massage knobs bend in and fall off and maybe that 's a good thing for some people but it is just a proof of poor quality and I was very dissapointed .
 The knobs starting breaking off 3 month after purchasing them.Now I need new ones .
 After about a month , the nubs start to come off of the sandal . You 're then left with your big toe in a hole as the sides of your feet fall into a rut .
 The product arrived quickly but for something that suppose to have comfort while you 're home or at the pool , this santiossage slide hurts like hell to walk in due to the hard bubbles in the inner portion of the slipper . Great look horrendous comfort ...
 The single most uncomfortable zhoe product I ever bought . Hard unyielding inner sole that does n't massage just hurts . If you 've nerver wore shoes before and went barefooted all you life you might like these .
 My husband hated them . They have little extensions on the sole . I thought he would be O.K. with that but he was not . I had to return the slides .
 Being heavy the Santiossae treatment is not at all comfortable . I would recommend a smooth sole if you weigh more than normal .
 I agree with `` Fargo Chowder '' -LRB- review from 2007 -RRB- . These were really nice at first , but they trap sweaty foot odor , and about half the nubs have fallen off . Additionally , I get little red spots on the bottom of my feet when I were these -LRB- and not with any of my other sandals -RRB- , which I can only describe as little pinching of the skin .
 Sorry , but these are the most uncomfortable shoes ever to be worn ! They are like walking on needles . The plastic nodes on the sole look intimidating , are intimidating and shoes at the Dollar General are better value . This has to be the first product I ever regret buying online . : -LRB-
 The little plastic ridges fall off . Mine were about 6 months old before they fell off . Find them all over the house and now big holes where they used to be in sandle.Really stupid design .
 Great looking and great feeling sandal . It takes awhile to get used to the massagers . Sadly , the massagers break off within a few weeks . This happened with a similar style sandal from Adidas too . I was hoping that the more expensive Santiossage would not do that . For $ 30 , the sandals should last longer than 2 or 3 weeks .
 I already had a pair of Softwalk 's Jupiter in size 9S in black and loved them . So much so that I ordered a second pair . But when they arrived , the new pair was at least one size wider and at least a half size longer . I could see just by eyeballing them that the shoes were much too wide . And when I held the right shoe up to the right shoe of my old pair of Jupiters , the difference was even more apparent . In addition , the leather in my old pair was shiny outside and soft and lovely on the inside . The new pair was dull , dull , dull ; and I could not tell whether the inside was leather or some sort of leather-look-a-like product . The degradation in materials and quality control between the earlier pair purchased and this one was amazing . So back went the shoes and off went a letter to the shoe manufacturer .
 The vendor did ship the bag in a very timely manner which I give them 110 % kudos for . However , when I received it , I really disliked the color of the bag . I emailed and requested a return authorization . They did n't respond for several -LRB- five -RRB- days , so I emailed them back and they responded after the second request.They emailed me back with a FED EX ground shipping pre-paid label , which I really did n't expect . I thought this was awesome customer service , as I really did expect to pay for the return shipping.Overall , they provided good customer service and sold a nice product . I just wish it would have been a nice chocolate brown color !
 This purse is crap . The leather is awful and feels fake . The lining inside the purse was torn away at the seam when I opened the packaging . It 's quality is so poor , I 'd be embarassed to carry this bag . Do n't waste your money on this one . I would give it zero stars , but this program wo n't allow that as an option .
 This purse is not leather as the ad states . It is very inconveniently designed as well . The large center strap is hindered by the two shoulder straps . My largest dissappointment is the platic fabric the purse is made of .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ...

 I applied a healthy layer of this simple , self-buffing wax until my shoes had a solid gleam , and went to work feeling slick and professional . But when I got home , my shoes looked only slightly less battered than when I set off . I do n't have the world 's most strenuous job -LRB- I teach English -RRB- , and if this stuff ca n't survive three hours of lectures on literature , how can someone doing real back-breaking work expect it to last ? A proper shoe-shine kit , with brushes and rags and polish in a can , costs more money and requires more work , but at least you know your shoes will still shine at the end of the day .
 I suppose you get what you pay for but hope its better than that . Only hopes though .
 To whom it may concern : My shoes look fine . The problem is they are too small . I usually wear a 11 1/2 '' B but I ca n't get these on . Never worn.Question
 I was very excited about finding a large size -LRB- size 19 -RRB- slipper/shoe like this product on Amazon , as they are a rare find for large shoe sizes . So , I ordered it without hesitation.What I had hoped to receive was a pair of shoes that were Men 's Size 19 . What I actually received was a pair of Women 's Size 7-8 . The more I read about the item , the more I realized the ad was mislabeled , and the actual shoes do not come in large sizes.I am awaiting a refund , and very disappointed .
 I had some great Speedo flip flops for well over 5 years , when they finally kicked the bucket I decided I would try Speedo again . These flip flops are not nearly as good . The part going between your toes is thick , so it can get irritating . They are not soft , the bottoms are very hard plastic , which is n't what I was looking for . Its not worth returning them , since few other types are available in my large size , but I would n't recommend this product .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 These shoes are really incredibly stiff and will hurt your feet . The soles mark just about every floor I have walked on . I do n't understand why they have the Tommy Hilfiger label , they feel like cheap shoes you can get at Walmart . If you are still thinking of buying them , they fit true to size .

 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .

 I have always purchased Asics volleyball sneakers in the past , and this year was no different . However , I have been unable to break in the Sensei . This sneaker is so uncomfortable . The sneaker digs into the side of my right foot , and I am not the only one that has had this problem . My husband purchased the men 's sensei , and I have two other friends that purchased the sensei . All have the same issue with the sneaker digging into the side of the right foot in the same location . I can not believe that I paid over $ 100 for a volleyball sneaker that is so uncomfortable . This shoe is garbage . Do n't waste your money !

 I have heard from friends that these are the most comfortable flip flops on the market and that they are good for walking . I have repeatedly tried to wear them and I find them to be painfully uncomfortable to the point that even wearing them to run out to get the paper is unpleasant . I believe that these shoes are made for people with arches , but I have very flat feet so it feels like something hard is pressing up against the bottom of my foot.I am giving the shoe 2 stars rather than 1 because I have heard so many good things from others .
 These shoes are either made for people with tiny feet or they just run really really narrow and short . I have wide feet and wear most Medium width and a few Wide width footwear but this was way too narrow and short on my feet . Also , these are VERY HARD soled . No cushioning whatsoever . A let-down for me since they came so well-recommended -LRB- see other reviews -RRB- . They did n't come cheap so I 'll have to resell or gift these at some point . Disappointing : - -LRB-
 I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortableand because they looked like they were made of leather.They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and notattractive . They will be returned .
 First of all , they look cheaper than I thought they would look . But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot . In other words , the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot , and caused blisters . I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them , the `` leather '' will soften up and become easier to wear .
 I love Skechers shoes ! I own a pair and wear them most every day ! When I found a great deal on these I was so excited by the price that I ordered a pair right away ! They are pretty but are NOT true to size ! I ALWAYS wear a size 7 - but these fit more like a size 6 ! VERY tight and wasting away in my closet , now . If you purchase these - go a size up - at least !
 The shoe fits great and is comfortable but the interior lining eats through a pair of trouser hose a day .
 Nice for what I needed them for but not a shoe that you will have a long time .
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .

 I love the old Quark Liberty , but this one is so disappointed me , size is too small , the shoe is too narrowed and too tight .

 I purchased these for myself after several family members aid how much they loved their Uggs ! Well The left foot has a large lump in the front part of the slipper that is very irritating ! They are also not wearing very well ! I usually buy Minnetonka slippers and they has always held up so well and been very soft and cozy with no issues . I will go back to my Minnetonka 's after this . :-LRB- These are way overpriced for the quality !
 Bought these for my wife , who , after reading the reviews said `` I am usually an 8 so I 'll go with that . '' Her heel hung over the back and she said they run a size short .
 had to return - I normally wear an 8.5 and Uggs do n't come in half sizes . I ordered a size 9 and it was way , way too big .
 These are not as comfortable as I 'd expect for the price . I 'm not getting the hoopla about Uggs , but thought I 'd try them . Think I 'll buy my totes again this year !
 These are the least comfortable slippers I have ever had . There is no padding in the foot bed and a single skimpy layer of shearling . Also no arch support . They keep my toes warm but that 's it . Now I usually revert to socks and a pair of Birkenstocks instead of wearing these UGG slippers .
 The slippers are not sized correctly - too small.UGG Australia Women 's Scuffette Slippers FootwearBought my wife the product for Christmas and now we have to figure out what to do .
 I thought with a price tag UGG has , it would be pure heaven on my feet . Why is this brand popular ? I suppose over the years they 've slacked on quality . but I 'm generally comparing a pair of sheepskin boots from Chooka I purchased over 7 years ago . Chooka are sturdily made , thick , non-shedding sheepskin , durable soles and withheld inside and outside . The total opposite with the over-hyped UGGs , the soles here are like cardboard , the interior is sparse and overall cheap , poor quality .
 I felt like I was wearing lined shoe boxes instead of cozy boots . Boots had no arch support and were very uncomfortable . I sent them back
 I love uggs , I already had a pair of uggs before purchasing these . However I was displeased with the service and product . I live in VT , and the boots where being shipped from OR . by UPS . Usually what takes 5 to 7 buss . days took 14 . And they were in stock when I ordered them . Next I had ordered the sand colored mini . The color did n't match up to the many different pictures I looked at online . The sole was really dark the trim was white , but the actual boot color was fine . Also the size was way to big . I had ordered the same size as my other pair of uggs that fit great , but these were easily 1 to 2 sizes to big . ? So I sent them back .
 NEED TO EXCHANGE FOR SIZE 10 , WILL NEED TO SEND BACK TO EXCHAGE THEM . SO WILL SEND THEM SO FASTY
 My previous pair of Uggs minis lasted 3 + years until the area around the toes got to be so worn it shredded . I wore them a lot . All the time . Spring , Winter , Fall . I agonized over replacing them when I saw the price went up from $ 90 to $ 134 , but decided with how much use I get from them , it was worth it . I bought the same size I had before -LRB- 6 -RRB- . The new ones -LRB- arrived late October -RRB- were significantly more difficult to pull on . I wore them a bunch -LRB- but not as much as the original pair since they just were n't as easy to pull on -RRB- . They never loosened up and remained difficult to pull on . Once on there was room to move -LRB- so I could have gone 5.5 if they made half sizes -RRB- . They were perfectly comfortable on though , nice and warm as expected . However , at the very start of January -LRB- so just over 2 months into having them -RRB- I pulled them on and they split at the seam -LRB- well , the right one did ... there was little point in pulling on the left one after that -RRB- . As the seam split , the tag poked through from inside the boot
 they fit a bit big so if you are a half size order down instead of up a size . I have to say these are very , very confortable , however if you live in an area with lots of wind or static in the air you are going to hate these . I ca n't even wear them for half an hour without getting progresively stronger zaps when i touch something . I tried 100 % cotton socks , heck i tried no socks , i sprayed static guard inside etc. so now i have an expensive pair of boots sitting in my closet holding down the carpet
 I loved the way these sandals looked so I ordered them right away . Could ` nt wait to get them and was happy when I tried them on . I read the other reviews and decided to order the 8 . I typically wear a 7-7 1/2 . The 8 did fit good -LRB- other reviews wrote that the shoe runs small -RRB- . On better inspection I realized that these sandals are not real leather ! The inside of the top of the sandal even has written `` made in Brazil '' and `` leather upper '' . Soooo not true . I gave this shoe 2 stars because I know that it wo n't stretch and mold to my foot like real leather would . Also I 'm dissapointed because this is blatent false representation of a decent brand . If it 's fake then sell it as a `` faux '' leather . Some people would buy it anyway for the price . But to be decieved is unfair to the consumer . This makes me feel leary . I 'll be sending these back or selling them at a yard sale . Extremely dissapointed !
 i was disappointed on the shoe too heavy and size runs very small plus there is no half sizes offered and amazon wo n't replace with another size so I lose out in 11.00 for postage and got NOTHING ! better off going to the stores in person .
 I was looking for a sneaker with excellent support for impact and a different look . These sneakers feel like they have good shock abaorption but run small . I had to pay to return them , did want to go through the exhange game , and refund not received yet -LRB- about 2-weeks post return date -RRB- . After a month I did receive my refund .
 I purchased these because I love Birkenstocks , but when I received them , I was terribly disappointed ! The piece between the toes is not the nubuck material , but is a very hard plastic piece that was quite uncomfortable . I did not see any hope for them softening up , and promptly sent them back to the company ! The company was great about the return !
 I DID N'T LIKE THIS PAIR OF BOOTS AT ALL SORRY AK . BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THE NINE WEST JAYDON BOOTS NOW THEY ARE SO SEXY . TERRY
 Sole of boot was a slick manmade material making it easy to slip & fall . Should have had rubber with ridges to prevent this
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 I bought these black Nunn Bush shoes to wear mostly for going out to various events . In the past year I have worn there perhaps 6 times for about 4 house at a time . Between wearing they were stored in their shoe box stuffed with paper as they came from the store . Recently when I put them on and started walking , the soles began to deteriorate leaving black marks and small pieces of the heel on my floors . The black marks were like adhesives and could only be removed by scraping . The shoes are totally worthless . Has anyone else seen this problem ?
 I 've had these shoes before but this pair is already worn out . Bad lot or deteriorating quality ? Not sure what to do now about a new pair .
 They are a great fit and comfortable , but the soles are not durable . My husband has been using these shoes just a little over a month and the soles are almost wasted . He does n't even use them everyday . It was disappointing because he likes that brand very much .
 I wore these shoes to my office job and to walk to the bus stop . The soles started cracking after 2 weeks . They took 3 months to break in . And after 9 months the sole started splitting from the leather .
 I have had many pairs of these shoes over the years and have always been happy with them . They are very comfortable but the last two pairs I 've owned have only lasted a few months . They must have change the hardness of the sole to a softer rubber for more cushion . The draw back is the soft sole wears very quickly . I would not recommend these shoes .
 This is a good shoe , but I was shipped the wrong size twice . The web interface is poor , it does not allow the shopper to review the size ordered . The `` Shopping Cart '' reviews the item ordered , but does not repeat the size , so the purchaser ca n't double check the size before paying .
 Fit was excellent . Uppers look nice and leather is good . Laces were a tad too long . My dad wore these for 4 months . He is almost 78 so he does n't run anything into the ground these days but the heels of the shoes did not hold up . They have those hollow pockets in them so they are not solid , long-lasting material . He wore a pair of SAS shoes for 2 years before we decided to retire them ... . The Camerons looked like a good match to the SAS shoe - style-wise but forwear , they did not compare . I got a replacement pair - customer service was good enough to offer that -- but I will never buy another pair . If you wear them inside 90 % of the time on carpet , you 'd probably be just fine with these shoes .
 I am , for the first time ever , amending my review . I ca n't recommend these shoes . I had had them less than a couple of months before they were scuffed so badly that they made me embarrassed to wear them . It 's got something to do with the high-gloss finish . Do n't buy .
 This is the third pair of this exact shoe of this style and size I 've bought but these are different . The left shoe feels like the sole is crooked and they are measurably wider . I could n't be more disappointed . Have to wonder if somebody else made them ???
 I purchased these shoes thinking that I was getting the Nunn Bush Colton shoe and was very disappointed . These shoes run very wide for their size and do not fit good at all . The Colton is a much better shoe in my opinion . I will be giving these to the clothes closet at my church in hopes that someone can wear them . I hate these shoes .
 Bought these in black , size 11W right after Christmas 2011 . Began wearing them to work in January 2012 -LRB- office environment -RRB- . Within 30 days the soles on both shoes began separating from the body of the shoe . After a couple more days the left sole had separated over halfway off the shoe -LRB- felt like I had clown shoes -RRB- . I contacted ShoeMall and they promptly sent a pre-paid shipping label to return for refund ... way to go ShoeMall!I have faithfully purchased Nunn-Bush shoes for years and the last two pair of the Cameron 's I had lasted for about 2 years each . I will try again ... maybe I just got a Friday afternoon special off the assembly line . Hopefully this is not a sign of systemic issues with their overseas manufacturing
 After 3 months the soles on both shoes are cracked and worn showing hollow areas within the sole . I am used to shoes lasting several seasons at least - I wear winter shoes in the winter , replacing them every several years , and the same for summer shoes . I do n't expect shoes to last only 3 months . Overall they are comfortable once one gets used to the `` Comfort Gel '' inserts at the heel . These shoes will be going back to the non-Amazon store where they were purchased .
 I bought these for my husband for Xmas and they are already shot . These are thin , cheaply made sneakers . Not really what I use to think of when I purchase Reebok but I guess they are the brand 's really low end model .
 Along with this shoe came a great deal of discomfort and several trips to the doctor.When the shoes arrived , we noticed that one of them had a fold in the insole . We pulled it back into place and thought no more about it . My husband works on his feet all day . About a month later , he developed a painful keratosis on the bottom of one foot . Being a man , he of course did n't rush off for medical help , but let it grow into something more serious and then found it necessary to make trip after trip to the doctor trying to get rid of it . We should have made the connection , but we did n't because , initially , wearing the shoe was n't uncomfortable and later , attention was focused on the foot problem , itself , rather than the cause . We made the connection when he began wearing a new pair of shoes to work and his foot problem disappeared.This is not a warning about Nunn Bush shoes . Nunn Bush makes GREAT shoes and we will continue to look for that brand when shopping for footwear . We bought this particular pair on sale at a very , very good price from Endless . Later , we found out that Endless sells seconds , ergo , the very , very good price and , consequently , my husband 's foot problems.By all means , buy Nunn Bush shoes , but if you buy them from Endless , look them over very , very carefully .
 I wore this for about 9 months and the inside sole came off . I also rode a motorcycle while wearing this pair and the gear level rip off part of the upper sole . Overall quality is poor but the gel feels nice .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 el articulo llego defectuoso unas de las botas es distinta una tenia la punta de la bota mas gruesa que la otra y se ve que son distinta porque los cordones es uno mas largo que el otro , una estafa total y mi calificaci&oacute;n seria cero
 I am having any luck in buying shoes online . I will go back to buying from the shore where I can fit it on and see it on my foot . It looks good online but looks different when its on my foot . Its OK but I would n't have bought if I was in a store .

 Although the shoes fit as advertised the pair I received was blemished . The black dye on the left shoe -LRB- kiltie and tongue for lack of a better description -RRB- was missing . The area was gray .
 This shoe is great to look at , it has that comfy thick sole and heel that looks stable , solid , and even a little bounc . However the foot bed of this shoe is not formed very well so when ever you walk in them , the back slides up and down with the motion of your foot like a flip flop - annoying . I love this brand but there are always `` heel '' isues with their shoe . I would not recommend this shoe .
 I , I purchased two pairs of these shoes . At first they felt great and looked quite sharp . Nice fit also . However , these shoes have a ring of jell sealed in the heel , it is called `` Comfort gel heel pod for shock absorption '' On one pair of these shoes it poped spreading the sticky jell in the shoe and made it unuseable . I would not get another .
 This is a nice shoe , but it is loose-fitting in the standard size I wear . A slip-on needs a firmer fit in order not to slip on the feet .
 These shoes were almost completely cushion free on the soles.I thought they would be something like their walking shoes as I have a bad back , and bad feet.Unfortunately , these slip on tennis shoes were the first real disappointment I 'd had from Propet .
 I 've tried different insoles in them to make more comfortable and not much luck . Have n't tried cleaning them yet so do n't know how easy that will be
 Absurdly , comically overlarge . My SECOND attempt to buy this shoe , I ordered a full size below my normal one this time as the last try was way too big . It is still nearly an inch too long and yet with a tiny opening for the foot . Unless you have feet like a sparrow and are willing to order 2-3 sizes too small and return a few to guess at what may fit , do n't waste your time . I thought the first time I got a misidentified clown shoe . Now I realize Propet just does n't know how sizes work .
 I ordered these shoes for work beauce of a number of positive reviews I 'd read about them , however , these are not walking shoes ! They make my feet ache just walking to and from the bus stop which is right down the street . They have n't much cushioning , had to buy inserts but in doing so make them extremely tight . The only feature I do like is the easy slide on/off . Do NOT buy these if you do a lot of walking.Still searching for the right shoe . So far , Nike Air Max has provded the best results -LRB- for me -RRB- . Hope this review helps .
 My husband only wears Propets and he has a 15 3E . Normally the Propets are perfect and very comfortable so I decided to buy this pair for him because it looked a little dressier in all black . He got them in and I am not sure if it was a defect on the ones we bought or what but they were super skinny . You could tell just by looking at them that they were way too long and tight . He could hardly fit ! Unfortunately they had to go back , but we bought the Propet Men 's Travel Walker M Casual instead which fit perfect just like the other Propets !
 Do n't buy this show . They look great and they are sturdy but they are not comfortable . In fact they bite you so bad . Bad choice !
 These were advertised for the Big Kid ... but I was sent the Little kid . so I had to return them ... STILL WAITING ON THE REFUND !!! They did look comfortable though .
 When we received the boots we saw that you send the boots smaller than I bought , I bought size 9.5 M and you send 8,5 M , I can not return the boots because we live in other country
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 Loved the look . The arch hit in the wrong place and it was n't comfortable .
 Even though these shoes are described as having `` patent leather upper '' , they do n't . The description of the item mentions `` patent leather '' three times , but it turns out it 's synthetic leather -- better known as plastic . Shoebuy calls this `` Poromeric patent '' , which is not described anywhere on Amazon or their website . I had to contact customer service to find this out.In other words , it 's not leather , even though they say it is.Don ' t be fooled.I was greatly let down by this product .
 As others have pointed out , these are not patent leather . They are patent PVC , which is much less breathable and less comfortable .
 It is not real leather . It is too shine and man-made look . I think both material and look are important . I will pay more for something better .
 The picture associated with these boots shows a rounded toe , when I received the boots the toe was more pointed . I also did not reveive anypaperwork that would able me to return them

 I have these shoes in Purple / Lilac and brown . They are very cute and stylish but unfortunately wearing them from my home to my car was painful enough yet alone walking in them while out and about the first tine I wore them . These are not recommended if you have a lot of walking to do . The style is perfect but not so much for comfort .
 Due to the super fast delivery , I rated excellent but be aware , the shoes are not Aetrex as the ad shows . They appear to be identical but when you take a close look , the brand is Apex , which I have no idea where is coming from . I 've been wearing these shoes since my Podiatric prescribed them to me 4 years ago , and I hope they result with the same quality and benefit to my back injury than the real Aetrex , if not , it is a total ripped off .
 I do n't think these shoes are really birkenstocks . They did n't fit like my others . They were too small and were not near as comfortable .
 This is very hard shoe . It is almost like a wooden Dutch clog . But it has the comfortable Birkenstock footbed and provides foot coverage although i would have and should have gone with the suade ...
 Normally I love ` Boston ' , but these were too small and the footbed was way too hard . I returned them for a mocha suede softbed .
 PRO
 I 've worn the Arizona sandals for many years and have always like the fit . However the same size for this clog did n't fit nearly the same . The ridge that supposed to be sitting behind the toes was placed too far forward . Therefore instead of providing support `` behind '' my toes , now they 're `` under '' my toes . Unlike a sandal you could only push your feet so far forward because of enclosed nature . Other than that the support is almost identical to the Arizona . If you do order this clog and you 're using the Arizona as sizing reference , you may want to try ordering 1 size up . But then again not sure if you will lose the proper arch and heel cup support due to being oversized . Overall , will not recommend . Max 2 stars .
 THE SHOES WHERE USED BOTTOM SOLES ALL SCRATCHED UP BUT THEY FIT GOOD SO I KEPT THEM . ITS HARD FOR ME TO FIND SIZE 14 SO I SOMETIMES COMPROMISE I SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO AN ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT .
 They look great ; but have the slickest soles I have ever come across . I spent the night in the ER the last time I wore them . My ribs still hurt from the fall !
 Have loved their sandals for years so was really excited when they came out with something for the winter . Be careful when you order these , ours stretched almost a whole shoe size , ca n't even keep them on my feet anymore . They do n't stand behind this product the way that they do their sandals . Very disappointing , we will go back to our Uggs .
 I purchased these shoes because I am taking a kiln construction class this semester . The bottom line is that I wanted something to protect my feet from bricks being dropped on them . Rather than go to Wal-Mart and buy a pair of steel toes that screamed `` lumberjack , '' I chose to order these , which I found more stylish and feminine . These arrived today and I will have to send them back . They HAVE NO STEEL TOE as described . I can feel the stiff leather move when I poke it . I am also a little disappointed with the service from Shoebacca . Although the product arrived in a very timely manner -LRB- two business days with standard ground shipping -RRB- , I received no packing sheet , invoice or return instructions in the box with my purchase . I have contacted the seller , and they have agreed to send me return instructions and a return label . The customer service person with whom I dealt was very pleasant and polite .
 I bought these and they are so warm and comfy . If you are a half size , go down .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 I own a few pair , and this is a fake version of the Sperry Top-Sider A/O 2 Eye . For the obvious , you 'd see that there are no logos on the back , left and right sides of the shoes . And that kiddy font on the padding just makes me laugh .
 I 've had many pairs of Sperry Top-Siders over the years and have found them great.This pair however looks good but has some kind of a yellowish coating on the sole that makes them slippery on dry floor ; so have n't tried a wet surface . I had such a hard time finding boat shoes in black in my size that I 'm keeping them and just using sandpaper to try and get the coating off , but I wo n't be ordering from here again .
 I love the color of the shoe , but when I took these shoes out of the box , the bottom of these shoes were ROCK HARD . The rubber is supposed to be white , but these were yellow . It seems like these shoes have been sitting in a warehouse for ages . I wore these Sperrys out for the first time and I fell . They were so slippery and stiff . Pieces of the rubber chipped off when I wore them . The bottom of the shoes were so hard to the point that when I walked they made a LOUD noise . I ca n't even bend my feet when wearing these . Now , after wearing them once for 2 hours , there are cracks ALL OVER the bottom of the rubber . I would not recommend buying from this seller .
 My daughter wears a 9 usually sometimes a 9.5 . These 9s were at least an entire size too big so back they went .
 Sperry Topsiders are the most dangerous shoes that I have ever owned . After one -LRB- 1 -RRB- month , the rubber soles lost their grip and became extremely slippery . They are slippery on teak decks , fiberglass decks , and non-skid decks . They are slippery on ladders with rubber grips and on cabin soles . They are slippery on docks , aluminum ramps , wood porches , grass , concrete , and other ` normal ' surfaces . For one month 's use , these shoes were incredibly expensive -LRB- $ 75 -RRB- . I would never recommend them to anyone . I have long experience with boat shoes -- and after years of using Tretorn canvas sneakers , Sebago Docksides , and WestMarine Docksides , I decided to try the famous Sperry Topsiders . Huge mistake !
 This was my second try with the company . The first pair were too small -- not the company 's problem , but then on this order they sent the wrong color . Also had a problem w the return of the first pair ... but that 's part of another review .
 I bought these shoes expecting them to be quality considering I spent 70 $ + . Yet , I was very unhappy when I opened the box -- the shoes looked worn already.Not good .
 These `` boat '' style shoes are not waterproof though the leather seems to have a water-repellent coating.Why the boat shoes are not waterproof : After about three wearings , the plastic bottoms start to get slightly loose from the leather part in the front.Therefore , if you walk around water or rain , water comes in the front part of the shoe so that the leather footbed under the ball of the foot will be wet . When this occurs , it takes several hours to dry.I have tried the Sperry Authentic Moccasins in both classic white bottom as well as Sahara color and have had the same issue .

 The older Topsiders of were fantastic . They are also great when new.Relying on reviews of very old , and of brand new Top-Siders wo n't get you the information you need.The soles of these shoes are `` made in China '' trash . Mine were completely worn out after 10 wearings , and one sole had a giant crack in the flex area . You will do better buying the fake ones at WongMart than this expensive junk .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 The shoe is so wide my feet slide around in them in a very uncomfortable way . I wore them once and never again . Look elsewhere .
 If you need a truly wide shoe , E or EE , this one wo n't come close . I bought my usual size , 9.5 E , but found the shoe too long and too narrow . Where can I find a true E or a narrow EE ? Ah , Me , the rigors of wide feet ! Hard to rate because of the width discrepancy , but appears to be well made . Let 's hope that it 's an easy return .
 I was really excited to find a narrow shoe that was n't totally ugly . Unfortunately , these narrow shows are REALLY narrow . Also , more pointed than I thought they would be , had to send them back . To be fair , the cushioning seems really nice .
 I wanted a casual shoe to wear with jeans . When I put these shoes on , I felt the heal coverage was too low . They felt like they were slipping off my foot .
 This shoe fits about 1/2 size too large . Had to return for a smaller size and even it is not comfortable . Would return for a refund but company does not include return labels like every other company from which I have purchased . Will not buy from this company again .
 I have big , narrow feet . I ordered the right size , but these just did n't fit . I returned them and did n't get my money back . I 'm ticked at Clark.Don ' t buy stuff from Clark .
 The shoes were a little small but true to size -LRB- my own fault got half size too small -RRB- . They are unique which is cool but the front of the shoe appears long and just did n't have the look I wanted . Very comfortable , loved how the inside shoe bed was all bubbly and very cushioned.SELLER REVIEW - In short , find these shoes from another seller.Tried to follow their instructions but my order number is not recognized . Seller included instructions with the product on how to return IF purchased on their various websites but these instructions DO NOT apply for purchases on Amazon . I have contacted the seller through Amazon and am waiting for them to approve me to return ! What 's that ? While waiting I decided to check them out on BBB . I 'm nervous to say the least . They can only say `` I can assure you this was not intentional and a very unusual situation '' so many times before it gets old . If you keep reading the complaints there are many reoccurring issues this company has clearly yet to fix . I would check another seller if you want these shoes and avoid the hassle of having to deal with their `` customer service '' and I use that term loosely . Do n't take my word , check them on the Better Business Bureau and have a look at complaints and customer reviews . -LSB- ... -RSB- So many people ... had I checked first I would have never made the purchase to begin with . Love Amazon but not all sellers on their site offer as great of service as they do . I am however , very pleased with Amazon .
 Understandably a pair of Wolverine boots for 1.50 seems too good to be true , and 99 times out of 100 it is . This is probably the 10th time an item has been falsely advertised . I have purchased a $ 100 DVR watch for $ 5 that was a promotion . All I knew was it shows the boots picture and describes it as such . This company does n't answer emails and I would n't touch their stuff again . Waste of time and money

 Bought for my husband . He 's not a complainer at all . He absolutely can not wear these shoes . In all our years this is the only pair of shoes I 've seen him give up on . He tried valiantly to break them in but they just hurt .
 While the styling on the Merge shoe is current , the quality is questionable . In the last few years , Kenneth Cole began manufacturing shoes in China . Consequently , the quality quality of materials and construction have degraded.When worn periodically -LRB- evenings/weekends -RRB- , these shoes should last 12 to 18 months . When worn on a daily basis , I doubt they will longer than 6 months . Eventually , the inexpensive leather cracks and the sole wears.However , I just purchased my second pair of these shoes . They are a bit expensive for low quality shoes , but I need the extended size and appreciate the styling.UPDATE
 I was pretty happy with the design and comfort of these shoes . However , the leather started falling apart on me after < 1 month . As a result of this and other expereiences , I 've taken to only buying Kenneth Cole shoes when they are on sale for cheap -LRB- because they really have not been lasting very long for me -RRB- . I figure if I can get them for ~ $ 70/pair , and they only last for 4 months , it 's a bit like getting $ 200 shoes that last for a year.When Kenneth Cole improves the durability of their shoes , they will end up doing a lot better for themselves .
 I have been buying Kenneth Cole shoes for over 8 years never had an issue with them . So this year when looking for the shoes I have been buying I found they do not make them anymore . So I purched the Merge shoes . Having worn them 4 times they are alreay falling apart . The black finish is flaking off . The sole is comming apart as well . I would suggest looking for another product . I think my days of Kenneth Cole shoes has come to an end .
 I love the Kenneth Cole brand , but I had a HORRIBLE experience with these shoes . The shoes were constantly rubbing my feet the wrong way -LRB- despite being the proper size -RRB- and left my feet extremely uncomfortable . I returned these and got a pair of Kenneth Cole Reaction Shoes , Strong Force Moc Toe Oxfords - these shoes were like walking on a CLOUD ... GREAT , comfortable shoe .
 I was happy from the design of the shoe , but in less than 2 month the shoe starts opening from the side and I could n't wear it . It is the second pair in a row . I return the first and got a new one , but again it happened . So if it is not really for cheap , you just waste your money .
 never worn them returned them , but these are very shiny , they look like the rental shoes you would wear with a tux ... the pictures are very misleading ...
 the size is more than usual , and deformed the top of the shoe , with only 2 days of use , expecting more of the brand

 This is a very attractive shoe , but note that , contrary to the product description , as I write this review , the shoe upper is not leather as stated but `` 100 % synthetic '' . I do not think this will last as well as leather , so I do not believe this is good value for the price.You will note that I am an Amazon verified purchaser , so any coxcomb who disputes my experience without purchasing the shoe should be treated with the contempt they deserve .
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .

 not particularly comfortable . Worse problem is the toe/sole pealed open after less than two months of light usage . I would buy another Reebok . This is a sad offering compared to 25 years ago quality .
 I had to wear a `` B '' width as a child but as an adult have been wearing a medium , or `` D '' width , comfortably . I decided to try the New Balance because they were more affordable than the P W Minors I have worn for years . When these arrived I found I could not get them on because they were so narrow . I was very disappointed to not be able to even try these shoes and had to return them . I think it should be noted in the description of these shoes that they are narrow and need to be compensated for when ordering sizes .
 I own four pairs of size 10 1/2 shoes - they all fit fine.So , I ordered these in size 10 1/2 - they should all be the same , correct ? Wrong . These are the equivalent of a size 8 or 9 at the most . I ca n't even fit my foot in them . They are clearly made in China or somewhere that Americans are mysterious giants ... If you buy these , make sure you order something 2 to 3 times the size !
 What ever you do do n't order shoes from ShopWSS in Los Angeles - they will not give or accept shoes returned after two months . These shoes did not stand up to normal wear . I talked to one of their order people and they informed me they would not give a credit or accept them back.Not a happy camper .
 These were mismarked . Ordered 7 1/2 and they fit like a 7 . My husband buys at least 10 pairs of these a year and knows how they fit . Wo n't order on line again . Have to find another store so he can go and try them on . Usuallly love amazon but not this time .
 I 've bought these sneakers for about fifteen years . I ca n't find them in local stores any more , so I tried online . The first pair , same size I 've always worn , was way too small and narrow . I returned them and tried two sizes bigger and wide . That pair is equally bad , ill-fitting and uncomfortable . I conclude that Reebok is no longer making good shoes .
 I have bought Reebok classic for few years because of the comfort . These were more narrow then pumas out of the box . Looked good like always but very uncomfortable . Worn them for a week and still narrow .
 Did n't fit , went back . The black ones fit , though . Only buy shoes in person . This will learn me ! Try 'em on first .
 I like this model of Reeboks and am still wearing my older pair to work outside etc.When I received this new pair they looked like they came from a discount chain . I was expectingall leather uppers . These are very little leather and mostly man made materials . To mysurprise ! They were made in Vietnam where I guess they can be made cheaper . Whathappen to quality 1st Reebok ?? Very Dissapointed and will never buy again ! Waste of money .
 Why in the world would guys send me two different leg ... the right leg of the shoe is smaller than the left . I ca n't wear the shoe for a long . I 'd stained it before I realized that its too small . I would love to return this shoes ... but I ca n't because I stained it ... terrible service .
 I ordered these 1/2 size too big to ensure they would fit and with no return . They seem to be the right size , but there is a defect ofmr something in the way they are made . They really hurt my feet when I wear them . I went to a rebok outlet and tried some that were just fine . Better luck next time
 This shoe looks to be of a great quality but , it is to narrow , i am 45 years old i wear a 10 . I checked the length with my foot it was correct but thee shoe is to tight . The only reason i gave it one star was because when someone see a one star rating they will read it . The shoe looks and feels strong but it is to narrow . OUCH !!! I will buy back one 10.5 .
 too narrow 2 narrow return was easy enough but there were no wide sizes to buy so the choice was ' t very good
 bought this shoe a few weeks ago , it finally arrived here in the Bahamas , but it was the wrong size.I wear a size 10.5 and the shoe that i got was about a 9.5 / 10 , although it said 10.5 . i 'm now In the process of ordering a size 11 after i just sold the other ones to a friend.BE CAREFULL !!!!! ORDER A SIZE BIGGER ...
 When I opened the box , I thought for sure I had received a narrow size by mistake . After examining them , they only had a `` 12 '' on the shoe and the box with no width designation , so I assume they are considered `` medium '' , but let me tell you , they are far from any medium I have worn . This is an obvious reason why one should try shoes on in a store before buying them on the internet - especially if it is something they have n't worn previously , or in a long time.The quality of the shoe is also sub-par in my opinion . On one shoe , the toe upper is sewn crooked and makes a strange folded crease in the leather when I wear it . After wearing New Balance for years , these simply seem cheap - and I do n't just mean inexpensive -LRB- which they are -RRB- . Bottom line for me is ill fitting , uncomfortable and inconsistent quality shoes equal a lesson learned in shoe buying .
 Simply received the wrong size . I 'm not sure who 's at fault , Amazon or Reebok . I 've been wearing this ` Gym Coach ' sneaker for years and always bought it at Modells and always got the same size . The pair Amazon sent was too small . Returned these OK , but who needs the hassle ? Next time I 'll be trying on sneakers before buying .
 I ordered size 10 1/2 shoes . They came in a box that said 10 1/2 but the shoes inside were size 10 . They were a gift so by the time they were given it was too late to return them . The shoes were perfect , only size was wrong . A complete waste of fifty dollars .
 I ordered this product twice ; each time they sent the wrong size . Then they tried to charge me shipping for the return . I will say a phone conversation with Amazon Customer Service later and I think that has been removed . We 'll have to wait and see about that .
 I have been wearing these shoes for years . I really like the classic look and overall make of the shoes . However , the ones that I received from Amazon seem to be made to less standards than others I have bought in stores over the year . Some of the seams look flimsy and in fact are splitting after only a few wears . Also , there was a scuff on the top of the right shoe when I received it . The laziness in me prevented me from returning the shoes , but the quality needs to get better or I will be finding a new go-to shoe in the future .
 I have been a pleased consumer of Reebock tennis shoes for many years . They fit me well and wore reasonably long until I purchased these Club C shoes in February . What I thought was break-in discomfort turned out to be a sizing problem and though they are ordered and marked 11D as I have worn for years , they crushed my toes to the point of a bruise under the large toe nail . They are definitely missized , wrongly marked or whatever . Reebock has lost me as a customer and the replacement New Balance shoes I bought were ordered at size 11D and fit as size 11D just as one should expect to experience . NO MORE REEBOCKS FOR ME ! They apparently can not control their manufacturers quality of the products . They owe me for my pain , suffering and loss of Tennis Pleasure .
 The shoe is looks cheap , anf poor quality , I made mistake of the way picture show , but I received it , that cheap shoe , shoe more like for children .
 The pair I received was running really small or was sized wrong . I have a pair of these in 10 M and they fit great , were very comfy and are worn out . This pair of 10 M was so small , I had to return them and pay return postage .
 I think most people will review items as soon as they arrive . Unfairly giving most items a better rating than they truly deserve . The true test should be after a long use of the item . I purchased these sneakers approximately one year ago . They were quite comfortable at first but wore out very quickly . After wearing them 50 or so times in the last year for just casual day to day use the interior heal began to wear out . A piece of hard plastic began rubbing against my heal making them impossible to wear any further . I expected far more use and comfort out of them . I definitely would NOT recommend these shoes .
 I ordered a half size larger from reading the reviews about the shoew being to small . Could n't even get them on my foot . They are going back .
 These shoes are absolutely adorable , but they hurt ! Not worth what you pay
 This shoe did not fit well . The tongue of the shoe is way too long and hits the top of the foot making it uncomfortable . Again , I did n't appreciate paying the return shipping .
 Initially , they were not very comfortable . After I wore them for a month or so they got broken in and were very comfortable . Just around the time they became comfortable the soles seperated from the body of the shoe . From the looks of things it looks like the soles were just clued on . Maybe it is constructed that way to make it easier to resole . This is the second pair of resolable -LRB- sp -RRB- Mephisto shoes I have had this happen to . Generally speaking I like Mephisto shoes . I especially like the Mobils . I stay away from the ones that can be resoled .
 I initially like this shoe very much ; however , they have begun to squeak constantly within the last ten days . I have exceeded the return period for the shoes . Very disappointing . I 'm wondering if I bought seconds since the shoes sold for 50 % off .
 Understandably a pair of Wolverine boots for 1.50 seems too good to be true , and 99 times out of 100 it is . This is probably the 10th time an item has been falsely advertised . I have purchased a $ 100 DVR watch for $ 5 that was a promotion . All I knew was it shows the boots picture and describes it as such . This company does n't answer emails and I would n't touch their stuff again . Waste of time and money

 The shoes are well fitting and good looking . Major problem is ugly black marks from the soles of the shoes left on hardwood/tile floors which are difficult to remove . I would not have purchased these shoes had I known about this problem ! The manufacturer should correct this .
 I was surprised by the tight fit of this shoe since Softwalk is supposed to be a brand of comfortable walking shoes . I appreciated the quick service of the vendor . Desertrose
 I ordered the wide width in these . Have had to use the shoe stretcher many times , and they are still not right . The leather is stiff and uncomfortable.The shoe is very pretty , but I doubt if I wil ever find them comfortable .
 I though it could be my favorate shoes , but it 's not comfatable for walking even short distance . I just put it away and wear my `` easy spirite '' shoe every day .
 I have been wearing Birkenstock sandals for fourteen years , and have loved every pair that I have purchased . Except these , which I will be returning immediately . I do n't know what the upper portion of the sandals are made of , but it is not leather or suede , or anything that would last as long as I expect my Birkenstocks to last . If these shoes cost $ 25 or $ 30 I could maybe live with this man-made material , but not for $ 65 or more per pair . Please read carefully before you purchase your next pair of Birkenstock sandals , and make sure that they have leather uppers .
 I always wear Birkies . I love them for their comfort as well as their great craftmanship . These Birkies were described as having leather uppers but they were the `` birko-flor '' when I received them . I do n't have objections to this material , but for $ 98 I expect leather . Especially when leather is indicated . I can get the birko-flor cheaper locally.I see that Amazon has changed the description from leather upper to birko-flor . I 'm glad to see that .
 The description clearly said LEATHER uppers , and the photo was of LEATHER , too -- but the ones I got have SYNTHETIC -LRB- i.e. , cheaper quality -RRB- uppers . In looking at comments on other items in this category , apparently Amazon has a HUGE problem with inaccurate description on Birkenstock shoes . They have just one generic description for each style of shoe which specifies composition -- but then they have all sorts of different ones actually for sale in that style . No way at all to tell what you are ordering unless the one you pull up specifically says in its `` size/color title '' , `` Birko-Flor '' or whatever for that item -- but most of them do n't , as they just say the size and color . Amazon needs to quit selling these until it gets it right !!! Free returns , but lots of aggravation , time , effort and disappointment involved . I ca n't get an exchange , of course , because I ca n't trust the description . Very disappointed .
 I 'm sorry , but I wo n't order Birkenstock by mail again . I ordered 37 , which was supposed to be an American size 7 , but I received a size 6 . They are quite too small , but it was not worth the effort to return . I will wear them some in the summer , but , as I said , I will not purchase this way again . The comfort of Birkenstock is missing . Very disappointing .
 Advertised as leather-are not leather . I paid more than other offfers of same sandal because they were adverised as leather and paid for shipping expecting leather uppers . Shipping took longer than advertised and came in a plastic bag , no box to protect during shipping and to store them in .
 This is actually nubuck , even though it 's not described as such . Also , the soft footbed apparently makes the sandal narrower , and consequently , uncomfortable
 I love Birkenstock sandals , but Amazon keeps sending me the soft footbed instead of the original footbed sandal . There is a big difference between the two and I do n't get the support I need with the soft footbed . This has happened three times . It says that it is a soft footbed on the box and on the sandal but it is written in German on the box and I think the shipping clerks ca n't read the German , and do n't realize that they are shipping me the soft footbed . Very frustrating . I had to ship back to Amazon four times . I 've given up .
 The ad did n't state that these Florida Birks were not leather . I love Floridas but need leather to make my feet happy . I spent a miserable hour on the computer , trying to generate the electronic form so that I could return these shoes , but I got stuck in an endless &#34; amazon loop . &#34; Finally , I found the customer service email request for a phone call , which I then quickly received . The amazon representative was very helpful , and I have returned these shoes for a full refund and ordered a pair of leather ones from ebay . The vendors that sell through amazon are usually great , so this experience was an anomaly , but because of the good outcome , I will definitely use amazon again .

 These `` boat '' style shoes are not waterproof though the leather seems to have a water-repellent coating.Why the boat shoes are not waterproof : After about three wearings , the plastic bottoms start to get slightly loose from the leather part in the front.Therefore , if you walk around water or rain , water comes in the front part of the shoe so that the leather footbed under the ball of the foot will be wet . When this occurs , it takes several hours to dry.I have tried the Sperry Authentic Moccasins in both classic white bottom as well as Sahara color and have had the same issue .
 I bought these shoes expecting them to be quality considering I spent 70 $ + . Yet , I was very unhappy when I opened the box -- the shoes looked worn already.Not good .
 Sperry Topsiders are the most dangerous shoes that I have ever owned . After one -LRB- 1 -RRB- month , the rubber soles lost their grip and became extremely slippery . They are slippery on teak decks , fiberglass decks , and non-skid decks . They are slippery on ladders with rubber grips and on cabin soles . They are slippery on docks , aluminum ramps , wood porches , grass , concrete , and other ` normal ' surfaces . For one month 's use , these shoes were incredibly expensive -LRB- $ 75 -RRB- . I would never recommend them to anyone . I have long experience with boat shoes -- and after years of using Tretorn canvas sneakers , Sebago Docksides , and WestMarine Docksides , I decided to try the famous Sperry Topsiders . Huge mistake !
 This was my second try with the company . The first pair were too small -- not the company 's problem , but then on this order they sent the wrong color . Also had a problem w the return of the first pair ... but that 's part of another review .
 My daughter wears a 9 usually sometimes a 9.5 . These 9s were at least an entire size too big so back they went .
 I 've had many pairs of Sperry Top-Siders over the years and have found them great.This pair however looks good but has some kind of a yellowish coating on the sole that makes them slippery on dry floor ; so have n't tried a wet surface . I had such a hard time finding boat shoes in black in my size that I 'm keeping them and just using sandpaper to try and get the coating off , but I wo n't be ordering from here again .
 I love the color of the shoe , but when I took these shoes out of the box , the bottom of these shoes were ROCK HARD . The rubber is supposed to be white , but these were yellow . It seems like these shoes have been sitting in a warehouse for ages . I wore these Sperrys out for the first time and I fell . They were so slippery and stiff . Pieces of the rubber chipped off when I wore them . The bottom of the shoes were so hard to the point that when I walked they made a LOUD noise . I ca n't even bend my feet when wearing these . Now , after wearing them once for 2 hours , there are cracks ALL OVER the bottom of the rubber . I would not recommend buying from this seller .
 I own a few pair , and this is a fake version of the Sperry Top-Sider A/O 2 Eye . For the obvious , you 'd see that there are no logos on the back , left and right sides of the shoes . And that kiddy font on the padding just makes me laugh .
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 I dont understand how fakes could be put up for sale on Amazon , a reputable online shopping platform . I have only worn it twice , and it is already breaking off.I am in my office at this moment , writing this review and am very embarassed because i should n'thave worn it to work . Amazon should ensure quality products , no matter the brand names they sell . I am very disappointed , it is a waste of hard earned dollars and i am definately throwing it away when i get home.TERRIBLE PURCHASE
 nunca me llego mi envio nose que este sucediendo quisiera saber adonde puedo dirigirme para poder solucionar esto porfavor

 I am so disappointed in these shoes . They are cheap , they look cheap , I am begining to wonder if there is any leather in them at all . I have had many a Cole Hann shoes and never in my life have I seen anything like these . Do not buy these if your looking for a good pair of shoes . Will look at some Johnston Murphy 's , something . If I can return , I will .
 I purchased the Florsheim Riley shoe because of it 's contemporary squared look , yet a conservative style and stitch . Comfort was reasonable for shoes in this price range . The laces are a little high , as many shoes of this style are , which required loosening them and using a shoe horn each time , something I have not had to do with previous shoes I 've worn . The inner lining began to wear out after about 6 months of 3-4 times a week wear . No discomfort from it . The leather is a little stiff , which I generally did n't mind until just after 12 months of wear the leather cracked where the shoe creases above the toes and below the laces while walking . The crack grew to over an inch in 2-3 more wears . I 'm not sure if the premature cracking was due to the quality of the shoe or if I needed to take additional care of the shoes . I 've regularly polished the shoes with good paste , not the sponge-on liquid , but perhaps these shoes require leather lotion or something else . My opinion is for a shoe in this price range they should be low maintenance and not require extra lotion and conditioning . Overall rating is 2 because scuffs in the leather often looked like ground hamburger and were much harder to buff as well as the crack in the crease described above .
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 This shoe did not fit well . The tongue of the shoe is way too long and hits the top of the foot making it uncomfortable . Again , I did n't appreciate paying the return shipping .
 Initially , they were not very comfortable . After I wore them for a month or so they got broken in and were very comfortable . Just around the time they became comfortable the soles seperated from the body of the shoe . From the looks of things it looks like the soles were just clued on . Maybe it is constructed that way to make it easier to resole . This is the second pair of resolable -LRB- sp -RRB- Mephisto shoes I have had this happen to . Generally speaking I like Mephisto shoes . I especially like the Mobils . I stay away from the ones that can be resoled .
 I initially like this shoe very much ; however , they have begun to squeak constantly within the last ten days . I have exceeded the return period for the shoes . Very disappointing . I 'm wondering if I bought seconds since the shoes sold for 50 % off .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 My first pair was the best flip flop I ever had . Then I bought a new pair and it caused red marks from rubbing the top of my foot.I could not figure out why the first pair was so good and the 2nd pair so bad . Turns out they shortened the band between the toe by 1/4 inch . Now the top rubs my foot constantly , removing my skin and irritating it.I called Crocs and they measured another 12 or so pairs and they were all 1/4 inch shorter in the band so it was not a defective pair that I had received but a change in the way they make them.So even though there are a ton of 5 star reviews I assume this is for the pair I had originally as I also rated it 5 stars on Crocs Website . Beware on this new cut because it might rub the top of your foot constantly.I have noticed other Crocs products have had the same issue including their flagship sandal . Reviewers have complained that they loved their original pair and then they bought a 2nd pair that was produced in a different country from the 1st pair and they were not comfortable at all because they were sized differently . It seems Crocs has a quality control problem with their manufacturing .
 Loved flip flops and have many , used these lightly one summer and the strap pulled out of the sole ? Company , Shoes.com , returned them to me , stating they could not `` re-sell '' them . Well duh , they were defective . FYI , This is not a stand behind it LLBean type company .
 After I purchased these flip flops , I wore them around the house for about two days . They were comfortable at first then irritation on my upper left foot began and in a few hours the pain became unbearable to wear them . I also purchased a pair of these exact flip flops from Shoe-buy for my wife -LRB- Amazon did not have her size -RRB- and had to return them due to the discomfort felt immediatly upon her trying them on . My advice is try them on in a store first .
 This is my second pair of these flip flops . I loved the first pair , however I made the mistake of going to the beach and then leaving them in my car overnight . One of them shrunk a FULL SIZE ! That is completely unacceptable ! They are now in the trash . I wore them 10 times and they were perfect . My second pair -LRB- 1 year later -RRB- is NOT the same as my first pair . The quality has diminished greatly . They were comfortable while they lasted . Very cheap rubber . I took a picture , but could n't figure out how to upload it . Seeing is really believing !
 I had such high hopes for these , but I was so SORELY mistaken . They are light , not heavy or clunky which was nice but they are in NO WAY shape or form comfortable or at all supportive . Sent them back and bought what I should have gotten in the first place , another pair of SKECHERS Reggae Rasta 's .
 When you use this flip flops it hurts you feet and then you can-t use any flip flop for some days . They have ruin my beach holidays !!
 Preliminarily , I note that never before have I written any review of any product - neither positive nor negative , but Crocs has now given me the incentive to do so.I used to be a fan of Crocs ' flip-flops and sandals , having owned a few pair over the past 4 years . HOWEVER , the new pair of Modi flip-flops that arrived directly from Crocs last week have seriously cutup both of my feet between the 2 large toes , similar to the consequence of wearing $ 2.99 flip-flops . Further , my calls to Crocs to discuss the matter have gone ignored - i.e. , I have called twice and each time was told that only 1 individual within Crocs could deal with this , 2 messages have been left for such person , and still no response . So much for Crocs ' Customer Service . The flip-flops are garbage , as it , it appears , Crocs ' concept of Customer Service . It seems their product , and their company generally , have become a croc of ...
 Crocs do n't come in half sizes , and thats where I had problems with them , I ordered the next size up , mens 8 womens 10 , and they made my feet hurt , were extremely uncomfortable , they kept sliding around on my feet , a smaller size would n't have fit either.I 'll never buy any crocs products again .
 Amazon sent the wrong article : The model that I bought was `` Crocs Unisex Modi Flip Flop ; color
 I was looking forward to these based on other reviews . After wearing for less than a mile stroll down the beach I had a blister on the top of my left foot . due to poor quality control the place the toe thong is glued to the foot straps is miss-aligned making them unwearable .
 I had purchased this sandal August 2011 , because it received such good reviews . My review/update is based on 6 months of use which is mainly at home while taking shower . Over the past couple months , I had noticed that the sole or foot bed of the sandal is getting unglued . I do n't know if this is because I used it in shower or it is due to other issues . But for this problem , the sandals are comfortable . My experience might be of help to others considering my use case.I would have like to attach a photo attachment , if it was possible . I will see if I can do so on the product link page .
 Order it for my man . It is our first Crocs . I order a size larger due to the previous reviews . But I should say I am wrong . I can not compare with other Crocs and never own it before . But compare with the regular shoes , they are true to the size . It is probably because my husband 's foot is narrow . But I do love the quality and price . Since it is a flip anyway , I will keep it.update
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 I own a pair of Softwalk clogs , MERCED size 7 1/2 W . They are the most comfortable pair of clogs I have ever owned . They were made in Brazil . I purchased Softwalk clogs , MADEIRA size 7 1/2 W and they are too small . I had to return them . They were made in China . Beware ! Not all Softwalk clogs are sized the same . Very disappointed with Softwalk .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 shoes are not the same as the picture , chinesse shoes bad quality . . think I lost my money
 I bought this at the store and the quality sucks . The stitching was horrible . After couple of months it came apart and then the whole side on both shoes started to come out and I could n't wear the shoe again . Save your money . This is what happens when you do manufacturing in China . I will never buy anything from Merona again .

 I bought a pair of Justin boots approximately six months ago , although not worn that frequently , the seams joining the front halves of the uppers to the rear are coming apart . Only the pull-on strap stitching is keeping the boots from falling completely apart . Not a very good product and contact with the manufacturer amounted to a `` go away boy , do n't bother us '' response .
 after only 2 months the shoe sole fell apart . Then the stitching on the side of the shoe came loose . I have worn Justin boots for over 25 years -LRB- same type of ropers - different colors -RRB- . I have never had a defective boot like this . I called and e-mailed papa shoe , They said I had to return it to the justin the manufacture . If I would have bought it at Cavenders or Sheplers , They would have exchanged the boot and did the return for me . I called Justin , They told me to mail my boots in to them and it would take up to 6 weeks to get a response . I will not buy from Papa Shoe again .
 First I have a pair of these boots and they are great . The issue is with the provider . The leather was damaged . I was very disappointed that someone did n't check the boots more closely before shipping , especially since it was so close to Christmas and more than likely they knew it was a Christmas gift . It tied up a $ 114 of my money and I had to find another gift and wait on my money from the boots . I understand that things can be damaged , but especially during Christmas , shippers should check things before shipping .
 I can get why the pair I bought are branded Made in China . They are not made of leather , also are not made with the quality expected from a brand as Justin . This Basic 's are BS , nothing else

 These shoes had to be returned for a different size . Loved them but they just did not fit .

 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 these shoes hurt my feet a lot , i thought with the price i put in them they 'd be comfortable . they do look good , like in picture , but they are just not feet-friendly , though i have thin feet .
 This shoes is simple and classic , but it 's way too narrow . I am usually a size 4.5 or 5M and I ordered the 4.5 W knowing that my feet could use wide shoes , but when i got it , the length fits perfectly , but it 's very narrow . I ca n't imagine how the normal width would be if the Wide is so narrow . Unfortunately , I had to return them . they do look pretty tho .
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .
 I bought a pair of Justin boots approximately six months ago , although not worn that frequently , the seams joining the front halves of the uppers to the rear are coming apart . Only the pull-on strap stitching is keeping the boots from falling completely apart . Not a very good product and contact with the manufacturer amounted to a `` go away boy , do n't bother us '' response .
 after only 2 months the shoe sole fell apart . Then the stitching on the side of the shoe came loose . I have worn Justin boots for over 25 years -LRB- same type of ropers - different colors -RRB- . I have never had a defective boot like this . I called and e-mailed papa shoe , They said I had to return it to the justin the manufacture . If I would have bought it at Cavenders or Sheplers , They would have exchanged the boot and did the return for me . I called Justin , They told me to mail my boots in to them and it would take up to 6 weeks to get a response . I will not buy from Papa Shoe again .
 First I have a pair of these boots and they are great . The issue is with the provider . The leather was damaged . I was very disappointed that someone did n't check the boots more closely before shipping , especially since it was so close to Christmas and more than likely they knew it was a Christmas gift . It tied up a $ 114 of my money and I had to find another gift and wait on my money from the boots . I understand that things can be damaged , but especially during Christmas , shippers should check things before shipping .
 I can get why the pair I bought are branded Made in China . They are not made of leather , also are not made with the quality expected from a brand as Justin . This Basic 's are BS , nothing else

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .

 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...

 While the shoes are indeed easy to walk on and they fit well with my wide feet . They do rub on the inner side of my arch and in a short walk will cause blisters on them . Ca n't wear them without socks which defeats the purpose of clogs ...

 I have already a pair of the Havaianas but unfortunately had to return the ones I ordered as they were to big.I had ordered the size I have already but the ones I received were huge ... . however had no problems with Amazon returning them - first class all the time .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 The shoe has quite a bit of heal to it , much more than I 'm used to , so I sent them back . If you like a big heal buy them . They appeared well built .
 Well to be honest This shoes sucks . I bought this shoes and they even did not last 2 months . so whatelse you want to know about these shoes .
 I would never buy these , and you should n't either , because they will ruin your chances with women . No really , please do n't buy these .
 Nice looking shoe , but as of yet I am having a hard time getting them broke in . The soles to me are extremely hard not allowing for a lot of flexibility .
 It could be a mistake for you to buy these.I have owned 8 pairs of Air Nike 's over the last 6 years for daily 4 mile power walks and some running , they were an excellent all around training shoe . But I decided to try these Sketchers based on the mostlygood reviews and only have the Air Nike 's to compare to.For the good ; They look good and look well constructed . They fit well , I have semi wide feet but the reg M wide fitgood . thats it for the goodFor the not so good ; They are advertised as having leather uppers but they are only partially leather -- approximately 40 % vinyland they are made in China . There is little or no arch support , you will need inserts with an arch support tomake up for it . They are not as light as the Air Nike , I would rate these shoes Medium in weight . The soles ofthe shoe have a hard rubber and aggressive tread -- looks like a serrated wash board and they feel likethat when walking . They look like they should provide alot of cushioning but only average at best , Theyfeel hotter than the Nike 's , maybe due to more vinyl material.These shoes feel rough when walking and are definitely not a good running shoe . They actually feelmore like a hiking boot/shoe than a tennis-shoe . -- cant recommend them .
 As other reviewers have stated , the shoes are comfortable but the construction is VERY poor . Within one week of receiving the shoes the protective tip on the toe has already begun separating from the shoe . This detracts from the appearance of the shoe and , if it continues to deteriorate , will make the shoe useless within just a few weeks . Do not waste your money . Buy from someone else who can provide a better quality product for your money .
 The shoe is very comfortable but , overall I think that it is poorly made . I have only had this pair of shoes for 3 months now and already the seams are tearing at the top were it lines up with my ankle , exposing the inside material .
 If you have any trouble with these shoes Sketchers will not stand behind their product . You will not be easily supported nor will you get a replacement/coupon/reimbursement for or towards another pair of shoes . I had a pair of sketchers that started falling apart after a week . The store would not take the worn shoes back and told me to contact Sketchers . So I did , and sent along pictures for their inspection . I was told that I would have to ship them in at my cost , with delivery confirmation because they are not responsible for packages and they would deem them to either be intentionally damaged or a manufacturing defect . Their Customer service reps are rude , and short and offered me no other options .
 Within three days of wearing these shoes the vinylish covering around the collar was wearing away , and after a few months now the collars on both shoes are falling apart . Otherwise they are comfortable and wear well , but these are definitely not going to last as long as the New Balance shoes I had previously been wearing . I have seen this excessive collar wear on another person 's pair , too .
 Sneakers are ok but the tongues four not stay where it belongs . It bunches at the toes . Will not buy again
 bought these shoes out of academy and wore them for about two days and by the end of the second day i could n't walk because they were so uncomfortable warning to all who buy these beware of the pain .
 les informo que aun no he recibido el correo con la notificacion de la compra del producto y tampoco he recibido el producto en mi casillero . quisiera respuesta a cerca de este problema .
 These were the worst fitting shoes I have ever tried . My feet actually hurt after using them for only 1 day at work .
 Due to the super fast delivery , I rated excellent but be aware , the shoes are not Aetrex as the ad shows . They appear to be identical but when you take a close look , the brand is Apex , which I have no idea where is coming from . I 've been wearing these shoes since my Podiatric prescribed them to me 4 years ago , and I hope they result with the same quality and benefit to my back injury than the real Aetrex , if not , it is a total ripped off .
 While the shoes are indeed easy to walk on and they fit well with my wide feet . They do rub on the inner side of my arch and in a short walk will cause blisters on them . Ca n't wear them without socks which defeats the purpose of clogs ...
 Quite narrow shoe for a Ektelon/Prince style.Shoe smaller than expected , had I know I would have bought a size up from my normal 7.5 US -LRB- womens -RRB- size .

 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .
 I should say I did not wear these even once . Looking at the shoes inside the box , they looked more or less like the shoes you 'd find in discount shoe stores . That was enough for me to send them back for a refund .
 I bought this shoe because I thought it had an unique style . I wear a six and this was a little big -LRB- and a little wide -RRB- for my foot . My heel kept slipping out of them and the only thing that helped keep my foot in was the cheap elastic band going across the shoe . The white is more of an off white with a pearl to it and an orange peel texture . I opened the box but was completly underwhelmed . I returned the shoe . IT also was n't comfortable to wear or walk in .
 Always wondered how the pump worked . In these shoes its all or none . Unfortunately the all is way too tight for me . Not a very comfy shoe .
 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .
 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .

 I had to send these back , so ca n't really review the quality of the shoe . It fit really small . I 'm a size 7 almost always , and I think I would have had to go a full size larger . Did n't want to take the chance .
 I wear size 6 shoes and ordered size 7.5 . It turned out too big so I have to returned it . Not working on zumba class if I got smaller size either . It was too slippery on wood floor .
 I got the shoes ok , but I was completely surprised at how they fit ! These shoes felt like a size 6 and they were supposed to be an 8 . I HAD to send them back when my daughter who wears a 7 could n't even get them on !
 I wore these in one Zumba class and they were very uncomfortable and ended up hurting my feet . I do feel that you should just get 1/2 size larger than your normal street shoe , though . I wear a size 9 and got a 10 due to the reviews . Though these fit , I think they should fit a little more snug ; for Zumba , anyway . You do n't want your foot moving around in the shoe . They seemed a little clunky to me too . Kind of like I was wearing a man 's shoe . I returned them and got a pair of Capezio Women 's Web Dansneaker ; and I love them !!
 The arches are mesh and I tore a ligament in my foot doing zumba . The bottons really slide and contort your foot in unnatural ways . Some people have suggested wearing them outside to scuff up so they would n't slide so much . I love zumba , but am out of it for at least 6 weeks . The sizing for me was 1.5 sizes larger than I normally wear , which I learned from feed back and is true .
 it is too much shoe ... very heavy , good support for zumba maybe but not for jazz !! did n't like them at all !!
 Even thought the product description says to order one full size up , I was n't prepared for how narrow this shoe is . I could barely slide my foot into the 9.5 -LRB- I 'm usually a 8.5 M/W -RRB- and could not move my toes . Returning for refund .
 The shoes are not awful , but I would n't buy them again , they crush your toes even when you wear 3 sizes bigger . The design is for people with Hobbit feet ! So if you are a Hobbit , get the shoes .
 I bought these for doing zumba dance classes . They seem like a good shoe but run very small . had a hard time getting the right fit . Definitely order a size up .
 Unfortunately the shoes have some sort of defect issue . Heels have bunched up and daughter can not wear them to wear they are not comfortable .
 These shoes were not flexible enough for Zumba and hurt my feet Going to stick to my Nike cross trainers instead
 Had to send them back because they were way too narrow even though I had worn a different style Capezio Dansneaker -LRB- which they no longer make -RRB- previously that was not too narrow . Susan
 These shoes are very comfortable -LRB- although be sure of sizing . Order 1 - 1.5 greater than you usually wear -RRB- and do have good arch support . HOWEVER , they scuff like crazy . I wore them to my studio once and left black marks all over the floor . Do NOT buy these for studio use unless you plan on scrubbing the floor afterward .
 I purchased these shoes from a Capezio store . I normally wear an 8 1/2 or 9 in street shoes . I got these in a size 10 . Big mistake !! These shoes run very short and I have a narrow to medium foot . The hard rubber at the tip is very uncomfortable if your toe even remotely touches the front of the shoe . I 've worn them several times and am now on Amazon looking for something else .
 First , I normally wear an 8 1/2 M or 9 M. I bought a size 9 M in the shoe . Too short , my toes were begging to be free plus the shoe just felt tight all around . Second , the shoe hurt my instep . I guess due to the lack of support . I did read the other reviews before I purchased them and I planned to buy some kind of sole insert but I just do n't have the heart to put my feet to the test . I never made it to Zumba class with these shoes , in fact I never left the house in these shoes . I liked the idea but I need something a little more sturdy that do n't hurt my feet .
 I purchased these shoes for Zumba dance . I think the shoe would have been fine except there was no indication the sizes run 1/2 to 1 size smaller than you normally wear in a sneaker . I thought I 'd use them for my cardio dance class first , but had to change after only ten minutes . I did n't notice much of an arch support either . Sadly , I had to purchase another pair of shoes and went with my favorite brand -- Ryka !
 I wear a women 's medium width size 9 athetic shoe and ordered this shoe in a women 's 10 1/2 , based on reviews . The shoe is still too short and the toes are extremely narrow . Very uncomfortable ! These shoes are going back .
 This shoe was not the correct size . It was several sizes smaller and I could not even get it on.Because it was sent in separated boxes but part of the same order , I had to pay separate shipping on each item to return and lost my discount for buying and ended up paying over $ 15 for a badly sized product.Very disappointed .
 these dance sneakers look as if someone danced in them and they were packed up and sent to me . the bottom looks like some one walked around in these sneakers . these are for my 10 year old daughter . she dances 5 days a week and she really needs them for a important dance show she has coming . i dont have the time to send this item back cause they wont b sent back in time . but just know im very dissappointed with the condition of this item . i order from this site all the time and i dont appreciate receiving items in this condition .
 I ordered these shoes 2x . I wear an 8 . I ordered an 8.5 - too small . Then a 9 - still too small ! Had to pay return shipping on both and restocking fee . I still dont have shoes that I can wear .
 ok so these shoes felt bulky and hard on the hardwood floor surface , not geat at supporting your weight either , halfway thru zumba i had to take them off and just use my regular sneakers ... my feet hurt even tho they fit me right , for some reason it makes my big toe hurt a lot ... . do not recommend these shoes
 I followed the suggestions from all the other reviews and ordered 7.5 originally -LRB- I usually wear 6.5 for street shoes -RRB- . Unfortunately , that was a little short . So I returned that pair by paying the returning fee , and ordered a 8.0 right away.I was hoping to get a great pair and use that immediately in my Zumba class ! How wrong I was !! They sent me a 8.0 , an used one!I can surely tell it has been used , because the lace was not in its original shape , and they forgot about the spare lace that the 7.5 pair came with!Well , I have to return it again , and I 'm not sure if I should give it another chance.Very unhappy experience.But , the size 8 was fitting me ok .
 I ordered these shoes for zumba and they were tooo slippery on my gym 's hardwood floors . I could n't get any grip on the floor and constantly felt like I was sliding and not able to control it . Also , if you do order ... order 1 1/2 shoe sizes up !! I sent these back and ordered the bloch boost SO528L , which my instructor wears for zumba .
 I bought two different brands of these shoes , the Capezios , through Amazon , are really hard and not comfortable at all . I bought them one and a half size larger than my regular street shoes , and they still felt tiny . I had to return them , doing that I lost the S&H fees , about 10 bucks , but customer service at the store -LRB- Second Skin Shoes -RRB- was excellent , they were very fast and very nice . I would definitely buy from them again , but not this specific pair shoes . I ended up getting Bloch dance shoes that fit perfect !
 I had to return these shoes . There is no cushion at all and using it for Zumba was hard on the bottom of my feet , my ankles and knees . I used inserts for arch support and cushion and it was ok but the way the shoes were made tend to shift my weight forward , causing more pressure on the balls of my feet . It felt un-natural and uncomfortable so I had to return it . For those who needs cushion and arch support , these shoes are not it . Will continue to try other shoes .
 I was very hopeful that I would like these shoes , but I was quite disappointed . I have pretty normal to thin feet and rarely ever have trouble with sizing . I read the other reviews and decided to order a full size up , but that was n't enough . The left shoe fit somewhat but the right shoe was very small . In addition , the soles are seriously hard as rocks . Even if they had have fit , I highly doubt my feet could have handled the unforgiving sole .
 I use these for Zumba . The shoes hurt my toes ! I wear a 10 1/2 , so I got that . But wish I had ordered an 11 . I 'm sure they would be wonderful , it they fit correctly ... I ca n't wear them beyond 30 minutes without my feet aching . Now I do n't even lace them entirely ! I 'm still hoping they 'll `` stretch '' a little .
 Purchased shoes but gave them away . Reviews say buy one size larger and I did but they were still too small . I wear a 9.5 in all shoes except these I needed an 11 so I went with a different style and gave these away .
 After reading the reviews , I bought my 2 yr old a size 5 . Didnt want to get them too big . They are difficult to get on , and I had to cut the elastic . the sole is right , its the mesh around it that is too tight . I like the cheaper Kmart style water shoes MUCH better . and they are half the price !!! dislike !
 These shoes are super cute , and I was excited to get them today ... a few days and we are off to the Bahamas . One problem THEY ARE HUGE !!! My 2 year old son wears an 8 so I ordered the 8/9 . They are a good 2 , 2 1/2 inches too long . Hoping we can do an exchange before we leave .
 The sizing chart indicated that a size 5 Toddler is 4.75 inches long . However , when I ordered these , the 5T size was longer than 6 inches . I had to return the shoe , because it was too big for my toddler.Do not trust the sizing chart on the shoe . The shoe itself looks nice , but unfortunately , I didnt get to try it out on my child .
 I bought two different pairs to see if the first one was defective but its the way the shoe is made . The right shoe will give your child blisters because the inside stitching indents into the left side of the right foot causing the skin to rub against it and causing blisters . Weird how the left side is perfectly fine and doesnt touch the skin !! Do not buy !!!!!
 These shoes are cute and seemed to fit well , but the seam and tag in the insole left blisters on both of my two-year-old 's feet ! I 've returned them and am ordering some from a different brand .
 Got S for my 14 months old , who wears size 5 or 5.5 wide right now and L for my almost 4 year old , who wears 8.5 or 9 . Initially , they were just using the shoes during daycare splash days and the teachers all liked them ... However , when we took them to a water park and experienced them ourselves , we did not like the shoes at all.For my 14 months old , she got a wide feet and we find it very difficult to put the shoes on . Took us a few tries to find ticks to get her feet in without getting her little toe caught and bend backwards , causing her to scream and kick.My 4 year old shoes was easy to put on but it was a little big . Got about 1 finger size room ... After two days at water park , we find both kids got blisters on their right feet -LRB- both right handed kids -RRB- . The blisters are in the arch , which is a odd place to get one.My older one was n't as bad , probably because her shoes was bigger . My 14 months old shoes was a good fit , but her blister was a bad one.I think the shoes are good for 1 to 2 hrs use , maybe to and from the swimming pool but not one that wears while playing in the water .
 The water shoes wore blisters on my daughter 's heels after the first wear . No thanks !
 She has worn water shoes multiple times in the past , these rubbed her poor little feet raw in one day .
 I bought a pair of Justin boots approximately six months ago , although not worn that frequently , the seams joining the front halves of the uppers to the rear are coming apart . Only the pull-on strap stitching is keeping the boots from falling completely apart . Not a very good product and contact with the manufacturer amounted to a `` go away boy , do n't bother us '' response .
 after only 2 months the shoe sole fell apart . Then the stitching on the side of the shoe came loose . I have worn Justin boots for over 25 years -LRB- same type of ropers - different colors -RRB- . I have never had a defective boot like this . I called and e-mailed papa shoe , They said I had to return it to the justin the manufacture . If I would have bought it at Cavenders or Sheplers , They would have exchanged the boot and did the return for me . I called Justin , They told me to mail my boots in to them and it would take up to 6 weeks to get a response . I will not buy from Papa Shoe again .
 First I have a pair of these boots and they are great . The issue is with the provider . The leather was damaged . I was very disappointed that someone did n't check the boots more closely before shipping , especially since it was so close to Christmas and more than likely they knew it was a Christmas gift . It tied up a $ 114 of my money and I had to find another gift and wait on my money from the boots . I understand that things can be damaged , but especially during Christmas , shippers should check things before shipping .
 I can get why the pair I bought are branded Made in China . They are not made of leather , also are not made with the quality expected from a brand as Justin . This Basic 's are BS , nothing else
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 My husband has worn Reebok for years , this shoe not up to the quality of the past.Workmanship was missing on so many levels . These always fit like slippers , not these , even brused his big toe . Very dissapointed .
 This shoe is HORRIBLE !!! I am an avid runner . I have run in just about every brand -LRB- Nike , adidas , Reebok , Asics , etc. . . -RRB- . I am partial to Asics , but like some of the shoes adidas put out in the mid 90 's -LRB- Equipment Ride , SuperNova Cushion -RRB- , so I figured I would give the `` Mega Ride '' a try.After my 3rd time running in the shoes , my arches hurt so bad I could barley walk . I took them to a local running store to ask on of the sales associates -LRB- whom I trust -RRB- about the a3 technology.He informed me that the midsole is PLASTIC ! I figured that it was a new material but would give some type of cushioning , but NO , IT IS PLASTIC ! Basically adidas was looking to knock off Nike 's SHOX technology because it was very successful for the Swoosh.Well adidas , you really screwed up . This shoe is awful . You claim to be so innovative and the best you can come up with is a plastic midsole ? WOW!You commercials claim that `` Impossible Is Nothing ! '' . Well , I guess at adidas , it 's impossible to build a good shoe these days !
 These shoes are very heavy and quite unresponsive . I ca n't really use them for anything else than really slow easy runs . They might be better for hiking than for running , I guess .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 The vendor sent the wrong size and then could not provide the correct size props to Amazon altho it was a bit of a hassle I rec 'd a complete refund
 I ordered these boots in size 12 m regular toe . They came in a box marked 12 m but the boots were 10 m . They did not fit also they had steel toes that I did not want . I do like these boots I have had 4 pairs that I bought from Sears over the years . I thought I would save some money online but it did n't work out . Just a wast of time . I went back to Sears
 I hate the boots ! I purchased a pair for $ 110 in October of 2012 . After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder . Regardless of the floor surface ; carpet , concrete , or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder . It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem . I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $ 15 . Thanksgiving goes by , then Christmas , then New Years with no word about my shoes . Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes . A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland . I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again . I am out $ 125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise .
 I had difficulty rating this , as I am waiting for a replacement . The shoes were of excellent quality , but unfortunately too small . I returned them for replacement , and am still waiting for my replacement pair . Ordering clothes or shoes from overseas is problematic , as sizes differ depending on country of manufacture . If I can get my size I will buy them.If you order from Amazon remember to add in postage to your cost as this can be quite expensive if you live overseas.I live in New Zealand .
 Extremely uncomfortable , never used them . This was the first and last time that I ever bought sneakers online . I learned my lesson - sometimes the old-fashioned way works !
 I am appalled at the quality of these boots . The materials would look cheap next to a $ 20 pair of shoes . Most of the boot is constructed of plastic and some kind of nylon tricot-y cheesy backing . The leather -LRB- which is more likely some kind of leather byproduct like that glued-together stuff -RRB- is paper thin and from looking at where it is seamed appears to be a veneer over some other material . This is the first negative review I 've written , but beware . The box says made in USA , but the boots say made in China . I almost hope they 're really bad knockoffs , because if not this manufacturer has dropped to a truly sad level and is , in fact , deceptive in their description in my opinion .
 Sorry to say , this Shoe Horn did n't work for me . I receive it as a gift , and was so glad to be able to put on shoes with ease . The first time I use it , the `` flex-handle '' came off . Easy to screw back on , but during use , it pops off every single time . For me , I had to order a wooden shoe horn that was solid .
 the flexibility of it makes it very hard to get into the shoe and keep it there
 ... and once that happens , it 's trashed . Three much nicer , sturdier shoehorns are product-linked below ... -LRB- 1 -RRB- 27 '' Teak Shoe Horn -LRB- 2 -RRB- 31 '' Plastic Tortoise & Wood Shaft Shoe Horn -LRB- 3 -RRB- 21 '' Rosewood -LRB- Stain -RRB- Shoe HornI bought this worthless product around town for about 15 smackeroos ... and it sells here on Amaz under about a dozen different `` brand '' names . But the pictures make clear it is the exact same item . The shoehorn itself is physically unbranded , except for a stamp on the thin metal horn that says `` Japan . '' -LRB- So I am posting this same review under the various brand names ... because I 've owned one and they are all ... they are all ... the exact same thing , OK ? -RRB- Anyway , it 's junk , I am telling you not to buy it.Happy hunting .
 Very uncomfortable . The strap near the toes cuts into the feet , and creates severe blisters . Very disappointing .
 The style is cute but the shoe is not at all comfortable if you need to walk around much during the day . It 's a little narrow and pinches on the front sides . I returned these .
 I bought a pair of la gear a few months ago . I have worn them for just about 20 days -LRB- outdoor walking only -RRB- , and they already show cracks near the sole.I am extremely disappointed . I bought them for the name and style , and the price . But even for a low price , the quality is simply unacceptable .
 I hate the boots ! I purchased a pair for $ 110 in October of 2012 . After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder . Regardless of the floor surface ; carpet , concrete , or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder . It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem . I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $ 15 . Thanksgiving goes by , then Christmas , then New Years with no word about my shoes . Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes . A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland . I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again . I am out $ 125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise .
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...

 Bought for my son . Bought size 3 and was too small and are like size 1 . Did n't bother to return .
 The product itself is good however the sizing is quite off . I bought a size 2.5 for my 10 y/o daughter and they were at least one size too small .
 I had these boots for less than a year when the heal cracked at the base of the shoe . I thought these were very stylish , with such a great price . In the end I wish I just spent a little more money and got a quality boot . When I bought these I also purchased 2 other pairs of boots by Rampage and since then I have had the same quality experience
 These boots are not knee length and have no zipper , which made it really hard to put on . I did n't like it at all and ended up returning the item .
 If you are looking for a boot that does n't zip on the side then this is the boot for you . Very hard to get on .
 I usually shop for everything on Amazon , but just got these boots from Macy 's at an online sale that brought down the price temporarily . I am a size 8-8 1/2 so I went a size up to accommodate socks . After trying them on I would say they run slightly big or are very true to size so I should have taken an 8 1/2 instead of 9 but it 's okay . Comfort level seems okay , should handle shopping trips okay . I will however attach heel cushion adhesives to prevent painful rubbing/friction . My main gripe is the boot shaft . For one , the shaft construction looks a bit cheap and sloppy in person . It slouches a lot and does not hold snug to my calf -LRB- i have an average slender calf . -RRB- The height barely passes mid-calf so if you are looking for a knee-length or tall boot this one may disappoint you as well . Overall , if I tried these in a store I probably would not have bought them and would have kept looking for something better .
 LA PERSONA QUE EMPACO MI PEDIDO NO LO HIZO CON UN CRITERIO FORMADO POR CUENTO AL REVISAR MI PAQUETE EL PRODUCTO ME LLEGO UNA BOTA DIFERENTE A LA OTRA , COLOR Y TIPO
 VERY thin and cheap . However , I was n't surprised , given that they were only $ 17.00 . I needed a cheap boot because winter has ruined all of my nice ones , so overall it will get the job done . However , I am going to have to exchange this pair because they have a huge gash in the side of one of the boots . Nice .
 While the shoes are indeed easy to walk on and they fit well with my wide feet . They do rub on the inner side of my arch and in a short walk will cause blisters on them . Ca n't wear them without socks which defeats the purpose of clogs ...
 I am appalled at the quality of these boots . The materials would look cheap next to a $ 20 pair of shoes . Most of the boot is constructed of plastic and some kind of nylon tricot-y cheesy backing . The leather -LRB- which is more likely some kind of leather byproduct like that glued-together stuff -RRB- is paper thin and from looking at where it is seamed appears to be a veneer over some other material . This is the first negative review I 've written , but beware . The box says made in USA , but the boots say made in China . I almost hope they 're really bad knockoffs , because if not this manufacturer has dropped to a truly sad level and is , in fact , deceptive in their description in my opinion .

 Normally 8 or 8.5 fits my feet . But the leather of this shoes is too rough . I first ordered 8.5 and I return it to replace by 9 . Even the size 9 is like a blade in my feet . When walking I feel scratching my feet but it looks very good . Make sure you order one bigger that your size .
 Great looking shoe , but the material at the tip of the shoe is synthetic and the sole is stitched to it . The walking motion of the sole directly contacts the tip and rubs a hole straight through it , exposing the end of your foot . I cant believe these are still on the market . Huge disappointment . Spend the money for something of higher quality because these are extremely cheap made . Not worth $ 25 in my mind . Madden lost a customer for life here !
 These are certainly handsome shoes though there are all kinds of construction issues . Also , do n't get them wet or wear them in winter weather or you will be throwing them out within a week , guarantee . I 'm not sure what they 're made out of , but they end up smelling unholy terrible afterwards . If none of this is enough of a deterrent , I would wear wear these shoes seldom and in dry , warm weather .
 the stitching at the top of the shoe came apart the first time worn . did n't wear until summer so the return period expired . very disappointed .
 These look great and are very comfortable . Having said that , the sole does n't come far enough forward to protect the toe which just happens to scrape the ground with every step . After wearing these maybe 6 times the leather on the toe is almost worn through . I would not buy these again .
 I generally like the shoe . It looks good and is comfortable . However , it is poorly made . The stitching is coming off after four months .
 I bought this shoe from a brick and mortar retailer , not Amazon , so my post may not pass the verified purchase test within Amazon . Irrespective there are good things and bad things about this shoe.The good . Nice leather . Cool Look . Interesting concept in a shoe , only problem is that too much stitching and finished leather like the Uppers are right along the outsole periphery or even the center of the outsole . In anything but the best weather and the smoothest of walking sufaces , this shoe will not last . I need a shoe that will survive the 1 -RRB- walk four miles on a sunny afternoon through the hillsides just because test as well as the 2 -RRB- run across the airport desperately trying to make my connecting flight because American airlines always arrives late into LAX test . On both accounts , this shoe would not cut it . The lateral extensions over the outsole are too exposed to abrasion and ultimate wear . The stitching starts to suffer , and the overall shoe bottom will start to look worse for wear after a few days of walking though some mildly damp streets after a SoCal rainstorm . If the outsoles were 10 % wider on each side , I suspect the shoe would have shown a lot more durability , but it did n't and so the shoe did n't last . Luckily , the brick and mortar retailer did give me a nice coupon towards the purchase of another set of shoes which I used to score some nice Florsheim Oxfords , so I am whole . I wish this shoe had more substance .
 Bought these shoes because I liked the look and needed a new pair of `` driving '' shoes after my last pair wore out after about 2 years of use . I 've had these for about 3 months and they are already falling apart . The rubber on the sole is falling apart , and the leather at the toe is peeling off . I would not recommend these as everyday business casual shoes .
 I have 2 of the exact same pairs of shoes purchased from Macy 's and the pair that I received from Amazon were not only missing insoles and the Steve Madden name anywhere on the shoes , but were fake plastic replicas from China . Completely unacceptable and now have to go through the pain of returning them .
 I have had these shoes for less than three months , and I only have worn them about 20 times in very light wear -LRB- to the store , around the house and such -RRB- . Both shoes are already losing their seams and falling apart . The covering on the leather was so thin it is showing through , and looks like they are three years old , not three months . My wife had ordered these before we read the other reviews , but we decided to give them a try anyway . I wish we had n't . What a hassle ! We are having to return them , and I would never buy another shoe from this maker again . They are garbage . I would have been better off buying some shoe at my local dollar store .
 the only good thing about these shoes is that their comfortable . but beware , they do n't last more than a week or two . the stitching on the bottom of the shoe gets worm out real quick , and then the shoe falls apart . its really not worth the money .
 Bought a pair of these about 5 months ago . Actually bought two ; one brown , one black . I wear the brown a lot more and they go with everything , but after about 2 months the bottoms wear out and fall apart . The bottoms now have holes in them . They shoes were great for a while , now they are going in the trash and will be buying from a different brand .
 I just do n't understand the business logic of manufacturers sometimes . Is it really worth it to save maybe $ 1 a unit and end up with a vastly inferior product?I bought these shoes at Macy 's and they looked amazing . They are a good combination of casual/dress that you can wear them just about anywhere.The problem with these shoes showed up about 2 months later . Apparently to save 15 cents in rubber per shoe , Steve Madden decided it would be a brilliant idea to use a perforated sole and cover the bottom with a thin layer of rubber . This gives the impression that you have 1/3 '' of rubber between your foot and the ground , but actually its 1/3 '' of rubber with a bunch of holes on it covered by a few mm of rubber . Unfortunately for you , that means that after a month or two this thin layer wears off and you start getting holes in the bottom of your shoes!Is rubber really that expensive ? I 'm paying $ 60 - $ 80 for these shoes . Seriously , spend $ 1/unit to make the soles more robust , charge me $ 5/unit more , and end up with a much better product and $ 4 more profit.If you 're interested in this style of Casual/Dress shoes I 'd suggest you check out some Sketchers . Not traditionally what you think of when you think of these kinds of shoes , but I 've had a very similar pair of Sketchers in white that look great for about 2 years now , and they 're still going strong.No more Steve Madden for me !
 The shoe is very handsome . I can tell a lot went into the design except for doing it 's job , i.e. protecting your feet . The shoe has no support and after a few months of normal wear a hole developed in my left toe on the outer leather . Not much longer did the irreplaceable thin leather foot-bed wear down to the rubber sole . If your intention is for the `` sole '' purpose of taking the Maserati out for a spin , then the shoe fits . If you plan on throwing the frisby around to impress the ladies with you mad skills , I suggest you do it barefooted .
 Very bad quality . The thread on side of shoe started tearing off on 1st day . Returned it immediately . Highly discourage any potential buyers .
 I thought these shoes were so adorable ! I usually wear a 7 , 7-1/2 , or 8 so I ordered the 8 first -LRB- so I could wear with a thin sock -RRB- -- way too big . Since half sizes were n't available I thought I would try the 7 next and it was way too small . Waiting anxiously for two shipments and having to process two returns was very frustrating .
 I have to wear a narrow width , and bought two pair of these in narrow , along with other narrow Clarks . I agree that this style runs small , and I , too , would have ordered up 1/2 -1 size if I had known . Both pair gave me blisters .
 Very good stuff . I am very satisfied with this product . I gave it 4 star because I had to buy one size bigger to fit . Thanks to another reviewer for the suggestion . For some reason the scale became one star , which is a mistake .
 this shoe is really not for tennis even this brand is famous . i have never met a leg injury until i wear this shoes , this shoes really bad for protect legs , so you know what i mean ?
 I purchased these shoes to replace a pair I originally bought at Nordstrom -LRB- these were damaged and I had to have another pair -RRB- . The first time I ordered , they were the correct size but they were much longer and did not fit me at all.I ordered another pair in a different color and when they arrived they did not fit properly either -LRB- too long again -RRB- . I thought it would be great to order them online to get a replacement pair since I knew my size , I love the brand and never had a sizing issue with others I have worn.I did not order a 3rd time since both times I ordered they did not fit . It is my opinion that the shoes I received were seconds . Bruno Magli makes wonderful shoes ; great fit and comfortable.I was very disappointed .
 Bought this shoe from Zappo 's abut two years ago ... Love the color ; not very comfortable for walking . Typically Arche shoes are extremely comfortable , but this is the exception . Looks great when you wear it with a summery dress and fling one leg over the other in a lawn chair ...

 I used to buy all-leather , steel toe shoes for work . They were black and un-exciting shoes . I decided to chance the look and I was wrong ! These shoes do not bound very well with work related activities . They are also very slippery on any type of liquid . I was wrong to belive that being called `` athletic '' was just nother name for a shoe . actually I do n't see how anyone could use these shoes for sport

 I had these boots for less than a year when the heal became loose from the base of the shoe . I tried having them repaired and it happened again . I thought these were very stylish , with such a great price . In the end I wish I just spent a little more money and got a quality boot . When I bought these I also purchased 2 other pairs of boots by Rampage and since then I have had the same quality experience
 LOOKS CUTE BUT NOT COMFY I HAVE WIDE FEET I GOT A SIZE BIGGER AND STILL IT WAS NOT COMFY . . DO N'T LIKE IT SORRY
 All boot is made with mademan materials . Then they are not as comfortable as I want . With the same amount you can find a better option .
 Inside of shoe has no soft cushion and very hard on feet . Not comfortable and could not wear them at all !
 While I found these for a rock bottom price ... I will never purchase again . The sole cracked in half and I have only had them 1 year . Considering I only wear them during the winter season not a value for the money . Go figure by the time I finally broke them in to where they were comfortable ...
 These things cut into your foot like crazy . Run , do n't buy . Did n't work for me , I have slender but boney feet and these rubbed so bad

 As I said above
 Shoes did n't look anything like photo . When I received these they were ugly . Nothing but glitter all of the straps . Picture does n't give it any justice . I returned these .
 Do n't get me wrong , these are cute shoe but ... They appear to be solid silver but are actually black with tiny silver -LRB- shiney -RRB- sequins covering straps with black stiching . They are alot more `` formal '' than I originally thought . I bought four pair for my bridesmaids and fortunately it is an evening wedding so they wo n't be too glittery and `` disco ball '' for the occasion .
 Squeaky beyond belief . Had to remove insoles and replace with DR. Scholls insole pads . Not as loud but not pleasent . Will not buy more Clarks !!
 . . because I should be able to give them 0 stars . First of all , I LOVED the style -- the buckles , the heel , the toe -- fantastic . Other than that , these are crap.They were advertised as leather , but are made of incredibly cheap plastic ... it would rip easily . The fabric is cracked & scratchy , & even feels hideously cheap . Not worth what I paid for themThe sole was almost as bad . Cheap , cheap , cheap.And the height -- I ordered these because I thought they were taller than normal boots -- WRONG . Just like the other pair I own , which I was NOT hoping for . Most likely , I should have measured more accurately , because the height is given in the product description.Bottom line
 They are not leather , which for some might be a bonus , but should n't when you consider that is how they were advertised . The feel is cheap and flimsy , the `` weathering '' on the material is laughable . I really wish these were of a good quality , because the design is terrific , but I want at least a little substance with my style.If you are looking for the boots at Milla Jovavich -LRB- Alice -RRB- wore in Resident Evil
 I understood when I bought the boots that they were n't leather but from the picture they look so cool . However , up close they look like they 're painted with swirls to look `` aged '' and feel almost like paper . I would n't wear these unless I was using them for a costume .
 these boots look awesome in the tiny photo , but once I recieved them I was immediately disappointed . The leather is `` weathered '' in a cheap looking way , like someone took a brillo pad and scratched circles into the boot . Also , the fit was bad . They were very uncomfortable , with no traction what so ever on the bottoms . I still like the idea , but these boots just seem cheap .
 Pros
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 Ordered this boot for $ 37 -- great deal on a great boot ! Pity it did n't exist . Seems that `` in stock '' does not mean that Amazon actually has it . 5 stars for Rockport , 1 for Amazon .
 Its been about 2 months since purchasing this boot . The 3rd party vendor had a great price and delivered on time , so 5 stars there.The shoe however get mixed reviews . Being a long time Columbia customer , I was n't surprised by the out of the box quality except that I remember thinking how flimsy the plastic speed lace clips looked ... sure enough one has already broke and I no longer use the speed clip feature , always keeping them laced with fingers crossed on the remaining three . -LRB- As an aside , Columbia customer service also gets a mixed review on this . While the clip would be covered under warranty I still will need to cover the freight one way . While this is the industry standard as pointed out to me by the on line customer rep , I do n't feel I should pay one more cent for an under-engineered fault of Columbia 's . And really , do you want to buy something from a just average company ? -RRB- Otherwise the boots do what I had expected , relatively light weight , waterproof , and comfortable , with just enough flex in the uppers to not chafe yet provide support . Grip is good too on varying surfaces except glare ice . I agree with other reviewers that this is an active wear boot , and would not recommend it for sub zero Fahrenheit temps and long periods of inactivity . And , if you overnight with them , plan on sleeping with them to prevent freezing since the liners are not removable . For my 45 minutes a day walking commute to work and day hikes in the upper Midwest the boot works well.Would I buy them again ? Not without a lot more research for an alternative -LRB- preferably with a metal speed lace clip ! -RRB- .
 The seams between the rubber and the leather started failing the first year . I sewed them up and patched them with ShoeGoo , but then the rubber started cracking in several other places . In total I have three major separations at the seams , and 6 other large cracks in the rubber .
 After wearing only a couple dozen times the rubber started to come apart on these where they are stiched together at the seam between the upper and lower sections . I expect that from a 19 dollar mart-mart boot , not something from Columbia . Disappointing.Columbia also wo n't respond to inquiries about their product . Buy something else made by someone else .
 Worked OK for a few outings , but seams fell apart at the seams after approximately 10 wearings . -LRB- See other reviews for confirmation that this is not an abberation . -RRB- Ridiculous . Will * never * buy a Columbia product again . Period .
 As with others I have had the same problem with the bottom plastic/rubber coming undone from the upper fake leather . Also the plastic/rubber gets stiff in the cold and then cracks in multiple places . Worthless boot made in China for a few dollars and then marked up by Columbia to 75 dollars . Avoid at all costs . Columbia will not fix or replace .
 Purchased in late 2006 to replace a pair of Sorels that I had worn for 8 years for snowplowing , showshoeing and winter hiking . Did not start wearing the Bugabootoos until winter 2007 and was surprised that the seam between leather uppers and rubber boot separated within a few weeks . In 2008 , the seam pulled apart entirely , allowing moisture through . Although I like the boot styling , I expected better from Columbia . This year , I will go back to Sorel for the long term .
 So I spend 75 bucks thinking I 'll get a quality boot . The false security of thinking big bucks means quality . Not so . The boot as designed has a major flaw where the rubber -LRB- plastic -RRB- is stitched to the leather uppers . Just wo n't hold . Also the plastic -LRB- rubber -RRB- cracks and splits . Once that happens the waterproof boot becomes a disaster . Here 's the fact , Jack . If you want a waterproof boot , buy a complete rubberized boot . The galoshes of old . The bastardized approach of leather and rubber means problems down the road , say in 5 weeks.Also I notice they are made in China , probably some big factory that turns out the same bugaboot that costs 20 bucks . Save your bucks and buy the pull on galoshes . Or stay out of the water and wear Timberland leathers .
 I 've given up on Columbia 's boots ... I 've had 3 pairs over the past few years and the rubber part over top of the foot has cracked open on all 3 letting snow/water in . It 's too bad really because otherwise I liked them ... they were warm and comfortable for long winter walks and snowshoeing . Anyway , they get a 2-star rating from me .
 I bought a pair of Bugaboots about 6 years ago and have worn them maybe 10 to 15 times . The boots are barely broke in and when I went to use them recently I pulled the lace right through the D Ring . Upon further examination I noticed that more than half of the D Rings are nearly corroded through , and these boots are barely broken in . Columbia 's warranty department informed that this would be considered normal wear and that they would not be willing to compensate me for the inferior product . I have owned many lower priced boots and have never had an issue even close to this happen to them . I used to think that Columbia was a premium product , and they have always been priced to reflect that , but this situation has completely changed my mind . I would strongly suggest not wasting your money on an overpriced inferior product .
 Third time wearing my Bugabootoo boots , no more than 6miles walked , and already a 3 '' separation between the leather & rubber sections . A tear , really , since this is a split in the rubber along the seam connecting to the uppers
 Used these boots only a few times and stored them properly . Rubber disintegrated during a winter hike when I was 4 miles and 2500 vertical feet from the nearest trail head . Thank goodness I had duct tape ! Could have been a realy bad situation . Columbia unwilling to help . Brand reliability and service is important to me so I guess I will never purchase from them again . Bean and REI are in my future . Their items are quality and service can not be outdone .
 I had owned these boots for about 3 years and wore them in the winter and a couple of times a year when working at work camps in the summer . I had been pretty happy with the boots because they are comfortable and held up pretty well.This past summer , however , one of the seams on the front part of the boot -LRB- just below the bottom left lace -RRB- tore apart . The rest of the boot is in great shape , but I am obviously very disappointed in the workmanship of this boot . That being said , I can not recommend these boots to anyone who intends to keep them for more than 2 years.I sent an email to Columbia customer service with photos of the broken seam to see if they would replace the boot . Stay tuned .
 I purchased these boots to last through Chicago winters . They are relatively light and comfortable , but the contact point between the rubber and leather begins cracking , letting in moisture and hurting one 's foot . For the price , these boots should be durable -- instead they are defective .
 The boot is comfortable in the foot and is warm and waterproof with good traction . However , the upper chafes my legs just above the ankle . I have noticeable abrasions and extreme discomfort . I do n't normally have this problem with boots . I believe that the upper is too rigid . In any event , I can not wear this boot anymore because it is so uncomfortable .
 I should have known not to buy shoes without trying them on . The fit was way off . I 'll never buy shoes online again .

 I have to wear a narrow width , and bought two pair of these in narrow , along with other narrow Clarks . I agree that this style runs small , and I , too , would have ordered up 1/2 -1 size if I had known . Both pair gave me blisters .
 loved the look of these shoes but every time I wear these I have sore toes . The foot slides forward because the straps do n't hold the foot in place .
 I love Aerosoles , but the problem with this particular style is that it looked better on-line . When it arrived it was too mature for me , meaning it would be something my mother in her 50 's would wear . Since I got it for a really good price , I just ended up giving it away to my co-worker .
 I bought these b/c I have a few areosol shoes and they have all been my most comfortable shoes . However , these are not . I have had them a month and they hurt my feet so much . My little two starts to stick out the side and the entire leather is ridged . They have not losened or become `` broken in '' . I would suggest any other heal than this ... unless cute is all you want .
 The style is wonderful , but the shoes were so uncomfortable I had to return them . The slope of the foot is much steeper than it looks in the picture , and your toes are jammed into an amazingly narrow point in the front with all of your weight on them . Also , the strap was very loose . Maybe for someone with a long and very , very thin foot .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .
 I hoped that since this was an expensive shoe , it would be more comfortable than it was .

 With the title of `` Walking Cradle '' I was expecting a comfortable walking sandal . I bought these for my trip to Disney . I could n't wear them more than a short time without them being uncomfortable . No way I could use them for the hours of walking in Disney World as I had hoped . They also squeeked ! Sorry , these are pretty , but definitely not the comfortable walking sandal I was expecting when I purchased .
 This shoe was said to be an 7.5 W but was too narrow to even try on . The manufacturer 's labeling and my expectations were WILDLY different.Worse , the finish on the seam around the throat of the shoe , especially over the toes was actually ragged , with threads coming up before they were even out of the package . Back in the box they go.Big disappointment , as I have a new job and will walk to the train to go to work . I thought these would be great , but they 're not .
 I was sent the wrong size . I had to return these boots . They did not have my size in stock . Awaiting credit back to my card .
 They do n't really look the same in person . They look matte online but they 're shiny like patent . I like the matte look better . Also , I ordered 8M but I was sent 8W so they do n't look as neat on my feet . They 'll have to do ... besides when you are an international customer , returning stuff is just too expensive .

 I was so happy when I found these shoes , they are cute and comfortable , exactly what I was looking for . BUT after about two weeks of wearing them , always with socks or pantyhose , they started to smell terrible . I do n't have this problem with any of my other shoes . This was SO disappointing , I will either try to return them or just trash them .
 Cute shoe , definitely comfortable , but after just a month one of wearing the velcrow -LRB- not sure if I spelled that right -RRB- straps are always coming undone . I do n't know if it 's just cheaply made or what . I do have to use some foot powder or something with this shoe because it does make your feet and the shoes smell ...

 Very good stuff . I am very satisfied with this product . I gave it 4 star because I had to buy one size bigger to fit . Thanks to another reviewer for the suggestion . For some reason the scale became one star , which is a mistake .
 this shoe is really not for tennis even this brand is famous . i have never met a leg injury until i wear this shoes , this shoes really bad for protect legs , so you know what i mean ?
 I was looking for quality slippers , no matter the cost . I bought a pair from H.S. Trask for about $ 150 and used them exclusively indoor . But they did n't last even 3 years , ending up having holes in their leather sole which is way too soft to make it durable . Very unhappy !!!
 A great manufacturer and the world 's leader when it comes to clogs . The reason for my poor review is this particular clog features a heel that is lower than the toe . Granted it 's probably designed to help your posture but I could n't get passed the feeling of falling back out of my shoes . You will also realize how flimsy the leather is on these as well . Sent them back .
 I recently got my first pair of Birkenstocks with the soft footbed . Previously , I only had the original footbed and broke the original in quickly , with no pain at all . I have plantar fasciitis and was excited to try the softbed out and break them in . I had actually gotten sized in a store to ensure the right fit and the softbed was highly encouraged by the salespeople.I know many people love the softbed and I do n't know what the problem is for me . I have been wearing them for a few weeks now and they are painful -LRB- right where the plantars is -RRB- . They are the right size . I obviously ca n't return them but I will be ordering another pair with the original footbed . The price was right for these however.By the way , I know many people dislike Betula by Birkenstock since they do n't use real leather and are supposedly lower end , but I never had a problem with them . They lasted 8 years with no re-soling . I bought them by accident since I wanted a second pair of Bostons and I thought they were the same . No pain at all with my plantars and quick break in period . In fact , they were exactly like the regular footbed Boston Birkenstock and I could n't tell the difference when wearing them or my Bostons.I will update my review in a few months to see if they will break in more and give me the comfort I have come to expect from Birkenstock .
 I have been a consumer of Birkenstock for many years , and this was the first pair that gave me trouble . I ordered the anthracite wool , and was quite displeased to have them break on me only after owning them less than 5 months . I believe this material is too soft , too felt-like , and too pliable . Which is why the band on my shoe broke .
 I 've worn Birkenstocks for years and love them . After wearing this pair for 30 minutes , both shoes developed an annoying squeak . After the 2nd day of embarrasing squeaks with every step , I 'm putting them on the shelf for awhile . I contacted the company and they suggested baby powder or leather conditioner/oil near the straps . I 'll give it a try , but right now , I 'm just extremely disappointed .
 My daughter has been wearing the $ 20 knock offs of this shoe for years . Target , Payless , where ever she can find them . I thought I would do a really nice thing and get her the expensive real deal . She hated them . Too Hard , too big , the toe sticks out etc , etc , etc. . Sorry Birkenstock . Had to send them back . Lost a 10 % restocking fee too .
 Ordered a pair a month ago to be sure to have it in time for Christmas . The status has been listed as waiting to ship since then . I contacted the seller yesterday and they basically said oops - they are out of stock . Plus they claimed to have notified me which is not the case since I have been anxiously waiting their delivery . This supplier is definitely lacking customer service.If you want your shoes delivered , do not order them here .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 This shoe is very comfortable , while it lasts . I have had these maybe three months and the inside started coming apart and there are holes in the bottom of one shoe , and the other shoe is forming holes . Stay away .

 These sandals are extremly uncomfortable . I wear a size 10.5 , but I ordered a size 11 , they were still very narrow and pinched my feet . Also they felt like I was walking on concrete . They are not ajustable and look and feel poorly made . For the same price go with Adidas sandals

 This Hilton model has a light brown sole that makes it to look chepear than it is , and although in photo it looks not bad , directly seen white with that color does not look good . Guess that sole will look better with the Hilton Gold , Brown an that type of colors .
 I too ordered these boots for my daughter for christmas but they are not as shown . There is NO rubber sole ! They will get ruined in no time . Back they go and now I 'm scrambling a week before christmas to find the ones I want . Ugh !
 I realize after getting them in the mail , that the description says soft sole . Duh on my part , but in the picture there is the rubber sole . That made me think I was ordering them with the rubber sole . I will be sending them back to order the mocs with the sole .
 Super disappointed with this company -LRB- shoemart -RRB- . They sent a pair of boots that did not have the rubber sole as depicted . I felt it was a misrepresentation of the product . I tried to exchange them for the ones in the photo but they do n't carry them . I asked to be reimbursed for return shipping because of this but customer service was quite rude . They did not return my calls or appologize for their mistake and would not refund shipping . Bad business in my opinion . I had never had any issues ordering from amazon in the past and this is the first time I have ever written a negative review .
 it looked really good , but felt very uncomfortable . i had to send it back because of it . again , why do you need 16 words ??
 With the title of `` Walking Cradle '' I was expecting a comfortable walking sandal . I bought these for my trip to Disney . I could n't wear them more than a short time without them being uncomfortable . No way I could use them for the hours of walking in Disney World as I had hoped . They also squeeked ! Sorry , these are pretty , but definitely not the comfortable walking sandal I was expecting when I purchased .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I have to wear a narrow width , and bought two pair of these in narrow , along with other narrow Clarks . I agree that this style runs small , and I , too , would have ordered up 1/2 -1 size if I had known . Both pair gave me blisters .
 The first thing I noticed on opening these boots was the smell -- which was bad . Secondly , the boots -- a size 8 for my normally 7 1/2 foot , were way too small . I 'm giving this transaction one star because they arrived on time but returning them cost me another $ 15.00 . I still have n't received confirmation they were refunded . Big sigh .
 upon arrival of the boots i discovered they just did not fit , trying to contact amazon or the seller was one `` wall '' after another , so i had to suck up the cost and now have a closet ornament instead of a pair of boots .
 Definitely not worth it . Not only are these boots incredibly cheap/flimsy , there is some ambiguity about which is the left and which is the right foot . They arrived in a very beat-up , dusty box as if they had been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time . I got them on sale and still think they were way overpriced .
 Though cheap and good for minor costume apparel I found these to be very ill fit and lumpy in the heel area , they do n't fit tight and seem to sag in large clumps in various areas.Still an effective costume however .
 I bought size 8 White PU , and when they arrived in the mail I promptly tried them on . In the foot they fit fine , though a bit snugly , but when I tried to zip them up they were too small ! I have about a 14in calf -- average for women in the US is 13 to 14 inches . One would think that as shoe size goes up the calf size in the boot would be bigger , but according to a rep I emailed all of them are 13-inches around . Also , at least in the model I want , they do n't come in a larger calf size . I will not be ordering from this company again .
 These boots look nice but the zipper did not move easily and the ankle is unbelievably small/tight . I have really skinny ankles and I could barely zip them . When I called customer service the agent went to get a size larger to compare the ankle area -LRB- she wore the same size as me -RRB- and she said she could n't zip them up past her ankle . So unfortunately I have to look elsewhere for gogo boots .
 When I received these boots I thought , `` oh finally ! '' and they fit nicely in the foot but did n't even hold onto the calve , so they rubbed as I moved . Not only that , inside the heel the metal underneath it came THROUGH not even three months after receiving . The shine was n't as it looks in the pictures and the material began to tear on the tips too soon . I 'd suggest moving elsewhere and finding better boots . Metal in the heel for a few hours is nothing I 'd want anyone else to have to suffer .
 I was so excited when these boots arrived on Saturday , but was quickly disappointed when I tried them on . I do not consider my calves to be large -LRB- I am a petite 5 ' 2 '' and size 4/6 -RRB- , yet I could not zip up these boots . They are at least an inch too narrow .
 These shoes are not the quality Italian made Bostonians like the pair I own . In fact , the Italian made Bostonians are the most comfortable dress shoe I 've owned . This model I bought from Amazon is made in China and is of poor quality . Thought I was getting a great deal , but ended up with a shoe that will probably be donated to Goodwill . You have to be careful , apparently many brands are using different materials and manufacturing methods under the same brand name . Amazon does n't state that the shoe is n't the quality Italian shoe the brand is known for .
 These Birkenstock 's in `` N '' are truly narrow . My foot is not wide at all but it was uncomfortably tight so I had to return them . Please be aware of the fact that Virtual Exchanges charges $ 10 restocking fee for all returns . : -LRB-
 These shoes do not have Birkenstock Footbeds , they do not fit like Birkenstocks they are saying they are by Birkenstock and they are NOT !!!!!!!!! do n't be fooledlike I was , Im so dissapointed , they are scammers , pay full price buy the real thing from a real Birkenstock supplier .
 I have other Birkenstock mules , but this pair felt really narrow . I usually wear a 40N , but these were tight and uncomfortable over the top of my foot . I ended up returning them for a refund since they never left the house . As soon as I put them on I knew these were never going to work and `` breaking them in '' was not an option . I had a similar problem with another Birkenstock style and returned them as well .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .
 These sandals are extremly uncomfortable . I wear a size 10.5 , but I ordered a size 11 , they were still very narrow and pinched my feet . Also they felt like I was walking on concrete . They are not ajustable and look and feel poorly made . For the same price go with Adidas sandals
 These shoes are cute but they fell right off my feet ! The elastic back does n't stay on so that with each step they just came off . I ended up returning them .
 I ordered a pair at 6 1/2 WW -LRB- EE -RRB- . For that size and width , according to standard sizing charts , the sole should be 3 3/4 -4 '' wide at the widest . These are 3 1/4 '' . According to standard size charts , that would be a C width at most.It 's really too bad , as these appear to be very attractive boots otherwise . Why bother advertising and supporting widths if your widest size is so narrow .
 I generally wear a 6.5 or 7 in shoes . I ordered these in a size 7 and they were way too big . I did n't exchange them because they are also wayyyyyy too flat , had no arch -LRB- unlike my other flats -RRB- , lacked any type of cushioning whatsoever , and look almost cartoony in person . Sorry to offend those who might like or even own them , but these shoes were definitely not for me .
 These shoes are a pain . They require extreme agility to stuff your foot in the shoe and then , if you should attempt to walk in them , ouch ! They are too tight . Maybe get a size too big . Also , they do n't look very good on . I love Michelle K shoes but these are rejects .
 2 sets of blisters on both feet . The detailing inside causes friction on the heels and the little toes even though they felt fine when I tried them on . I will certainly keep trying different tricks because they look great ! For $ 15 @ Burlington Coat , they are OK .

 I have several pairs of genuine Birkenstock sandals . The Betula sandals are clearly inferior . A light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into.T.H . Grove

 These shoes appear to be yellowing - literally yellowing - on the shelves in stores all over New York City . I do n't know what they made the white part of the soles from , but they should consider changing it because it actually turns yellow with age like the plastic on an old computer , except apparently much much faster.I ca n't speak to their comfort , however , because Amazon/FootLocker sent the wrong size , so I had to return them to a FootLocker that had stopped carrying them .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 The zipper on this boot is very cheap . I had to take my boots to a shoe repair shop to have the zippers replaced because they popped open all the time .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .

 Will be returning these shoes after the holiday season . They are a very narrow fit and they do not stretch .
 They are really rough and the loop from the knot on top really rubs the skin raw . Even if wearing light socks it still is abrasive .
 Recieved these as a gift from my dear mother . My face said thank you , but my mind said da HECK . Copious amounts of gross .

 These are the only running shoes that have continuously given me blisters . Even with good running socks after a couple 10K runs these shoes gave me a blister on my heel . I tried different lacing but it did n't matter . Threw them away . I thought I would buy some cheaper trainers for when I have to run inside on a treadmill . It can get down to around -40 for weeks here and I usually run outside . If you run less than 10K or just walk/slow jog it might not matter .
 So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks ... what a dissapointment . I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect . The inside of the shoe -LRB- like on your right foot , the left side , not the right -RRB- was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area , including smudging on the asics logo . This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged . Also , the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe . Poorly done , last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again .

 I was looking for a comfortable walking shoe that I could take on vacations where I would be walking 8-10 hours per day . I would not be able to walk 2 hours in these shoes . They are not supportive and I would not consider them a comfortable walking shoe . In addition , I am a very consistent medium width and these shoes were very narrow .
 i bought these shoes and they lokked great but the were too small and my toes hung ofver the edge . so if your a size 11 do n't bother . but if your smaller than just order the next size up .
 These shoes were tight , hard and no arch support . After 1 hour I felt like someone had beat the bottoms of my feet with a lead pipe . I had to leave my nephews wedding early my feet hurt so bad . Not only was dancing out of the question , I did n't even want to walk to the rest room . At 40 plus yrs of age when the pain in my feet wins over my need to tinkle ... that 's a miserable shoe !

 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .

 I looked long and hard for a pair of substantial and rugged-looking slip-ons and found these Roper shoes . I normally wear a 7.5 M , but I had to return them for a size 8 . The first pair was too short and too tight , especially around the opening . It felt as if I had a rope around the ankles . The size 8 fit nicely , but the right foot was still a bit uncomfortable around the ankles , and I do n't have unusual or deformed feet . I think they 'll break in before long . These shoes are heavy like boots , handsome-looking , with textured leather . I like them alot even if the footbed can use more cushioning , but some low-profile shoe inserts will fix that . I suggest that if you have meaty feet -LRB- I have bony feet -RRB- that these are not for you because you 'll have trouble getting them on and your ankles will feel constricted even with the padded opening . Other than that , the shoes will stay on securely and not feel like they 're falling off when you 're in motion , which is important if you live in a big city and never know when you 'll need to run for it.Update
 I have been dissapointed in the place I was sent to order these shoes from did not get them and have not been able tofind what happened to the order .

 The vendor sent the wrong size and then could not provide the correct size props to Amazon altho it was a bit of a hassle I rec 'd a complete refund
 the very first time my son wore these for a banquet . They came apart at the bottom . The sole was loose in the heel area . I have never had a problem with anything I got from Amazon before : -LRB-
 This is the first time that I 've had an issue with an Amazon product , and I 've bought plenty from Amazon . This pair of shoes for my son was `` gently used '' . I suspect this was a returned item , but it has definately been worn . Since it did not look too bad , and I did n't have time to return it for another pair , I kept it . I would think that the folks responsible for inspecting returned items would do a better job of checking the merchandise before reselling it .

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I had one of these for about a month before it suffered it 's first structural failure . It developed a slight bend right where your heel goes ... and that got bigger and bigger until it simply folded to a 90 degree angle ... So i thought i could pull the handle off and use the other end . . Nope ... It 's not finished the same under the handle , it 's sharp.I would recommend a sturdier shoe horn if you are going to put any weight on this thing ...
 Bought the Springboost B-Train on Sept 30th 2009 , when it arrived i check thru the box . . A `` manual '' 3 pairs of sole and the shoe itself . Everything seems ok , Used Dorsi 1 for 3 weeks then i moved on to Dorsi 3 sole ... Nearly 4 weeks passed , i decided to take it up another level and put in the Dorsi 5 sole . Right sole fit the shoe perfectly , had trouble with left sole.The left Dorsi sole just could not fit right , then i check under the sole . I saw there was a size marking . To my horror , all the other Dorsi sole showed size 8 except for the left dorsi 5 sole . It showed a size 9 . So make sure you check the all sole size when your order arrives . Its too late for me to return it now , so i cut up the left sole to make it fit . Will try contact Springboost to see if the sole can be ordered individually .

 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .

 I generally wear a 6.5 or 7 in shoes . I ordered these in a size 7 and they were way too big . I did n't exchange them because they are also wayyyyyy too flat , had no arch -LRB- unlike my other flats -RRB- , lacked any type of cushioning whatsoever , and look almost cartoony in person . Sorry to offend those who might like or even own them , but these shoes were definitely not for me .

 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .

 I needed a shoe that was good for year round yard work ... easy to put on and take off and easy to clean . In looking at the picture this shoe appearded to fit the bill . When I received them , I was less than impressed . The material quality was poor , the sizing was completely wrong , much too larger . I could not in good conscience recommend these to anyone .

 Comfort
 The shoe itself is very stylish . I thought they were a little narrow and would break in . I was wrong . They are a little tight but more annoying is that they squeak when you walk . It started after 2 weeks of wear .
 My son put them on and complained how much they hurt.Don ' t recommend you even trying them on .

 This is a pretty shoe . Has a very high heel . The toe of the shoe is very narrow and almost pointed . If your toes like to have breathing room , this is the wrong shoe for you .
 colors shown on jasco online are not true to what you get . customer service is horrible .
 This has been a very unpleasant e-commerce buying experience . It has changed my mind about purchasing some items on line . I ordered some Roper boots from Bargain Outfitters . They came in a timely manner , when I tried them on they did not fit me . I decided to send them back immediately and because there was no address other than the one on the box and it was the same on the paper insert that was given to me , that is where I sent it back . I sent it UPS ground and it was delivered the next day . That was 3 weeks ago . I am still waiting for my refund because they are busy and ca n't get around to finding this box and refunding my money . I am wondering if I will ever receive a refund and what my recourse is going to be .
 My son was going between this boot and the same boot with the side zipper for $ 10 less . We decided on this one only to receive it and it has a side zipper although it does n't state it . I can see absolutely no difference between this boot and the less expensive one . When I called he could n't give me a good explanation why . My son does like the boot alot even with the zipper but I feel like I was misled and the customer service person I talked to was less than helpful so with that in mind I will not buy from them again .

 When I ordered these boots I was really excited to find a reasonably priced boot with such good reviews . I ordered my regular size 8 and the boots were way too long and narrow . The boots also arrived scuffed up like they had already been worn . The boots were also cheaply made -LRB- in china -RRB- and the toe was much pointier than appears in the picture . I was very disappointing when I got these boots and promptly returned them.The only thing they might be good for is as dress boots if you have long narrow feet.typical `` made in china '' product
 Unclear on whether I got some semi-defective boots or what , but the toe shape of these boots is just ... strange looking . It kind of bulges in strange places ? I was expecting clean lines , and that was definitely not what I got . I 'm returning them .
 I ordered these boots expecting them to be tan -LRB- like they are in the picture & description -RRB- When I received them I was very annoyed . They are a deep , dark chocolate brown . When I called to tell shoebuy that they were n't the right color , they said sorry the picture is deceiving just return them . NOT happy at all !
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 I 've gone through two pairs of the Adrenaline GTS 6 and loved them . However , the GTS 7 is terrible ! They are way too wide for my feet and I ordered a B. My legs hurt from beginning to end of a dozen runs so I 'm giving up . Since GTS 6 is discontinued , I 'm going to have to go on a quest to find another shoe . Brooks , why must we fix something that is n't broken ?
 I have always bought Mizuno for walking daily about 4 miles . They did n't carry Mizunos anymore so the salesman recommended Brooks . I have now developed a painful corn between my 4th and little toe that he has tried to fix with an insert and tying my shoes tighter . It still hurts after walking on it for a while . Never had the problem with Mizuno . I will be going back to Mizuno .
 I have used several generations of Brooks Adrenaline in 7.5 D . This one does not conform to the conventional measures -LRB- even though the size tag indicates it is -RRB- . My feet hurt and I do not get the proper pronation support I would expect from this model . Otherwise , the service was timely and a good deal . But unless your shoe size is well narrower than a C width , this shoe wo n't cut it for you - you would be better off buying it in the store even if its $ 20 more expensive .
 Seemed like a well made shoe , but way too small-probably need a whole size larger .
 I would not buy this running shoe again , feels like a cheap pair of everyday sneakers
 I always buy the same running shoe - the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 6 . Unfortunately that style has been discontinued so it has been difficult to find . I thought that the GTS 7 would probably be pretty much the same , maybe even better so I decided to try it.It 's not a terrible shoe , but I think the GTS 6 is much better . I do a lot of long runs and the GTS 7 does n't have as much cushioning . It actually feels like the GTS 6 after about 200 miles of running . I think it would probably be better for shorter distances like 2-3 miles or walking .

 Wow , I thought my feet are wide . These shoes are very narrow and I am returning my pairs tomorrow .

 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size .

 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 I purchased these shoes for a Caribbean cruise , hoping they could withstand lots of walking and possibly wet weather . After a day or two of wearing them , my feet were covered with blisters and I could barely stand to put them on my feet ! They were not the best for wet weather either , as it took them a long time to dry , which caused more blisters . I do not recommend this shoe for walking .
 This was my first purchase of work boots via the internet and my decision was ultimately influenced by other reviewers . That was a mistake I will not make again . The product was nothing close to what I expected . I have been in either construction or landscaping for 40 years and more of my life has been spent in work boots than anything else . Most days I wear them dawn past dusk , -LRB- to my wife 's dismay -RRB- , and I 've run the gamut from top-shelf to two pair for fifty-something . These are the first pair that are so heavy , as opposed to solidly built , so confining , as opposed to well-fitted , so awkwardly engineered as opposed to innovative , so uncomfortable as to be unwearable when not necessary . Soles are rigid and smack the ground , the boots are heavy without an obvious reason why , the tongue is padded where the eyelets need come together making them difficult , -LRB- I swear it ! -RRB- , to tie . They are truly sized only if one were to wear dress socks and subsequently in the cold weather they do not allow for any normal hosiery and thereby are n't warm enough to spend the workday outside . I would 've returned them immediately after one wearing if I had n't marred them my first day working with them . The only saving grace is soft supple leather uppers and one successful day being waterproof . Big mistake . I had the choice of so many well-known brands , models and prices that my disappointment is magnified that much more .
 Another product ordered and I receive it in a damaged box and they are not steel-toed as I ordered . . I need steel-toed boots here and soft toes are not acceptable . Since it will cost me more time to fly into a base with a post office and send these back , i will use these as slippers and order boots from another site . If you are going to sell a product ensure you have an adequate Quality Cantrol/Quality assurance Dept.
 When I first tried these on , they seemed roomy , but when I stood up , it was as though there was no foot bed between the bottom sole and the inside covering , which , by the way , was dirty . I tried them outside , since it had just snowed , and the snow caught in the tread and turned to ice , sending me flying . What a disappointment , but , you get what you pay for .
 I returned this ! I did n't even try to use it because it does not look feminine . It fits awkward ... like my feet looks big and weird . I do n't know what exactly is wrong but it just does n't look nice to me . It 's heavy too !

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 there should be some kind of return policy . Or if there is , make the date line more expansive ! Make sure you know your shoe size like the back of your hand because if theses do n't fit , well , you 're screwed !
 the vendor DEFINITELY sent the wrong size and color shoe . after alot of emailing back and forth , they issued a ups return label and i sent back the wrong shoes.too bad . i really wanted those shoes.obviously , i ca n't give them a rating since i received nothing that i could rate .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .
 This is the third pair of Sudini 's I have purchased . The two other pair are mules so I purposely ordered this pair in a wide size . But , when they arrived they were too tight . Therefore , I was not happy with the sizing of this Sudini product . And , I had to pay for the shipping both ways when it really was n't my fault that they were n't sized properly . Needless to say , I ca n't give this product a good rating .

 Though pretty , these flip flops were very poorly made . The sequins started to come off immediately -LRB- some had already come off in the box when it arrived ; a few more showed up on the floor each week . The stem that divides the big toe from the others started to fall apart to the point that the flip flops became completely unusable after 6 months . And this was only with moderate wear , primarily around the house ! Avoid this product !

 I 've had numerous other DOCs , shoes , boots , etc. and never had a problem . I have one pair of boots over 10 years old and they are still going strong.These sandals broke on the very first day I wore them . Do NOT buy . I mailed them back for a refund , but we 'll see how foot locker handles it . I do n't expect much , but who knows .
 This style did not come in my size -LRB- I needed a half size -RRB- and so I can not write a proper review about the product . The shipment however , did arrive on time and in good condition .

 My daughter wears a size 6.5 so that is what I bought and they are waaaaayyyy to big , they probably wo n't fit her for another year or more !
 I own these shoes in red and am very disappointed . The leather is nice and soft , however it is so soft that the shoes give no support on the side and it looks like my feet are double their normal width . The sole does not cover the toe portion -LRB- as many other moccasins do -RRB- and now my bright red shoes have a huge white wear mark across the toe portion -LRB- imagine you were in ballet slippers up on toepoint -- that portion is completely worn -RRB- . I must say - I own several pairs of mocassins but none were such terrible quality . I loved the way these looked that I ordered 5 pairs in various sides and colors and EVERYTHING went back .

 these shoes were really heavy and the sock was very narrow . we were very dissappointed with these shoes so we returned them .
 Bought these for my son because he loved the way they looked online . Once we got them -LRB- fast shipping ! -RRB- he could n't get his foot inside the bootie , it was just extremely too narrow for his foot . We will be returning them .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 Was disappointed with the color of the shoe , because there is a difference between the left and right shoe.At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box.But no , it 's the shade of the leather that is different , left shoe is darker than the right shoe.Being in Singapore , it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement . -LRB- I had the shoe delivered to my Brother-in-law in L.A. , who brought it back to Singapore for me -RRB-
 I love the shoe that I ordered , however the one that Amazon sent me was a different version . I do not like them . I have sent them back for a refund .
 This shoes are el cheapo , to be sure . But , the retail price of 60 bux is completely misleading . To begin , these shoes are constructed poorly . Personally , I wanted a pair of kicks that functioned as sneakers , but had some quirkiness to them so that I could wear them with just about anything . These are not shoes that will replace the comfort of sneakers proper . First off , the leather -LRB- beige or red -RRB- is not reinforced on the interior of the shoe . So basically it 's a single layer of leather without cushioning . As a result , your white socks will turn either beige or red depending on which color you order . Second , the laces are inserted through this cheapo plastic protrusion -LRB- white in color -RRB- that looks like -LRB- and feels like -RRB- it was made from an empty gallon milk container . The only thing decent about this shoe is the rubber sole . But this is not enough to make this shoe function as a legitimate sneaker with comfort . If you really like the style , or if you can appreciate the diadora phenomenon in the late 80 's and want to relive it , then these shoes are probably good for you . The price is certainly decent . But , I suggest going for a pair of old school Saucony Jazz or Asics Tigers which actually do function as good sneakers unlike these Diadora shoes . The old school Adidas are OK , but their prices tend to be inflated for no reason except popularity , which is precisely what we are trying to avoid by buying these types of shoes right ?

 I really dislike these shoes . As with anything made in China , they are inferior - especially in the size department . They hurt my feet ; I am hoping they will loosen up a little so I can wear them for longer periods of time . I thought I was purschasing a product made in Europe where they typically strive for quality instead of quantity . The term `` nordic '' threw me . I have tried to wear clothes and shoes made in China , always with the same disappointments . My suggestion is that you should let people know where the product is made so they can make a more informed decision about their purchase . My bad - I will try to ask more questions next time I purchase .
 I find this shoes to be very uncomfortable but then again I paid less than $ 30 for the pair so I cant complaint .
 Be aware that the inside part of thong is missing . In other words , the top panel of the sandal does not span the foot totally . I thought it looked odd and is n't apparent from the pictures . Also , the stiffness of the leather on the panel dug into the top of my toes .
 I love most Donald Pliner shoes . These were cute in the picture but ugly on the feet and not that comfortable .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 Because I 'm an avid runner that can pretty much use any neutral shoe , thought I would run in this shoe with no problems . I found that the top stitching in the toe-box was weird and pressed up against my foot . Overall they were surprisingly uncomfortable . However , if you are looking for a shoe to just walk around in or do some light exercise , this one seems okay .
 Thought this shoe was attractive when I saw it online , but when I received it I was n't pleased with the look at all . It does n't fit comfortably across the top and so I have n't worn them at all .
 The sole separated from leather of the boot . My beautiful boots are now worthless . Plain and simple . .
 The sole of this shoe -LRB- at least the pair I got -RRB- does not support the foot under the toes - when walking it feels like the toes are actually lower than the ball of the foot . I did n't think much of it until I wore them for a whole day , after which my feet hurt for several days .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 I suppose that it 's inevitable , but I was hoping that the shoes would be the same as I remembered as a kid . They are not . To say the quality is inferior is being kind . The sizes run small as well -LRB- about a half size -RRB- and A * com will charge you shipping to return it .
 I bought the shoe and they are ok but they are NOT Stan Smiths . Just a bland old no name shoe .
 When I ordered the shoes , I thought there would be a screen to change to shoe size or else let me cancel the order . It did not , so I had to return them and have not yet received my refund
 I would rate these a lot higher if I could wear them . I used to wear Stans all the time , when a pair would wear out , I would go to the store and pick up another pair , size 11 1/2 . I did n't have to try them on , just buy them and go . Beware of doing that with these . I got 11 1/2 and they run narrow , the length is ok , but they are narrow , and squeeze my feet . I could wear them , and they might break in , and stretch , but I would bet they would also blow out in short order where the upper connects to the sole.I have tried to contact the sell Midwest Sports , to get the issue resolved , but the email came back , and when I contacted the website , it did n't get answered . This is a buyer beware situation . The look good , but I do n't want to look good and feel terrible . I would not buy these online , go to an old brick and mortar store , and try them on .
 I thought this looked great online and ordered it . It is heinous , looks like it is made of plastic or vinyl . Then I was out the money to return it and had to pay amazon back for the free super saver shipping . There are nicer bags for the money . You can get a bag like this for $ 20 at Target .
 Warning , do not buy these if you have flat feet . The way they designed these shoes causes extreme pain . I bought these for my son who has flat feet . He ca n't wear them more than 10 minutes . A coworker 's son has the same problem . I did a Google search and found more cases of people with flat feet having problems with this shoe . ** UPDATE ** My youngest son 's feet finally grew to the size of these shoes and he started wearing them . He has normal arches and he loved them ! He wore them out actually .
 These shoes are a joke ! My 16 year old son plays varsity for his high school and on 2 Select teams . As it is for everyone , money is tight but , we bought these for him . -LRB- Did not buy from Amazon , purchased locally at a soccer store . -RRB- One of the cleats `` stripped '' in the first 3 weeks making the shoes totally worthless . I contacted Addidas and they have seen no reason to talk to us . Took them back to the store where they were bought and they were going to `` fix '' them . Told them not to bother . We got a different , better pair of shoes and a gift card for the trouble . I do n't care how much my son might believe in another pair of Addidas but , I refuse to buy any of their products ever again because they have NO customer service .

 Maybe because the sizing is over seas , but these shoes were too small for me , not comfortable , I was very disappointed . Returned not exchanged because I would try shoes on first .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .

I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .

 Because I 'm an avid runner that can pretty much use any neutral shoe , thought I would run in this shoe with no problems . I found that the top stitching in the toe-box was weird and pressed up against my foot . Overall they were surprisingly uncomfortable . However , if you are looking for a shoe to just walk around in or do some light exercise , this one seems okay .

 they have black spots on them like they had been sitting where someone was painting and have over spray on them could not find a way to contact seller
 I have worn shetchers for ever but this pair the seam seperated after one day need to send them back
 Based on some of the reviews here and after trying on my size in a different material , I ordered my preferred style from Amazon . I am on my feet anywhere from 10-6 hours a day and needed something that would hold up better than my regular sneakers . After wearing these to work for a few days I began to realize that they completely failed to support my feet eventually leaving me with the early symptoms of plantar fasciitis . I added a highly recommended orthotic and they became more tolerable but now after less than a month , the color is beginning to come off of the toe area . I am not one who is willing to throw out a pair of $ 60 shoes but I am more than willing to ask for a refund . If you are looking for something comfortable that supports your feet for long periods of time I would not recommend these shoes .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 Basically , the steel on the inside is not padded properly to keep it from digging into your toes . These shoes just kill your feet . Probably the worst pair of steel-toed workboots I ever bought . Will never buy shoes again on Amazon . You need to try shoes on before you buy . I 'm disgusted with them and tired of hassling with shipping stuff back . Some purchases work on the web , this is not one of them . Too bad Amazon sells this kind of junk on their website . Lesson learned , you do n't have to tell me twice ...
 I thought perhaps time on the shoe stretcher and leather softening liquid would work on these so I did n't send them back . My efforts at alteration did not work . I have had Propet shoes that did fit - must have been a different last . My foot is short and wide . I bought it in a 6 extra wide . Maybe they will be all right for people who have trouble finding shoes that are narrow enough .
 I knew better than to buy Propet walkers , as previous styles I 've purchased do not run true to size . But a pink sneaker in AAAA width ? I could n't resist . Stupid me . The label says AAAA , but the shoe fits like a AA at best , perhaps even a plain old B/medium width . In the past , I 've had problems with lengths -- a 10 is short , while a 10 1/2 is long . Even with thickly cushioned socks , this shoe is far too wide . And it 's not even that cute . The heel screams `` old lady , '' even in the eyes of my 89-year-old mom . I do n't care for the finish -- it 's not a matte pink but a sparkly one more appropriate for an evening shoe than a sneaker .
 When I ordered this I thought I was ordering the black womens sneaker - however when it arrived it was the mens shoe - be careful to double check and make sure it is the womens shoe . I have the shoe in white and love it - very comfortable

 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 I bought these shoes in a 7 and they were WAY too big and I wear a 7 in everything else . Then I bought a 6.5 and one shoe was still WAY too big and the other was kind of snug ... They looked great but they must be factory rejects at this price ... especially with the horrible sizing ...

 Although they Iook great , I am quite disappointed with these boots . I was not aware of how tiny my legs needed to be in order to be able to zip these boots up . Should have sent them back , but thought I could lose enough weight before I &#34; needed &#34; to wear them ...

 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I would love to write a review however I am still awaiting the arrival of the shoe for a month now . I if I had known that through no fault of my own the shoe would not have been delivered I would not have ordered it . I do not know where the shoe was delivered and I ca n't get a refund or a replacement . HELP
 this shoe was inexpensive for a reason . It 's cheap-looking and does not fit well at all .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 I ordered these shoes for Halloween , ordered a size bigger to make sure they would fit . They did not , still too small . So I go to return the item and I have to email someone for a number and whatnot , while I only have 30 days to return item . I will order my boots from Amazon friendly company now .
 In November I saw this shoe and ordered a 12 EEE and as I indicated I received a Size 12 D shoe in a 12 EEE Box . Thank God they fit my 19 year old son . What is the possibilty that the size available is actually a 12 EEE ?
 I purchased three pairs , one black , one brown and one burgundy . The shoe fits great and is very comfortable , I give it that . But all had the same problems eventually :1 -RRB- The tassles fell off , or at least one of the pair will fall off . This means that either you glue the tassle back on somehow or cut the other ones off . One of the tassles popped off when I was having the shoe shined . This happened on all three pairs . The tassle simply fell off . So one shoe has two , the mate has no tassles . If you happen to lose the tassle then it looks ridiculous .2 -RRB- The leather appears very thin and flimsy and it tears easily , scuffs easily . When this happens you have a shoe that looks like it is falling apart , looks cheap . You can cut off the peeled leather then polish it , but then it does n't polish well . This happens under normal wearing conditions . I am very careful with my shoes so I was a little surprised at this . My other shoes do n't have this problem at all .3 -RRB- The seams appear to be of poor quality . I noticed that some of the seams separate where laced/stitched . There is fraying in places .4 -RRB- The soles are thin and wear through easily . I have worn through one pair so they will need to be re-soled . I am not going to bother though . If you step in water after you 've worn these a few months your socks will get wet . Another reviewer noticed this .5 -RRB- The heels also are not the highest quality , they wear out too easily.All in all , not a good shoe for the price . I am disappointed . And it 's a shame , I have always owned Florsheim shoes and have always associated them with high quality and high price , but at least the price was worth it in the past . I do n't mind paying up for a decent pair of shoes . These shoes look absolutely wonderful when you get them . They are very comfortable . And no , I do not play football in them . I strictly wear them to work and to church . I think someone somewhere skimped on material quality and workmanship quality .
 I 've had this pair of shoes for a few months now . They are nice looking and take polish well for a good shine . However , the pair I received had some loose threads from the top stitching sticking out which required me to trim them back flush . The stitching for the top section also seems to be a bit looser than I would have expected . When wearing them you can see a gap between the top and side section . Might only be 1/16th of an inch but that could have been prevented with a little tighter stitch.Also , the leather sole seems to be a bit thinner than most other leather sole shoes making the feel on the bottom of my foot more of a moccasin feel rather than a fine dress shoe . The sole also does not seem to have been treated to resist water at all . When stepping in any shallow standing water I can feel the cold dampness on the bottom of my foot . Might also be a partial result of the sole thickness or the quality/treatment of the leather.I like the look and comfort of the shoes but I 'd be reluctant to purchase this same pair again and may have to think twice about buying a pair from Florsheim in general out of concern for overall quality across all of their products .

 I agree with the first reviewer , Wendy . I had measured the circumfrance of my calves before purchasing and these were not even close to fitting . Looked nice from what I could tell though .
 Decorative and lightweight . But it 's nothing more than a very large , waterproof gift bag . It 's stiff and crinkly -LRB- and loud -RRB- . For the price , you can find something better as a beach bag .
 This is a huge bag ... but the one they delivered is not the one I ordered . In fact , the pattern I received was not even pictured on the Amazon description . Quality control issues .
 I loved this bag . It was exactly what I wanted ... lightweight , roomy , water resistant . I was so disappointed to realize that after less than a month the material right next to the straps was ripping on three of the four straps ! I was using it as a pool bag so it was packed with several towels , goggles , sunscreen . Nothing heavy that would have stressed the material too much . Returned it for a refund .

 I just realized that high heel shoes with open toe like these ones are not so attractive.On side view , they make your feet look too small -LRB- short -RRB- for the height . It looks funny specially worn with long jeans . . I did n't like it , it 's not my style .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 Cute looking sneaker , interesting design . My daughter did like the look , easy for her to put on but after a week or so the velcro would not stay closed , kept lifting , and we could no longer use the sneaker . Never had this problem with a velcro closure before , was not a problem with fit or width , just the strength of the velcro .

 What a disgrace , these boots are MADE IN CHINA . For the price they are selling for this is ridiculous . Not worth the price for CHINESE MADE COWBOY BOOTS.I JUST BOUGHT A PAIR OF ARIAT SEDONA AND NOTICED THE BALANCE IS MAN-MADE . FURTHERMORE , THESE BOOTS ARE MADE IN CHINA . THEY ARE WORTHLESS . YOU TRY TO PASS THESE BOOTS FOR WESTERN/COWBOY BOOTS BUT THEY ARE WORTHLESS CHINESE BOOTS . WHAT A SHAME . I AM TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT THIS . IT IS NOT WORTH THE $ 140 I PAID .

 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 As stated by another customer , the back inside of the shoe wear out immediately , leaving your heal exposed to a sharp piece of plastic . I previously bought multiple pairs of these from a variety of teams -LRB- for the price -RRB- but in the end , every pair had the same issue . Pointless purchase . .
 Bought these shoes lasted 2 months with minimal wear , the inside plastic piece , wears through bery quickly . Making the shoe uncomfratable to wear
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 This item was not very durable . After only a couple months the suede started to wear and rip open almost like it rotten . Pieces of it tear off easily and I now have big holes . They are also very bulky and heavy for a slipper . Unfortunately its too late for me to return it . I will think twice before ordering this brand again .
 I ordered these shoes for my husband and they run very narrow , he no longer wears them.He now has a new pair from another company for the comfort he needs after a long dayat work . I also ordered a similar pair for myself by Daniel Green , they , too were adisappointment , as well . You will have a problem in cleaning them , too . I did find outhow to clean my Daniel Green 's , but after the shoes were cleaned , they were tighter onmy feet . These were meant as houseshoes or slippers for comfort at home , this did notprove to be the case for me .

 I like Etienne Aigner products , have a pair of boots and wallet I love ... but these shoes started killing my feet after only one hour of wear resulting in painful blisters . I did try these on in a store and liked them , then saw them here on Amazon for about half the retail price . I might take them to the shoe maker to see if they can do something , but I doubt they will ever be wearable . Glad I did not pay full price , especially since it turned out to be a waste of money .
 These boots fell apart the second time I danced in them . The upper separated from the sole . Every time I buy a pair of Pleaser shoes or boots , this seems to happen . On top of that , the toes are extremely narrow and pinchy . I give up on this brand entirely .

 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .

 shoes last about two months before they start to leak , the cheap sole wears away and the cheap leather on top starts to peal away from exposure

 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...

 Not what I expected . Much smaller than it looks and the colour blue is a little different from what you see in the picture . Inside lining looks very cheap !

 The shoes themselves are fine , and they look good . HOWEVER , the first time I tried to wear the shoe , the little metal `` eye '' that goes into the ankle strap hole fell off completely . In my attempt to fix it -LRB- with a knife , really poor choice on my part -RRB- I ended up stabbing myself in the hand 7 days before my pole competition . So . Not . Awesome . But I did end up fixing the shoe . Or so I thought . the night of my competition , the exact same thing happened , to BOTH shoes . Thank the sweet Lord someone happened to have a pair of pliers , so I could fix the shoes . It was an easy fix , but it 's also an easy thing to do correctly when the shoe is made in the first place . This speaks to a lack of quality control during construction , so be aware !
 These shoes are not described as being a wide fit yet are extremely wide where the toe covering is making them dangerous as you slop and slide around in the toe portion of the shoe . If they were too small they could be stretched but being too big is a problem that will cost as much as the shoe to fix - unless of course you actually need a wide fit shoe then this will be ok for you ...
 These shoes do n't come in half sizes . Size 8 usually fits me perfectly in every shoe so I got these in size 8 . The front toe area of the shoe is so wide that my toes hang off the edge of the front of the shoes . Maybe if the toe opening had been a bit more narrow , it might have improved the way they feel on my feet . Size 8 is not exactly big enough and a size 9 would 've been way too huge . A half size probably would 've been perfect in these . The fit is just really awkward . I was looking forward to wearing them out sometime but now I only wear them around the house to amuse my husand because he loves the shoes a lot more than I do Lol .
 I am very disappointed in the shoe itself , and also the seller 's policy . One of the shoes -LRB- right -RRB- fits great and has no issues , but the other -LRB- left -RRB- is totally messed up ! The toe strap is so tight my foot barely makes it in , and there is no way in hell I could use these !!! I wanted to exchange them but the return policy is 30 days , and with my busy lifestyle I was n't able to get them back in time , and now I am stuck with shoes I can do nothing with ! =-LRB- Not happy .

 I am a size 6 , but the shoes feels more like a size 6.5 to possibly 7 .

 The sandals were comfortable , but they did n't last long . I wore them for less than a week before the soles started to come apart .
 This is a terrible sandal . I purchased these to replace a pair of a Reef Smoothy 's , in a slightly different style , that lasted three years and were crazy comfortable . These however are uncomfortable , poorly designed and poorly made . Under the leather strap is a nylon strap which cut into my foot for the few days that I tried to wear these sandals last year . Then , when I took them out again this year , I discovered that the sole was separating . I 've always had good experiences with Reef products until this sandal . Ridiculous .
 Really I disappear with this producto I bought a pair of sandals using my regular size of shoe but , this item is excesively narrow my feet dont enter in that
 The product is NOT as described ... no leather foot bed , size is fine , workmanship appears OK , unworn as of yet ... . the seller or Amazon needs to change product description ... if what i received is what they are Really selling . Disappointed !
 Our order for basic Reef Men 's Sandal was never fulfilled . We never received a status update , even after requesting one . This is NOT a reliable and professional seller/vendor .
 Within about a week , the leather began to delaminate from the sole . Now I have t deal with the amazon return policy . There are other similar reviews . Disappointing that reef des nt deal with this .
 Ordered these about a half size larger than normal based on the reviews seen on this site . The size delivered was correct , but the sandals are extremely narrow , especially since where the bands connect to the base is far in from the side . Also , the bar between the toes was very uncomfortable - but this may be because the overall fit was so poor . Returned , will look elsewhere .

 the adjustability of the shoe depends on being able to apply tension . the first time i wore this shoe the blue hub over the cord came off .
 I personally do not like , as I saw them potresen.Te are some more artificial leather that looks like a raincoat.A customer read above is very happy in Kabul , but I am afraid that if you pull them out of the box to crack the skin , so hurry to sell them to anyone in Kabul who will like them.I thought that SWAT is a proven company and sell only quality goods and are therefore sympathetic to the price , but it turned out that for less money you can not buy quality .
 I 'm disappointed in the footbed of this shoe . I have three other pairs of very comfortable and well made BITE sandals and none of these other shoes have Croc footbeds in them . The Tempo footbed lining has the Crocs label on it and it is much thinner , less padding , slipperier and has less arch support than the other BITE footbeds . I have n't been wearing these Tempo much .

 I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew .
 This came on time but a different color of what I ordered ! I do n`t recommend it !

 Part of the shoe lace wholes in -LRB- lacing them up -RRB- were weak and did n't hold after using them for a month .
 I work in a factory on concrete 8 hours a day , I had a pair of these shoes that were great , wore them every day for work . So decided I would purchase the same one . Found that after wearing the second pair of shoes it would become painful to walk on my right leg , it seems the footbed is uneven . Not uncomfortable wearing around the house but on a long walk it is like my foot uneven and twisting when I walk . I do n't understand it and maybe the next pair would work but will be staying away from these !
 I purchased this item and I must say I am not satisfied . The right foot fits well but the left does not and I experience pain when I start and finish my exercises .

 They arrived with a terrible odor , very heavy dye smell . I could n't have worn these anywhere even if they fit . I let them get air for a week but they still had the heavy dye odor . Also they were an inch and a half too long -LRB- part of that is the style but part is they did n't stay on my feet . -RRB- The vendor graciously accepted them back and I bought another brand -LRB- Bostonian Nasello -RRB- from them . The vendor was Gabriel Shoes in NYC and they had the time to be kind to me even though Sandy had just hit .
 this company inflates the prices artificially and the same boots are available elsewhere for a much cheaper prize
 Seem skids in the water , is ot slip , thats mean that if you are with the humid floor , maybe you will broken head in the floor . For another side , is ok for mountains , only if this last is dry .
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 I looked long and hard for a pair of substantial and rugged-looking slip-ons and found these Roper shoes . I normally wear a 7.5 M , but I had to return them for a size 8 . The first pair was too short and too tight , especially around the opening . It felt as if I had a rope around the ankles . The size 8 fit nicely , but the right foot was still a bit uncomfortable around the ankles , and I do n't have unusual or deformed feet . I think they 'll break in before long . These shoes are heavy like boots , handsome-looking , with textured leather . I like them alot even if the footbed can use more cushioning , but some low-profile shoe inserts will fix that . I suggest that if you have meaty feet -LRB- I have bony feet -RRB- that these are not for you because you 'll have trouble getting them on and your ankles will feel constricted even with the padded opening . Other than that , the shoes will stay on securely and not feel like they 're falling off when you 're in motion , which is important if you live in a big city and never know when you 'll need to run for it.Update
 I have been dissapointed in the place I was sent to order these shoes from did not get them and have not been able tofind what happened to the order .
 This is the 3rd pair of shoes from Charles David that I 've ordered from Amazon . The shoe itself is very attractive and the color very rich , however , if you have low to no arches and narrow heels -- this is not the shoe for you ladies . I have flat feet and always wear heels to cover this , but in this shoe , the strap up the side of my feet and around the heel did not provide any support and the shoe `` gapped . '' I bought specifically to wear with a dress and it did not look good .

 Although they Iook great , I am quite disappointed with these boots . I was not aware of how tiny my legs needed to be in order to be able to zip these boots up . Should have sent them back , but thought I could lose enough weight before I &#34; needed &#34; to wear them ...
 I liked the look of the shoe and I have owned other Bite shoes . This model ran small , so I had to return it .
 nice shoe . A little tight in the width -LRB- the only reason I did n't give it 5 stars -RRB- Very confortable .
 I 've had a pair of Womens Bite Golf Shoes for approx 2 yrs and have only worn them 3 times in the 2 year period . I was playing golf yesterday when I noticed the cleats were disappearing ! Both shoes only the heel cleats left . The cleats just fell off the shoes while I was golfing!It 's a shame as the shoes themselves are comfortable . Now I have golf shoes with no cleats .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 This has been a very unpleasant e-commerce buying experience . It has changed my mind about purchasing some items on line . I ordered some Roper boots from Bargain Outfitters . They came in a timely manner , when I tried them on they did not fit me . I decided to send them back immediately and because there was no address other than the one on the box and it was the same on the paper insert that was given to me , that is where I sent it back . I sent it UPS ground and it was delivered the next day . That was 3 weeks ago . I am still waiting for my refund because they are busy and ca n't get around to finding this box and refunding my money . I am wondering if I will ever receive a refund and what my recourse is going to be .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 This has been a very unpleasant e-commerce buying experience . It has changed my mind about purchasing some items on line . I ordered some Roper boots from Bargain Outfitters . They came in a timely manner , when I tried them on they did not fit me . I decided to send them back immediately and because there was no address other than the one on the box and it was the same on the paper insert that was given to me , that is where I sent it back . I sent it UPS ground and it was delivered the next day . That was 3 weeks ago . I am still waiting for my refund because they are busy and ca n't get around to finding this box and refunding my money . I am wondering if I will ever receive a refund and what my recourse is going to be .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 This shoe is pretty and stylish , but not true to size . I ordered a medium width . The shoe fit OK except for the heel , which was way too narrow . I had to return them .
 i was looking for nice plain low heels.i trusted the hushpuppies brand . needed 11 ew . to narrow and bottom of shoes were slick . a plus size girl could slip and fall in these real fast . i returned them . i suggest cloudwalkers instead .
 This is a very cute shoe , especially the style and the height of the heel . However , it is not made of leather as advertised . This makes a difference to shoppers as myself , as shoes made of manmade materials do n't breathe well.Also , I ordered a Medium-width shoe , but this style runs extremely narrow . I have never had to buy a Wide-width shoe in my life and am consistently the same size for dress shoes . However , these are more than uncomfortably tight on my foot.It 's too bad , because the seller mailed the product to me in record time . Their customer service was also very responsive when I contacted them to return the item . Overall , I would not give the seller a negative rating , but would caution people interested in purchasing this product as they may need to order a size up -LRB- esp . in width -RRB- .
 I looked all those nice reviews but I was disapointed when the shoe came . It is pretty but has a slipery sole . And it is not leather as advertised .
 Shoe is advertized as a leather upper . When it comes it is clearly marked as `` ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS '' inside the heel . Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15 % restocking fee for a `` damaged shoebox '' to 50 % for `` trying-on wear . '' Seller is a rip-off . Do not buy ! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use .
 The product took 2 weeks to arrive since it was originally shipped to wrong state . Then , I received the wrong color . Size ordered fit at least two sizes smaller than same size from any store . Even when color and size were wrong , I had to return to store at my own expense . Poor custumer service . I will not buy from this company again .
 Not the best fit , and not the best color . I wear them occasionally but not often . My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles .
 Other reviews were right that these seem to run a little small . Both a little short and maybe a little narrow too .

 I was under the impression that this was a mid level shoe . Higher than a low-cut shoe . The 1st day I used them I rubbed a blister on the back of my foot which I have to avoid doing due to my diabetes . I now can only use these shoes to go out in , not for walking that I was buying them for .

 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .

 I 've worn these less than twenty times . The material in the side wall is NOT reinforced with a built in fabric , and fell apart at a decorative seam.Similarly priced water shielding boots I previously bought from the local hardware store that do have reinforcing in the material lasted four years under similar use.I asked the vendor Military Trail Gear Shop about the defect and they said the warranty is 30 days and no more . If I had worn these boots every day for 30 days , I suspect they would not have lasted even that long.Neither the manufacturer nor the vendor stand behind this product . I wo n't be buying any products from them again . Not recommended.I will be looking for an alternative on Amazon .

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 This has been a very unpleasant e-commerce buying experience . It has changed my mind about purchasing some items on line . I ordered some Roper boots from Bargain Outfitters . They came in a timely manner , when I tried them on they did not fit me . I decided to send them back immediately and because there was no address other than the one on the box and it was the same on the paper insert that was given to me , that is where I sent it back . I sent it UPS ground and it was delivered the next day . That was 3 weeks ago . I am still waiting for my refund because they are busy and ca n't get around to finding this box and refunding my money . I am wondering if I will ever receive a refund and what my recourse is going to be .

 I 've worn these less than twenty times . The material in the side wall is NOT reinforced with a built in fabric , and fell apart at a decorative seam.Similarly priced water shielding boots I previously bought from the local hardware store that do have reinforcing in the material lasted four years under similar use.I asked the vendor Military Trail Gear Shop about the defect and they said the warranty is 30 days and no more . If I had worn these boots every day for 30 days , I suspect they would not have lasted even that long.Neither the manufacturer nor the vendor stand behind this product . I wo n't be buying any products from them again . Not recommended.I will be looking for an alternative on Amazon .

 I acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit . I even complimented her on them . I liked so much how they looked on her that I took the time to locate them online -LRB- Amazon -RRB- . I ordered them with much anticipation that I would also look cute in them . Needless to say , looks ARE deceiving . Perhaps , they felt better on her than they did on me but I felt like I was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic . I was disappointed . If there 's nothing I 've learned being a woman in her mid-30s , I come to realize that there 's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes ...
 I only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute . Other than that they were quite unusable . I usually wear a size 7 but I could not even get my foot into these shoes ... and they are quite hard . Had to get rid of them .
 I normally wear an 8.5 comfortably in Steve Madden shoes . I purchased these in a 9 after reading about how small they run and I had to literally squeeze my feet into them . I did n't even get to wear them to know how hard they really are , because the circulation was cut off to my feet and I could n't tell , lol ... needless to say , I would n't recommend purchasing these unless you can try them to actually feel them yourself . I am not impressed with these at all . I love Steve Madden shoes , but this was the big disappointment from the brand .
 size 9.5 fit like it was an 8 . I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in , and was unable to walk in them at all without pain . I 've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small , but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled .

 I have small , wide , flat feet . It is so hard to find any kind of shoe in a retail store that actually fits me . I ordered these after going through the reviews . They fit wider than other wide shoes I have owned . I probably should have gotten a regular width . After wearing these to work after only a few weeks I started developing sharp pains in my heels . I switched out to an old pair of work sneakers and the pain went away . Went back to the Saucony and the pain started again . It felt like the entire insides of the sneakers stopped giving support.Maybe it 's just me , but these were the most expensive and most uncomfortable pair of sneakers I have ever purchased .
 With my orthotic it was too high of a footbed even with their insole taken out . The shoe made my foot roll to the outside when it never does that . Took out my orthotic and put their insole back in but it is a bad shoe for me .
 I 've only wore these a few times from 6-12hour shifts twice a week and the bottom of my right shoe has began making a squeaky noise every time that I step . They are n't as comfortable as the first day that I wore them and the noise is annoying . I am now purchasing another pair -LRB- different brand -RRB- to replace these just after a few wears .
 I 'm not at all happy with the Women 's Saucony Grid Omni Walker . I wanted an excellent walking shoe with the maximum in cushioning in the forefoot because I have neuromas . I was willing to order them on line because I 've always loved Saucony shoes . These are terribly bulky -- which I would put up with -- and they cut in to my ankle bone -- which could be fixed . What 's really bad about them is that the heel is wide and sloppy on the inside , while the heel base is soft and bouncy but not stabilizing . After wearing them for a long walk , I ended up with a hip joint injury . Of course , I ca n't be absolutely sure the injury resulted from the shoes . But it seems to me these are n't well designed and are n't up to Saucony standards .
 I loved the look of the shoe and the fit . I am a nurse who woks 12 hour shifts and I needed a good fitting shoe . However , I wore the shoes for 2 shifts and then the left shoe began to squeak with everyLeft step . Even my co workers commented so therefore I have to return the shoe .
 These have to be the most uncomfortable shoe ever . They are super cute but After 3 weeks of wearing them my feet and legs are killing me . I have rheumatoid arthritis and after wearing these shoes I thought the arthritis had spread to my feet and legs then I remembered I had new shoes . The inside insole/arch is extremely too high , I 've been walking on the outsides of my feet since wearing these shoes . I do not recommend these shoes , unless you turn your feet inward when you walk , wearing these shoes will definitely keep you from doing that .
 I normally wear a size 9 but the shoe was too small . So I had to return the shoes and got my credit back on my Amazon points .

 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 These shoes would be so comfortable if they could be tightened . Let me explain , the big flap you see is the velcro part . And you simply place the flap onto the shoe . Sounds simple enough , but the problem is you ca n't tighten the velcro . The Velcro does n't go through a hole/loop initially , so you ca n't pull on it and then set the velcro down . Even if you hold the shoe really tight and then drop the velcro down , it is still loose . So what I had to do was set the velcro down without my foot in it . Then I use a shoe horn to get into the shoe so the shoe will fit snug enough so you wo n't slip out of the shoe , otherwise , you feet will come out of the shoe . The problem with the simple fix of shoe horning my feet in is that the shoe has a tongue , and the tongue gets shoved down . So after getting into the shoe I have to dig out the tongue and pull it up.As for looks , even with velcro it can easily pass off as a comfortable dress shoe .
 My dad has bad feet and we were so hopeful that these would allow him to use his brace and have nice shoes . Not the shoes fault but we had to return them .
 You ca n't tell from the picture but the upper on this shoe is fabric , looks like a t-shirt . The big fat velcro flap would be fine if you want to look like a dork.Unless you had very limited use of your hands or would only wear these covered with long pants , pass on this design .

 These are a beautiful pair of shoes , but they had to go back ... they were just not comfortable . Very tight in the toe area ... so sad to see them go back !

 Nice materials . Not much support in the footbed , sandal runs loose . I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I 've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible .

 Cute shoe and the price was great but they looked cheap . I am normally a 7.5 , I ordered the 8 because 1/2 sizes were n't available . It turns out they were too big . My feet were practically sliding out of the shoe . I returned them . You get what you pay for .

 These boots are HOT ! The look is great but they hurt my arch after only 15 minutes of wearing . Not just a little pain , but so much so , I have to take them off immediately . I gave the boots 2 stars because they look so great but If rating on comfort , the rating would be negative stars . I 've only worn them twice because of this . I 've had a couple of friends try them on and they ca n't wear them either .
 SUPPOSE TO FEEL GOOD NO MATTER HOW I TRY THESE KILL MY FOOT BED AREA . I HAVE TRIED THE 5 MIN A DAY AND BUILD AND EVERY OTHER METHOD . NOT FOR ME I HAVE TO STICK TO NEW BALANCE 993
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .

 I ordered these shoes because Clarks ' are supposed to be quality , comfortable shoes . However , these have left blisters each time I have worn them , have a wobbly sole , and are not that attractive on .
 I have owned my wolverine durashocks for roughly four months ; they are by far the worst boots I have ever owned ! When I first bought them I could n't stop telling people how comfortable they were and ankle support they gave me . That all we out the window after the first month . My feet are in constant pain and I roll my ankle every time I hit uneven ground , the soles of the boots have tore apart from walking on stone and the pavement , and so much more ! These boots are pure junk ! The only reason they got two stars is because they look okay . Just bought a pair of Georgia boots to replace these jokes !
 All I hear is * squish squish squish * as I walk in these shoes . Wish I 'd spent a bit more for something nicer .

 Good delivery , easy return , beautiful shoes , but they do n't fit me . Soft , nice leather , very nicely made . Gaped a bit widely at the front , at the ball of my foot , when I took a step . But , I doubt it was the shoe , think it is my feet .
 The size is correct for me but since it is not very comfortable and the scrap is hard so I have to return it .
 This is a very attractive shoe but it lacks any type of support for the arch or ball of the foot . The footbed is very hard . It is an attractive round-toe style which I really liked . Too bad it would be very hard to wear over the long haul .
 I was desperate for a new pair of work shoes ; I have purchased this Mary Jane from Propet before however the sizing on this was so wide it gapped when I put it on with thick socks . Had a hectic schedule at work and missed the short return period which was barely thirty days . Better to go to Zappos .

 They try to boast that this calf skin is comparable to kangaroo leather ... It 's not . The feel on the ball is soft , but when you strike the ball , it is n't even close . I love adidas and bought 4 pairs of Profi 's before they were discontinued . At the same price , these just do n't cut it . Stick with the copa 's , at $ 90 , they may wear out a quicker , but a seasoned player can tell the difference . On the plus side , I do like the traxion .

 The item is described as fitting a shoe size 9.5 - 11 U.S. Mens . However my foot is a size 9 , and I tried to get this overshoe to stretch over my size 9 tennis shoe and it would not stretch far enough .
 I got a 9 Medium , and I do n't know how anyone could fit their foot in that thing . I have average width feet , and this is the first time I have bought a show that said medium but was too narrow . Sad because I think otherwise they would have been comfortable . .
 I was given a pair of Keds from my daughter when we visited her for Christmas . She lives in CA and I live in DE . I was unable to pack the box the shoes came in for the flight home . When I returned home to Delaware , I tried the shoes on to discover that they are too narrow . It was n't until I tried to exchange them that I learned that I needed the original box or they would n't accept them . Now my daughter is out $ 35.00 and I have a pair of shoes that I ca n't wear ! I will NEVER purchase anything from this company EVER ! They do n't care about customer service at all !
 Great service for delivery ! I had to return the shoes because they were too wide . I am still awaiting my refund . The return process is more complicated because the shoes are considered a drop-ship item . There was no return label , so I had to call to find out where to return them . My only suggestion would be button up that part of the process and make it a little more customer-friendly . Keds Women 's Champion Basic Slip-on
 I ordered these for an elderly relative -LRB- female -RRB- who has difficulty putting on shoes and walking . Over the years , she has purchased several pairs of lace-up navy blue Keds with which she was very satisfied . Due to this , I ordered her size -LRB- 8 narrow -RRB- in this slip-on style . Unfortunately , while one shoe fit perfectly , the other one was much too loose - at least a size too big ! I 'm not sure why this is the case , but I tried to remedy the situation by buying heel pads . This did not help . I even stuck two heel pads together and they still did not make the shoe fit . These shoes will be returned soon . We have since found a pair of Sketchers that fit her much better .
 I had to give these away because they were so narrow they would n't fit my feet comfortably -LRB- and my feet are pretty darn narrow -RRB- . Oh well !
 Not sure whether we simply got a bad pair or what ... within 2 weeks , the sole was separating from the shoe , causing my daughter to flop down the hallway .
 I ordered a couple of Keds Champion Basic Canvas Slip Ons because of the brand name . When the white pair arrived , there was a hole in the sole of the one shoe . Amazon.com was great about shipping out another white pair and I did n't have to pay for shipping so that was good . However , after just a few months of minimal wearing the navy pair -LRB- probably all of a dozen times and nothing harsh -RRB- , the sole on one of the navy ones started separating from the shoe ! So some quality issues with 2 pairs of Keds . Amazon.com was terrific in making good on the problems -LRB- thank goodness I ordered the shoes from Amazon ! -RRB- , but I will not order any more Keds brand shoes . I also noticed a similar complaint on the keds.com website so even though in the past Keds has had good shoes , it seems like now they have some quality issues .
 Shoes are not like other Keds I 've worn in the past . They have little support , are flimsy , and look cheap .
 i sent back the shoes because they were the wrong size and thought that I could get another pair sent back to me . No such luck . I have to buy them all over again . Why not an even exchange?Keds Women 's Champion Basic Canvas Slip-On
 The shoe I ordered was beautiful but they did n't fit . They were to narrow . They should give the choice for the shoes to be wider . And I do n't no how to return them so just sitting in the closet now
 I have worn a size 7 in keds for the past 10 years , so normally just buy a pair online , wear them , and go . However , keds have now changed their shoe design . These shoes are slightly narrower and about half an inch longer than my previous size 7s . So I of course had to return them . Which is sad because I love this style of shoes .
 Just an alert -- KEDS has just changed the design of this shoe , and it no longer resembles the KEDS Champion we all knew and loved . The thick , 3-part sole is gone , as is the terry lining and insole . The arch support is non-existent , and the semi-circular heel pad -LRB- the part that touches your Achilles tendon -RRB- is not there . The fabric is thin and cheap . KEDS has altered the shoe so it now resembles a $ 5 - slip-on from Wal-Mart . Looks like its going to be Vans for me .
 Having grown up wearing Keds sneakers , I was pleased to find that they had re emerged on the market . However , these slip ons are the worst sneakers ever . They are very narrow and have ZERO support in the soles . Poor quality , in my opinion . . do n't waste your money on these !
 These used to be the perfect sneaker but they are no longer the sturdy , comfortable shoes of years gone by . Do n't waste your money on these . They do n't fit right anymore and the material is of the poorest quality ever . Wow did they ever cut corners . I wish I had bought a dozen pairs several years ago . These new ones are nothing but cheap Chinese junk !!!
 I bought this for my mom and she was disappointed because this was suppose to be a wide width , but it was still too narrow . Had to send it back .
 I have worn keds slip-ons like this for years and never had this problem before.I do n't know the technical names , but the height between the insole and the upper is so short I ca n't even get my foot in the thing ! If you look at the picture where the `` tongue '' part is raised , this pair is flat . I even tried putting powder in the shoe to force slip it on and I ca n't get my foot in at all.Very disappointed and I feel like this may be a `` second '' or `` irregular '' , not an actual Keds for retail , which would explain the lower cost as well.Very disappointed .
 December 2009I have been wearing these slip-on Keds around the house for years . The fit well and have a decent arch support . Have tried other slip-ons and always come back to these because of the fit . When I can find them in the stores they usually only carry white . Was very pleased to get a chance to choose other colors . The navy color , however , is very dark and at first glance I thought they sent black by mistake .07 / 07/2011I just purchased another pair of Keds , ignoring the recent review that these shoes are no longer the same . I hoped there was some explanation for that buyer 's experience and was willing to take a chance on having to return them . But , sadly , the reviewer was 100 % correct on every point - these are not the same Keds slip-ons I used to buy.I am shipping them back for a refund , but please note that ShoeMall does not reimburse shipping costs .
 I have been an annual purchaser of these shoes . They are NOT the quality of Champion Basic Canvas shoes I 've purchased in the past . I was disappointed in the product I received . Gone is the quality fabric . Gone is the thick sole . Gone is the lining . Gone is the arch support . In fact , there is no arch support . The new fabric is thin and cheap . They will not provide the comfort of past Keds slip-on shoes . They are not worth the $ 25 when I can find similar shoes at Walmart for $ 8 . FORTUNATELY , I also ordered the Grasshoppers brand of canvas slip-on shoes thanks to reading a previous review on the Keds . They are fabulous . Same price and just like the `` old '' Keds quality ... great fabric and comfort . NYC school field trip here I come with comfortable shoes !! Thanks Grasshopper ! Better option
 Shoe sellers should have a unit of measurement for width . Inches and centimeters are only charted for length . I really , really do n't think the average consumer knows whether they wear a 4A , M , C , 5E , etc. . Most shoes in this world do not come with width labels ! So , even though a slip on canvas was exactly what I wanted , I could only gamble at the limited selection of colors and sizes . I lost .
 I 've worn a 7M -LRB- in Keds -RRB- since my feet stopped growing -LRB- 30 years ago -RRB- and suddenly they 're way too narrow . First time for everything , I guess ... Maybe Keds just mismarked the shoes -- or they 've changed how they 've made a product that have fit me for 30 years.Stupid me , I did n't look at the return policy and Peltz Shoes does n't do exchanges .
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes

 Appeared to be nice however after wearing once for about 6 hours both inserts are peeling out . Very poorly made and really not worth the money .
 These shoes are adorable . Much cuter than I had expected . I thought they were perfect when I took them from the box . I usually where a 9 and ordered that . I put them on and they were way too small . I sent them back and reordered them in a 10 since they were so stinkin cute I had to try again . They came and once again were too small . I was amazed . I have decided to give up . Total bummer !
 I love Sugar brand shoes , but they do not last long enough to warrant the price . I got a great deal on these at Amazon , so if I get 6 months out of them I will be happy , not upset like with my Sugar Military Cats that I paid full price for . These also run WAY small . They ended up at Goodwill , unworn .
 I am disappointed with these shoes . First , they run very wide . Second , the back strap is low and tends to slide off . I made as many new holes as possible to try to tighten them but still they slide off . Otherwise , the shoe is indeed comfortable . It looks high but actually it is not because of the platform .
 I always read other people 's reviews and sometimes base whether or not I will purchase an item or not by their say so . There was one review on this shoe and I should have listened more carefully . Out of the five or six pairs of Clarks I own , this is the most uncomfortable of all . The instep is too low and cuts into the top of each foot . You will notice it has an elastic band on one side but that does not help . Also the leather is not flexible on the sides of the shoe , futhermore , cutting into the sides of my feet as well . To make things worse , the shoes are a half size bigger than my regular Clark size , 9 M. I decided to keep these though I do n't know why . I have patched them with soft moleskin all over the place inside the shoe so they can at least be wearable . I will have to wear knee socks with them because as I stated above , they are at least a half size bigger than my size 9 's . I have never written a review that said , `` Do n't buy these . '' Looks like this is the first time .
 These boots look great , but they were too tight for my calves , and I 'm not a big girl .
 This pump was cute and stylish , but the heel height and width of shoe was n't right for me . I had to send back . If you have a slightly wider width foot -LRB- not D but not average B -RRB- this shoe would be perfect
 I was disappointed . They are cheap and look trashy instead of rocker chic . They also run very narrow .
 These boots seemed excellent when I just got them , very comfortable , breathable but after a single winter one of them started leaking water somewhere ... Ca n't locate the exact spot , but the leak is definitely present . These boots are not durable enough , there has to be something better out there .
 I have owned and loved Timberlands since 1994 . My last pair was the White Ledge . These appeared to be basically the same boot but with Gore Tex. . I loved the white ledges so much that I thought these would be a great upgrade with the Gore Tex lining . Since the outsole is the same and similar lacing . However , there is one design difference and it is a bad one . The the leather of the toe box and the leather strips that the lacing bolts run through , they meet and overlap at the top of the toe box . Since they overlap , it is not as flexible as the surrounding leather , and when you step forward , the extra firm leather digs straight down crushing my toes . I am hoping after more hikes and unfortunately more suffering , they may break in . This is unfortunate and downgrades an otherwise exceptional boot . I wish I would have stayed with the white ledge instead .
 I purchased a few months ago -LRB- but I do n't wear them in the summer -RRB- so they have seen some winter weather . The stitching is already coming apart on both the inner and outer parts of the boot .
 The seam on the sides of this boot come undone . After 30 miles of hiking the seam where the leather meets the nylon mesh is completely frayed and ripped on all sides . 2 boots with 4 seams that are split wide open . Very comfortable but does you little good when your feet are wet and the boot is actively self destructing . Shame on Timberland for putting this garbage out there .
 comfortable boots , I wear them everyday for 10-12 hrs a day . . They are starting to come apart on the side where the gortex meets the leather . . You would figure they would last a bit longer ??
 These boots are kind of waterproof but in the most difficult conditions are not . They will keep you feet dry going across a stream , but a half mile through long wet grass will leave you with wet feet.I do n't know if this is just me , but they hurt my feet . Given the nature of the construction with a molded EVA last and sole this is a function of the shape as they will never break in . I find that after 3 or 4 miles I just want them OFF ! I have tried the factory insole and 2 kinds of orthotics based upon casts of my feet . They hurt no matter what.I read the reviews and everyone said ordering the normal US size was okay . I wear a US 13 and am thinking I should have ordered a 14 . If you get these wear them indoors and standing for a few days before deciding to keep them
 Okay I have bought two different versions of this shoe one in black the other in brown leather with green nylon . Both were incredibly comfortable . I loved them for the time I could wear them . However , that was only for four days . Seems in order to save some money -LRB- on a 120 dollar shoe this amazed me -RRB- Timberland decided to use bent metal eyelets for the shoe strings on the lower half of the shoe rather than a more durable cast eyelets or simple punched eyelets . Note I 'm not talking about the hooks on the upper half but the lower portion . After wearing them for four days the eyelet broke at one of the bends . This type of quality fits well for the 50 $ or under crowd but the 100 $ or higher I just could n't believe it . Also , note this was the second pair not the first , as the first one came with the eyelet already broken . They were so comfortable that I gave them a second chance . Unless Timberland replaces my eyelets with cast ones I 'll be returning these and wo n't be giving them a third chance . These boots are for those trendy types who want to look like the outdoors type at the clubs but are not for the outdoors . Stay away from these boots as your hiking could be ruined if the eyelets fail at a bad time.Side note I 've been wearing Timberland workbooks for the past 6 months with punched eyelets and have had no problems .
 First , if you plan to wear these boots for significant distances , do not buy them online ; they may not fit as you expect . I normally wear size 13 , but ended up getting 12 ; 13 felt way too large , while 12 felt about right -LRB- and this was in the summer ; unfortunately , boots usually do not come in size 12.5 -RRB- . I bought these over 2 years ago and took them on a 100-mile backpacking trip after wearing them in town for just a couple of miles . My toes felt a tiny bit of pressure from the boot , but overall the boots felt very comfortable , and it was a delight to walk through puddles without my feet getting even dump.By now , these shoes have gone through about 200 miles of backpacking with 40-60 lb pack -LRB- mostly on hilly terrain , but with good footing -RRB- , 100 miles of 15-25 mile day hikes -LRB- mostly on flattish terrain , but with rocky footing -RRB- , and perhaps another 50-100 miles of walking in town , 1-2 miles at a time . So , while I have had them for a while , they have not gone through that many miles -LRB- for comparison , AT is 2200 miles , and I do not think most through hikers go through more than 2 pairs of boots -RRB- . Unfortunately , the outsoles are starting to detach from the top of the boot where they are joined at the front . I am afraid this may end their waterproofness in the near future . The top parts of boots also seem to have started soaking a little bit of water -LRB- though it still does not get through , unless I actually stand in a paddle for quite a while -RRB- . The pressure on my toes has also increased significantly ; recently , I have been feeling it even after wearing the boots briefly -LRB- 1-2 miles -RRB- in town and then taking them -LRB- somehow , 20 miles on a trail do not feel any worse -RRB- . My guess is that these boots have shrunk over time . I also ended up with blisters at the back and at the bottom of my feet after each of two 25-mile day hikes.In summary , this boot is waterproof to begin with and can be pretty comfortable -LRB- if it fits properly -RRB- , but it is not overly sturdy . It also appears that the quality of Timberland Chocorua may have declined over time ; see my review of the women 's version which my wife bought this past summer . They are all made in China , btw .
 I love these boots , I really wish they were designed better . The first time I put on the boots they felt broken in , I wore them all day , and did not take any time to break in . However I do n't wear these boots that often . Usually just for rainy days , and in Southern California , that is not very often . After I would say 5-10 days of wearing the boots , the inside fabric on the boot by my arch has started to fray . And not on just one side , but both sides . So it is not an instance where maybe I caught one boot on a nail . The other thing is the eyelets on the boots are starting to fray the laces . I 'm not pulling a MacGuyver and using these laces to shimmy down a zip line either , I am lacing up my boots and It is only a matter of time before the laces snap.I will probably send back to Timberland to swap them out , from reading some other reviews it does not sound like an isolated incident .
 I purchased my first pair of these shoes several years ago . They were very comfortable and the only problem was the shoe lace fell apart within a couple of weeks.Purchased my second pair -LRB- replace the first pair -RRB- about 10 months ago . Same problem with the shoe laces . Replaced the show laces ; a couple of months later one of the lace eyes came apart and had to be replaced by our local shoe repair store.Purchased my latest and LAST pair less than two weeks ago . Shoe laces fell apart on the second wearing and one of the lace hooks started coming off ; one of the two rivets pulled out of the upper leather.Timberland 's website claims these shoes are manufactured in New England , when in fact they are cheaply made , as evidenced by the quality , in China.Returned shoes and ordered Hi-Tec hiking boots .
 I had them for two weeks that I actually hiked in them and they left my feet soaked just from walking in snow , and the soles are almost completely worn out already . Would not reccomend buying these spend 10-20 dollars more and buy Merrell .
 Hi , I bought you a pair of shoes Timberland Men 's Chocorua Gore-Tex Hiker . I 've been wearing the shoes almost two months and already are damaged.I never checked the quality of the shoes , only I 've been wearing the shoes.The damages the shoes are some holes in the seam of the fabric , I think you have sent to me poor quality shoes.I am in Venezuela and I 've wearing this type shoes made here and they not have nothing damaged like the ones you sent to me.How could I solve this send of a poor quality shoes?Timberland Men 's Chocorua Gore-Tex Hiker
 Admittedly , I was looking for style rather than function , but just know that it DOES NOT look AT ALL like it does in the picture . Notice there being `` Green '' in the description and there not being any green on the shoe except for the little tab at the top of the shoe . No , I 'm not color blind , the photo-shop artist changed the shade of the picture and well , they did a good job .
 size too big - product should specify country of origin . This item is made in China , I always thought Timberland products were made in USA
 I received these as a gift and they are awful . A main reason I put them on my wish list was that they were supposed to be breathable . They are not . At all.But my biggest complaint is 1 that Timberland is going to hear about . I do n't know if the pair that I got is defective or if they 're all like that but the sock liner was not glued to the roof of the boot in the toes . It hung loose in both boots and was very uncomfortable . And I think greatly contributed to the boots being very hot . Now after I 've worn them several times & my feet have soaked themselves in sweat the liner has all bunched up and dried.If Timberland wo n't replace them then these $ 90 boots are going in the trash & I wo n't ever buy Timberland products again .
 i purchased these boots for my brother a while back because he only wears Timberlands and couldnt find his size in the local store in our country . they arrived well packaged and all but after a few months of wearing them -LRB- total of about 12 wearings -RRB- he had he strangest complain in all his time as a Tims fan
 I bought this boot in march 2012 . The boot is very comfortable , but the quality of the shoe is very questionable . It is now august 2012 and the boot has begun to unravel where the nylon mesh is stitched to the leather . In the time that I have owned this shoe it has not been worn often or roughly . Maybe I just got a bad boot , I do n't know but I wo n't be buying timberland shoes anymore .
 My husband took them on a trip abroad and after wearing the shoes for one day , the stitches broke . Since we were on the trip I was not able to return them and instead we got them fixed . To my surprise , after another week of wearing , more stitches broke . I 'm very disappointed with the quality for the price paid .
 I have had two pairs of these . They fit great , are light weight , and tractible . Gore-Tex is truly waterproof ; waterproofed leathers are n't . The problem I 've had with walking three or so miles a day is the fabric insert . Although these are stitched well , the fabric is cut short and not folded over and hemmed when sewn into the leather , so after several weeks the fabric becomes internally frayed and pulls out of the leather through the stitching on both pairs ; so I know it was n't just a fault with the first pair . That 's too bad , because I really like the fit and comfort.There is a similar shoe with leather sides and no fabric - but they are n't Gore-Tex .
 On the plus side , these boots have been very comfortable right out of the box . The break in time was almost zero . Unfortunately there are quality issues with my pair . The seam along the webbing on the side of the shoe came loose after relatively short use . A minor problem has been the laces . The outer sheath broke very quickly after I started wearing the shoes . A nice shoe with some quality issues .
 Initially , I was very happy with these , as I have been with Timberland in the past.However , within a few months , 3 or so , the stitching between the canvas and leather -LRB- or faux-leather -RRB- came apart on both boots . This is unacceptable in a boot from a brand like Timberland for the price . I expect better quality , and will not likely be buying Timberland again anytime soon . I can get better quality cheaper.On the upside , the boots are comfortable ... until it rains or snows . Wet feet are NOT comfortable at all , and once the stitching splits , they are no longer waterproof . Have n't had any issues with traction , but as I got them in the spring and they had begun to fall apart by the summer , I have limited experience with them on snow or ice .
 These might be great boots for most people , but not someone with my specific foot problems . I get very sore spots on the outside mid sole area of my feet . If a shoe or boot has a seam in the same area -LRB- the cuboid bone -RRB- like this boot , they function more as a torture device than a foot protector .
 Didnt buy these on amazon but they barely lasted a year . Now I 'm searching for a new boot . The outer leather wore way too quick and the inside lining detached around the toes on one of the shoes .
 the boots are knock off 's they wore out in 8 weeks soles wore thru came apart very unhappy . very bad boots
 These slippers are very uncomfortable . They are also made of cheap fabric and are not the least bit warm . I will not waste the money to return them , since I have already wasted enough money .
 When I received these flip flops I was very excited and was saving them to wear to an Island Party thinking they would be a huge hit especially for my Martini girl friends ... unfortunately -- only one of the sandals blinked the other one was fine . There is no way to get inside them to adjust anything so there is nothing you can do - Now they are just expensive regular flip flops . I would not recommend them and wish I had saved my money .
 I 've always been impressed with the look of Kenneth Cole dress shoes , but not so impressed with the quality . This is the second pair that i 've purchased in recent years and it 's also the second pair that i 've returned . Steer clear .
 The shoes look great , but the leather is very stiff , which makes the whle shoe unflexible and the upper rim is actually cutting into my foot when walking . Tried wearing it in a bit , but does n't help .
 I will never buy anything from this company again . I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law 's wedding , they were not what she wanted , we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge . Boy they are reaaly making money off customers .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .
 I will never buy anything from this company again . I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law 's wedding , they were not what she wanted , we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge . Boy they are reaaly making money off customers .
 The shoes have sparkles all over and do n't serve my purpose . I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle . A nice shoe to use during the night .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 This boot looked so much better online . For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap . I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I 'm still waiting for my refund !!!

 Compared to other Merrell products that I have used , these shoes just do n't compare . Although , they are stylish looking , they offer zero support and are too uncomfortable to wear all day . I have a retail store and spend my day on my feet . My test of a comfort shoe is to wear them for a day in my busy store . These shoes just do n't pass the test . I had to resort back to my worn Merrell clogs or my Keene Mary Janes .
 This is the first time I have written a product review . I ordered a pair of Merrell Barrado shoes from Metro Shoe Warehouse . The shoes arrived with a broken zipper . Metro advised that the other pair in stock was the same as the pair I returned . Metro would not credit my account for the shipping costs - either way - for a defective pair of shoes . I offered to split the shipping costs and Metro would not agree to this compromise . Most companies do not even charge shipping costs , and certainly not for a defective product . Clearly Metro does not believe in either making the customer happy or that the customer is always right . I will NEVER order another product from Metro .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 Very good the shoes I recommend 100 % , thank you very much .
 Even though I ordered a wide size of these , they killed my little toe . I 've got a huge blister and was limping by the end of the day . I would n't buy them again . They look great , but hurt like crazy .

 These boots look great , but they were too tight for my calves , and I 'm not a big girl .
 I do n't know what it is with the Structure 10s , but it causes me to get shin splints . I do n't know what they changed about it , but it is no good . I went back to running in my 9 's . And what do you know ? The shin splints went away . I think I will try the 11s next and hope they changed the shoe back to how it was on the 9 's .
 The Nike TRIAX Air Structure 10 I purchased had a very poorly made left shoe , leaning far to the left . It makes me wonder if it is a ` knock-off ' instead of Nike . I 'll stick to my old source and style .

 I ordered these shoes because Clarks ' are supposed to be quality , comfortable shoes . However , these have left blisters each time I have worn them , have a wobbly sole , and are not that attractive on .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 I wore these shoes for one day and the ripped right at the top flower !! Now I am VERY careful with my shoes because I LOVE my feet and Shoes ! No wonder they come with patches ! I was very disappointed !! I also bought another pair and have yet to ware them !
 I like these sandals , but after the first day of wearing them , the soles cracked . Fortunately , they came with a repair kit of stickers , but the sticckers are starting to come off too -LRB- after only a few weeks -RRB- . If you just want to wear them around the beack or pool infrequently , they 're fine , but any amount of walking seems to be too much for them to hanldle .

 I have bought the shoes for playing basketball indoor . But the shoes slip so much , so I cant play basketball , even if i can not run also .
 I purchased this for my 11 year old backpacker who has 125 lifetime miles . He just finished 42 miles backpacking the Gran Teton Loop via Cascade Canyon . I wish I would have bought him Keens Pyrenees instead . These boots are way to stiff . We buy high end super light gear . He averaged 8 lbs as his pack weight carrying everything except food in his pack . Not enough weight to worry about a stiff shank . It is better to have more flexible shoe to prevent blisters .
 I found the post old school Forums and I had to have them . I usually wear a size 11.5 us and that 's what I ordered . They arrived on time and in new condition . I tried them on they were a size too small and they pinched my toes something terrible . I sent them back and bought some larger ones at a store close to home . The seller was nice enough to credit my account as soon they received them /

 I want to return that item because I received a wrong size . Since now i did n't have a chance to contact to the seller , I hope someone can help me to change this item with the right size that I ordered . By the way I ordered size 11 and got something like size 9 .

 I normally love Naturalizer shoes , but these were so uncomfortable that they actually physically hurt to wear . I think the design of the shoe is too narrow towards the toe so your feet end up extremely squished together . It was so bad that I do n't think even a bigger size would have helped so I sadly returned them .
 20 OctThe leather is fine ; so is the style . However , I got an 8 1/2 wide Naturalizer Women 's Fuller loafer and the shoe is wider in the heel than toe . The heel looks bulky and slides even with adhesive pads inside the heel .

 The sizing on these skates is entirely off !! Such a disappointment to receive them just in time for my daughters birthday to find that the size 5 is actually a youth size 4 -LRB- sizing on tongue says Adult 5 , Youth 4 , European 35 -RRB- . Knowing that Heelys run small I intentionally ordered a size up too . Had to order a completely different style from another site . I still do n't understand how an adult 5 is a youth 4 ...

 I love Nine West shoes , but these boots are not made like Nine West.It did n't help that when I received them they were damaged . I purchased 3 other pairs of Nine West shoes from Amazon and LOVE them but these boots stink !!!
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 The shoe for the right foot fit fine . The left foot shoe was uncomfortable -- there was something inside it -LRB- not smooth inside -RRB- .
 I have to return this boot , way too tight to get on my foot . Even got someone younger and thinner than me and she had a hard time getting this boot on her foot . And a little too furry , do n't like the look of all the fur .
 I should have not wasted time and money seeing for myself given the bad reviews . They do not zip to the top as stated many times and in no way can you possibly tuck in a pant leg as there is no room . These are useless , I ordered them for the practicality of them as I am in and out of bad weather with my job . I live in Maine , I need practical , not `` cute . '' I own other Sorel boots for snowmobiling and those are great , these are constructed too stiff and the zipper sucks ...
 I bought these boots in anticipation for the big snow storm and after 1 block the zippers fall down and my feet start to walk out of the shoe . The shoe becomes pretty useless when the snow falls inside ! Wish I had gotten the lace up ones , going to return these
 I ordered the Snow Angel 's in grey and LOVED the look and feel of them . So comfortable !!! And it is true what another reviewer stated that you can not tuck your pants in as the boot top hugs your leg . I like that - it helps to keep snow out without cramming pants into the boot ... but ... SIGH ... all this about the zippers slidding down-it 's true-rats !!!! The left zipper stayed up and the right foot zipper just would not hook , so I think it 's a crap shoot , with the odds being against you to actually get both left and right boots zippers to stay up ... and I was n't even walking around-the right boot zipper slipped just sitting down and trying them on . It really is too bad because they are the most comfortable boots I 've tried on since I had an old pair of Columbia 's that I stupidly stored in my attic to boil for two summers and the rubber split on the soles . I may try the Snow Angels out next year , or at least check the reviews to see if the problem has been fixed , but sadly , these babies are going back . If it matters-they did run try to size .
 The boot would not stay zipped and after two hours of snow tubing , I struggled to keep the boot on .
 I bought these shoes a half size bigger than I normally wear to make sure they were roomy enough . They were still a bit small and the zipper was super flimsy and nearly impossible to zip up or down . I returned the shoes because they were just too much hassle to get on or off . I 'm going to try out the laced version of the same boot ... a whole size bigger than usual .
 EDIT -LRB- read my initial review below -RRB-
 These shoes are very cute but horribly uncomfortable - very , very stiff . I had to return these because I could n't wear them .

 Left shoe middle strap shorter than right shoe . Too bad , beautiful otherwise . Just ca n't wear . Still waiting for replacement .
 My son loves the appearance of the shoe , but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description : - leather-Soft , calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper . I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising .
 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .
 my husband gifted me these boots , which I tried at a local store back in October.they seemed comfortable and well made ... boy , was i wrong.got the first pair mid-december and within the first week of wearing them , the plastic heel part fell off from the right boot.i returned that pair and got my second pair from amazon right away.wore the second pair 3 times and the leather was becoming unglued from the sole on BOTH SHOES.needless to say , i returned the 2nd pair for a full refund.what a shame.beautiful , comfy shoes that are poorly made and a total disaster .

 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .

 You need to order 1-2 sizes smaller than your normal size , these things are massive boats . It does n't matter if you have other Puma shoes in size X , go size X-1 here . Pretty mad that I wasted $ 40 on shoes I ca n't wear now , but that 's what happens when you buy Amazon .

 Very dissapointed with the Vendor . I fail in love with this slippers for my 4 old month baby , the first time I ordered them size small which is 6-12 they send me Medium which is 12-18 even thoguth the packing slip has the correct size , I was very dissapointed but I like them so much that I keep them . I ordered them AGAIN for the second time Small they Send the Wrong size AGAIN . Now Im stuck with 2 pair of slipper wrong size and my baby can `` t wear them they way too big for her . I have to return them and pay when they the one who make the mistake TWiCE !!! I will never order from this Vendor EVER !!!

 I bought these shoes in white for a holiday . They were comfortable and the right size . The problem is , I wore them once and made them slightly dirty . I figured I am going to wash them . What a mistake !!! I washed them from the top and inside with plain water . It looked like they were now clean . I set them to dry overnight on a chair . I wake up in the morning to see and now instead of white pair shoes , I had a rusty pair of shoes . There is some sort of rust all over the shoes . It looks like there was some chemical in the shoes that came out when they were washed . I now ca n't wear them anywhere . Have to throw them out . What a shame to throw out $ 50 . The shoes should come with a warning that you ca n't wash these shoes . Very disappointed.On the positive side , I looked really nice in them during the holiday while they were clean : -RRB-
 The opening was way too small to get my foot in . Once in , the shoe fit fine ; my foot is not overly wide .
 I have bought Vans before without problems , but this particular pair have quality and consistency issues.The left shoe is a perfect fit.The right shoe ... crushes my little toe . -LRB- Toes are the same size ... FYI -RRB- I tried breaking it in and after a while ... the same . . it freakin hurts my right little toe.I am now very leery about buying shoes online . Its one of those things you got ta try on in person , I guess .

 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .

 I ordered this shoe in my standard size and upon receipt they were huge . I returned them for a .5 size smaller and I stepped out of those as well . On the third attempt I went down a size smaller and they were also too large .
 The design of these shoes is so pretty , especially the thin ankle strap and toe cleavage in the front . However , they are so poorly made and therefore look so cheesy that it spoils the overall attractive design.Even though they are not that expensive , they are still way overpriced considering that the quality is so inferior .

 The shoes were a little small but true to size -LRB- my own fault got half size too small -RRB- . They are unique which is cool but the front of the shoe appears long and just did n't have the look I wanted . Very comfortable , loved how the inside shoe bed was all bubbly and very cushioned.SELLER REVIEW - In short , find these shoes from another seller.Tried to follow their instructions but my order number is not recognized . Seller included instructions with the product on how to return IF purchased on their various websites but these instructions DO NOT apply for purchases on Amazon . I have contacted the seller through Amazon and am waiting for them to approve me to return ! What 's that ? While waiting I decided to check them out on BBB . I 'm nervous to say the least . They can only say `` I can assure you this was not intentional and a very unusual situation '' so many times before it gets old . If you keep reading the complaints there are many reoccurring issues this company has clearly yet to fix . I would check another seller if you want these shoes and avoid the hassle of having to deal with their `` customer service '' and I use that term loosely . Do n't take my word , check them on the Better Business Bureau and have a look at complaints and customer reviews . -LSB- ... -RSB- So many people ... had I checked first I would have never made the purchase to begin with . Love Amazon but not all sellers on their site offer as great of service as they do . I am however , very pleased with Amazon .
 I was very disappointed when I received these shoes . They were not the same shoes that are in the picture . I could see all the glue that was used to hold them together . The soles were frayed all around the rubber . Simply put , these shoes are cheap and not well built . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THEM !! I sent them back for a refund the next day .
 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .
 I bought these because they look almost identical to my beloved Gizehs . They turned out to be far less flexible , and the thongs injured my middle toes so badly after very brief and painful wearing that I could not wear any shoes at all for the several days it took my feet to heal . Do n't be misled by their visual similarity to Gizehs .
 If you have a high arch , good luck getting these babies on ... bought my usual size and ca n't get my foot past the turn of the shaft.Too bad , because they 're a great looking boot .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 My daughter told me all her friends have the tool to remove the wheels and the covers that go over the holes when you take the wheels out . These did n't come with either . She was really bummed . If I had known that I would have never bought them .
 we were not pleased with this product . There is no easy way to get the wheels out . Suppossedly there should be a tool to do this . It was not provided with this style .
 I bought this because is was adorable . The wiring inside is very thin and it broke when we opened it : -LRB-
 These umbrellas are really cute and both my boys -LRB- 2 and 5 -RRB- love them . However , after only 5 minutes of running around with it , my 2-year-old dropped it and stepped on a couple of the tension rods and they broke . So now , it does n't stay open . The tension rods are quite flimsy , so I 'd recommend this for older -LRB- 5 + -RRB- children who can understand it 's only for keeping rain off their heads .
 I have had an identical pair -LRB- same size , 9M , and colour -RRB- of these for four years and loved them . These new sandals are 1cm shorter and 6-7mm narrower than the old ones and feel too tight . The size difference is not a matter of breaking in and a little stretching that may occur , it is far greater than that . I 'm concerned that new ones will not be comfortable to wear for long periods as the old ones are . I can not see how Keen could allow such poor quality control .
 I usually love Keens , they are so confortable and look cute too . These sandles are the most unconfortable shoe I have ever worn that was not a dress shoe . I was excited to get these because of all the great reviews , but I am very disappointed that they did n't deliver . These shoes hurt my feet in multiple places . Amazon is wonderful though !

 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 The low feature on the back of the shoe make it uneasy to wear , due to the fact that it does not hold the ankle properly .
 The shoes arrived in what looked like a trash bag with some postal information on it , not a box . Normally I do n't judge based on the packaging , but in this case it was somewhat fitting.The shoes themselves seemed to be of halfway decent quality for as cheep as they where . When I put them on , I noticed that one was incredibly loose . So loose it felt like it was going to fall off after a couple of steps . The elastic section was almost twice the size as the other , preventing the shoe from fitting snugly . I tried several ways of tightening the shoe enough to match the other one without any success.These could possibly be worth the money if they did n't have what I am going to assume is quality control issues . I , however , do n't think I will ever purchase shoes online again .
 I use these type of shoes strictly for walking from my car to work and back every day , about a half mile . These shoes are cheaply made with little to no sole so they are uncomfortable . It had been raining this morning and merely by walking on wet concrete , my socks got wet . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone ! I 'll be tossing these and finding another pair !
 I 've never had a problem ordering my husband shoes . These shoes run a full size too big . I got too busy and have n't returned them . There is no way he can wear them this big . The only thing is if they were sized wrong .
 I have owned these mocs for about 6 weeks and worn them mostly just on the weekends . The have already completely fallen apart and this is what I consider light use for a short time , heaven forbid if you wanted to wear them everyday . Waste of money and will be returing them for a refund . Size does run very large as well although this was a minor concern compared to construction .
 i was really excited about these shoes until i got them

 These were too small for their stated size , 11.5 . I wear 11.5 in Nike shoes and have a pair of white Lunar Control shoes in the same size . These were too short and narrow . Amazon took them back with no problems .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I have big , narrow feet . I ordered the right size , but these just did n't fit . I returned them and did n't get my money back . I 'm ticked at Clark.Don ' t buy stuff from Clark .
 This shoe fits about 1/2 size too large . Had to return for a smaller size and even it is not comfortable . Would return for a refund but company does not include return labels like every other company from which I have purchased . Will not buy from this company again .

 I ordered 4 pairs of flip flops according to havainas size chart , which ended up being a size to small . This order was placed on June 10th . As of today , July 4th , I have not been able to process this return either through their web site , nor on the phone with their customer reps. , who were at a loss as well . I was promised an extension for my return date -LRB- they have a 30 day return policy -RRB- , and they were supposed to contact me within 48 business hours which they yet to do . Flip flops are not worth all of this trouble !!!
 I purchased a pair of the havaianas slim -LRB- size 37-38 -RRB- and wore them for a while , but suddenly one of the straps broke off where it goes into the sole between the toes . This was absolutely not due to hard wear , so I feel that I spent over $ 20 for a pair of flip-flops that lasted about as long as a pair of $ 3 ones would have . Very disappointed , as this was my first pair of havaianas and I expected them to last for a while .
 If you have a high arch , good luck getting these babies on ... bought my usual size and ca n't get my foot past the turn of the shaft.Too bad , because they 're a great looking boot .

 I bought these for my little girl for the winter but they do not stay very long no matter what I do . They are cute and look durable but it is a hassle to have to worry whether or not the shoe will be lost as she kicks or moves around . My friend has the Ugg boots similar to these but she has the same problem . I would suggest getting Robeez shoes .

 Do not buy this shoe I have no clue how it got a rating from Runners World Magazine ... I ran the Chicago Marathon in these shoes after wearing them during workouts for 2 months and they killed my feet while the rest of my body felt great . I do not recommend this shoe at all .

 These boots are so cute , but unfortunately , the velcro is not strong enough to keep them on my daughter 's feet ! They come undone very easily , so I have to constantly check to see if they 've fallen off ! Not worth the money !!!
 I thought these were so cute that I bought them in pink and tan . I am SOOOO disappointed in these shoes ! They will not stay on . I would not recommend them except to take a quick picture , because that is about all you will get out of these !
 This backpack is not for adults . The handle is very short , and you will have to bend in order to transport . Seller should inform buyers that this back pack is for kids or very short individuals . I am 5ft .7 in and it was too short for me . In addition , it is not very comfortable carrying on back .
 This item was needed for my son in the fifth grade . He hauls about 40 lbs . of textbooks to and from school . Needless to say he has put this item through rigorous paces . One of the legs have broken off so it will not stand on its own . Also the clear plastic has split at the end of the zipper . I would say the backpack on wheels would be more capable with not more than twenty pounds maximum .
 My daughter was so excited to get this rolling backpack . The amount of books she has to carry was hurting her back . The item lasted until last week -LRB- week before Thanksgiving -RRB- when she told me that one of the wheels was not rolling good any more and the straps had torn off at the bottom so she could n't even put it on her back . The wheels are too small and it looks like they got worn by the concrete . One of the leg props fell off within a couple of weeks too . This is not a strong enough backpack to be put thru the day to day travel of a 6th grader . I wonder how they tested this item before they started selling it . I would not buy this again and it makes me nervous about other products that look the same . I thought for $ 30 that is would have lasted thru the school year at least instead of just 1 month .
 This backpack with wheels is not resistant at all and it 's too expensive . I bought it for my son and it did n't last the whole school year . The base does n't unfold as it should , so the pack never stands in the wheels so it is always falls on the floor if you do n't hold it . Nice concept but poor fabrication .
 These shoes have a high , hard heel and almost no cushioning . It feels like you are walking on two wooden wedges . They make the back of my legs and posterior hurt by the end of the day . They also seem about 1/2 size smaller than previous versions and are no longer waterproof . I have been wearing Rockports for over a decade , but I guess I will have to change brands now .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .

 I am a big Rockport fan , and have purchased at least three pair of theRockport Men 's World Tour Classic Walking Shoe , which is comfortable , comes in wide sizes and made of sturdy materials that last . Typically these make it 2-3 years of heavy , daily wear . A couple months ago I tried to purchase a new pair for these from Amazon and they were temporarily out of stock , so I decided to try this product , the Rockport Men 's Prowalker Walking Shoe . What a mistake !!! The filmsy material the shoe is made from are already wearing , and since the manufacturer skipped out on putting metal rings where your laces thread through the shoe within two months my laces tore through the thin layer of material that held it ! The shoes are basically ruined , but since I missed my return window I 'm basically hosed . My warning , do n't buy the Rockport Men 's Prowalker Walking Shoe unless you 're looking for disposable footwear .
 I have been buying a pair of white Rockport Prowalkers for ten or twelve years and have remained loyal to the brand because of the excellent wear they gave me and their superb comfort . Something has changed recently in this series of shoes . The leather is much stiffer and the shoes are just not as comfortable . They still give good arch support and the assembly quality seems okay , but only time will tell how they hold up to daily use . I hope Rockport returns to their high standards of manufacturing in the future . I 'll probably look for something else when it 's time to replace these . The color white is more like an ivory color now . Before they were pure white .
 The service for this was fine . No complaints . However , the shoe itself is another thing . First , I chose white . When it arrived , it was an off-white . My husband was willing to live with that . But then , after wearing the shoes a couple of times , he said they were extremely uncomfortable . We have purchased Rockport ProWalkers in the past & loved them . This was quite a disappointment .
 I have been wearing Rockport shoes for years and have always loved them . I bought a 10M , like all of my other Rockport shoes . As soon as I put on the shoes , my feet both ached in the balls of my feet . I thought they needed to be broken in , but after wearing them two days , no change . They are marked M , but are actually narrow . I intend to return them !
 I too have been wearing the Rockport Prowalker for years . However , this model is now a most unconfortable shoe . I do n't even think they had the width right . I also noticed that the name Rockport is no longer labeled on the back of the shoe . I would stay away from this shoe . I tried one of the more expensive shoes and they are better .
 If you have worn Rockport Prowalker in the past please note that the design of this shoe has changed over the past 1-2 years . I recently ordered a pair and the padding is much reduced , the leather is not as soft . The shoes may be OK and well made but they are not the style you may be used to if you have worn this stlye in the past .
 They look like plastic , feel like wood , and wear like paper . This is by far the lowest quality , least comfortable shoe I have ever paid this much money for . I found myself looking for signs that the shoes were counterfeit . Unfortunately , this is just one more company that went from making a quality product to selling cheap foreign crap . It 's sad to see another good company go bad . Save your money for a better quality shoe .
 I have been wearing rockport walkers , almost exclusively , for many years so Iordered the shoes in my ususal size . It was too small and I had to return itand I had to pay for the return because I did get what I ordered . Not worth itand I wll never buy shoes , clothes , or other previously untested items online .
 I first started buying the Rockport Pro Walker show about 15 years ago and went through several pairs -- about one every 3 years after near-daily use . That 's incredible quality ! And for what was then $ 100 , an expensive shoe , but very much worth every penny given the comfort and proven durability . My work changed and I did n't need a new pair for the past 5 years -LRB- I was walking less -RRB- , but when it came time to get a comfortable work shoe again a few months ago , I naturally turned to Rockport Pro Walker , given the great experiences I had in the past . I was pleasantly surprised at the low prices these days . I hoped the quality would be the same , but was disappointed.I think the construction of the shoe is probably as solid as ever -LRB- hence the 2nd star -RRB- , but the material is clearly a cheaper material these days than in the past , and the soft , comfortable walking experience is basically gone . This shoe is now harder and each step lands awkwardly . I would gladly pay $ 100 for the old shoe again . But the sacrifice in comfort in the current ` Pro Walker ' series is n't even worth half of that . I 'm sorry I bought these , and even more sorry that a once venerable product I previously spent so much time wearing is no longer desirable .
 poor quality , leather thinner , less confortable than before . Better buy Rockport WT Classic for a few bucks more !
 This is the first pair of this specific model which I have purchased in over 5 years . I have probably owned 10 pairs of this very same model over the years . This shoe is not even close to the quality I am accustomed to and I have worn it only once because it just looks and feels cheap . I should have returned it immediately after purchase but it sits on the shoe rack . Needless to say I am very disappointed in my purchase and the quality of the product . Bud -
 I was told to expect the shoes to arrive on 14 Sept. . As of today-20 Sept , it has NOT arrived . Who can I talk to to track it and find out when -LRB- if -RRB- it will arrive ? Please call me at Home 301-627-5664 / cell 240-305-5981 . Hoping to hear from you-Yours truly , James Storey
 What a disapointment . Bought them a few times in the past . The only thing that has n't changed is the look and name . They are a total misfit and give no support . I guess Rockport does n't care what it sells .
 The last pair I got were marked medium width . They fit good . This pair -LRB- which was returned -RRB- was marked medium but the were to narrow .
 I agree that the Rockport ProWalker just is n't what it used to be.It 's tight and stiff and in spite of ordering the same size as usual it does n't fit.And , no , my shoe size has not changed !
 I 've been purchasing Rockport shoes since the 1970 's . I was always very satisfied . Pro walkers were always my favorite ... The most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased . I just bought a new pair -LRB- in June , 2012 -RRB- , which are as uncomfortable as you can imagine . They 're cheap ... There 's really no other word for it . They are no longer made in China -LRB- would you believe it -RRB- , and that 's the reason for their cheapness ! Yes , cheap IS cheap !
 These broke after less than one year of light to moderate usage . They did n't wear out -- the leather tore around one of the lacing holes.My biggest surprise was that Rockport would n't do a thing . They said that they can not handle warranty claims.I 've always had good experiences with Rockport , but this certainly gives me pause .
 I had seriously intended to buy a new pair of Rockport Prowalker shoes to replace my wonderful old ones when they wore out but upon closer inspection of the new Prowalkers I see that just too much has been changed.My wonderful old Prowalkers -LRB- model # M9218 -RRB- were manufactured in Hungary , had Vibram rubber soles over two layers , one black , the other gray in color , each being a different density of relatively thick , sponge-like , sub-sole . The soles now look to be molded in one piece , all of some type of synthetic , semi-rigid plastic or rubber that simply say Rockport on the bottom.The entire inside of the uppers on my old Prowalkers is leather lined and the area around the inside of the heel , ankle , and backside of the tongue and lace area are lined with an additional layer of soft , smooth leather.Instead of the additional layer of soft , smooth leather lining , the new Prowalkers appear to be lined with some sort of cloth or synthetic , woven material.Also , the rigid `` Rockport Prowalker '' emblem which is sewed into the leather on the outside/backside of the heel on the uppers of my old Prowalkers is no longer there on the new Prowalkers.As trivial as it may seem , the rigid Prowalker emblem added a measure of extra support and strength to the heel area.Matter of fact , all of the new Rockport shoes I 've looked at recently , including the new Prowalkers , have stated the country of manufacture as China or Vietnam on the size tag located inside the tongue.All in all , I do n't believe I am going to risk buying these new Prowalkers . Just too much of what I can see , and do believe was critical to their outstanding comfort , durability and longevity has been changed , and unfortunately for the worse.I really do hate that , too , because my old Prowalkers are the single most comfortable shoe I 've ever owned , starting the moment I first wore them .
 I will add my voice to the chorus of longtime wearers terribly disappointed w / the quality of the 2012 ProWalker model . My current pair -LRB- purchased in late 2009 -RRB- is my tenth in twice as many years . To date , these shoes have consistently surpassed my expectations in wear , comfort , and support - from day one . And that is exactly how long the 2012 version lasted on my feet ; stiff , narrow , and uncomfortable with every step . The drop in quality is stunning . I believe I now understand why the Rockport dealers have been drying up in my area.On the seller-side , they were quick to process the return with no hassles whatsoever .
 I 've been wearing Rockports for a number of years and have always been very satisfied , but something has changed ! The quality is noticeably declining while the prices remain steady or increase . My latest pair of Prowalkers seem flimsy , provide less support and are made of an ugly grainy leather rather than smooth leather . The new ones have scuffed quite easily within the first month of wear -LRB- my older ones never did scuff -RRB- and they are not as comfortable as previous pairs.When I contacted Rockport customer service , I received a boiler plate reply e-mail that thanked me for my feedback and said they were happy that I like their products . Not the response I was looking for ! I 'm looking for a new brand of walking shoes and casual shoes .
 I ordered the right size shoe , but when they came they were way too tight.I paid for shipping back but I think the error was really Rockports sizes.Not happy . Did not reorder .
 I waited 6 months in order to give a fair review , and hoping somehow the soles would soften up and `` wear in '' . But not happening . No softening up going on . The black color and style is fine but the sole is very hard and uncomfortable . These shoes are terrible , and maybe I got suckered with a knock off or something -LRB- no way to prove -RRB- . I 'm very disappointed with these shoes . I expected better from Rockports . Now I just have to `` make do '' with them . But maybe this is what $ 40 Rockports are . If you like even a hint of cushion in your shoes , these ai n't for you . Instead of walking shoes they 're more like `` walking '' shoes . If you walk a lot at work , these will kill your feet . This is my first ever extremely negative review of any Amazon item , but this is how bad these shoes are . Do n't be regretting like me . Youre way better off buying athletic walking or running shoes . Peace out bro .
 this shoe is not comfortable like running shoe , the sole is hard , and flat , and little heavy .
 I was very dissapointed when I received subject shoes . I thought I was going to receive a high-end of the Prowalker based on the list price of $ 89 on Amazon . I had previously purchased Rockport Prowalker shoes from local stores that were in this price range but they were far more superior ... they had more cushion that made them more comfortable . The only reason why I did not return these shoes is because I only paid $ 29 for them . The shoes were listed at $ 89 marked down to $ 59 and I received an additional $ 30 discount -LRB- gift certificate -RRB- for applying for an Amazon credit card . Believe me , the shoes that I received are not worth $ 89 or even $ 59 ... I basically felt like I was deceived .
 My Rockport shoe size in Australia is USA 9 W however this size was unavailable as an option for selection online . I carefully read the shoe conversion tables provided and ordered what I considered to be the nearest match , size USA 9 M. - These arrived however are far too small -LRB- especially in width -RRB- I sent accurate measurements of my foot size to Amazon however they were unable to assist with my conversion dilemma . They kindly offered to accept a return of the goods however I found that the return freight charge to be almost the same as the cost of the shoes.This is my first order placed through Amazon ... . I have found all communications very friendly and the paperwork etc thorough . Unfortunately the outcome has been disappointing and a total waste of money .
 My order had to be returned because they were the wrong size . When I went to re order they were $ 20 more . Getting the right size without being able to try things on seldom works . I 've got a $ 5 investment in postage and still no shoes . They did look nice .
 As you can see from the picture , this is a shoe with laces . Since the vendor apparently did n't have the item that I ordered , they sent me a loafer instead . But that was n't the end of it . I returned the shoes in the same box , using the Amazon label . Amazon processed the refund and , on the following day , sent me an e-mail confirming receipt of the return . Seven weeks later , I received another e-mail from Amazon stating
 I ordered size 10 1/2 and received size 10 . Did n't notice until I had worn them so too late to send them back .
 Nice shoe except , it does n't conform to standard sizes . I bought the 12N size shoe . My foot is A/AAA . Really narrow feet ! But somehow this shoe is severely pinching my little toes . I walk on my job over 20,000 paces five nights a week . So purchasing these were a waste of money . I 'm willing to try the next size up though and give you a review later . But I suspect that maybe the manufacturer is using the wrong standards -LRB- Intl in lieu of US -RRB- and should publish their sizing standards in the descriptions .
 my last pair of prowalkers had a made in china tag , i 'm not so sure the shoes are of the same quality as before .
 The shoes which I received appeared to have been slightly used . I would not use this merchant adain .
 Yes it does stop you from falling , and yes it does `` look '' comfortable however upon wearing them i discovered that they did not trim a seam on the inside all the way it then proceeded to give me blisters . Save yourself some trouble and just go to Shoes For Crews and you will never be disappointed .
 The sizes were described as `` Kids . '' Our girls wear 4.5 , and so we ordered size 5 . Okey dokey ? Not.The Heely 's arrived and when I opened the box , they looked awfully small . Upon inspection , the box AND the label said `` WO 's 5 , Youth 4 . `` I do n't know what `` WO 's '' is -LRB- Women 's ? -RRB- but we were sold a size 4 Heely , and without enough time to exchange before Christmas .

 Grey color is nice.Shaft a little short and bigger.Shaft cuts off at unattractive place on calf . Not fitted but not the cool shaft that fits a little loose like a motorcycle boot . Cute but boring , Comfortable fit but does n't look good with mini skirts . I liked Mia better . Also loved kenneth cole wan na ride boots . They have more style . I am not a rocker or a biker but low heel boots should have character .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .

 I like Naturalizer shoes and sandels and most times they are very true to size . I order this shoe a size wider and it was still too narrow .

 These shoes are so cute , but run very small . I would suggest you get it at least a size larger than your average size . I bought an 8 1/2 , but I could barely get my foot in it . It was more like a size 7 .
 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 I LOVE how this shoe looks -LRB- got them in purple -RRB- , but it is not comfortable . I wore them out to dinner and my feet were killing me . The part that hurts is where the elasticized back digs into your foot while walking . I am hoping that they will stretch out because I think these shows are really cute !
 Very cute sandals , but they did not wear well . They started making a `` crunching '' sound after only a few wears . The noise was so loud it was actually making people turn and stare , so I had to stop wearing them . I got them on sale for about $ 23 , but the regular price was much more than that . I would not recommend these shoes at either price . I expected better quality from Easy Spirit .

 I just got my shoes now . I have n't worn them yet so ca n't talk about that but these shoes came with visible dark orange or yellow glue on them holding the strap design on the side in place . I bought them for work with possibility of wearing them at other times but the way they look I 'm not ever gon na be able to wear them anywhere else . I do n't even want to wear them to work . I still do n't know if I 'll send them back .

 These shoes were counterfit . I own a real pair of these shoes.The interior lining was different , the impression on the bottom of the sole was different and the top of the shoe was not reinforced with extra canvas to give them dimensional stability . The elastic on the side of the shoe was not up to the quality of the real shoes . I guess you need to question a $ 30.00 difference in price and I should have known what to expect.I returned them and was reimbursed the money from Amazon .
 I searched very carefully for a suitable pair of canvas shoes -LCB- `` Boat Shoes '' if you like . -RRB- . I was delighted when they arrived - until I tried to pull them on.I am an English size 8 , and these American things certainly are NOT . I should have realised that they would have been different.Postage back to you is prohibitive , so I am lumbered with the darned things.I have never been happy buying stuff from America.Dr . Nigel W.Ashworth .
 These are awesome ! I wore them with my police officer uniform . They run small and are very narrow ! They get sweaty and hot . They look AWESOME . If you want to forget all about your problems buy a pair of really AWESOME shoes and you will forget all about your other problems because you will be to busy trying to walk like a model with feet that feel like a thorn bush ! Great Fun Though !
 the very first time my son wore these for a banquet . They came apart at the bottom . The sole was loose in the heel area . I have never had a problem with anything I got from Amazon before : -LRB-
 This is the first time that I 've had an issue with an Amazon product , and I 've bought plenty from Amazon . This pair of shoes for my son was `` gently used '' . I suspect this was a returned item , but it has definately been worn . Since it did not look too bad , and I did n't have time to return it for another pair , I kept it . I would think that the folks responsible for inspecting returned items would do a better job of checking the merchandise before reselling it .

 These shoes are more of a 5 than a 6 . They are labeled as 6M but I even had an aunt who is 5 try them on and they were tight on her .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 I bought these because they were discounted -LRB- under $ 20 -RRB- . I own another pair of Fly Flot shoes called `` Jazz '' and I am veryhappy with Jazz . I thought these shoes `` Dana '' since they looked verymuch like Jazz to me . I must say they may look a likebut they are very different when you put them on . Dana sit higheron your feet and feels very stiff . I have foot problem one of myheels hurt so may be I am more sensitive than others . I just wouldnot buy these shoes again .
 ordered this shoe from amazon and found it to be defective as one shoe toe area was stretched out . Returned with no problem . Then ordered shoe from another source and the same problem was there , one shoe toe area was stretched . I have this shoe in two other colors from other places of purchase and no problem . This shoe has been made from defective materials or forms . I really like fly flot shoes but this particular shoe seems to be defective no matter which seller is used .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 I ordered a women 's stretch overshoe in a medium -LRB- size 6.5-8 -RRB- but was sent a men 's medium . The bar code sticker that was put on the box was incorrect , which I 'm sure is why this mistake happened . However , because of this , I was afraid to try to order a different pair . Amazon sent me a pre-paid return label to that I could easily return the product .
 This product would be OK for someone who wears a narrow size shoe . The boot would not fit over my shoes that are of average width . I returned the product to Aubuchon and 2 weeks after they received it , I still did not have my account credited . I had to call them to get a refund !
 Despite of how cute they look , I decided to give them only 2 stars . There is no padding for your feet and the shoes make loud noises clicking the floor . If you like to pamper your feet , do n't get them .
 These boots where definitely a disappointment from Kenneth Cole . They did not resemble leather in the least . They looked terrible on me ; maybe there is someone out there that they would look good on .
 I love the look of Converse sneakers and have purchased them in the past . I do feel that for the price I paid I was expecting a higher quality of these Converse , vs. the ones I bought at Target for less than $ 20.00 . I was hoping that for over $ 60.00 , these Converse would have a better made insole with arch support and the canvas used on the sneaker was also very flimsy compared to my other Converse 's -LRB- even from Target -RRB- . Also - I ordered a half size down from my normal size -LRB- as requested by the seller -RRB- , they were still a bit to large.I like the look of these shoes but would not purchase another at this price .
 The sizing advertised is all wrong.I wear a size 12 US ASICS , and a size 12 in Converse is 1-1 .5 sizes too big . I had to give them away.I 've learned from this encounter .
 I bought 3 pairs and they are to big for him . They seem to be running a size larger than marked
 I COULD N'T BELIEVE IT !! MY SON OPENED THE BOX OF SHOES TO FIND THE SHOES CAME WITH NO LACES !! HE WAS SO UPSET THAT HE WAS N'T ABLE TO WEAR THEM RIGHT AWAY , BECAUSE IT WAS DEC. 24 EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOTHING WOULD BE OPEN UNTIL DEC. 26 , AND WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR SHOE LACES ??? I 'M GLAD YOU SENT ME THE E MAIL , BECAUSE I 'D LIKE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK !! WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A BRAND NEW PAIR -LRB- WITH LACES -RRB- AT A BETTER PRICE .
 These came as advertised and in a timely manner . What I did n't like was the tear in the elastic band -LRB- which functionally replaces shoelaces -RRB- on the right shoe . This causes the my right heel to come out of the shoe when I walk simply because the shoe is not tight enough . There is also a tear in the piece of canvas on the left shoe that holds the grommets . When I walk the hole opens up on the side of my foot.I 'm wearing these because I 'm in Afghanistan and have no other sneakers to use until the replacement set I ordered from another vendor arrives . Returning these would not be practical as it involved significant bother and cost using the military postal system . If the vendor had sent a non-defective pair of sneakers in the first place there would be no reason for this bad review .
 These shoes are not like your Chucks from back in the day . I had a pair of similar Converse branded all-hemp shoes previously which were far more durable . The first week of wear introduced a series of streamer threads splitting out from the ` shoestring ' area . It is a design intention -LRB- a la ` cut-offs ' -RRB- . Looks pretty shaggy for new shoes , but some of the appeal is no doubt the show of impermenance . If you need shoes for everyday wear and you ca n't buy a new pair every month , I would go with a more durable shoe .
 I thought it would be great to get slip-on chucks , but these are imposible ! i struggled for sooooo long each time i tried to put them on because the stitching comes up pretty high and decided to cut them a bit . Good idea , but did n't help at all . ended up chucking the chucks . boo
 I had to return my first pair of converse because the size was wrong . I resent that I had to pay to ship them back as this is the third pair of shoes I had to pay to return . The new pair fit fine
 I usually love Chuck 's . bought these for my boyfriend and a month later the heel was completely separated from the sole . I tried to return the shoes but i was one day late on the return policy . Not pleased , wo n't buy from here again .
 I was not pleased with the product I received . Before I purchased the product I would have liked to have known that the colour black is not what you think ! I still think I was sent the wrong colour shoes -LRB- they look like they 're navy blue not black -RRB- . When I emailed the company about this they ignored me and did not offer for me to send them back or anything , so I was not happy with them at all.I will not be purchasing from them again !
 These shoes look great . But when I received them the size was wring ci had to return them and had to pay for it . Then the shop costumer service told ne that I made a mistake in the size . Which is not true . And they were not sure whether they reimburse me.I got my money back but I was not happy with this experience . And I still dont have my shoes .
 Ordered over a month ago , emailed seller and still have yet to hear back . I think i am considdering it a loss about now . Funny how quickly they were to take my payment but not send out fast ...
 When I purchase a pair of shoes in the USA I expect them to be USA sizes not UK sizes . I had to return the shoes I bought not once but TWICE cos the people at this company could n't follow my first returned instructions nor did the person I spoke to on the phone ! IDIOTS.The third time they were delivered I was promised next day delivery which never happened . I did finally receive the correct shoes 2 days later , which ended up being over 3 weeks from my original order.Good luck to anyone using this company !!! Shoemania
 I would like to return this pair shoe . It 's not fit me . Please send me a return form . Thanks !
 Easy Spirit Women 's Coconut Bay Sandal , Lt Natural ,8.5 MThis shoe was very , very wide . It was even too wide for my sister , who has a wider foot than I do . Too bad , because it is a cute shoe .
 Unlike other Mezlan shoes I 've purchased , this shoe is made of cheap leather . It was on sale from just over $ 200.00 to $ 75.00 . I know why now . The Mezlan Carmichaels are far superior to these shoes . I would definitely not recommend them .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I ordered these boots in size 12 m regular toe . They came in a box marked 12 m but the boots were 10 m . They did not fit also they had steel toes that I did not want . I do like these boots I have had 4 pairs that I bought from Sears over the years . I thought I would save some money online but it did n't work out . Just a wast of time . I went back to Sears
 Unlike other Mezlan shoes I 've purchased , this shoe is made of cheap leather . It was on sale from just over $ 200.00 to $ 75.00 . I know why now . The Mezlan Carmichaels are far superior to these shoes . I would definitely not recommend them .
 In spite of reading a review from another purchaser about these shoes squeeking , I bought them anyway and continually regret it . They squeek loudly and continually ; it is embarrasing to walk in a quiet place . I thought that if there were a squeek , it would be minimal and livable , however it is NOT . They are essentially unwearable in public . They are cute , they are comfortable , and I got them on sale , but i still feel I wasted my money . Hope you do n't make the same mistake . I 'd be curious if someone else bought them and they did not squeek .
 Bough a 2nd pair , thought maybe the first pair was defective . Seems to be a design flaw , though . The sole squeaks loudly with every step . Wast of hard earned money . Big disappointment , they are comfortable , too !

 I found these to be very uncomfortable in a short period of time . I know they are supposed to massage your feet , but for me , they just hurt after 30 minutes .
 I got these for my wife since she always complains of leg aches . Saw the sharp edges to massage feet and thought it would be good . My wife did not really like them but is putting up with it - `` something is better than nothing `` I tried them and felt the same - not a great way to soothe your aching legs.I would not recommend this to others - for the price you pay it 's not a good buy .
 The item that was order and expected was not what I received . This was a very big dissapointment on Christmas morning when presents were being opened .
 I bought these to replace my black ones that were lost years ago and so far they are n't nearly as comfortable . They may take a few more months of breaking in , but I dont remember the other ones hurting this much to begin with : -LRB-
 Two weeks after I purchased them the little pink message things started falling out and they were all over my floor . Now the sandals are useless .
 i was disappointed in the color of the adidas women 's sandals that I ordered . It looked like they were black and white -LRB- not pink -RRB- in the picture . I chose not to pay the postage to return them .
 I bought these shoes and liked the feel . However , within a month , many of the nubs broke off . I contacted Adidas for a return pair . They do n't reimburse for return postage . No one from Adidas ever responded . Do n't waste your money on these ; buy another brand , or expect to find that they will deteriorate in short order .
 Okay , so I love pink stuff , and these are pink , but the little bumpies on the in-soles hurt the bottom of my feet after a while . If I wear them with socks , then it does n't hurt . Also they run really big . I am a 7-1/2 to 8 , but I am able to fit into size 6-7 of these shoes . Interesting . I say
 I purchased these shoes because I have neuropathy in my feet . I imagined that the innersole having the rubbber spikes would be good for blood circulation . I was wrong , they were terribly painful . I was going to give them to my daughter who loves sandals and she gave them back to me saying they were too painful . I then asked my granddaughter who is 11 to try them and she had the same problem . All along I thought it was me . Others in the reviews raved about them . Sorry I could n't join your praise .
 We liked the idea of these massaging sandals . However , they are poorly designed because the tiny massaging pegs came loose and broke off not long after we started using them . My wife and I are not overweight people -LRB- athletic build -RRB- and only use these sandals around the house -LRB- not for hight impact activities -RRB- . We were both very disappointed with this product from a name brand company like Adidas . We would not recommend this product for anyone since they begin breaking so soon .
 I have been wearing these type of sandals for many years , the brand I loved quit making them and I have been searching for a suitable replacement since , the big problem with these Adidas is the half dollar size logo at the heel right where there should be massaging `` nubs '' I feel the logo with every step I take . What I do n't understand is the decision in the design department that thought this was a good idea since there is a huge logo going across the front of the foot , what 's up with that ? I will be continuing my search for the best replacement for my old ones as these do not cut it !
 I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11 . They run large , which is strange for being from the same company . They are super thin , light , and only stay comfortable for about a half hour . Afterwards your feet WILL hurt . I do n't recommend them , even though they look cool . Comfort is a must , so I will be going back to my beloved 574 's .

 We recently placed an order with Amazon for these shoes in brown . They arrived and were better than we anticipated in looks and comfort . Tried to place an order today on line and over the phone and was dissapointed to find that the price we paid originally $ 39.90 had gone up to $ 67.90 . They would absolutely not budge on this even though I could have ordered additional pairs on our original order for the lower price . In addition , finding Amazon.com customer service number was no easy feat . For those of you who would like to get absolutely nowhere and talk to an uresponsive/uncaring service rep the number is 800-201-7575 . Pretty useless if you 're looking for outstanding customer care ... do n't look to AMAZON !
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio .

 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11 . They run large , which is strange for being from the same company . They are super thin , light , and only stay comfortable for about a half hour . Afterwards your feet WILL hurt . I do n't recommend them , even though they look cool . Comfort is a must , so I will be going back to my beloved 574 's .
 I 've got these shoes and they look good , but after some minutes of constant using you will feel the hardness of the sole and they will become uncomfortable.Recommended only for using occasionally and for some minutes . Otherwise you will end with feet pain .
 First , I have to admit the shoes look gorgeous . That is why I ordered them and gave 2 stars here . But it is so difficult for me to walk because the wedge heels lack elasticity so for every step the shoes would slip off the heels of my feet . I kind of feel myself like an acrobat on these high wedge heels . Have to return them although they look beautiful .
 The shoes are great looking , but the heels are very heavy . The style of the top of the shoes is flattering , however , there is nothing to help keep the shoes on my feet . There is no flexability to the heel at all , so when my foot bends ... the heel stays down and I walked right out of the shoes . I do n't care for ankle straps , but I think this shoe needs something . I usually LOVE the comfort of Nine West shoes , so I was disappointed .
 Looks can be deceiving ! This shoe is so cute and stylish , but it hurts my foot like crazy . I used shoe stretch , asked my daughter to walk in them , hoping for some kind of relief . The sole is hard an does not bend making me walk very strange and uncomfortable . NOT a walking shoe , but if you want to sit and be cute , nice shoe ! Sorry Nine West .
 The boots dig into the heel of the foot . The leather is very stiff and the boots are not very comfortable.NOT RECOMMENDED
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .

 they are not really comfortable and just missing something . look worse than on the picture . i was going to send them back but then just got too lazy . probably a good pair to have in the car for driving , but not to wear .

 I bought this to replace a pair of Adidas Mega Bounce . This shoes do not have as much cushion and comfort as the Mega Bounce . I bought it because Amazon did n't have a pair of Mega Bounce on my size.It is ok for short distance walking but for long distance walking and running , I need more cushioning . I felt pain in my toes after a mile and I could use a bit more arch support .

 These sandals were not comfortable , they felt stiff and the straps cut into my feet . They looked okay , but that did n't make up for it . Returned them .

 Cute , but runs really narrow and I ordered a half size larger than my daughter takes .
 I agree with the previous reviewer who says it runs large . Potential to be very beautiful and comfortable - but only at the right fit . I wear Trotters size 8.5 - but this `` Janet '' pump fit me about a full size larger than those do - even though it says `` 8.5 ''
 Once again the shoes did not measure up to their advertisement . I wear a size 9AA and these shoes did not fit well at all . I think that I will stop buying shoes from Amazon .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 I am appalled at the quality of these boots . The materials would look cheap next to a $ 20 pair of shoes . Most of the boot is constructed of plastic and some kind of nylon tricot-y cheesy backing . The leather -LRB- which is more likely some kind of leather byproduct like that glued-together stuff -RRB- is paper thin and from looking at where it is seamed appears to be a veneer over some other material . This is the first negative review I 've written , but beware . The box says made in USA , but the boots say made in China . I almost hope they 're really bad knockoffs , because if not this manufacturer has dropped to a truly sad level and is , in fact , deceptive in their description in my opinion .

 What was I thinking ?? I am too old for shoes with hearts on them !! The leather is very rigid and crackled-they look defective . They do not move with the foot because they are so stiff . They were returned . They seemed to run a half size large .
 Unlike other Mezlan shoes I 've purchased , this shoe is made of cheap leather . It was on sale from just over $ 200.00 to $ 75.00 . I know why now . The Mezlan Carmichaels are far superior to these shoes . I would definitely not recommend them .
 Although this shoe is really lacking in the comfort area , I gave it 2 stars for price as I purchased it for just under $ 25 . I 'll be sure to wear them when much walking is n't required .
 these shoe is not the same that i have before , this dont have cushion , its hard on the foot , compared to the one i got couple of years ago , i still have it , and even untill now after so many years of using it , is still comfy compared to this one ! this sucks ! im thinking of returning this .

 I had to return these boots . The soles were totally different in appearance and texture . I do n't know if I just got a lemon or if quality control is a serious issue . I 've owned several pairs of these boots over the years . The used to wear like iron and were as comfortable as a pair of your favorite slippers , but my last couple of pairs have fallen apart . It seems to me that the `` Wolverine '' name is becoming synonomous with `` Garbage '' .
 First of all , I 'm Mary Graham , not Jessica Shoemaker . I 'd really like these shoes if the white part were black . Please make some of those shoes , all black , the way you used to .

 Unfortunately , I 'm unhappy with this pair of shoes . I typically love cole haan shoes ... have over 20 pairs . But the tip of these shoes showed up unglued ? Never had this happen before w / this name brand . I guess there 's a first time for everything .
 I bought these shoes believing Cole Haan would provide me a comfortable yet stylish work shoe , which is really all I wanted . I wear a 15 EE , so trying shoes on in the store is not an option . After reading other reviews I decided to give it a go . Well , it 's been a few months and I 'm still not happy with my shoes.From the start , they were narrow as all get out , and since returning them was n't an option , I just kept wearing them until they finally broke in , which took about a month . The current problem I have is that the `` visible NIKE AIR Technology in the heel '' is n't doing ANYTHING . The sole is HARD , and when I walk in them , I can feel the impact of each step.On the plus side , the leather and stitching is top-notch . However , that 's not enough for me . For my next work shoe purchase , I 'll be trying a different brand . In the meantime , these are too expensive to just not wear ...
 Please dont buy this !! , they are very hard on the top . I call Peltz shoes to return them but sadly my sister who gave them to me as a present lost the original shoe box , so i coul n't , im stuck with them !!! = -LRB-
 nice looking shoe but not made for the wider foot ... must be the most uncomfortable shoe that i have paid 100 dollars fot ... if you have narrow feet , you might haver better luck ... they are sitting in my closet right now after one wearing ... thats too bad

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I had to return these boots . The soles were totally different in appearance and texture . I do n't know if I just got a lemon or if quality control is a serious issue .

 Unfortunately , I 'm unhappy with this pair of shoes . I typically love cole haan shoes ... have over 20 pairs . But the tip of these shoes showed up unglued ? Never had this happen before w / this name brand . I guess there 's a first time for everything .
 I bought these shoes believing Cole Haan would provide me a comfortable yet stylish work shoe , which is really all I wanted . I wear a 15 EE , so trying shoes on in the store is not an option . After reading other reviews I decided to give it a go . Well , it 's been a few months and I 'm still not happy with my shoes.From the start , they were narrow as all get out , and since returning them was n't an option , I just kept wearing them until they finally broke in , which took about a month . The current problem I have is that the `` visible NIKE AIR Technology in the heel '' is n't doing ANYTHING . The sole is HARD , and when I walk in them , I can feel the impact of each step.On the plus side , the leather and stitching is top-notch . However , that 's not enough for me . For my next work shoe purchase , I 'll be trying a different brand . In the meantime , these are too expensive to just not wear ...
 Please dont buy this !! , they are very hard on the top . I call Peltz shoes to return them but sadly my sister who gave them to me as a present lost the original shoe box , so i coul n't , im stuck with them !!! = -LRB-
 nice looking shoe but not made for the wider foot ... must be the most uncomfortable shoe that i have paid 100 dollars fot ... if you have narrow feet , you might haver better luck ... they are sitting in my closet right now after one wearing ... thats too bad
 I 've had at least one pair of florsheim dress shoes for regular use since the late 80s . My current pair is the one being reviewed here . After about 6 months , right shoe had the outside seam going down the heal started coming unstitched . I was able to overlook this quality issue since it only unstitched about 1 inch and did not effect the wearability . Today , about 2 years since purchase , the same shoe had the sole split across the middle . There is still lots of wear available on the sole , it seems that the material chosen for the sole was not a good choice . I 'll be buying some replacement shoes but they wo n't be Florsheim ... I do n't think they are the quality shoes they used to be .
 This man is a rip off , screwed me over big time . DO NOT GIVE HIM YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!!!!
 This high heel shoe was not what i asked for . It looked like a comfortable , gel-padded shoe in the picture , but in reality it is a hard plasticy shoe that gives you blisters on your feet . I wore this for four hours and had to wear athletic shoes and put bandaids on my numerous blisters for two days.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE FREAKISHLY SKINNY FEET AND A LOW INSTEP .
 You ca n't beat this shoe for comfort , but they 're definately cuter in the picture . I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel did n't quite seem to fit the shoe . I returned them .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 I hate the boots ! I purchased a pair for $ 110 in October of 2012 . After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder . Regardless of the floor surface ; carpet , concrete , or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder . It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem . I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $ 15 . Thanksgiving goes by , then Christmas , then New Years with no word about my shoes . Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes . A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland . I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again . I am out $ 125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise .

 This shoe is very cute but the fabric is so stiff and rough that it made it impossible for me to wear them for more than 1/2 hour before I took them off . I do not like to have to `` break '' a shoe in . It 's not just uncomfortable in the achilles area but around the front edge of where the fabric rubs on the foot as well . If there was some sort of padding sewn into the area under where you see the ribbon , then it would have made a big difference in the quality of the shoe . Oh well , I guess I got what I paid for .

 My son loves the appearance of the shoe , but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description : - leather-Soft , calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper . I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising .
 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .
 I had to return these boots . The soles were totally different in appearance and texture . I do n't know if I just got a lemon or if quality control is a serious issue . I 've owned several pairs of these boots over the years . The used to wear like iron and were as comfortable as a pair of your favorite slippers , but my last couple of pairs have fallen apart . It seems to me that the `` Wolverine '' name is becoming synonomous with `` Garbage '' .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 Bought these for my son to use for soccer and t-ball . Good price , but got ta do something different . The back of the heel sticks up and rubs the ankle . The cleats are better for turf than grass or dirt . Would be okay for his age if it were n't for the heel issue.Fit was good . They also have a lace flap that is apparently tucked in for their photo .
 My 9 year old wears a 3 1/2 shoe and I bought these a half size bigger in a 4 . His foot would not go in them . They fit more like his brothers size 2 shoe . I returned them the same day ,
 Deseo la devoluci&oacute;n del producto porque no me lo pueden enviar con los demas productos , y ademas la talla elegida es demasiado grande para la medida del ni & ntilde ; o

The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 I had to return these boots . The soles were totally different in appearance and texture . I do n't know if I just got a lemon or if quality control is a serious issue . I 've owned several pairs of these boots over the years . The used to wear like iron and were as comfortable as a pair of your favorite slippers , but my last couple of pairs have fallen apart . It seems to me that the `` Wolverine '' name is becoming synonomous with `` Garbage '' .

 I ordered this slipper in size 13 for my boyfriend who wears a 12 and would you believe that it was about 2 '' too small . There seems to be some problem with the sizing .
 I have had this pair of shoes for 3 years and lately in the last 6 months I have discovered the shoe grabs and causes me to pitch forward . . i 'm wondering if anyone else have had this problem ? . .

 Prior to purchasing these shoes , I read a review where the reviewer experienced discomfort with this style . However , I 'd owned several pairs of Reebok Classics in the past so I felt this was a lone bad review . Unfortunately I should have heeded the advice given by the prior review . These shoes were SO UNcomfortable after only being worn for a few hours , that I could n't wait to get home to get them off my feet ! After wearing them only a short time the bottom of my feet were near raw and very sore . I 've never experienced my feet hurting after long-term wear of sneakers ! My experience was so bad that I only wore these shoes once . I do not recommend them .
 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .

 They shipped the wrong size and wrong color . I sent both boots back and never got a refund . They owe me $ 120 . Amazon said I did n't resolve it according to their policy so they are absolved . I am upset - got no help from anyone . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SHOE MANUFACTURER AND KNOW YOUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS WITH AMAZON .

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 these shoes are very cute indeed . . i bought the black in these shoes and a 9.5 which is my exact size and they a bit tight . i find that they are small for the size . they are very narrow to the top , so order with caution , u may need to order a half-size bigger . they are supposed to be leather so i hope they stretch cuz they really are cute !

 I am on my feet 10-12 hours aday at work . I was looking for a pair of shoes that would be comfortable throughout the day . So I bought a pair of Spira Classic men 's shoes . After wearing them 3-4 hours , I had to switch back to wearing my old ones . The springs in the front of the shoes began to hurt . I thought at first I needed to give it some time and allow the shoes to break in and to allow the my feet to adjust to the shoes . I then was going to give it a month for the break-in period , but after wearing them for 3-4 hours for 2 days my feet were in very painful . I had to stop wearing them . I then tried wearing them once a week for 3-4 hours . Once again my feet became painful and I had to switch back to my old shoes . I believe the problem with the shoes is in the springs . The springs are much to hard to walk on and that there is no give . I would NOT recommend buying a pair of these shoes .
 I am a Banquet Food Server and was looking for a good work shoes ! ... well after purchasing these shoes , I am still looking !!! 1st these are Heavy shoes2nd my feet NEVER hurt so bad after using these shoesI started to break them in doing some none banquet work -LRB- desk job -RRB- , I then had 1 banquet shift and they seemed fine . but the next week I had a week of doubles -LRB- Breakfast & Lunches -RRB- . The 1st day my feet were sore , the 2nd day it was worse , and the 3rd day I could barely walk to the car . The pain in the balls/pads of my feet was unbelievable . I switched back to my 2 year old shoes for the final 2 days of work and my feet were fine . The spring in the balls of your feet must of caused this as the soles are plenty thick -LRB- an inch and a half thick -RRB- . I must note that I had put inserts in these shoes for additional padding when I had this pain , ca n't imagine how bad it would have been if I had no inserts!The only good thing I can say about then is that my arches -LRB- plantar fasciitis -RRB- did not bother me at all .
 I have purchased 5 pairs of spira shoes and will not waste anymore money on them.They have a good idea and work good on cement with comfort for bad knees and back but the quality is junk.Spira measures quality by milage and believe mese willnot make it out of the house , i have to keep glueing the soles back together one place after another maybe i will get them completly re glued and they will work.I HAVE WATCHED THE QUALITY KEEP DECLINEING OVER THE PAST 4YEARS TRYING DIFFERENT STYLES AND THEY KEEP DECLINING DO YOU SELF A FAVOR AND BUY SOME OTHER BRAND .
 In there ad they claim because of the steel springs the sloes do not compress as much as conventional shoes . I supinate with my right foot and she shoes compressed on the outside a lot on my first use . It 's the only time I was able to wear them . They were uncomfortable and gave me ankle pain .
 This shoe is basically a gimmick . Very cheaply made , wears out very fast . For the price I was amazed at how poorly constructed it was . I was not impressed with this product at all . A little over a month the sole was wearing down , the top looked very worn , and I think the spring inside broke because the shoe started to lean to one side . I attempted to contact the manufacturer who only told me to return it to the place of purchase . When I told them that it was past 30 days and I could n't send it back they essentially told me that I was out of luck . I will never buy a shoe made by this company again .
 I recently bought this sneaker , the fit was great right out of the box . I am an RN and have knee issues . When I put the sneakers on they felt comfortable . I walked around for one day with them . That night my knees became swollen and painful . Two weeks have passed and my knees still hurt . I attempted to return the sneakers but they were sent back to me . I am very upset and disappointed with this company and would not recommend this sneaker or this company to anyone . The company also advertised a 100 % satisfaction guarentee . It appears they will not honor this statement .
 I bought these shoes because of all of the hype that they are comfortable . I am on my feet most of the day . I wore them for 2 days and I had to take them off because the shoes only caused pain and agony to my feet . The concept is good about the springs . The reality is that the springs are very hard and have no give . I tried these shoes off and on for a month . I even went to the store and bought padded inserts . The inserts did n't help either . I tried everything I could think of to help make them comfortable . Nothing worked ! I just did n't want to throw away a pair of shoes that I had spent so much money on . The bottom line is that I would never buy another pair of Spira shoes .
 Does n't fit the way I want it to . Since I had to wear them and the return policy said they had to be unopened or unused , I can not return them .
 ITried them on and sent them right back.To tight hurt my foot I need a big EEEE width this felt like a 2E

 I owned a pair of Doc Martens for 10 years and when they gave out I ordered this pair . Unlike my last pair , these were extremely uncomfortable . I could n't wear them without pain , so I returned them .
 shoe size was wrong , felt like the shoes were seconds . Sent them back for a replacement , or refund on the 26th of Dec. today is the 19th of Jan. and still have not received any new shoes , or heard from anyone via , e-mail , or phone . Customer service sucks since they already received payment from credit card . But the shoes look really nice ... if they fit anyone from america ??
 I would not recommend this sandal . I received it and within a week , the stone fell out .
 The boots dig into the heel of the foot . The leather is very stiff and the boots are not very comfortable.NOT RECOMMENDED
 SanFran Jo says : I , too , noticed a difference in fit and also that the pair I recently purchased was made in China . I had to return my pair because they were not comfortable . I already have two other pair of Dansko Professional clogs , and they are very comfortable . I am disappointed in the comfort of the most recent pair I purchased . I have noticed that some of the clogs do say by Danita . Thanks to happy mommy mentioning Sanita , I googled Sanita clogs . Below is a statement found online from the Original Clogs website : For the last 17 years , all Dansko Professional clogs and all Dansko Stapled Clogs have been manufactured by Sanita in Europe . The relationship between Dansko and Sanita ended in August 2007 . Since then , Sanita entered the US market and is now distributing their products directly . If you are looking for the Original stapled clogs with patent number 0060240 stamped on the bottom -LRB- made by Sanita exclusively -RRB- , then look no further as our website features Sanita Clogs ' products exclusively.I ordered the `` original '' clogs by Sanita and they fit as comfortably as the two other pair I have . The number mentioned above is stamped on the bottom .
 first off for $ 120.00 there should not even be any vinyl on them but the plastic vinyl covering the piping is coming off after 1 month of use so i will need to use a black marker to hide it dansko was great till they left sanita now they are cheaply made in china , hungry , italy , and they dont even fit these are some of the problems i have found over the last 3 months i have tried aprox 50 pairs of dansko cabrio professional i should be waring a 37 -LRB- us size 7 -RRB- but now i cant , i need a 38 and most of the 38 are too small also 1 shoe bigger than the other in some pairs the left is tight and the right shoe feels great and in some pairs the right is too tight and the left feels great then after of 3 months and 50 pairs of trying on the pair i did keep the VINYL piping is coming off dansko is no longer good i will now only buy sanita COME ON DANSKO YOU ARE TAKING THE CHEEP AND EASY and you soon will loose customers
 2 consecutive blow outs of the Dansko oiled Cutter style shoes . The first pair split one of the soles at 10 months of use . This was in July of 2009 . Took them back to the store where they were purchased and they sent them back to Dansko to see if they would honor a replacement . They did , although the process took 4 months before I got the replacement pair . Fast forward to last Sept 3 2010 . After less than 9 months of usage one of the soles on the replacement pair not only split completely across the sole but separated on both sides . Plenty of usable tread on the soles so they were not worn out at all . So of course I take them back to the store they came from . Manager of the store calls me today and says they can not help me because now Dansko only has a 6 month warranty on failures and I have to contact them on my own . I 'll see what happens . Dansko = ExpensivePoorly made in China .6 Month warrantyEPIC FAIL !
 Dansko 's quality has continually declined since their split with Sanita a few years back in 2007 . Sanita made the Dansko clogs for years until Dansko went their separate way and decided to produce their clog elsewhere , so now Dansko 's are now made in China , whereas Sanita 's are still made in Europe . The quality difference is VERY evident.Not realizing that Dansko was n't held to the same standard as it used to be I ordered a Dansko professional and the professional XP as well . They were so clunky , huge and heavy , I felt like a child wearing my dad 's shoes !! Plus the sizes on the Dansko 's were so inconsistent I was n't able to find a size that fit , even when I went to the Walking company store and tried on several different pairs of the same size , one 38 was almost right , the next was way too tight , one 39 was way to wide , the next just plain huge in every way.Dansko will accredit it to the hand made feature but those of us who have been wearing hand made clogs for some time can attest to the fact that it is so much more than that , Dansko is just not the same shoe that made it famous in the first place . Now it 's just poor quality . I wear a 7.5 US , sometimes an 8 which put me perfectly in a size 38 . Whereas a 38 used to fit me perfectly now they are too short and my big toe smashes every so slightly up against the end to the shoe when I take a step , well no biggie , I 'll just order up one size . So i ordered the 39 which was so huge it flopped off with every step , even with thick socks there was just no way to make them work . 38 's too small , 39 way to big . why the huge jump ?! I have a normal foot , never worn or needed to wear a narrow or wide ever in my life so when these shoes fit so incredibly wide and clompy , I knew that it was n't my foot but their shoe.But the most disappointing point of all was that the quality had noticeably declined.I had the same issue with the XP 's . And a little known fact about the XP memory foam version is that the memory foam base will only last a few months TOPS before going flat , and the cost to replace just the inserts is $ 40 a pair ... ouch ! So after I realized that Danskos would n't work anymore , I decided to search for another clog , that 's when I did some research and discovered that Dansko had made the break from the original maker of the shoe -LRB- sanita -RRB- . I did n't realize that you could actually order Sanita 's until then . That 's when I decided to try a pair of Sanita clogs instead . SOO happy that I did !!! Now I have the quality I remember in a size that fits perfectly . So for those of you on the fence ... try Sanita 's instead . THey were the makers of Dansko that made them famous in the first place . They are better quality , better materials , not made in China , and not so wide you can barely keep them on without sizing down to the point where they are way too small . You wo n't be disappointed . However , due take note because when I went to scrubs and beyond to try the KOI clogs -LRB- made by Sanita as well -RRB- to get an idea of sizing , I did chose to size up so now I wear a size 39 , but who cares ... the quality is back and they actually fit !!
 I was SHOCKED at how uncomfortable these shoes were , after having worn and loved Dansko brand for many years . I found out that the company changed manufacturers -LRB- made in China now -RRB- and the quality of both fit and comfort is so much more obviously underpar ... I literally could not believe how these shoes could pinch and hurt my feet so much in one evening ! I mean , we are not talking about high fashion platform shoes here.I have attached this info from the Sanita shoe website -LRB- the old Danish company that USED to make Dansko clogs -RRB- : `` For many years Sanita manufactured clogs for Dansko . The Sanita and Dansko relationship ended in the Fall 2007 . Since then , all Sanita manufactured products sold in the USA have been sold exclusively under the Sanita brand . `` There you have it . Save your money and your feet . Sanita still makes clogs , thank goodness . Dansko on the other hand ... same high price , but NOT the same shoes .
 I work in a pharmacy and I am on my feet up to 12 hours a day . I had heard so much about how great Dansko shoes are . I got this pair and I was so excited because they are a very nice looking shoe . I wore them 1 day and decided that there was just no way I could keep them . They are way to heavy . I was trying to find a shoe that would help reduce the swelling in my ankle an old injury I still have trouble with -RRB- . My feet were aching and my BOTH ankles were very swollen . Maybe it was just this style ? I have spoken with many nurses that love Dansko and would n't put on any other kind . But for me , I 'm going to have to go back to the Born Toby . Sorry ... I really wanted thee to work out .
 I like these shoes but recently they have gotten tight !! Or my feet are swollen I wear them with thin socks and they still are a pain
 I decided to replace my old Dansko clogs with this style and color . After wearing it for an entire shift at work , I developed blisters . I felt that the insole were hard . I was disappointed with this particular style . I like the color .
 These shoes were advertized as being very comfortable . Nothing could be further from the truth . They were so uncomfortable that I can no longer wear them . I even tried to have them professionally stretched twice , to no avail . They are very tight over the top of your foot . OUCH !! What a waste of $ 100 .
 I used to buy them for my whole office but , we have noticed a big difference in quality . The company use to be a lot more personably and cared about each customer . I had a very bad experience with one of the managers there . There are plenty of really good shoe companies so , bye bye Dansko .
 Dansko 's have a great reputation but buying them on line is a bad idea . Dansko 's need to be tried on as they are individually made and sizes are very difficult to judge . I ordered a pair that I thought would fit perfectly , they were too small and I had to reorder my shoes . And return the original pair . I made my initial order on August 29 , 2009 . Today is September 29 , 2009 and I have not received my shoes . All of my friends that wear Dansko 's love them but have urged me never to buy them on line again .
 This was my second pair of Dansko professional clogs and again , they did n't fit properly . I wear a size 10 and therefore purchased a size 41 on my first purchase . They 're extremely tight fitting across the top middle section of my feet and my feet were actually NUMB after wearing them for just an hour . I could n't stand it any longer than that and did n't want to risk permanent nerve or some type of circulatory damage to my feet . My feet also slipped out of the heels frequently . The second purchase was even worse ! I purchased a larger size , 42 , thinking that it would alleviate some of the problems and ended up barely able to even put my foot into the right shoe and could n't even get my foot into the left shoe at all . They were extremely tight and unforgiving . I HATE DANSKO 'S ! I could n't give them anything less than one star and would actually give that star for the way they look . I actually loved the color and style . They 're just poorly made for the price . I ended up buying Klogs brand which look very similiar to Dansko 's and cost about $ 10 less on average .
 They started out comfortable especially since I travel and work on the hospital floor supporting physicians and nurses during EMR implementations . I had a pair of reliable flats , but I needed something with a heel . It all went south when I went to pick up my rental car in San Francisco . Walking on the pavement , I sprained my ankle and fell in the lot . I simply attributed it to clumsiness and the slanted driveway . It was n't a bad sprain and I wore the shoes without any issues afterwards.That was until I parked my car in the cobblestone driveway and wiped out again when I hit the incline . This time it was a little more bloody . Ended up with a swelling , bloody knee , a tetanus shot and grounded by the Medical Clinic at the airport for three days . I concluded that I could n't possibly be that clumsy . I realized that the only thing that changed was my shoes and both times I wore them walking in a driveway , I went down . So if you must have them , be sure to stay on level ground.Mine went back to the store and I have an appointment with an orthopedics specialist .
 Was disappointed that these Dansko 's are not as comfortable as my other pair of Dansko 's . These run a little big and slide on my heel . Also , the top rubs the top of my instep and something about them makes the top of the bottom of my left foot sore . Will still try another pair of Dansko 's later , however .
 My wife ordered these to wear to work . She is on her feet almost continually . When they did n't fit as well as the REAL Dansko 's she was replacing , we looked inside and saw why . MADE IN CHINA was stenciled on the uppers . We got our money back but no wonder they were such a good `` bargain '' . Always make certain they are not knockoffs when you buy . The original Dansko 's are great shoes for working people .
 I work in restaurants , so I 'm on my feet for 6-14 hours a day , and I heard so many good things about Danskos I thought I would buy a pair . They were really comfortable for a long time , but the first pair I bought was patent leather , and the leather was tearing around the toe and it was squeaking while I walked . So I returned those and got a plain ol' leather pair , and those too were ok for a good 6 months . Now , not even a year later , the colour on the inside of the shoe is rubbing off on my socks , turning my white socks nearly black , and even going through and staining the soles of my feet . On top of that , I come home every night and my feet are stiff and swollen , and I 'm starting to have aches in my knees . I got some gel inserts and they 've helped marginally . I understand I may be putting quite a bit of stress on these shoes , but I think a 120 dollar pair of shoes that markets itself as `` occupational shoes '' should not be doing this in less than a year of use . I wo n't be buying another pair in the future , to save my knees and my back .
 I bought the Dansko Pro in a wide width because I needed a great pair of sturdy , comfortable shoes to work in . I have owned another pair in the past and was really happy with them , so I did n't even question my decision to order this shoe . No place in my area carries this brand , and the closest place does n't carry the wide width , so I ordered them online . Big mistake on my part!One shoe fits great but is n't nearly as comfortable as my other pair had been , but the other shoe barely fits . It 's really tight all the way around and makes my foot go numb . I realize that they 're handmade , but there should be some way for the company to ensure that both shoes are made similarly enough that they can actually fit as a pair . I was so disappointed that I had spent so much money on a pair of shoes I ca n't wear , for multiple reasons . I had to buy a different pair of shoes and they 're more comfortable , but I still have n't found any that offer what I 'm looking for or what my first pair of Dansko shoes did .
 the clogs would have great if they were the correct color and came on time . I paid for expedited shipping and should have gotten them in 3 days . It took over a week and they were the wrong color . The shoe company was very nasty and refused to refund my shipping , and when i returned the shoes , they refused to give me a credit , claiming they never got them . UPS sent me the name of the person who signed for them at their store !!! This company is horrible , I would never order from them again . The seller was Shoes Central . Do n't order from them , they are awful . I would give them zero stars but that is not an option
 I have heard nothing but good things about these shoes but when I bought a pair and put them on , I just could n't stand them . I bought a half size larger because I have a wider foot but they just dug into my instep like a torture device . Perhaps they are only for people with narrow feet and low insteps .
 I have bought white pair few years ago and loved it so much I wanted another pair . However , I have recently tried 3 new pairs of Dansko clogs -LRB- all dark colors -RRB- and they all dye my socks . They are extremelly comfortable but I hated to see my white socks dyed after few hours of wearing the clogs . I returned the shoes -LRB- black and blueberry colors -RRB- and ended up with Dansko Nubuck in light blue . The inside is light brown . That too does dye my socks , but at least it is not black.It is still the most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned , but be ready to see your white socks black .
 I have n't even received my order and am furious with Amazon ! I was charged twice for my order by Amazon and when I called Customer Service I was told the first charge was a pre-authorization and I should contact my bank about getting it credited back . So I did call my bank and was told that if Amazon would send a fax explaining what had happened the bank would credit my account for the $ 99.99 . I again spoke to an Amazon Customer Service rep and was told they could submit my request to billing but it would take at least 3 days for my request to be processed . Word of wisdom
 I have worn Dansko 's for over 20 years and never had any problems . They have always been my favorite most comfortable shoes and well worth the cost . In the last year I have had 3 pairs of Dansko 's less than 3 years old fall apart suddenly . It is like the soles just disintergrated . I store my shoes in boxes w / silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated . I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly . I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also . I gather Dansko has changed the material for the soles in the last few years and it is common for this `` dryrot '' issue to occur .
 I bought this for my wife . I ordered brown , and I received old brown.She is a surgeon and needed to replace the previous right away . Because she needed the clogs NOW , and she could n't afford to wait another week for a replacement , she will be stuck with the wrong pair for a while .
 Do n't buy these from Amazon . My wifes pair arrived packaged nicely in the original box but it was clear that the shoes had been worn before . The leather on the left shoe was stretched by someone walking in them and they missed a spot when they wiped off the bottom . White is a hard color to clean dirt from so it was obvious . There was also a nice sweat/dirt line just inside the left shoe . If this pair would have been offered at a shoe store I would have asked for a different pair or a discount . I will no longer trust Amazon for a new shoe purchase .
 I seriously am not understanding the positive reviews on these shoes , but I fell for them and now I 'm sitting here with sore feet . I think some of the problems are unique to my situation while others could possibly be more universal , i.e. something for everyone to consider when thinking of dropping $ 100 + on these shoes . I 'll break the review down into `` universal '' and `` unique '' issues.Universal : - The bottom , i.e. insole , is hard . Maybe if this were n't the case , these shoes would be less painful for me . There just is not cushioning on the inside . I do n't get it . How are these shoes comfortable to anyone with no cushioning , and why do n't they have any ? - These shoes seem to come at least a size or half a size smaller than normal . This makes it difficult to reliably order online , and I am glad I did actually go to a store and try shoes on . Originally , I had called the store up to get the plain Dansko professional leather shoes set aside for me to pick up , told them my size and they held them for me . I got to the store , and those shoes were just too small and uncomfortable . Went a size up , and still ... could barely get my left foot in the shoe -LRB- my left foot is slightly larger than my right foot -RRB- . I asked if they had any Danskos not leathered and they said no ... leather , to me , makes shoes less comfortable because leather is more rigid , harder to stretch out and such . The salesman suggested the oiled Danskos , and they did work better ... but still felt a little too small , even a size up , particularly on the left foot . The salesman stretched out the left shoe , and it eventually felt doable , though not the most comfortable . But I 'd read there was a break-in period , so I went with it . Um , it seems like every time I take the shoes off and put them back on again , they have gone back to being as uncomfortable as the first time I put them on , i.e. they just do n't seem to `` break in . '' At least not quickly , i.e. within a week.Unique -LRB- and these things , as well as some positives about the shoes , are why I give 2 stars and not one -RRB- : - The shoe is uncomfortable , sometimes painful , across the top of my feet , particularly my left -LRB- larger -RRB- foot . I 've seen others say this , too , but I admit to having big , wide feet . I do not have little dainty women feet . I maybe should have asked for the men 's Danskos ... honestly , I do order men 's shoes at times because I have big feet and it 's hard to find women 's shoes in my size at times . But because I had to go up a size with these shoes , I ended up getting the largest size they come in for women ... and I feel like that size is still actually too small for me . It 's actually a little difficult for me to even get my left foot in the shoe , depending on the kind of socks I 'm wearing . Maybe if I could have gotten a better fit for these shoes , they 'd be more comfortable . With the shoes being not quite the right fit , I ca n't really even get cushion-y inserts into them that do n't make the shoes even more uncomfortable . Something to keep in mind for women with big feet.-The shoes are generally fine for about 3 hours or so , but then they start getting more and more intolerable . I work a job where I basically STAND in the SAME SPOT for 8 hours . Most reviews , if not all , I see on these shoes where people are being positive ... are from people who probably are walking and moving about for hours and hours . I do think these shoes are more comfortable when I 'm on the move , though I 'm still not sure I 'd be able to say , if I moved in these for 8-12 hours , things like I see other people writing , i.e. `` my feet feel as good as they did when I first put them on 12 hours ago . '' I really doubt it , especially with , again , the rigid leather material and the hard insole . But I ca n't at all say they feel as good as 8-9 hours before work , with a job where I stand . Again , 3 hours is the ultimate for me . 7 hours in , my feel are hurting to the point where it 's tough for me to concentrate , and all I do is think of excuses I can make in order to sneak off and sit down somewhere . One day , I actually changed out of these shoes and finished my shift in regular shoes because it was so uncomfortable . I have gotten to the point where I take the shoes off regularly during my shift and just stand in my socks/try to stretch out the muscles in my feet . Keep this in mind if you have to stand for hours and hours , and are considering these shoes.-I pretty much always feel as if I 'm going to fall when I wear these shoes . It 's not really the issue others have mentioned , i.e. the heel bouncing up and down in the shoes . It 's how they feel like high heels . If you 're not used to wearing heels ... I 'm finding it just odd . I feel like I do n't have control of my own balance.-I think it might also be important to note that I 'm overweight . It might very well be the case that neither these shoes nor any other are going to help anyone who is putting a lot of weight on their feet for a long time.Positives-With every other kind of shoe , my feet are not the only thing hurting at the end of the day . My back , my legs , even below my stomach area all hurt . I do n't get that with these shoes -- nothing hurts but my feet when I wear these shoes.-I feel completely debilitated after work with other shoes , i.e. I can barely stand or walk for hours after work . With these shoes , my feet do hurt bad after work -LRB- for hours -RRB- , but I can still manage to get around ... I just would rather not ...
 I love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel . I get great arch support and there is plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around . They are fantastic for long hours on your feet.BUT , they are terrible for my ankles . When I wear these shoes I roll my ankles all the time and have fallen a couple of times . They are especially bad for me in a hospital setting where there are cords and such that I risk stepping on . I am also afraid to walk/run in them because I am afraid I will wipe out and fall down.I really want to love these , but I feel that the base of the sole needs to be a bit wider for stability .
 I just recently purchased a pair of the Dansko professional oiled leather clogs . When they arrived I tried them on , it was difficult to get them on they felt a full size smaller . The feel was stiff and hard not comfortable at all.I have a pair that I purchased in 1997 that were the same size as the new pair that fit perfectly and oh so comfortable.I put the 2 pairs together and it was quite obvious the new pair was a few inches shorter.I contacted Dansko and spoke with 2 different representatives who really had no explanation and suggested that I just return them and exchange them.My concern is was it that particular pair or has the sizing changed.I decided to do some research and have read that the new clogs are manufactured in China and the quality is not the same . I checked inside the shoe and it is printed made in China.I think my best bet is to return them .
 They are not comfortable at all really do n't like them . If I knew how to send them back I would .
 The shoes were very uncomfortable , hard , blistered my feet . And i discovered that the shoes of the same size and make are do not fit the same , maybe i should have bought them from a store . Never again
 I bought the brown oiled leather Dansko 's for a vacation to the UK and returned them promptly after getting back home to the US . I thought since I 've heard great things about these shoes and since Danskos are so ugly , they have to be comfortable . I was totally wrong !! These shoes proved to be the absolute worst choice in footwear for European travel and for those that have low arches!The Dansko 's work great for people with high arches , but I felt like I had a river rock jammed in my arch and the aftermath left me with intense pain in my arches and heels days after switching to my Crocs for the remainder of my vacation.The Danskos also have a thick , stiff arch which is a disaster when walking on uneven pavement or cobblestone as the shoe does n't give . I rolled my ankle countless times while walking on cobblestone and ended up with a mild sprained ankle on the first day of my vacation . I have very strong ankles , excellent balance -LRB- I 'm a yoga instructor -RRB- , and I 'm a lightweight so I 'm not the type of person that takes a step wrong or prone to rolled ankles.Last time I vacationed in Europe , I wore $ 20 clog Crocs and walked 10 + miles everyday without experiencing any problems over the cobblestone . I do n't think I 'll experiment with other shoes such as Danskos for the next vacation I take .
 I was so excited to finally purchase a pair of Dansko 's but I 've tried on clogs before and they always seem to run small . Given that information I went ahead and ordered a size larger than I normally would have . I wear a standard size 10 in US Women 's shoes , I ordered a size 11.5 US -LRB- 42 EU -RRB- in these and there is no way they are this size . I also have several pairs of Birkenstock shoes at size 41 that are longer than these . I wondered if perhaps they sent the wrong size in the box , but it is stamped quite clearly on the bottom of the shoe size 42 EU . It simply is not possible for me to fit my smaller foot -LRB- my left foot is smaller by about half a size -RRB- into these shoes . I am so disappointed as I really was looking forward to having my first pair of Dansko shoes that I 'd heard so many great recommendations on . It is my opinion that at the larger sizes these shoes run very small . I think perhaps one size larger may fit , however I still have n't decided if I 'm going to try a larger size . If I do , I will update my review with how that turns out .
 I can not see if `` made in China '' is stenciled in the upper and there is no serial number , but the shoes I bought from Footsmart could n't cut an 8 hour shift . I wore them around the house the day they came in the mail and they seemed fine , but after I wore them the following day at my busy waitress job , I felt crippled . The stitching around the sides dug into my feet and worse , the ball of my right foot is still sore 30 hours after having taken them off and my toes on that foot are still numb . I ca n't believe these are the same Dansko shoes so many rave about and just maybe they are not . After one wearing , they would not allow me to return them nor would they send me a different right shoe . Now I 'm just $ 100 poorer and have a pair of shoes I will never wear again in my closet . Great . My suggestion is that you buy Dansko 's from a company that takes returns in the event it does n't work out for you . I wish I had .
 I decided to get a pair of Dansko clogs because I 've heard and read so much about them , and I do have significant foot problems , which limits the kinds of shoes I can wear . This basic model comes in a narrow , and it fits my foot well , as described . I like the way it rolls forward as you walk . The shoe has a bit of a platform bottom , so it puts you up a little higher than `` flats '' . I thought it was a nice change from my usual Birkenstocks and sneakers . I am leery about rolling an ankle in them , as many have reported , though , as I am a bit accident - prone . I was also leery about the hard foot bed , and my foot did seem sore after wearing them off and on . But my foot problems also can be off and on -LRB- but REALLY on when wearing the wrong type of shoes -RRB- . Overall I liked the look and feel of the shoe pretty well , and really wanted to love them . But after wearing them on a long day with a lot of errands , my soles were so extremely painful that I had to put lidocaine patches on them and take pain meds . So disappointed . The fit is good , and I ca n't get my orthotics into them . Maybe there 's a thin insert that would help ... suggestions ? Apparently my case is unusual , but I would like to see Dansko either 1 . Offer a `` soft footbed '' version , as Birkenstock does for some of its styles , or 2 . Make the insole removable , in case customers want to use their own custom orthotics.Meanwhile , I strongly recommend that if you have foot problems -LRB- mine are plantar fasciitis and tendonitis , aggravated by lupus -RRB- , and you want to try these clogs , do wear them around your house as much as you can for a couple of days , and see how your feet feel , before you decide whether to keep or return them . I wish I had known this , it would have saved me a lot of money and pain , so I Hope this helps someone ! -LRB- actually , this item IS available ; do n't know why it is listed as `` not available . -RRB-
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .
 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .
 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .
 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .
 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 Warning , do not buy these if you have flat feet . The way they designed these shoes causes extreme pain . I bought these for my son who has flat feet . He ca n't wear them more than 10 minutes . A coworker 's son has the same problem . I did a Google search and found more cases of people with flat feet having problems with this shoe . ** UPDATE ** My youngest son 's feet finally grew to the size of these shoes and he started wearing them . He has normal arches and he loved them ! He wore them out actually .
 These shoes are a joke ! My 16 year old son plays varsity for his high school and on 2 Select teams . As it is for everyone , money is tight but , we bought these for him . -LRB- Did not buy from Amazon , purchased locally at a soccer store . -RRB- One of the cleats `` stripped '' in the first 3 weeks making the shoes totally worthless . I contacted Addidas and they have seen no reason to talk to us . Took them back to the store where they were bought and they were going to `` fix '' them . Told them not to bother . We got a different , better pair of shoes and a gift card for the trouble . I do n't care how much my son might believe in another pair of Addidas but , I refuse to buy any of their products ever again because they have NO customer service .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .

When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .

 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .

 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small .

 These are by far the worst made flip-flops I have purchased . Having been a long time Scott 's fan , I decided to give something from Island Pro a go . Big mistake . 2nd day of wearing , the rubber sole started separating from the leather foot bed on the left flip-flop . I am not one to drag my feet , so I have to assume shoddy materials or workmanship . Well , not one to grip , I decided to bond the area . The next day , the sole started separating from the heel area . Real junk if you ask me . Also , beware the leather dye they use . If you shoes hold together you 'll be spending the back end of your weekend cleaning you the soles of your feet to rid them of the black dye they use . Complete waste of money . Want great flip-flops , try Scott.Bright side , Amazon.com and the retailer were great .
 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .

 I purchased this product on the strong recommendation of Merrel shoes customer service . I have a chameleon 4 shoes which I wore once on a service call to one of the restaurant kitchen I service . Somehow my beautiful shoes top portion got in contact with some grease/oil which I tried thrice to clean with hot water and mild detergent , with degreaser , and baking soda . None of them worked . So I called Merrel , and they recommended Nikwax . It was with great anticipation waiting for the product , then finally using it , and waiting for a good result . Once it dried , the same old grease was still there.After I informed Merrel about the result , they graciously mailed a check for my purchase price of Nikwax . So , if you have grease or oil on your nubuck Merrel , Nikwax is not the product to go to .
 Just after two uses , the shoe showed white patches here and there andlooks ugly now after just two uses - not used in rain yet .
 While the sole is comfortable on hard surfaces , after wearing around town on a few errands , mostly by car , the skin on the tops of my little toes was rubbed off . I also had red patches of skin in other areas on the tops of my feet which would have rubbed off had I continued wearing them . I was limping by the time i got home , and now I ca n't wear regualr shoes without bandaids until they heal . The uppers are too stiff , and the edges around the vents are sharp . Also , the insides of the little button things that hold the straps hurt the sides of my feet where they rub them . If I had n't discarded the shoe box I would have returned them . Now they just take up space in my closet . Perhaps with socks they 'd be OK , but that would defeat the purpose of sandals/clogs . I 'm sorry I wasted my money . The irony is that I bought these specifically for comfort - not style .

 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes .

Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine .

 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 Bought these shoes because I liked the look and needed a new pair of `` driving '' shoes after my last pair wore out after about 2 years of use . I 've had these for about 3 months and they are already falling apart . The rubber on the sole is falling apart , and the leather at the toe is peeling off . I would not recommend these as everyday business casual shoes .
 I have 2 of the exact same pairs of shoes purchased from Macy 's and the pair that I received from Amazon were not only missing insoles and the Steve Madden name anywhere on the shoes , but were fake plastic replicas from China . Completely unacceptable and now have to go through the pain of returning them .
 I have had these shoes for less than three months , and I only have worn them about 20 times in very light wear -LRB- to the store , around the house and such -RRB- . Both shoes are already losing their seams and falling apart . The covering on the leather was so thin it is showing through , and looks like they are three years old , not three months . My wife had ordered these before we read the other reviews , but we decided to give them a try anyway . I wish we had n't . What a hassle ! We are having to return them , and I would never buy another shoe from this maker again . They are garbage . I would have been better off buying some shoe at my local dollar store .
 the only good thing about these shoes is that their comfortable . but beware , they do n't last more than a week or two . the stitching on the bottom of the shoe gets worm out real quick , and then the shoe falls apart . its really not worth the money .
 Bought a pair of these about 5 months ago . Actually bought two ; one brown , one black . I wear the brown a lot more and they go with everything , but after about 2 months the bottoms wear out and fall apart . The bottoms now have holes in them . They shoes were great for a while , now they are going in the trash and will be buying from a different brand .
 I just do n't understand the business logic of manufacturers sometimes . Is it really worth it to save maybe $ 1 a unit and end up with a vastly inferior product?I bought these shoes at Macy 's and they looked amazing . They are a good combination of casual/dress that you can wear them just about anywhere.The problem with these shoes showed up about 2 months later . Apparently to save 15 cents in rubber per shoe , Steve Madden decided it would be a brilliant idea to use a perforated sole and cover the bottom with a thin layer of rubber . This gives the impression that you have 1/3 '' of rubber between your foot and the ground , but actually its 1/3 '' of rubber with a bunch of holes on it covered by a few mm of rubber . Unfortunately for you , that means that after a month or two this thin layer wears off and you start getting holes in the bottom of your shoes!Is rubber really that expensive ? I 'm paying $ 60 - $ 80 for these shoes . Seriously , spend $ 1/unit to make the soles more robust , charge me $ 5/unit more , and end up with a much better product and $ 4 more profit.If you 're interested in this style of Casual/Dress shoes I 'd suggest you check out some Sketchers . Not traditionally what you think of when you think of these kinds of shoes , but I 've had a very similar pair of Sketchers in white that look great for about 2 years now , and they 're still going strong.No more Steve Madden for me !
 The shoe is very handsome . I can tell a lot went into the design except for doing it 's job , i.e. protecting your feet . The shoe has no support and after a few months of normal wear a hole developed in my left toe on the outer leather . Not much longer did the irreplaceable thin leather foot-bed wear down to the rubber sole . If your intention is for the `` sole '' purpose of taking the Maserati out for a spin , then the shoe fits . If you plan on throwing the frisby around to impress the ladies with you mad skills , I suggest you do it barefooted .
 Very bad quality . The thread on side of shoe started tearing off on 1st day . Returned it immediately . Highly discourage any potential buyers .
 Normally 8 or 8.5 fits my feet . But the leather of this shoes is too rough . I first ordered 8.5 and I return it to replace by 9 . Even the size 9 is like a blade in my feet . When walking I feel scratching my feet but it looks very good . Make sure you order one bigger that your size .
 Great looking shoe , but the material at the tip of the shoe is synthetic and the sole is stitched to it . The walking motion of the sole directly contacts the tip and rubs a hole straight through it , exposing the end of your foot . I cant believe these are still on the market . Huge disappointment . Spend the money for something of higher quality because these are extremely cheap made . Not worth $ 25 in my mind . Madden lost a customer for life here !
 These are certainly handsome shoes though there are all kinds of construction issues . Also , do n't get them wet or wear them in winter weather or you will be throwing them out within a week , guarantee . I 'm not sure what they 're made out of , but they end up smelling unholy terrible afterwards . If none of this is enough of a deterrent , I would wear wear these shoes seldom and in dry , warm weather .
 the stitching at the top of the shoe came apart the first time worn . did n't wear until summer so the return period expired . very disappointed .
 These look great and are very comfortable . Having said that , the sole does n't come far enough forward to protect the toe which just happens to scrape the ground with every step . After wearing these maybe 6 times the leather on the toe is almost worn through . I would not buy these again .
 I generally like the shoe . It looks good and is comfortable . However , it is poorly made . The stitching is coming off after four months .
 I bought this shoe from a brick and mortar retailer , not Amazon , so my post may not pass the verified purchase test within Amazon . Irrespective there are good things and bad things about this shoe.The good . Nice leather . Cool Look . Interesting concept in a shoe , only problem is that too much stitching and finished leather like the Uppers are right along the outsole periphery or even the center of the outsole . In anything but the best weather and the smoothest of walking sufaces , this shoe will not last . I need a shoe that will survive the 1 -RRB- walk four miles on a sunny afternoon through the hillsides just because test as well as the 2 -RRB- run across the airport desperately trying to make my connecting flight because American airlines always arrives late into LAX test . On both accounts , this shoe would not cut it . The lateral extensions over the outsole are too exposed to abrasion and ultimate wear . The stitching starts to suffer , and the overall shoe bottom will start to look worse for wear after a few days of walking though some mildly damp streets after a SoCal rainstorm . If the outsoles were 10 % wider on each side , I suspect the shoe would have shown a lot more durability , but it did n't and so the shoe did n't last . Luckily , the brick and mortar retailer did give me a nice coupon towards the purchase of another set of shoes which I used to score some nice Florsheim Oxfords , so I am whole . I wish this shoe had more substance .
 These sandals are extremly uncomfortable . I wear a size 10.5 , but I ordered a size 11 , they were still very narrow and pinched my feet . Also they felt like I was walking on concrete . They are not ajustable and look and feel poorly made . For the same price go with Adidas sandals
 Even though I favor leather , every once in a while a pleather product comes along that I really appreciate . Well , these boots sadly are not in that category . The pleather started cracking after I wore the boots x3 ; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling . The sad part is that for the amount of money that I spend on these boots , I could have bought a pair of leather ones after x-mas .
 I am sure I would love these shoes , but I ca n't really say for sure because the company sent me anotyher shoe in black , size 8 Triple E width . Consequently , I went in to exchange them and when I tried , they said out of stock , so now I am ska-rooed . Soo , I guess I can never rate them , too bad for me ?!!
 English is not my native language , but here I go . I 've been using these shoes for only 1 week , and so far they are just OK.The `` toe box '' is rubbing against my toe , so at the end of the day it can be annoying . Also , they are very slippery on wet floor . I almost fell off my feet this morning , and in the city I live on is very common every day rain . Also there is almost none arch support , so I 'm buying some insoles to wear with the shoes.I 'm going to try them for another 2 or 3 weeks . If they do n't get better , I 'll get rid of them .
 I have several pairs of genuine Birkenstock sandals . The Betula sandals are clearly inferior . A light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into.T.H . Grove
 The right shoe hurts my foot . I would like to return this item . Would you please tell me how . The right shoe is very uncomfortable . It also it not the same width as the left . It hurts the bottom of my big toe . The bottom rim digs into the bottom of my foot . Extremely dissatisfied . Diane Howard
 Overall they are nice looking and fitting shoes , however one of the shoelace eyelets at the toe has torn . It has n't affected the usefulness of the shoe but I should n't have to deal with a torn eyelet within the first week .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 Poorly made . Not firm enough to hold items without sagging . Looks a bit cheap , not the quality you would expect from Pagliei .

 While the sole is comfortable on hard surfaces , after wearing around town on a few errands , mostly by car , the skin on the tops of my little toes was rubbed off . I also had red patches of skin in other areas on the tops of my feet which would have rubbed off had I continued wearing them . I was limping by the time i got home , and now I ca n't wear regualr shoes without bandaids until they heal . The uppers are too stiff , and the edges around the vents are sharp . Also , the insides of the little button things that hold the straps hurt the sides of my feet where they rub them . If I had n't discarded the shoe box I would have returned them . Now they just take up space in my closet . Perhaps with socks they 'd be OK , but that would defeat the purpose of sandals/clogs . I 'm sorry I wasted my money . The irony is that I bought these specifically for comfort - not style .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe . It is so cute but but terribly uncomfortable . The shoes are cheaply made and very stiff . I ordered my usual size and they felt small on my toes . I will be sending them back .
 These boots look great , but they were too tight for my calves , and I 'm not a big girl .
 Got S for my 14 months old , who wears size 5 or 5.5 wide right now and L for my almost 4 year old , who wears 8.5 or 9 . Initially , they were just using the shoes during daycare splash days and the teachers all liked them ... However , when we took them to a water park and experienced them ourselves , we did not like the shoes at all.For my 14 months old , she got a wide feet and we find it very difficult to put the shoes on . Took us a few tries to find ticks to get her feet in without getting her little toe caught and bend backwards , causing her to scream and kick.My 4 year old shoes was easy to put on but it was a little big . Got about 1 finger size room ... After two days at water park , we find both kids got blisters on their right feet -LRB- both right handed kids -RRB- . The blisters are in the arch , which is a odd place to get one.My older one was n't as bad , probably because her shoes was bigger . My 14 months old shoes was a good fit , but her blister was a bad one.I think the shoes are good for 1 to 2 hrs use , maybe to and from the swimming pool but not one that wears while playing in the water .
 These shoes are super cute , and I was excited to get them today ... a few days and we are off to the Bahamas . One problem THEY ARE HUGE !!! My 2 year old son wears an 8 so I ordered the 8/9 . They are a good 2 , 2 1/2 inches too long . Hoping we can do an exchange before we leave .
 The sizing chart indicated that a size 5 Toddler is 4.75 inches long . However , when I ordered these , the 5T size was longer than 6 inches . I had to return the shoe , because it was too big for my toddler.Do not trust the sizing chart on the shoe . The shoe itself looks nice , but unfortunately , I didnt get to try it out on my child .
 I bought two different pairs to see if the first one was defective but its the way the shoe is made . The right shoe will give your child blisters because the inside stitching indents into the left side of the right foot causing the skin to rub against it and causing blisters . Weird how the left side is perfectly fine and doesnt touch the skin !! Do not buy !!!!!
 These shoes are cute and seemed to fit well , but the seam and tag in the insole left blisters on both of my two-year-old 's feet ! I 've returned them and am ordering some from a different brand .
 After reading the reviews , I bought my 2 yr old a size 5 . Didnt want to get them too big . They are difficult to get on , and I had to cut the elastic . the sole is right , its the mesh around it that is too tight . I like the cheaper Kmart style water shoes MUCH better . and they are half the price !!! dislike !
 She has worn water shoes multiple times in the past , these rubbed her poor little feet raw in one day .
 The water shoes wore blisters on my daughter 's heels after the first wear . No thanks !
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .
 Honestly , folks , people would buy these sandals if you would give customers a chance to indicate the desired size !
 I bought two pairs of these for my girls and , when I first got them , I loved them . They go from hopping and skipping down the garden path to puddles like a dream . The problem ? Five weeks after I bought them , my youngest 's soles started separating from the bottom -LRB- both pairs -RRB- at the toes . Since I bought them online and Teva is a good name , I figured perhaps she 'd scuffed her toes or something and just Shoe-Gooed them back together . Two weeks after that , the SECOND one 's soles started doing the same thing . I Shoe-Gooed THOSE back together as well . Three weeks after that , the BACK soles of the first kids were coming apart . More Shoe Goo . And now , as I 'm putting away the summer gear for school shoes , the older kids heels are also now coming apart . I think I spent more money on Shoe-Goo than I did on these over-priced sandals.I have a pair of Teva that have lasted through some pretty rough hiking on rocky terrain . It surprised me these were so poorly constructed , especially as my kids only used them for normal use , not the rough backwoods hiking my own pair has gone through and lasted several years . At $ 25 a pop , I expected a LOT more from these shoes . At least a full season ! The cheap $ 7.99 leather sandals I bought at WalMart have gone through all three of my kids!Teva should know better than to tick off it 's customer base by selling shoddy sandals that fall apart . Now not only am I not going to buy any more sandals for my kids , but when my $ 80 ` old faithful ' pair which is finally beginning to show heavy wear kicks the bucket sometime next summer , I 'll be looking at another brand for MYSELF as well . If I wanted cheap ` made in China ' stuff that falls apart , I 'd have BOUGHT sandals from Walmart !
 i like teva shoes and sandals but this one is tight . my little one can hardly push his toes in front .
 I bought my son Teva 's and before the summer was over the velco would no longer stick it had worn out . I emailed Teva 's customer service and I got no response so I emailed them again and again NOTHING ! I no longer buy Teva anything and my whole family has switched to Keen . Last summer my active son 's keens held up so well they can even be passed down to his little brother . Keens cost about double but they are worth it because they last all summer and then some .

 These shoes just fit a bit weird and uncomfortably . They tend to pull to one side so they are n't centered properly on my foot which is annoying and I just expected better from Bloch even though they are cheap .

 Very disappointed in these flats . The sole is really thick so it 's not that cute to wear with jeans or anything . I got them in the gold color and it is VERY GOLD . I mean it 's screaming flashback gold ! Not for me , going back to amazon !
 I ca n't wear them more than 10 minutes without ending up with blisters . These shoes are so stiff it 's not even funny . Thank God I bought them when they were on sale .
 It was n't what I imagined . It looks very cheap and worned out . I do n't like the wide feeling cuz it does n't make your feet look elegant . It makes your feet looks sloppy . but then again what do you expect for 25 bucks . I guess I 'll wear it to take out the garbage .
 These boots were pretty to look at , but a bear to wear ! I could n't get them over the arch of my foot , and I have a small foot ! I pulled so hard , that the boot strap broke . I received them as a gift from Nordstrom , and the saleperson said that a lot of other women had the same problem .
 As another reviewer mentioned , these boots have a snug fit to get them on . Although I did get them on , I found that the foot bed was VERY uncomfortable . The cushioned heel was more like a big lump and it was very difficult to walk on . I was really hoping that these boots were going to be more comfortable . Although they look outstanding , the lack of a comfortable footbed has forced me to return them and continue my search .

 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .

 This shoe was not cushioned as promised and the arch placement was not comfortable , even for a wide shoe .
 I had never worn Saucony so when they were recommended , I decided to try . I ran on the store 's treadmill and they felt fine , but I really should have taken the time to run longer.They boast that there is cushion , but there is n't enough cushion -LRB- or the shoe breaks down REALLY fast -RRB- . My feet ached after I ran only about 20 miles in these shoes -LRB- I run about 3 miles at a time -RRB- . The toe box is big and too roomy for me.My advice ? Keep a journal on your activity and what your feet felt like during and after and maybe even how they feel the next day . Go to a store that knows running shoes and take your time deciding . Hoping for better luck next time .

 After owning many different styles of these Minnetonka moccasins that are great have to warn that these soles slip or slide in wet conditions or on dusty floors , so beware ... or clean meticulously .
 I found scratches and glue stains of this product , and it 's made in Dominica not US , it 's not in good quality .
 This slipper has gone down hill for the past 15 years . 15 years ago it was still made in the USA , then about 10 years ago manufacturing was in Mexico , not great but ok . Last pair I purchased three years ago were manufactured in China . Terrible product , leather trim is now plastic , shreds within two months . I tossed out the China pair last year total waste of money . Way over priced . I would n't pay $ 10 for a pair of L. B. Evans Chinese slippers .

 The shoes are very pretty however the leather is very hard . They are not confortable to walk like other flats shoes . If you want just to show pretty shoes that are flats then this is a good choice .
 i am very interested in getting a pair of Puma Riberas , first i looked at the Puma website , but they do not ship to Canada . Now i 've come here and found them , but you do not have any sizes higher than 8.5 , what is the deal with that ? If theres anyway i you could swing me a pair of Puma Riberas size 10 please let me know
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .
 I wrote a bad review on the shoes and the seller of the shoes . I bought three pairs of the same style . I have other shoes , from this shoe maker and love the shoes I have . The three pairs I bought were cheaply made and very stiff leather . They were tight , heavy and uncomfortable . When I requested to return the shoes , the seller told me that I had to pay shipping.However , I contact the seller and explained the situation and the seller promptly sent me return labels .
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 Bought these after 2 hours of debate . love the looks but they are beyond cheaply made . the sole nubs mind as well not be there at the rate they fall off the shoes . i truely wish i could give them a better rating , but you get no bang for the buck at all . they wouldnt be have bad if your only intentions was to look at em ... yup not very durable though , just my .02 im still in debate on wether or not ill give sketchers a second chance.companies seam to forget that they are selling more than just a product ...
 I bought those Sketchers -LRB- black color -RRB- three months ago , and the sole of the shoes lost almost 10 studs . Really bad .
 The little rubber studs on the bottom of these started breaking offafter only a few weeks of wearing them . They were not abused in anyway , just a bad tread design . They are however , extremely comfortable .
 These shoes look great , but after only a couple of weeks the leather pieces started tearing apart at the seems by my toes . Shortly thereafter , the backs of the soles had completely worn through and the rubber nubs started falling off the bottom . I wear these every day , but I do n't do anything crazy in them and I 've never had shoes completely fall apart after only a few months of wear . I normally like Skechers , but these are just of exceptionally poor quality .
 The shoe started out very comfortable . Then I began finding little brown rubber pieces around the house and noticed that they were coming off the bottom of the shoe . Now that about 30 % of the rubber nubs are missing the shoes are actually painful to wear . I contacted Sketchers and they said all they could do was replace them with the same shoe , but I have read many reviews now indicating this is n't a unique problem . If you only want the shoes for a month or so they will be great . If you want them longer than that I would definitely go for something else .
 Loved the look and were comfortable at first ... The little Things on the Bottom began to fall off and so over time Ankles and Shins were taking on damage . Comfortable as an around the House Slipper but that would make these a fairly Expensive Slipper in my book ! Pass !

 I am appalled at the quality of these boots . The materials would look cheap next to a $ 20 pair of shoes . Most of the boot is constructed of plastic and some kind of nylon tricot-y cheesy backing . The leather -LRB- which is more likely some kind of leather byproduct like that glued-together stuff -RRB- is paper thin and from looking at where it is seamed appears to be a veneer over some other material . This is the first negative review I 've written , but beware . The box says made in USA , but the boots say made in China . I almost hope they 're really bad knockoffs , because if not this manufacturer has dropped to a truly sad level and is , in fact , deceptive in their description in my opinion .
 15 months child could not fit his feet into these boots , he has wide feet and high ankles and boots do n't have any opening or zipper . We returned boots back to the company and had to pay shipping both ways .
 I really do n't like these . They feel very , very bulky . Someone else mentioned that they are one size too small , but I think mine actually feel bigger than what they should be . Also , I bought it somewhere else and it said that these are good shower sandals . Not at all - it takes them more than a day to dry up even in winter when it is very dry in my home ...
 I have used it for about 4 months . The sole hardly has any give-in . I thought it would get better over the days . It is almost like wearing a plank of wood . So it is not a good one to use it for daily use at home . I tried to use in the gym -LRB- swimming pool -RRB- . The flap that goes over your feet wears out quickly . The blue and white stripes have started peeling off . It is hard to dry them after wearing them in the pool area . Yet to find a good use of these . I now have to find a better pair .
 These slides look good and fit me okay , but they are PAINFUL because the bottom edge of the band cuts into my toes . Why would anyone make a shoe out of such rigid , sharp-edged material ? Obviously not everyone has this issue with the slides , but it could be avoided with a softer band .
 bought these sandals a year ago . used to just wear them between locker room and pool . started wearing them between apartment and pool . the front of the strap cut into my feet behind my toes . am now looking for something comfortable . as these sandals are quite popular , i thought they 'd be comfortable . not the case .
 I have purchased this type of slider before and never have I had the white strip peel off ! It 's almost like this slider is a different material then the previous pair I bought . I believe the white strip was painted on . The white strip on my last pair has not peeled away , and they are 3 years old .
 These shoes just fit a bit weird and uncomfortably . They tend to pull to one side so they are n't centered properly on my foot which is annoying and I just expected better from Bloch even though they are cheap .

 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .

 This item had little to be desired . Poor shipping-box was torn and not packaged right . This product was misrepresented , not the right color and very cheaply made . I will never order from them again .
 EL ZAPATICO ES MUY DURO ME DA&N tilde ;O LOS PIES , NO ME LOS PUEDO PONER , NO SE AMOLDAN , LA TIRITA QUE TIENE POR ENCIMA Y LA FORMA DEL ZAPATO ES MUY DURA.NO LO RECOMIENDO

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these for a figure show and I received them promptly , I was hoping with the wider toe they would be wider , but I could n't even get my foot into them , I may have to reorder two sizes bigger than I normally do . The plastic strap is n't forgiving - at all .
 These boots are so warm , but only lasted me one season ! They are now seperating from the soles and i can put my hand from in the boot right out ! : -LRB-
 I bought these boots for my daughter in Aug 2008 . She did not even wear them until late October . In less than 2 months the sole on both boots split . Also I noticed the heel was worn down far more than you would expect for such a short period of time . I am hoping Famous Footwear will return these boots . DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM .
 This boot fits nicely , but not as warm as my 10 '' boot . I have hardwood floors in my house , and I have to wear socks with this boot . Not enough padding between boot and floor . I rate it a two star .
 As recommended I ordered the next size larger . Not only was the size too small but like many other reviewers I found the opening at the top of the boot too tight . I returned the boots to Luggage Biz and was charged the 5 % restocking fee as indicated by their return policy .
 I ordered these boots over three weeks ago and paid 10 outrageous dollars for the shipping and they are STILL not here !!
 I have written several emails because calls are not accepted by this company . I was charged for the boots , received the wrong boots . I ordered angle black boots size 10 . I received knee high light brown boots with feathers size 7 . This was over a month ago ! I will never order from this company again .
 I returned the boots as they were a gift that was not wanted . I an waiting for the credit back to my account and was also surprised at the healthy restocking fee . I do n't think I will use Amazon again for attire or apparel items .
 the sellers were great and very cooperative ; but the boots were so small and I ordered on size up and one size down and they were exactly the same size .
 This is the first time I have not purchased UGGs and let me tell you there is no comparison . I have 3 pair of Ugg boots already and I wanted the Mini Ugg boot . They were sold out in my size in most places and I did not want to wait until March to get them . So I thought to myself `` Why Not ? `` Well I will tell you `` why not '' . When you slip your foot into an Ugg Boot the very PLUSH and THICK shearling surrounds your foot in a pillow of warmth . In the Bearpaw product the shearling inside of the boot is very thin , does not have the nice looking plush shearling that Uggs do , and they did not keep my feet warm while wearing them inside.I had such ice cold feet in them that I took them off and put on my Ugg slippers instead . The immediate difference I felt between the two , made me sick with buyers remorse.On the outside of the boot where they clue the sole to the boot , there is glue residue that is very noticeable and gives the boot a cheap look.If you are buying these solely to get the `` Look '' of Uggs without the price , then you may be satisfied . The do have the same look and are less bulky , making one 's foot appear to be smaller . So score one for Bearpaw.If I could go back and do it all over again I would just spend the extra $ 50 and get the real thing . UGGS are expensive but THEY ARE WORTH THE EXPENSE . Plus Ugg stands by their product and will even replace the insole , and in some cases the entire boot , slipper , etc if you are not satisfied with the product.I think my daughter 's fake shearling in her Target knock off Ugg is thicker than that of the Bearpaw.I will keep these boots because there is a restocking fee and I have to pay shipping to send them back . I will not pay Bearpaw anything more .
 I was so excited to find these boots , only to be disappointed when I received them ! They ran very small and were SO hard to get on ! I actually needed a shoehorn !! After wrestling them on my feet , I stood up and my toes were rammed into the front of the boot . SO sad ! I ordered my normal size -LRB- 9 -RRB- and even have a different pair of similar boots in chestnut -LRB- they are 8 '' ones -RRB- that fit great ... unfortunately , these did NOT fit the bill at ALL and I 'll be returning them for sure .
 Product ordered size 9 regular Bearpaw 419-Demi in black . Compared to same boot already own , these were HUGE/WIDE . Had to return AND PAY $ 10 RESTOCKING FEE for a boot that was too big . Own 2 pairs , same product , same size ... they fit perfect . Bottom said 9W , I think they are wides , they say they do n't make wides . Ordered same product/different color from Amazon at same time , they fit perfect + free shipping . Will buy again if seller is Amazon , or in store to try on .
 I have an old pair of bear paws boots that I LOVE . They are warm and comfortable and have held up well over the past 3 years . I bought these boots with high expectations and I am very disappointed . The sole is thin and not at all cushy nor comfortable . The lining is fuzzy but not nearly as warm as my old boots . They also run small . I ordered one size up to accomodate winter socks and they are tight/short without socks . I would say these boots are comparable to the $ 15 boots sold in walmart - not at all what I would expect from Bear Paws , especially for this price .
 The pair of boots that I received were way smaller than the size indicated . So I had to return them . If they were the right size they would of been a nice boot .
 I bought a pair less than a year ago . They are nice , warm , lightweight slippers and I liked them . But after wearing them for 6 months , the seam between sole and the upper part of the left one got split and it is never fixable . They are not very durable for daily use in a cold place like the mid-west . Very disappointed .
 I wanted shearling boots , and I thought these were perfect because they would keep my feet and ankles warm while not overheating my legs . And , I thought they were pretty cheap.The sole is of a horrible construction . It looks like the rubber is about three quarters of an inch thick , but it 's not , it 's hollow in the sole with rubber reinforcers to make it seem like the sole is thick . So , the sole of the shoe is not actually one solid piece of rubber . After minimal wear , the sole begins to fall apart and you see that the sole is not 3/4 '' but was actually 1/8 '' or 1/10 '' . I never really liked the look of the Ugg-style shoes , but I bought them for their warmth . It 's hard to be warm when walking through a light rain and your feet are damp and squishing because of the poor quality . I would have rather spent a little extra money and got a much better product.Oh , and the shearling wore away inside fairly quickly in spots -LRB- mainly the back of the boot by the heel -RRB- , but that did n't bother me , I expected that to happen .
 Cheap materials ; bad design -- should be sold as ` slippers , ' not boots!These were wonderfully comfortable for the first few hours . But after only a few weeks of ownership , after walking on flat pavement probably not more than 5 miles total , the sole on both of these boots split all the way across at the metatarsal , all the way through to the insole . The sheep wool around the foot packs down within a few hours of putting them on , forever losing its comfortable fluffiness . After the wooly lining has packed down , the fit loosens , then the boots move around on the feet while walking , causing rubbing in the heel . The heel also seems to be shaped wrong . The boots rubbed the edge of my heel on both feet , producing callouses with big blisters underneath . Could n't walk in shoes for a few weeks until my feet healed . Do n't try to walk around town in these !
 Loved my demi boots when I got them for Christmas , but here it is Jan. 17th and my bear paw demi boots are worn through across the toes on the right boot . The suede appears to be quite thin in this area , and there are visible holes . Since this was a gift , and I do n't have a receipt , I ca n't return them . What a disappointment .
 I bought 2 pairs of BearPaw shoes because I saw that they were on sale on Slickdeals . I had to return BOTH the Women 's Knit Tall Knee-High Boot and the Women 's Demi Boot within 2 weeks because the quality was so terrible . One of them started coming apart at the sole . The other had glue all over the place . You could tell they were made very cheaply.Also , I noticed that the knit boots -LRB- cardy copy -RRB- are * very * heavy ... . about twice as heavy as the Ugg name brand ones -LRB- which I 've since invested in and having been wearing frequently for a year -RRB- BUYER BEWARE ... there are better brands out there . Costco actually has the BEST sheepskin boots . I swear they are identical to the real things . Check it out ... they usually stock them during the winter
 I bought these boots specifically for running errands in rainy/snowy weather . -LRB- I have Uggs , which I 've sprayed to make them a bit water-resistant , but we had a snowy winter and a rainy spring and I do n't want to get them soaked . -RRB- This would have been a good plan if it were n't for the fact that one of the boots has a crack in the sole.When I first got them , I noticed an odd sort of crease in the sole of the left boot . Since it did n't seem to be an actual crack , and since I did n't want to deal with paying a restocking fee -LRB- ! -RRB- to the seller -LRB- My Fashion Corner -RRB- as I 'd seen other reviewers mention , I decided to just keep them . They were pretty comfy , though definitely not as warm and soft inside as Uggs . After wearing them for two months , that crease in the left sole has turned into a crack , so now water and even little pebbles get into the boot while I 'm walking . I 've had other Bearpaw boots and this has not happened , so I think this quality issue is not because it 's a bad brand , just that these were perhaps factory seconds or something.My advice
 I am a true size 6 . I ordered a size 7 to they would be roomy enough for socks . Even in my bare feet these were much , much too tight , more like a size 5 . There is no way these were a size 7 . My toes were painfully jammed in . Order 2 or even 3 sizes bigger !
 Buying shoes through the internet , unless you already know the size of your foot and that that specific shoe will fit you , is really a waste of time . These were too tight for my foot and I didnt wear them much .
 I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11 . They run large , which is strange for being from the same company . They are super thin , light , and only stay comfortable for about a half hour . Afterwards your feet WILL hurt . I do n't recommend them , even though they look cool . Comfort is a must , so I will be going back to my beloved 574 's .

 It is really not well designed . Ugly , difficult fit . I sort of imagined the totes overshoes or those old fashioned rubbers that were softer and more pliable . This is hard . Do n't waste the money or time .
 they came in right away but were way too large - we need to send them back - can you help me with a return label ?
 Unfortunately , the largest size I can order from my Postal Uniform supplier is size XXL . I wear a size 12 sneaker and while putting the Tingly overshoes on over them , I just about pull my shoulder out of socket trying to pull them on . I hear this same complaint from other carriers I work with as well . Tingly seems to be stuck in the past where everyone still wears wingtips , and conventional dress shoes . I 'd bet that 50 % of their customers wear them over sneakers . They really need to make their overshoes with more room inside .
 The rubber shoes are extremely difficult to put on over the shoes.We ended up cutting a slice in the top .

 Received the mocs in timely manner , however they were poorly fitted . They were huge , at least a size too large and the width would 've accommodated a very FAT , WIDE foot . Was so disappointed . Have had these mocs . before and they fit wonderfully . Not the case this time . Sorry
 The stitches on my left shoe fell apart , and I now have a `` joker 's mouth '' on my shoe front . I am very disappointed!Anyone knows how to repair the shoe ? It sounds silly , but i really want to get my money 's worth ...
 Minnetonka Moccasins that have this type of sole are too wide . The sole with the little nubs on the bottom are a better fit if you have a more slender foot . I love the look of these , but can not keep my feet from falling out of them .
 These Shoes are ok but they are overpriced . I have a pair of Bostonian Maldens and they are similar quality . The Bostonian cost less than half of the Florsheims . These shoes are average and I do like them but they do not compare to other 225 shoes on the market.Florsheim customer service was hit or miss . I bought the shoes from the Florsheim website and had them shipped to Canada . Half the time I dealt with with a good customer service rep the other half not so much . My big complaint is that I tried to leave a 3 star review on the Florsheim website and they did n't approve it . It seems they screen all their reviews and if they do n't like what the customer has written they will not publish it . I think this is extremely misleading and dishonest.If you can find these shoes for 150 bucks and do n't have to deal with Florsheim directly then I would recommend them . If it was n't for the price and service I would have given 4 start review because the shoes are nice .
 I 'm really disappointed with the quality and workmanship of the Florsheim shoes . The leather is so tough that they are uncomfortable to wear . I wore them just once and will never wear them again . What a shame !

 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .
 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .
 I purchased the sandals for myself but was not able to wear them because they run narrow , I even went a size up because I have wide feet . . I ended up giving them away to someone with a narrow foot . .
 I bought these sandals because of the name and users recommendations . I found then to be uncomfortable due to the material between my toes.I offered them to my daughter and she also found the material uncomfortable .
 The pair I received were a beautiful color -- just what I was looking for , but one of the sandals was not manufactured properly , one of the bands that crosses over the foot was way too long , so it did n't fit properly . I was disappointed to have to send it back , bc there were no others to get a replacement .
 I 've been buying a new pair of Tevas every year for the past 4 years because I 've loved & used them so much.I ordered a 7 again this year , but it was too small . I ordered a 7.5 and that was too big . They must have changed manufacturers , or changed something about the shoe.I 've been looking in brick-and-mortar stores as well , hoping the shoes shipped from Amazon were just a bad batch . No luck yet though.I will be really disappointed if I ca n't find any that fit next year .
 Due by 2/24/12 - 2/29/12 ... . arrived 03/03/2012 . LATE and extremely disappointed , will NOT purchase from supplier -LRB- HEART & SOLE SHOES -RRB- again . The correct item -LRB- color/size -RRB- was shipped correctly - so i gave it 2 stars . Amazon is usually better than this.The actual sandal was comfortable and acceptable . It deserves 5 stars . I have bought 7 pairs -LRB- from other people -RRB- and I do LOVE the flip-flops .
 Wore them once . Thought they felt good . They looked really nice . Woke up the next morning and could n't walk . Have been limping ever since -LRB- 3 weeks so far -RRB- . Thumbs down for lousy arch support .
 Have bought several pairs of this exact sandal in the past few years . The pair I received was too wide to wear-so I had to return it . Not happy . Will not buy this product online again -- Not consistent sizing .
 I have very narrow feet and bought a pair of these a few years ago . They fit perfectly . Now they 're old and not very supportive so I went to get another pair . The straps are so loose on the new ones that they barely stay on my feet . I was so disappointed . If you have narrow feet the 2011 version of these probably wo n't fit . I 'm sad that shoes for wide feet have taken over the world . I am stuck with my old ones until they fall apart .
 I like flip flops . These were cute and on a good sale . For me , the sensation of webbing wrapped around my big toe was n't comfortable - or was it just too tight around the toe for my liking ? Had to return them , since I knew they would n't get worn .
 shoe is not supportive . Even if it is a Teva . I am need support for arches . It is very cute but if you need stablization even with extra strapes this is not it .
 I ordered these shoes because I loved the way they looked . When I received them , I was shocked at how comfortable they were ! However , the reason why I gave these shoes only two stars was because of their tightness . I wear a size 7 and I am always true to size , however , these shoes felt extremely tight , even after attempting to stretch them out . In addition to feeling quite snug , every time I walked in them , I felt as if my feet were slipping out the back little by little each step . Also , these shoes do not offer much support . If you want a shoe this in this style , I recommend checking out Rafters Antigua Sandals .
 Very uncomfortable to wear . I did not realize from the photos before purchased , that this was a `` thong '' - thought it was a criss/cross flip flop . Not only is it a thong , but a coarse and narrow thong material is utilized , making them quite painful and uncomfortable - cutting between the toes . Teva has a good name , but this flip flop is a disappointment - only good for bath to bedroom to dress . Too bad , as they are quite attractive
 I have VERY narrow feet . I ordered these and actually had trouble wedging my foot in . Once I did , wearing them was impossible due to the straps rubbing blisters on the tops of my feet . I had to send them back .
 I had hoped these would be good for walking around campus during summer semester but the narrow cross strap keeps slipping under my short pinky toes . This makes it really uncomfortable and I have to keep stopping and repositioning the strap . Nice colors , not very cushy sole because it 's so thin and overall very sorry I bought them without trying first .
 Teva 's are very comfortable , but do n't leave them in the sun ! They shrink ! I left my new sandals in the back of my Jeep while I was at work one day . When I came out the top portion of the sole had shrunk and curled up . Did n't realize they were so fragile ... not happy . $ 30 bucks wasted .
 I was sure with all the good reviews that these sandals would be awesome . Well for me ... they are not . I do not like the way they feel at all . They are cushy on the bottom which is nice but they are just not comfy . The straps are not comfy . Sadly . . I threw my money away on these since I had to wear them to find out I do not like them . Poor me . .
 This is the 2nd pair of these sandals I 've ordered . I LOVED the first pair . They were so comfortable , light weight , fit secure on my feet and provided arch support . So I ordered another pair of the exact same sandal for this season . I do n't know what 's happened in the manufacturing process but the quality has definitely suffered . The straps were all over the place , some were way too loose , others too snug . They were not comfortable mainly due to the way the straps were sewn , so I sent them back to Amazon and requested a refund . Have not received yet . I also ordered a pair of the Mandalyn Wedge Ola flip flop at the same time . Again , I have had another pair of those , and the new ones were not as comfortable . Foot bed was harder than first pair , straps not uniform as to fit . TEVA WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR QUALITY ???
 This Teva style looks pretty nice for a flip flop . The strap configuration is the whole thing , the only thing I can see that distinuishes it from a $ 1.99 drugstore version.The third time I wore mine , the strap on one came loose . This means the main strap over the foot that holds the sandal on slipped out of its mooring 1/2 or 3/4 inch , from where it connects to the body of the shoe . I was just walking down a cement sidewalk with my dog.From that moment , the whole shoe is much too loose , and easy to trip with . Insecure . And the whole reason I chose this style was to have a more secure flip flop on my feet.I just could not face writing the company and shipping it back and paying $ 5 more to return an $ 18 item . Would not buy again . Disappointed in Teva .
 These fit a little small for the size , even from other Chacos . I ended up returning them since the straps seemed tight .
 I have been wearing these Teva sandals for three years now , and I have to say that I was really disappointed with this year 's crop of sandals . I used to love these sandals because the bottom part of the flip flop was so squishy and comfy and because they fit my narrow feet so perfectly . They were by far the most comfortable shoes I 've ever owned . I would wear mine every day throughout the summer , until I wore the heels through!But this year , its seems that Teva decided that the fit was too narrow for the majority of their customers so they decided to make the fit a bit wider , the straps a bit looser . I tried on multiple different styles and colors while I was at the shoe store , and it seems that they 've all be changed to fit this way . Unfortunately , this completely changed the comfortability of the sandal for me . Though they fit length-wise like they used to , they now feel like they 're about two sizes too big for me and flop around way too much . Where before I would have rated these shoes 5 + stars , I can now only give them 2 stars . They are no longer my favorite sandals , and I really wish that Teva had n't decided to mess with a sandal that would have been my favorite go-to summer sandal for years to come .
 I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11 . They run large , which is strange for being from the same company . They are super thin , light , and only stay comfortable for about a half hour . Afterwards your feet WILL hurt . I do n't recommend them , even though they look cool . Comfort is a must , so I will be going back to my beloved 574 's .

 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!

 did not like rubber bottom because have to use taps on heel and could not apply and shoes ran narrow sent back
 Bought them for work but they were not comfortable ... like walking on cement . Other skechers shoes are much much better . I wear skechers work shoes now .

 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I purchased the sandals believing they were the same shoe I purchased several years but regretfully another company could not let an excellent product alone and changed it for the worse . The tread , the leather , and most importantly the sizing was very different from `` the original recipe . '' They look and feel cheaper , I 'm sure they do work for some people but I am not one of them . I ended up having to pay S&H for a product I do n't own . Customer Service folks were very nice but did n't really help . The original sandal can not be found in any warehouse stores . Teva does make many other great products but dropped the ball on this one .
 I have a pair of leather TEVA already . I love them and had worn them out . I would normally never order shoes on line , but I got what I thought was an exact replacement and they are really too small . I 'd say at least a size smaller than my old ones . Be careful .
 The poster who complained about parts of the shoe digging in and hurting is correct . With me , it is the part where the T-strap hooks into the ankle strap that digs into my inner ankle quite painfully . Loosening the strap does not work . I can not even stand having these shoes on my feet for very long , let alone do any kind of extended walking in them . I am sorry that I ever bought these overpriced and very uncomfortable sandals . I feel that I was completely misled by the looks of the shoe and the stellar reviews that I read . MAJOR disappointment .
 About 10 years ago , I purchased a pair of these Tevas and loved them . I ordered the exact same pair -LRB- style and size -RRB- . When the arrived , they felt small . I measured them up against my old ones and they were 3/4 inch shorter . Also , they did not have the same padding on the straps . Overall , very shoddy workmanship . I have since purchased a pair of Ecco sandals that I am very happy with .
 I was so disappointed in this pair of sandals that I just shipped them back . Perhaps if I had n't known what this sandal USED to be like , I would have kept them . I own fivel other Teva sandals and two of them are this same sandal I just ordered . But Teva has changed this sandal ! The sole is a lot stiffer and uncomfortable and the straps in the medium width -LRB- they do n't come in wide width -RRB- are shorter leaving much Velcro exposed when fastened . The sandal is not nearly as comfortable as my other Teva sandals . All my other Teva 's were VERY comfortable the first time I put them on . I was really disappointed in this new pair and have communicated with Teva and they told me they have made several changes in their product . I asked them to change them back because they 've ruined their product . My old Tevas are several years old and I still wear them and the only reason I wanted a new pair is because my old pair have begun to look old even though they are not worn . I just wanted a newer pair to wear when I want to look dressed up . They are really still a very serviceable shoe even though I 've worn one pair in salt water ! -LRB- Yes , they are leather ! -RRB- I wear Tevas every waking hour in weather warm enough for sandals .
 I really wanted to like these sandals . They felt comfortable when I put them on . They are a bit smaller than I 'd thought they would be , despite buying my normal size . After the first day , I had a lot of left heel pain . Thinking it might be a fluke , I tried again , this time by adding an additional heel pad underneath my heels . While this made wearing them a bit easier , I was still in pain within an hour and by the end of the day , could barely walk . Anyone who has real trouble and heel pain issues might want to reconsider this sandal . So far , the sandal that works best for me is Skechers ' toning sandal - the one with two thick straps across . It affords support and adequate cushioning .
 This is my 4th pair of Teva Pretty Rugged leather sandals , and I am disappointed in the changes . Everything seems less rugged , and inferior - down to my toes being stained rust from the leather dye . It will be my last pair of `` Pretty Ruggeds ''
 I bought this because I needed a bag that could carry all my things , plus my 6 year old 's toys . The size is perfect , but the straps were way too short to carry on my shoulder comfortably . I am 5 ' 7 '' and average size . I guess my search for my perfect bag continues !
 Had to finally buy some where else . Did not return the item because not worth enough to return . Waited two + weeks to arrive . When it arrived post mark date was 2 weeks after what I was told was the ship date and box arrived ripped open . Very difficult to get selling company to respond also . Beware when buying from this company .

Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11 . They run large , which is strange for being from the same company . They are super thin , light , and only stay comfortable for about a half hour . Afterwards your feet WILL hurt . I do n't recommend them , even though they look cool . Comfort is a must , so I will be going back to my beloved 574 's .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I bought these shoes because I wear the same size in all my Steve Madden shoes and they do not fit . The problem is that the opening in the top of the boot in much smaller than my foot , so it is almost impossible to actually get my foot into the boot . I did manage to get the left foot in , and I know that the shoe fits because once I actually had my foot in the boot I had plenty of room and it looked cute . My right foot , on the other hand , will not fit into the top of the boot . I guess I will try to put them on again tomorrow but for now I am thoroughly disappointed with the fact that it is a struggle and I can still only get one boot on .

 I 've had numerous other DOCs , shoes , boots , etc. and never had a problem . I have one pair of boots over 10 years old and they are still going strong.These sandals broke on the very first day I wore them . Do NOT buy . I mailed them back for a refund , but we 'll see how foot locker handles it . I do n't expect much , but who knows .

 These are most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn . I understand that there is a break in period for leather , but you ca n't possibly wear these enough times to ever break them in -LRB- if they ever do -RRB- . I feel like I have two boards strapped to my feet . They pinch in the heel and leave blisters within a few hours . The manufacturer may want to condition , rub 'em or whatever to make these a bit softer before they sell them .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 These beautiful boots garnered many compliments and made my legs look great . But after four or five wearings , the cheap plastic zipper started disintegrating at the ankle -LRB- and I do n't have thick ankles causing undo stress on the zipper . -RRB- Hoping it was a fluke , I exchanged them for an identical pair , and the zipper fell apart on them as well after just three wearings . I could have replaced the zipper for $ 40 , but it 's just a matter of time before some other shoddy component self-destructs . Luckily , Nordstrom 's has a very gracious exchange/return policy . I wo n't be buying this footwear brand again .
 I bought these shoes for a specific occasion and they served their purpose for that occasion . The shoes were painful to walk in and left blisters on my feet and have since gone in the trash . These were really cute and I was hoping the quality would be better .
 I have used several generations of Brooks Adrenaline in 7.5 D . This one does not conform to the conventional measures -LRB- even though the size tag indicates it is -RRB- . My feet hurt and I do not get the proper pronation support I would expect from this model . Otherwise , the service was timely and a good deal . But unless your shoe size is well narrower than a C width , this shoe wo n't cut it for you - you would be better off buying it in the store even if its $ 20 more expensive .
 Seemed like a well made shoe , but way too small-probably need a whole size larger .
 I would not buy this running shoe again , feels like a cheap pair of everyday sneakers
 I always buy the same running shoe - the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 6 . Unfortunately that style has been discontinued so it has been difficult to find . I thought that the GTS 7 would probably be pretty much the same , maybe even better so I decided to try it.It 's not a terrible shoe , but I think the GTS 6 is much better . I do a lot of long runs and the GTS 7 does n't have as much cushioning . It actually feels like the GTS 6 after about 200 miles of running . I think it would probably be better for shorter distances like 2-3 miles or walking .
 I have always bought Mizuno for walking daily about 4 miles . They did n't carry Mizunos anymore so the salesman recommended Brooks . I have now developed a painful corn between my 4th and little toe that he has tried to fix with an insert and tying my shoes tighter . It still hurts after walking on it for a while . Never had the problem with Mizuno . I will be going back to Mizuno .
 I 've gone through two pairs of the Adrenaline GTS 6 and loved them . However , the GTS 7 is terrible ! They are way too wide for my feet and I ordered a B. My legs hurt from beginning to end of a dozen runs so I 'm giving up . Since GTS 6 is discontinued , I 'm going to have to go on a quest to find another shoe . Brooks , why must we fix something that is n't broken ?
 I got the gold and the color was more of a yellowy brown , then a sparkly gold . Just not what I expected . The shoes were quite stiff and even though I have this style of shoe in a suede , they were just too small with the flexible and ungiving patent material . I 'd recommend going up a 1/2 size if chosing this material

 This was not the quality of Sperry Topsiders that I have come to know and like . The shoes were so stiff that they were uncomfortable and unwearable . I returned them with great disappointment . Sperry as I remember them were soft pliable leather that were comfortable from Day One.Warren LittrellGrayslake , IL

 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .
 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .

 This is extremely hard and heavy - not comfortable because it is so heavy - it makes you stumble and then the leather straps are so hard . Do n't like it .

 These boots were pretty to look at , but a bear to wear ! I could n't get them over the arch of my foot , and I have a small foot ! I pulled so hard , that the boot strap broke . I received them as a gift from Nordstrom , and the saleperson said that a lot of other women had the same problem .
 As another reviewer mentioned , these boots have a snug fit to get them on . Although I did get them on , I found that the foot bed was VERY uncomfortable . The cushioned heel was more like a big lump and it was very difficult to walk on . I was really hoping that these boots were going to be more comfortable . Although they look outstanding , the lack of a comfortable footbed has forced me to return them and continue my search .
 These shoes are very attactive for casual pumps . However , they pinch the sides of my feet , even when I 'm sitting . These shoes are OK to wear for short periods of time , but do not live up the the `` comfort shoe '' reputation that I expect from the Clark 's lines .

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 The shoes were a little small but true to size -LRB- my own fault got half size too small -RRB- . They are unique which is cool but the front of the shoe appears long and just did n't have the look I wanted . Very comfortable , loved how the inside shoe bed was all bubbly and very cushioned.SELLER REVIEW - In short , find these shoes from another seller.Tried to follow their instructions but my order number is not recognized . Seller included instructions with the product on how to return IF purchased on their various websites but these instructions DO NOT apply for purchases on Amazon . I have contacted the seller through Amazon and am waiting for them to approve me to return ! What 's that ? While waiting I decided to check them out on BBB . I 'm nervous to say the least . They can only say `` I can assure you this was not intentional and a very unusual situation '' so many times before it gets old . If you keep reading the complaints there are many reoccurring issues this company has clearly yet to fix . I would check another seller if you want these shoes and avoid the hassle of having to deal with their `` customer service '' and I use that term loosely . Do n't take my word , check them on the Better Business Bureau and have a look at complaints and customer reviews . -LSB- ... -RSB- So many people ... had I checked first I would have never made the purchase to begin with . Love Amazon but not all sellers on their site offer as great of service as they do . I am however , very pleased with Amazon .

 These Shoes are ok but they are overpriced . I have a pair of Bostonian Maldens and they are similar quality . The Bostonian cost less than half of the Florsheims . These shoes are average and I do like them but they do not compare to other 225 shoes on the market.Florsheim customer service was hit or miss . I bought the shoes from the Florsheim website and had them shipped to Canada . Half the time I dealt with with a good customer service rep the other half not so much . My big complaint is that I tried to leave a 3 star review on the Florsheim website and they did n't approve it . It seems they screen all their reviews and if they do n't like what the customer has written they will not publish it . I think this is extremely misleading and dishonest.If you can find these shoes for 150 bucks and do n't have to deal with Florsheim directly then I would recommend them . If it was n't for the price and service I would have given 4 start review because the shoes are nice .
 I 'm really disappointed with the quality and workmanship of the Florsheim shoes . The leather is so tough that they are uncomfortable to wear . I wore them just once and will never wear them again . What a shame !

 I really like sausany but the shoe was smaller and narrower than the size bought
 Very cute and colorful shoe . Made to look at and not walk in ! Very hard and uncomfortable . Could barely walk across my carpet in them .

 I found these to be less than comfortable . The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour .
 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!

 Buying shoes through the internet , unless you already know the size of your foot and that that specific shoe will fit you , is really a waste of time . These were too tight for my foot and I didnt wear them much .

 They are marked 9 , which I wear , but I ca n't even get them on . I 'm assuming they were mismarked as to size.I have 2 other size 9 pairs of Sketchers that fit me perfectly and are my favorite shoes .
 Wanted to exchange shoes for smaller size . When i called them they said sorry , because of policy shoes that had been worn could not be exchanged . Could not understand because all he did was try on in house . When i received them back there was dirt on bottom of shoes caked in holes . Not understanding how this happened .

 I purchased these Sloggers to use when I garden . They looked very nice but they slip off when you are walking and your feet get wet . I do not recommend these Sloogers for gardening .
 When I bought the first pair of Sloggers , I bought a size 8 . After about 2 months , I could n't get my foot into them . I went back and bought a women 's 9 . My foot was a little loose in the shoe at first , but it continued to shrink and now , I ca n't get my foot in the 9 either . The store says they will refund my money . I 'm amazed that there are no other complaints about them shrinking . Not only are they much smaller , but the toe curls up as they shrink !
 I am sorry to say that my shoes arrived while I was away . The shipper threw them into my yard and my dogs trashed the box -LRB- still have n't found it yet -RRB- and the shoes inside . I have requested a new pair , but Plastex says I need to take up my displeasure with the shipper . NOT . The shipper is not supposed to put them in my yard -LRB- prior arrangement -RRB- , but sometimes they tie a plastic bag to the fence . The dogs trash them , too . I had the same problem with Nordstrom 's , but they were delightful and replaced any items torn or destroyed without any complaining . I am very unhappy with this transaction .
 I bought a pair of these on sale for $ 4.98 and am glad I did n't spend any more on them than what I did . After wearing out two pairs of generic `` Crocs '' I gave Sloggers a shot . I 'm just glad nobody was around when I walked out of the house with them on . The shoes do not have holes in them like most clogs of this style . Not only does this make the shoes hotter because you do n't get the air circulation of the others , but it allows for a certain suction to occur on your foot . As you take a step , the suction is broken and a rather embrassing sound is emitted from the shoe as the air escapes around your foot . The end result , it sounds like you are passing gas with every step ! I suppose if you only wear them in the garden this might be fine , but better hope nobody sneaks up on you ! I was also very disappointed in the comfort level of these shoes . The insoles are quite hard feeling despite the fact that the shoes are extremely flexible . You feel EVERYTHING you step on and there is no cushioning effect because of the density of the insole material . I thought these would replace my cheap `` Crocs '' ... instead my search continues .
 We received very poor customer service from Plastex . Item was expected to ship out in 1 week from order . After 3 weeks , we contacted Plastex ; item had not been shipped even though it was in stock . Interactions with the Plastex customer service representives were extremely difficult .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 Very cute and colorful shoe . Made to look at and not walk in ! Very hard and uncomfortable . Could barely walk across my carpet in them .

 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...
 It is unfortunate . After wearing the shoes for a week , the shoe gives a black mark on top of my daughter 's right foot because the flap is too hard and long for her . Since she have already wore them for a few days ... I am reluctant to ask for a refund .
 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .
 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .
 I have been a distance runner for 8 years , and I have always sworn by Asics running shoes . When I purchased these shoes , they were great for the first two months . Then , last night , I noticed the black treads on the bottom had started to peel off already . Now I have to buy a new pair of shoes as a result . I will never buy Asics again , and I do n't suggest that you do either unless you enjoy spraining your ankles .
 The flip flops are not in any way as good as the older `` Sugar Flip Flop '' . I have searched all over to find the older kind . They molded to your foot and were extremely comfortable . This new flip flop makes lots of noise when walking and does not mold to the foot . If you can tell me where to find the older `` Sugars '' , I would appreciate it.Thanks
 Love the look of the sandals , but they rubbed the area raw between the big toe and second toe on my left foot and rubbed an area raw on the top left portion on my right foot .
 I have severe plantar fasciitis and there are very very few products that actually help the condition . I own Birkentock Arizonas , which are better than walking barefeet but are heavy and slip off my feet . So I always walk a certain way to make sure they do n't come off and that causes pains in other parts of the feet . I ordered Reef Fanning 's based on the reviews -LRB- obviously -RRB- , to only wear around the carpeted house . I wore them for 1 week and there was a sudden increase in pain in my heels and now knees . I never had knee pain before . The slippers seem to have fair arch support but the heels are not hollowed to provide cushion -LRB- a must -RRB- . This could very well be how my feet are structurally and not a design issue . Remember the Fannings are not marketed as slippers for Plantar Fasciitis slippers , they only claim to provide arch support - which it does failry decently . The slippers otherwise are well-made and look very cool.-Orthoheel-I returned the Fannings and got Orthoheel Waves , they were uncomfortable the first day and the strap still hurts between the toes and fingers . But they are otherwise comfortable , after a week of wearing them I feel it is safe to keep them and transition over from my Birkenstock Arizonas -LRB- which have a great foot bed btw -RRB- .
 REEFS SUCK , LOOK AT MY PIC . Took a pair of Reef 's to Costa Rica . Everytime they got wet in the ocean the straps left huge black marks on my feet . This was n't like a one time thing . EVERY TIME THEY GOT WET . Complete garbage for an expensive pair of sandals . It looked like I had a crazy foot disease . An it was hard to wash off . Anyways , I threw the reefs in the trash where they belong and got myself a pair of Kustoms . Cheaper , lighter , more comfortable and NO MORE BLACK FEET . I put up a picture of my stained black feet . REEFS SUCK ! Oh and you look like a jack@$$ using a sandal to open your beer .
 I was interested in buying a pair of these sandals since my dog ate one of my sperrys . While perusing the list of styles I noticed that they had two styles that included the colors of the mexican flag . However I saw no style that offered the red , white and blue colors for us US patriotic Americans . Nuff Said !!!
 Way too tight a fit for size 12 foot . The sole size was fine but the vertical rise of the strap was probably made for a size 8 foot . Your manufacturer needs to know that when foot sizes get bigger it is not just in length but in thickness and height also . Unwearable .
 These were very uncomfortable flip-flops for me . I worst part , though , were that they have a bottle opener built into the sole . This seemed like a great idea when I ordered them , but the metal scratched my vinyl floor . The opener should have been embedded deeper into the sole . I returned these .
 Purchased these for a Caribbean cruise . On the last day of the 7 day cruise the sole fell off one shoe . I thought it was n't a problem as I would return when I got home . When I went to return them , yesterday was the final day I could return for full refund . I have searched for someone to contact , but that info is not available . I liked the shoe , was very comfortable , but did n't last but 1 week . I would not recommend these if you expect them to last .
 Picked up these about 8 months ago . I researched the REEF 's extensively and choose their most `` Highly Rated '' design ... The Mick Fanning.Fast forward 5 to 6 months and BAM ... the strap broke . Your kidding me ... $ 50 sandals that could not make it through a few months -LRB- purchased in February and broke in June -RRB- . The funny thing is I actually purchased another pair in July -LRB- thinking maybe I got a bad product made on a bad day by an overworked and under paid Chinese person -RRB- . The 2nd pair lasted exactly 3 months . Same flaw ... the toe strap broke during a dinner out . Fortunately , the 2 broken pair -LRB- s -RRB- each broke a different foot . Light bulb goes off ... still in business , I can wear the 2 good remaining feet for a new pair . BAD ! They broke the straps within a week . Now the bad news , the straps are not covered in the warranty . I am sending them back , both pairs , with no warranty , at my cost , to tell Reef , `` Please send this crap back to China and have your underpaid Chinese workers to wear and most importantly enjoy their new REEF Sandals '' . Thanks REEF , but I will be spending another $ 50 on a pair of Rainbow Sandals that actually come with a warranty .
 The feeling of it touching my feet is not very comfortable . Moreover , once it gets dirty with dust or sand , you may never get rid of them no matter how hard you try .
 Toe Strap broke within 1 month . Horrible . Other then that good flip flop . t t t t t t t
 I bought these based on the high number of reviews and high ratings , but I was in for a surprise . You see this sandals that everyone 's `` husband '' and `` boyfriend '' likes so much and that last `` for 10 years '' -LRB- just check the reviews and you 'll know what I mean -RRB- . Are n't all THAT good.They are a bit large , first I ordered a Size 11 -LRB- my normal size -RRB- then had to exchange them for a pair size 10 . Both times they were shipped fast , no complaints there.The second pair had a good fit , but they make my toes bleed . After wearing them for only thirty minutes or so and some moderate walking around , I had a wound on the second toe on my left foot . The straps between the big and second toe is also quite uncomfortable and quite frankly a bit painful.Overall , I would n't call them total garbage , but certainly not that good and not worth the current price .
 These are really cool sandals . Even with the ` novelty ' item of a beer bottle opener on the bottom of 1 is good for a laugh ... once . They are comfortable and very stylish . Here 's the rub ... Bought in July of 20 +11 , I wore them a significant amount of the time . However , when you get to some days in September and then to October ... here in Kansas , it 's not flip flop time . Fast forward to March 20 +12 , and the front sole of the flippers are darn near gone , I mean all the way to the base bottom of the shoe . Now I do n't know how many days I wore them , but I 'm handicapped and do n't walk a lot , which is a factor . So all in all , nifty lookin ' flippers , but they wear out way to quickly . WAYYYYY to quickly . Believe I 'll have to go shopping again . Just one guys opinion on one set of flip flops , perhaps it was a fluke . But it 's not a workmanship problem , it 's a materials problem.Good luck and FINS UP!PART II
 Minimal use over a period of a year . Toe strap broke on one sandal . When I contacted the company about replacement , it was pointed out that the warranty is good for 6 mos only , regardless of use . No more Reefs for me . Other makers have much better warranties .
 I attend a fairly large campus and walk 1-3 miles every day between classes . Last semester I wore a cheaper Reef product -LRB- the Phantom sandal -RRB- , and it provided good cushioning for long walks . However , it flattened quickly , as other reviewers have pointed out , so I wanted to trade up . The angle of the item picture misleads the viewer into thinking that it has good arch support and cushioning . This is incorrect . When I got the sandals , they were very stiff , and the part between my toes was more abrasive than the Phantom sandal . Imo leather is not a good option for a sandal . It does look `` prettier '' , but it 's not that comfortable . But I decided to try the sandals some more anyway . They proved to be more uncomfortable than the Phantom sandal ; walking long distances feels like walking on blocks of cement . My feet were extremely sore -LRB- btw I 'm 21 and almost never have sore feet -RRB- , and that air bubble under the heel was not helpful at all . Furthermore this sandal stains very easily . After wearing it for two hours , there was all kinds of dirt and crud stuck between the crevices of the foot bed . I have never had this happen with a sandal before . So it ends up looking really gross . Overall I do not think it was worth the extra money , either in style or substance .
 Look around through the reviews here and you will see a few people complaining about otherwise good sandals falling apart prematurely . Well , after 11 months you can now add me to that list.The inner straps on the right one pulled free -LRB- all three -RRB- during a walk back to the hotel . I finished the trip barefooted and tugged on the same straps on the left one out of curiosity . They also pulled free quite easily . The straps seem to simply a press fit to holes in the tops of the sandals ; there was no evidence of glue or stitching.Friday afternoon at the Chinese factory or bad design ? I suppose that it does n't really matter . I 'm still out a pair of expensive sandals that are n't covered by a warranty . Since this issue only seems to be hitting a few people , it 's probably just shoddy craftsmanship and not poor design , but buyer beware - if you get a bad pair and they fail after 30 days , you 're eating the cost , not Reef . And as a `` premium surf brand , '' they 're not cheap.Two stars because they WERE great sandals before they fell apart .
 These were very good sandals while they lasted . Mine lasted ~ ten & one half months . The outer side strap on my right one became unattached from the sole - all three foci . It looks like they might have been glued . I did get them wet a couple of times . Mine cost U$ 42.31 . I think I should have gotten more out of them than that . I can buy a lot of rubber flip flops for that money .
 I have had multiple pairs of Reef sandals and love them . UNFORTUNATELY , this pair broke within a month or so , popped out just like the proverbial Jimmy Buffett song -LRB- stepped on a pop top , blew out my flip flop -RRB- , color me disappointed on this purchase .
 I have owned many Reef sandals and was hoping to upgrade by going with a leather pair . The sizing ws accurate as always and they were also stylish , Unfortunately after the first mile of walking in them , the straps starting digging into the top of my feet causing blisters . I have not been able to wear them and plan on sending them back .
 I 've used this sandals for like 5 days now , the reef logos in the back end of the sandal are already fading and looking really bad , like the sandal had like months of use.Also i ordered the black ones and they are getting to look like white dirt or something on the foam bed . I thought they would be more comfortable but not what i expected . This added to the fading logos make the sandal look like at least 1 year old.I should return these , im thinking . For the price , i definately got ripped off . I bought Adidas sandals in the past for the same price i got these , i still have them since Dec 2007 and wore them until i got these and they still look VERY good but i just thought it would be a good time to buy new sandals , either i was wrong or chose the wrong brand . =-LRB- Buyer beware .
 I have never had a pair of Reefs that has fallen apart so quickly . First the leather lining comes undone on both sandals , then a few months later the nylon part is broken . My past reefs have lasted at least 2 years if not 3 . This pair broke in less than a year . I wonder if the manufacturing process has been compromised . My sons Reefs bought at Costco had to be returned after about 2 months because the leather was delaminating from the sole . What is up with Reef ?
 Lets look at thisYou are going to put the opening of your bottle next to the same surface that you walk in public restrooms on .
 Horrible quality , completely fell apart in 6 months . Broke in , and realized they also make your feet smell like dirty dogs a ** if . you get them wet . * note , when wet you will slip and slide.all over the place in addition to the foul smell that will present itself.More about the quality ; front toe strap partially disconnected @ 4 months , side lower connection shortly thereafter . Can not believe such catastrophic failures from what is supposed to be a good manufacture . I guess that 's why I will be going back to purchasing only rainbow or olulukai sandles as Reef has gone gimmick over quality . * on that note , be careful ! The novel placement of metal `` church key '' beer opener in the slippers arch can cause you to lose control and eat serious s # $ t when descending stairs , ladders etc , especially wood or metal ! `` Stay on your toes '' so to speak !
 I 've long been a fan of reef sandals but this model it terrible . The soles have separated/split apart after two months of wear .
 This is the most disappointing purchase I have ever made on Amazon . These sandals slip on wet surfaces -- like the shower floor in my gym , or the area next to the pool , or wet sidewalks . I ca n't believe that no one commented on this in all the reviews that I read before making my purchase . Did everyone else buy them to wear to the mall off of Rodeo Drive ? I missed the window to return these but I will definitely tell everyone I can not to buy Reef sandals . The stupid bottle opener gimmick on the sole of the sandal will scratch your hardwood floors if you wear them inside . Amazon or Reef , please credit my account ! I would be happy to pay the shipping cost to return them - far less expensive than a lifetime of therapy after I slip on a wet floor , crack my head open , and end up a TBI patient . I ca n't believe I paid $ 44.00 for this scam .
 I ordered these to replace a lost pair of reefs that i had for over 4 years with no issues . could not find the same style that i had but these appeared to be similar to them . these weigh at least twice that of my old pair . they are ok i suppose , one of the major issues with purchasing something online without finding them local to try on/touch first . another reason to only buy books or items that you have physically had contact with first from any online retailer . to much of a hassle to return items . bottle opener on sole may be interesting but only a drunk/stoned person would even consider using it to open anything they would be drinking from .
 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 the seller original claimed that it is gore-tex , I bought it , it is not gtx , and more , there is no evidence to show it is waterproof.I contact the seller , but no response at all.won ' t buy from it again.now they revise the description , but be noted , it could still be a lie to say it is waterproof .
 I began serious running about a year-and-a-half ago using cheap running shoes . Everyone kept telling me I needed to upgrade before I injured myself . I finally went to a running store where I was fitted with a pair of Brooks Beast due to my over pronation . As I first started running in them they seemed fine , but with each training run they became more uncomfortable . By the end of a month I was in such excruciating pain I could not run a full mile . I switched back to my cheap shoes and had immediate relief from the pain . I was back to running 10k distances in a few weeks . People who walk in these shoes seem to love them , runners seem far less taken with them .
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake .

 After reading other reviews I anxiously awaited my own order of black suede boots . But when the came I was disappointed . The suede looked worn in many spots and it seemed so thin . The black had worn down to a grey in some spots such as the toe and heel . Also the boots I received were not wrapped in plastic and had debris on them and a few small soiled spots . I felt like a fool for spending almost $ 100 on these ! I could have gotten better at Target !
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .

 When I first tried these on , they seemed roomy , but when I stood up , it was as though there was no foot bed between the bottom sole and the inside covering , which , by the way , was dirty . I tried them outside , since it had just snowed , and the snow caught in the tread and turned to ice , sending me flying . What a disappointment , but , you get what you pay for .
 I returned this ! I did n't even try to use it because it does not look feminine . It fits awkward ... like my feet looks big and weird . I do n't know what exactly is wrong but it just does n't look nice to me . It 's heavy too !
 The shoes are very nice . My son loves them . Unfortunetly they were for me . The sizing is way wrong .
 I remember when Converse meant quality but not anymore . I purchased these for my son and in just a few months the literally fell apart the whole leather shoe came apart from the sole on both shoes . The leather is still in new condition so they were not abused in any way just poor quality .
 I am in the process of returning the shoes because two weeks after wearing them , the rubber `` bumpers '' started to pull away from the base of the shoe and then completely split .

 Love the color but very disappointed in the fit . I have heard for so long how comfortable the Acorns are but having narrow feet I just swam in these ... way to wide . I could n't see that these were any better made or felt any more comfortable than a similar pair for sale at Bi Mart for $ 6.99 . As for arch support I found none . Not happy with my purchase at all but tried washing them to see if that would give them a snugger fit -LRB- which it did n't -RRB- and of course not returnable after that ... only good for the yard sale I am sorry to say .
 they say they are supporting to your feet but really they have a sole but they have no support , , the are overpriced , , , i really needed a good slipper to wear around when home , , i was disapponted completely
 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .

 Heel height is advertised as 3 inches . The cork part is 3 inches but the lining adds another 1/2 inch which was more than I could handle . Wish the description had given actual height of heel . These shoes are beautiful and fit well . I will not wear them .

 I should have known not to buy shoes without trying them on . The fit was way off . I 'll never buy shoes online again .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 Very happen with the purchase process . Very quick and easy to order . Got to me EXTREMELY quick . But , warn them for 5 days and the sole on the left boot is squeeking farely bad . There is no damage whats so ever to the boot or the sole . Took them to a boot repair place and they didnt want to touch them cuz they were too new . Will be contacting the dealer for refund or exchange .

 These shoes are adorable , but they HURT ! My feet were killing me within ten minutes of wearing them . I 'm a teacher who is constantly on my feet , and I was excited to get Naturalizers , which are supposed to be made for comfort ... not successful ! I have tried to `` break them in , '' but the fact of the matter is , they just hurt!A cute pair of shoes if you do n't plan on doing a lot of walking , but not very functional . Try Aerosoles instead ; I 've had great luck with their heels .

 The shoe rack works fine , but the picture put up is very deceptive . It only comes with ONE shelf , and the picture shows two stacked together . I have no idea what a person would want with one shelf since half your shoes would be on the floor anyway , so whats the point ?? Way too expensive for one shelf . Returning this !
 Purchased this item for a small space in a closet . The photograph shows three pairs of shoes lined up across this shelf . These must be children 's shoes because the shelf is only 22 inches wide . The quality was okay , but the price is exessive for enabling you to stack two pairs of adult shoes .
 From the picture I expected the mesh to have 2 tiers where I could put shoes on them . Instead it was just one . I am very unhappy with this and have to now purchase another one to have a second tier .
 I 've also made the mistake of not noticing that it only comes with 1 shelf . Much too expensive compared to the rest of the products . It 's not very durable and does n't hold more than two pairs of adult shoes . I 'd say this product and it 's ad is very deceptive . It sucks .
 I wish I could give NO STARS ... Worst seller experience on Amazon I have had . This chinsy little shoe rack was not worth a quarter of the price the seller charged me . It does nothing for my need for a shoe-rack , and I am still going to have to shop for one now , as this shoe rack went directly into the garbage can , as did all the money I 'd wasted on it .
 There are two shelves stacked together . But what you are buying is only one ! Screw it ! It costs no more than $ 10 .
 This item is not worth the money since the picture gave the impression that it was a dual shelved product . This is the first time I buy something on here and am not satisfied with the product due to price vs worth .
 I purchased this shoe rack last week , thinking that $ 20 was a good deal for a 2 tiered , mesh shoe rack . When the rack arrived , it was only half of what is pictured on the seller 's page . Other reviewers , who are apparently just argumentative , or who are related to the seller , suggest `` reading the details or reviews would have shown me what the product actually was '' , but thats not acceptable to me even * if * the accurate details really were printed in that section . The image shown is that of a TWO TIERED SHOE RACK . Either modify this picture to show whats actually being sold , or perhaps enough crappy reviews and equally crappy sales will remind the seller of what integrity is all about . Yes , the DIMENSIONS listed of this rack are those of a single tier , but Im not in the habit of corroborating printed measurements with what appears in printed images of the products Im about to buy .
 Within 1 month , there were two spots that were starting to get wear spots . Within 1.5 months , there were 3 spots and the plastic end came off . So 2 months and in the garbage they go . I work inside in an office and I only wear these shoes every other day so they have not seen any `` abuse '' . If you want shoe laces to last like the ones that came with your shoes , keep looking -- these are very poor quality . To make it worse , they are expensive and poor quality .
 I am disappointed to receive my laces and see that they are n't white . So now I 'm back at the website and I see that what I ordered was actually called ` natural ' . The picture made them look white , so I ordered them , period . I should have checked the writing as well . Also I 've noticed that there are actually no true white laces on the ` athletic shoe ' , flat lace section . Who woulda thought ??? You know ? So when I scrolled through the colors which are n't clear by the small pics , I found what looked like white in the enlarged picture . Mistake . I do n't know - just sort of misleading in passive way . Surely the owners know they do n't sell white and that many people want white ...
 i made an order for 63 &#34; fat white shoelaces . i recieved skinny laces . i called back to return and they &#34; dont carry fat laces 63 &#34; in white &#34; , the website says otherwise . better of going to footlocker
 Inferior quality to original laces on my Adidas Adi Racers ; these are excessively plastic-y and too thick . I paid nearly $ -LSB- ... -RSB- shipped , when I could have gotten equivalent -LRB- these are very low-end -RRB- laces for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- with free shipping via Prime . I expected better laces based on the premium and the pictures and am really disappointed .
 There was an honest mistake on the part of this company where the first page said `` FLAT '' shoe laces and I ended up with FAT shoe laces . Being there are also spaghetti style laces I assumed `` Flat '' meant traditional laces . I was pretty disappointed to receive huge fat laces in the mail .

 I have worn shetchers for ever but this pair the seam seperated after one day need to send them back
 Based on some of the reviews here and after trying on my size in a different material , I ordered my preferred style from Amazon . I am on my feet anywhere from 10-6 hours a day and needed something that would hold up better than my regular sneakers . After wearing these to work for a few days I began to realize that they completely failed to support my feet eventually leaving me with the early symptoms of plantar fasciitis . I added a highly recommended orthotic and they became more tolerable but now after less than a month , the color is beginning to come off of the toe area . I am not one who is willing to throw out a pair of $ 60 shoes but I am more than willing to ask for a refund . If you are looking for something comfortable that supports your feet for long periods of time I would not recommend these shoes .
 they have black spots on them like they had been sitting where someone was painting and have over spray on them could not find a way to contact seller

 Last time I checked , shoes laces are pretty basic . . However the color is just what we needed .
 This product was made with cheap materials and were extremely stiff . There was no way to sit in them without having your legs straightened all the way out . Undesirable to say the least - I recommend buying real leather that is able to stretch with your natural body movements -
 Purchased after reading the reviews and viewing the pics of the gold boots . Thought they would be the thigh highs I was looking for , just for casual wear . They were very large on my leg , and loose from bottom to top . Just did n't look right . They were also stiff and difficult to sit down while wearing . I tried them on several times with different looks but could n't find a reason to like them . So , back they went . The shoe part also looked very wide with a pointed toe that was huge . Not a good looking boot , and I would n't even wear them for costume since they just did n't look right . Glad that others found them acceptable and that 's all that matters . The silver ones appear to look great , but I now know how they look . Too bad ...

 This boot only lasted me 2 months wearing them every other day . The zippers splits apart . It is not water proof and the air pocket on the bottom popped . Do n't waist your time or money .
 I am currently `` between shoes '' as Wilson keeps discontinuing every model I 've liked . I generally buy shoes that are labeled `` extra wide '' . I 've worn shoes the manufacturer has called 2E , 3E and 4E . I do n't mind wearing more than one pair of socks , in fact I prefer it.I gave this shoe a try because a tennis specific website indicated this was a good choice for wide feet . It is n't . At least not if you need width in the forefoot . I spent several days trying to stretch these guys out and then finally decided I 'd made enough progress to give them a shot on the court . It was a painful experience and I really could not play my game with them on.I think the workmanship of the shoe is top notch but the shape is really not foot-like . If you look at a Nike shoe or a Wilson shoe , they are shaped like feet . This shoe is shaped like a canoe . If your feet are shaped like canoes then you 've found your shoe.I think on the basis of my experience with these shoes that I like a comfort oriented shoe . The ride in these things is harsh . Using a car analogy , I am guessing I need a Cadillac type ride and got a Corvette by mistake .
 I usually do n't review products but I had to tor this one . ITS THE WORST SHOES EVER . it ripped after 2 weeks . my knee started hurting like nothing else . PLEASE DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY . Its low low quality product .

 I dont like anything about this shoe . I ordered this shoe along with a different pair both same brand . Both size 8 . This pair was a little too big and the other pair was too small -LRB- my foot hung off the back -RRB- . I dont like the way this shoe looks on my foot . It looks quite ugly ... the top , bottom , back . . all parts of the shoe is ugly . And theres splotches all over the entire shoe . Im honestly not sure what color the shoe is supposed to be bc half of it is dark and the other lighter . But its in splotches . I would be embarrassed to wear it out bc it doesnt look right . Dont buy this shoe . Its ugly and it has mistakes .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 The shoes look great but the quality is terrible . I purchased these heels wore them once and the leather around the heel was peeling and the sole of the shoe was poor .
 Very happen with the purchase process . Very quick and easy to order . Got to me EXTREMELY quick . But , warn them for 5 days and the sole on the left boot is squeeking farely bad . There is no damage whats so ever to the boot or the sole . Took them to a boot repair place and they didnt want to touch them cuz they were too new . Will be contacting the dealer for refund or exchange .

 Bought these for my son for his harvest festival at school . He loves his rain boots , but these fell apart at the back seam before they could even protect him from the puddles . Right up the back of the boot where the rubber meets rubber it just came apart . Sad because these are adorable boots and even shoe glue and duct tape could not make them work for a bit . I will just stick to buying a cheaper store brand now .
 These boots were a total waste . If you live in town and plan on wearing them twice then they are for you . These were worn a month and not everyday only for mud and they feel apart where the brown goes to the tan they really just fell to pieces . You could be better off getting overshoes at walmart .
 after barely a month they fell apart . we did contact thecompany and they replaced them.we have bought rain bootsbefore , not from this company and not with this problem.hopefully they will last longer than a month.with all of that we can not give them more than 2 stars butcustomer service so far is a 5 star .

 I bought these shoes because I wear the same size in all my Steve Madden shoes and they do not fit . The problem is that the opening in the top of the boot in much smaller than my foot , so it is almost impossible to actually get my foot into the boot . I did manage to get the left foot in , and I know that the shoe fits because once I actually had my foot in the boot I had plenty of room and it looked cute . My right foot , on the other hand , will not fit into the top of the boot . I guess I will try to put them on again tomorrow but for now I am thoroughly disappointed with the fact that it is a struggle and I can still only get one boot on .

 they finally arrived and you ca n't imagine how disappointed i was when i could n't get the zipper even halfway up my calves !! i am a size 2/4 . i 'm 5 ' 2 '' and petite . even my feet are small -LRB- the size 6 is too big for me -RRB- ! i barely exercise so it 's not as if i have muscular calves . but these boots do n't fit ! my fingers actually hurt from trying to get the zipper up just a little bit farther , in the hopes that i could somehow wear them . but these boots are made for girls who have nothing but skin and bones for legs.i would have given them 1 star but i love everything else about them . i 'm just not willing to starve myself for them . hopefully i get a full refund .

 Although pretty , these wedges are uncomfortable . the straps rub and the rubber soul came off after walking from my car to the office , Maybe 60 yards away . -LRB- in optimist mode -RRB- >> > I dont mind saving money but come on now ... the rubber soul came off . In front off the toe , I think its might be because I usually get the wedges that have a curved up toe . Dont know , Dont care it came off
 Unfortunately , what Trotters describe as 6.5 must be a 5.5 . If I had known I would have bought a size bigger than the one I did . These shoes are not roomy at all in the finger area . Their height is not balanced with the rest of the shoe either . A pity because they look nice . But they feel very uncomfortable . They crush my fingers terribly . I really wonder why . I have purchased other models from the same brand and they fit perfectly .
 Trotters Women 's Jamie PumpMy wife had problems with one of the shoes that did not fit her well and the quality of workmanship was not up to par considering the cost for these shoes . Wo n't probably order from this vendor in the future .
 I bought these shoes to see if they would help ease some back pain at work . No luck yet . I also find the scuffed up toes disappointing . The literature on these shoes certainly falls into the too good to be true category for me.Moreover , I was surprised by all the packaging for these things . Two boxes , paper and canvas bags for each of them certainly seems excessive for a shoe claiming to be earth friendly . I prefer my Merrells .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .

There are two patches of fabric on the bottom of the shoes which make them extremely slippery . We were unable to use them at all on playground equipment since they caused our child to slip and fall . They ended up sitting in the drawer because they were too dangerous to use . Had we known that the bottoms are not not non-slip we would not have purchased them .
 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .

 My husband has worn Florsheim Imperials for 30 years . A typical pair for him lasts about 5 years and undergoes at least 3 resoles in that time with no problem . In less than 2 months , wearing them only 2-3 times per week , the sole on one shoe has split . We 've never seen such poor quality in a Florsheim shoe . Makes me wonder if the low cost found on Amazon means we were sold an irregular product to begin with . We have to have them repaired as he needs them right away and we can not wait for replacement process . Not an ideal situation on a $ 150 purchase .
 The sole on one shoe has delaminated twice since purchased . I was surprised since I had purchased this item before . Very disappointed .

 I love kenneth cole brand and my previous shoes were exactly the same but without cords . I spent many months trying to find them until I saw them here and I did n't hesitate to buy them . Now that I have them I barely use them because they are very hard and uncomfortable .

 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 I would think that a slipper in this price range would ensure that the dye does not bleed - a TOTAL waste of money because my feet a such a dirty black after wearing these slippers . It does n't matter if my feet are wet or dry - it is disgusting . Such a waste and disappointment .

 Unbelievable for the cost of these nurse shoes one would think that they would last longer than the basic rubber croc shoes.NOOOOOO ! These shoes are not worth the money spent , they came with the glue already pulling away from sole , if shoe is accidentally rubbed against something it rips the white off , they are not EASY to clean unless you want to play with white shoe polish . The straps are not secured through the whole shoe and tore right off when I was trying to wash them by hand . Please these shoes are only 2 months old , if that , and now I have to buy another pair of nurse shoes for work . Now I know not to purchase Nurse Mates go figure I guess it is true just because it is name brand does not mean it is worth the money !
 These shoes are horrible . they look cute but they do a number on your feet , i wore them in a wedding and we all had the same shoes and we were all three in horrible pain . they were all ditched before the reception and now i have a expensive pair of shoes waiting in my closet for me never to wear them again ... . dont buy them unless you like pain !
 This is a heavy clog and the insert is somewhat slippery . The clog seems mostly true to size , maybe slightly wide , looks very nice , but I find that I would need to wear athletic socks to stabilize my foot in the shoe . The arch support is too high/hard for my feet , and my foot slides forward , making for an unstable walk , almost losing the weighty shoe , so I really have n't worn them . Everyone 's feet are different , so this is just my personal opinion .
 Not well made . Had to return them . I do not recommend this shoe , especially for instructors . This shoe came apart the first time I wore it .
 I am not satisfied that my shoes took a long time to arrive . -LRB- Back-order -RRB- Once the shoes arrived they were too big . I am not able to return shoes . 80.00 lost ! :0

 They are very hard in the inside when walking in them so if you plan to walk in them for awhile you better go to Target/Wal-mart and get some cushioned insoles for comfort and they look like knock offs .

 This was my first purchase of work boots via the internet and my decision was ultimately influenced by other reviewers . That was a mistake I will not make again . The product was nothing close to what I expected . I have been in either construction or landscaping for 40 years and more of my life has been spent in work boots than anything else . Most days I wear them dawn past dusk , -LRB- to my wife 's dismay -RRB- , and I 've run the gamut from top-shelf to two pair for fifty-something . These are the first pair that are so heavy , as opposed to solidly built , so confining , as opposed to well-fitted , so awkwardly engineered as opposed to innovative , so uncomfortable as to be unwearable when not necessary . Soles are rigid and smack the ground , the boots are heavy without an obvious reason why , the tongue is padded where the eyelets need come together making them difficult , -LRB- I swear it ! -RRB- , to tie . They are truly sized only if one were to wear dress socks and subsequently in the cold weather they do not allow for any normal hosiery and thereby are n't warm enough to spend the workday outside . I would 've returned them immediately after one wearing if I had n't marred them my first day working with them . The only saving grace is soft supple leather uppers and one successful day being waterproof . Big mistake . I had the choice of so many well-known brands , models and prices that my disappointment is magnified that much more .
 Another product ordered and I receive it in a damaged box and they are not steel-toed as I ordered . . I need steel-toed boots here and soft toes are not acceptable . Since it will cost me more time to fly into a base with a post office and send these back , i will use these as slippers and order boots from another site . If you are going to sell a product ensure you have an adequate Quality Cantrol/Quality assurance Dept.

 I was excited to get these flats and I had outfits already planned for their arrival . When I opened the box I found them to be of the cheapest quality material , and the metallic paint was SPRAYPAINTED on !! It flaked off the second that I took them out of the box and made a mess on my table . The toes and bow were already scratched up from the shipping , and that was inside of a box so just imagine what one day of wearing them would do ! I am returning them today and getting a full refund.These shoes are cute in the picture , but do n't be fooled , they are of the worst quality ! Dont waste your money .
 Bought these for my son to use for soccer and t-ball . Good price , but got ta do something different . The back of the heel sticks up and rubs the ankle . The cleats are better for turf than grass or dirt . Would be okay for his age if it were n't for the heel issue.Fit was good . They also have a lace flap that is apparently tucked in for their photo .
 My 9 year old wears a 3 1/2 shoe and I bought these a half size bigger in a 4 . His foot would not go in them . They fit more like his brothers size 2 shoe . I returned them the same day ,

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I love these shoes - design and style but fit and comfort - no ; feet hurt ! returning cos my feet hurt!Asics please redesign the sole !
 I thought these shoes would be more comfortable , and felt like they were cheaply made . My heel falls off of the sole , and they hurt my feet . I may try a different pair and see if they are all the same , but did n't like this pair .
 i was excited to receive this package because i read that the shoes were very stylish and comfortable . however , upon opening the box , someone left an empty can of diet pepsi in it . it was gross . not a happy customer .
 Did n't fit and was n't quite what I was expecting . Going to give them to my girlfriend 's brother for xmas . Looking for a different style of Asics
 I have 3 pair of ultimate 81 's . Two fit perfect and weirdly one is quite snug -LRB- all 10.5 -RRB- . These and another Tiger -LRB- I forget the model -RRB- also fit poorly at 10.5 . I really hoped to be able to enjoy all of the Tigers . But unfortunately they do n't all fit the same . 10.5 is the best size for me for the Mexico 66 's . But they start to bother my big toes after 2-3 hours of wearing .
 I wore them around the house to get used to them and they gave me a blister .
 I ordered these on sale . Great deal - wish they were true to size . A 10 is normally a bit large on me and they were significantly small -LRB- mainly narrow -RRB- . Shoes were light and nice looking . I knew right away after trying them on .
 I wear a 10D shoe in everything . Sports , hiking , dress shoes . It has been years since I have bought anything but a 10D . These shoes did not fit AT ALL . 10D is way too narrow . Shoe does look ok but it suffers from stability problems as well as being too narrow . Tried shoe for a few hours to see if they would work or not , they did not . I did this because they are leather . Often leather is intentionally tight so people break it in . This did not happen at all with these shoes . Returning them after a few hours of use.The worse part is that I now have to worry if I am going to get a refund or not . If you are going to sell shoes on the internet you have to expect returns for refunds if they are mis-sized . I checked sierratradingpost dot com and all of the reviews said they are narrow so it is not just my subjective viewpoint.I should have found those reviews before but every time I try on a 10 wide it is way too wide . Even if I had found those reviews before I ordered , how would I have known if they were too narrow for my particular feet or not.In any case I trust Amazon will do the correct thing , they always have in the past , excellent customer service . And I will update when they do . For now I would suggest to NEVER buy any shoe from Amazon . Unless you have tried on the EXACT shoe model , size , and width in person.Amazon did come through as usual . Very appreciative , excellent customer service .
 I do n't know about the other colors , which seem to look okay , but the pink color is terrible !!! The rub off really means messy and ugly spots of pink and white all over . It is not evenly `` rubbed on . '' The shoe color is nothing like the picture . I am returning it .
 I wish ONE star was an option . This shoe is pleasing to the EYE but POOR in QUALITY !!!! The rubber bottoms on the heels broke off in the first WEAR !!!!!!!!!! HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!! So before the shoe was even broken in , we were paying to repair it . And then - Guess what ??? Anyone wan na guess ... . They came off AGAIN !!!!! I should have KNOWN something was WRONG when they gave you two extra complementary pairs of heel bottoms !!!!!! They KNOW they come off easy and have a bad base . I was so excited about this shoe but I 'm telling you people ... Go into a store , try on the shoe , save yourself the headache b/c now it 's too late for us to send them back and it was just a waste of money ... You get what you pay for !!! Convenience of ordering online is n't always the best option !!! Go to the Nine West website , stay away from the middle man when it comes to your shoes and other important items ... cd 's , books , dvd 's , all that 's nice ... . but HEELS ... Never Again . I bought this for my girlfriend b/c she loves heels and wears them 90 % of the time ... she has worn every type of heel from every brand and this one was just PATHETIC !!!!! Again , the shoe is pleasing to the eye ... looks really nice ... but it 's poor quality and it 's a waste of money ... . I have never ever had a prblm w/my orders frm amazon so I tossed the receipt as soon as she tried it on and her face lit up ! Did n't think twice ... returning it never crossed my mind ... so much for positive thinking ... Sorry to bore u. . . but I was really excited about this shoe and I 've adored ordering from amazon since I started last year so I thought hey , why not get my girl some heels -LRB- she is a high heel fanaitc -RRB- and it looked so nice ! She was so excited ... as she always gets when it comes to shoes ... Big , Big , Big , BIG Disappointment .
 There is n't a bit of leather in these shoes . THESE ARE COMPLETELY PLASTIC SHOES ! I would n't have bought them if I 'd known they were plastic .

 These boots look nice and fit pretty well . I bought them because the price was right - but after wearing them for 2 weekends -LRB- outdoors -RRB- the heels are both falling apart -- the grip on the bottom fell off of the left boot the first day , and after the 3rd day the grip on the bottom of the right boot was gone as well . This allowed rocks to be wedged into the resulting hollow and ruined the traction on flat ground . Yes , they 're cheap - but not cheap enough to fall apart so quickly !
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 this product is smaller than actual size . i ordered a 12 , which is my true size , but i needed a 13 instead . I returned the product instead of exchanging for the bigger size because i did n't like the high heal on the back and i decided that i wanted a pair that i could wear outside also . Plus , it was n't that comfy with or without socks . The black L.B. Evans Boulevard slipper is more comfy , especially without sox , it actually fits true to size , and you can wear it outside also because the bottom street-like sole on it . : -RRB-

 I bought these based on the other review 's recommendation , but now that I have worn them , I ca n't see anything special about them . The shoe itself is rather shapeless , and it is a little small in the toe area , but otherwise I would say they are true to size . The bottom also has no traction , so I felt like I was going to slip . There was more padding in these shoes than the Jessica Simpson Leve flat , but it was very thin and flat - if you need arch support , these are not for you . For the amount these shoes cost , I am kind of surprised at how little these shoes offer . It was like walking around in socks .
 The shoe takes the shape of your feet which is not always a good idea !

 Despite the `` lugged outsole '' of this shoe , after having worn it on the wet streets of seattle , they are VERY slick on smooth concrete . BE CAREFUL !!!

 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...

 This is the poorest boot that I have ever purchased . The right sole was rounded and the boot for a wide is very narrow . I returned them for a refund .
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 This is the poorest boot that I have ever purchased . The right sole was rounded and the boot for a wide is very narrow . I returned them for a refund .

 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .
 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .

 I ordered these sandals in a size 10 and they were too small . A friend of mine tried them on -LRB- she 's a size 9 -RRB- and they were still small . We think that the size 10 is more like an 8 1/2 ! I have other shoes in this same brand in a size 10 and they fit fine . Also , they 're not European Crafted like it says in the description , they 're made in China .

 This is easily one of the best pair of shoes I have ever owned in my entire life . The look , the quality , the feel , the fit ... everything was absolutely perfect . I wore -LRB- almost daily -RRB- the brown * burnished * version for almost three years . Its still in good condition though the color has faded a lot . I wanted to buy the exact same pair and found out that they do n't make the brown burnished version anymore . There is only brown and black . The brown is , well , dark brown and looks very very ordinary -LRB- I went to a store to try -RRB- . It is nothing compared to brown burnished which had a sexy burnished look which looked fantastic in any light . Brown sucks . It almost looks reddish brown . Its the exact same problem with another favorite of mine - Clarks Escalade . I do n't understand why they stopped making burnished versions . Black and Brown are just plain boring . Even the construction and leather quality seem to have gone down . I was a devoted fan . I did not have to worry about my shoe needs anymore . But now I have to search for a new favorite . Why Clarks ? Why ? All the new designs just plain suck ! Wave ? Really ? I think something bad happened in their design/management department . Sigh ! I am going to try my best to extend the longevity of my current pair .
 I agree with what many are saying . The uppers are well constructed , and the soles especially in the front where your toes flex , and at the ball of your foot are thin.I have left foot pain with certain shoes and I can not walk in these . Uncomfortable.Of course they cause no problem for my right foot.I have had this issue with many shoes . And many shoe companies pull this crap where they make a solid upper , and an office to the car sole . NONSENSE !
 I purchased my first pair of Clarks Touareg style shoes 2 years ago in a burnished brown color . I love those shoes . They fit great still and look good . I recently purchased a pair in black and am very disappointed . They do not fit snug . The mouth of the shoe is larger than my previous pair . They are about the same length however they feel too long and my feet slide out of the shoe . If I wear these I am sure to develop blisters and wear the heel of my socks . I 'm in the process of returning these shoes and will not purchase them again . I would only consider them if I were able to try them on in a store first , despite that I have purchased them before in the same size . I will look for another shoe company after this experience . This is a let-down ! Beware .
 I bought these lovely shoes and was thrilled when they came in . They fit great and are very comfortable , but the first time I polished them the brown color came right off and I was left with freaky looking shoes that I ca n't wearWhat a rip off ! . I would not advise any to purchase these shoes , unless you never plan to polish them . I hope I can have someone dye them for me .
 I loved these shoes at first . They 're very handsome , and well-made -LRB- true to Clarks history of high quality -RRB- . Swapping the insole with my custom orthotics was extremely easy . However , I found there was n't enough of a firm sole to support the orthotics . I teach , and after just a couple of hours of standing/walking , my feet ached tremendously . Unfortunately I had to return the shoes . I found they run true to size legth-wise , and were actually a tad wider than similar D-width shoes .
 This is by far the worst item I have every purchased here . The day I received this pair of shoes I realized that it was ugly . I never used until after about a month of purchasing and the sole of the shoe came off in my hand while I am attempting to place it on my feet . Was an absolute waste of my money .
 I purchased these slippers for Christmas for my wife . They are a complete disappointment . The sole on the bottom is so narrow , the slipper body completely overlaps it causing her feet to slide to the inside as she walks . In just two months , the inside edge of the slippers is wearing down and at this point she has gone back to her old slippers because she ca n't even walk properly in these . Unless you have very narrow feet , do n't waste your money .
 I bought my first pair of Qwaruba Cabin Slippers at REI in Seattle years ago . I was in love with them from day 1 . Here in Montana , I had occasion to wear them nearly every day ! When they finally wore out , I started searching for another pair just like them . It is almost impossible -LRB- maybe totally impossible -RRB- to find a pair of Qwaruba Cabin Slippers . You can find lots of Qwaruba slippers in other styles but I wanted to stick with what I knew I loved . So , a Google search brings up the slippers from Overland . Even though they were considerably more expensive than ALL of their competitors -LRB- Plow and Hearth has a nearly identical style on sale for $ 44.95 and REI 's nearly identical model sells for $ 60 every day -RRB- , I bought these because they were exactly what I bought before . WRONG !! Folks , even though these are a decent slipper , they are NOT a QWARUBA Cabin Slipper ! There is absolutely NOTHING on this slipper that identifies it as a QWARUBA . The `` brand '' is OVERLAND , stamped on the sole . Qwaruba slippers are stamped `` Qwaruba '' on the sole ! They identify themselves as Qwaruba slippers ! The brand tag also says `` Qwaruba '' on a Qwaruba slipper , the tag on these says `` Overland '' . If you look closely at the picture in this ad , you will see that the sole says `` Overland '' - after I returned them , I put this pic in a photo program that let me enlarge it . Also , you may notice that they are not actually called `` Qwaruba Cabin Slippers '' , just `` Women 's Cabin Slippers '' - the search for Qwaruba leads you here , but nothing in the information actually tells you they were made by Qwaruba . It leads you to believe they are made by Qwaruba but does n't clearly state that . A call to Overland after receiving the slippers got me a snippy representative that insisted they were made by Qwaruba but had absolutely no answers as to why nothing on the slipper identified it as a Qwaruba slipper . If you look closely at ANY other ads for a Qwaruba slipper , you will see the sole and brand tag actually say `` Qwaruba '' . These slippers did not fit like the original Qwaruba Cabin Slippers -LRB- they had slip in the heel that the real Qwaruba 's did n't have -RRB- nor was the sheepskin as soft or plush as the original . I returned these with the return shipping paid and $ 69 returned but I 'm out $ 5 for the original shipping on this knock-off bait and switch .
 After paying $ 75.00 you would think they would be a good quality no support worn out very fast . Very disappointed

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 I found these to be less than comfortable . The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour .
 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 The shoes are very cute but do not hold up . . I have only worn them 3 times and already seems are falling apart and the toes have funky looking wrinkles , I doubt I will be wearing them again . . otherwise I recieved my order superfast and amazon made the transaction so easy ! Amazon is awesome . . the shoes were not : o -LRB-

 I really liked these boots at first , but it did n't take me long to notice that there is almost no traction on the bottom , and you can unexpectedly slip on fall on tile , pavement made of smooth rocks , or even concrete pavement if it 's on the slightest decline.I 've had these boots for about a year , maybe a bit more and they look really shabby already even though I do n't wear them often because the leather is sooo thin that the tips of both toes got badly worn pretty quickly.Overall , they 're cute , and they 're great if you 're buying them for a specific occasion and do n't intend on them lasting forever , but otherwise it might be smart to spend an extra $ 30 - $ 40 for a more durable pair of boots .
 disgusting shoes , definitely look like faux leather . i never even put them on my feet , so i would n't know if they are comfortable . do n't get these mixed up with the sensational leather boots by Chinese laundry . those are beautiful boots . these are sickening . i just got them today , and I 'm returning them later this after noon . YUCK !!! and amazon.com you should be ashamed of yourselves . those boots you sent me were defective . the material was scraped of in various places . they looked like they had been melted too .

 I never bought a pair of specialty running shoes until around 2002 when I was advised to buy a pair of asics 2070s by a specialty running store . That model felt great and jumpstarted my running hobby . Since then however , every model has become progressively more uncomfortable -LRB- with the last reasonable pair being the 2090 -RRB- . Now they have the 2120 which was uncomfortable for me with minimal exertion . They have tightened the midfoot dramatically . I was having tingling in my feet with these after 2 miles . Was able to find 2080s for dirt cheap online and did stock up but of course they are no longer available now . Asics ! I 'm pleading with you ! change back to the old shoe shape or I 'll be running in adidas from now on .
 I was looking for a comfortable wedge heeled shoe to wear with jeans , and disappointingly , this was n't it . I wear a size 8-1/2 M and rarely have to order anything other than my true size . This shoe was tight in the toes and very uncomfortable -- they felt too small and a bit on the narrow side . I did n't think ordering a half size up would resolve the problem and honestly did n't want to have the hassle of exchanging them with the risk of the replacement size not working out well , either . I opted to return these .

 Bought for my husband . He 's not a complainer at all . He absolutely can not wear these shoes . In all our years this is the only pair of shoes I 've seen him give up on . He tried valiantly to break them in but they just hurt .
 While the styling on the Merge shoe is current , the quality is questionable . In the last few years , Kenneth Cole began manufacturing shoes in China . Consequently , the quality quality of materials and construction have degraded.When worn periodically -LRB- evenings/weekends -RRB- , these shoes should last 12 to 18 months . When worn on a daily basis , I doubt they will longer than 6 months . Eventually , the inexpensive leather cracks and the sole wears.However , I just purchased my second pair of these shoes . They are a bit expensive for low quality shoes , but I need the extended size and appreciate the styling.UPDATE
 I was pretty happy with the design and comfort of these shoes . However , the leather started falling apart on me after < 1 month . As a result of this and other expereiences , I 've taken to only buying Kenneth Cole shoes when they are on sale for cheap -LRB- because they really have not been lasting very long for me -RRB- . I figure if I can get them for ~ $ 70/pair , and they only last for 4 months , it 's a bit like getting $ 200 shoes that last for a year.When Kenneth Cole improves the durability of their shoes , they will end up doing a lot better for themselves .
 I have been buying Kenneth Cole shoes for over 8 years never had an issue with them . So this year when looking for the shoes I have been buying I found they do not make them anymore . So I purched the Merge shoes . Having worn them 4 times they are alreay falling apart . The black finish is flaking off . The sole is comming apart as well . I would suggest looking for another product . I think my days of Kenneth Cole shoes has come to an end .
 I love the Kenneth Cole brand , but I had a HORRIBLE experience with these shoes . The shoes were constantly rubbing my feet the wrong way -LRB- despite being the proper size -RRB- and left my feet extremely uncomfortable . I returned these and got a pair of Kenneth Cole Reaction Shoes , Strong Force Moc Toe Oxfords - these shoes were like walking on a CLOUD ... GREAT , comfortable shoe .
 I was happy from the design of the shoe , but in less than 2 month the shoe starts opening from the side and I could n't wear it . It is the second pair in a row . I return the first and got a new one , but again it happened . So if it is not really for cheap , you just waste your money .
 never worn them returned them , but these are very shiny , they look like the rental shoes you would wear with a tux ... the pictures are very misleading ...
 the size is more than usual , and deformed the top of the shoe , with only 2 days of use , expecting more of the brand
 The shoes showed up with a large scuff on one shoe . They looked like someone had wore them before.The scuff had scraped away the leather down to a large white mark . Return !
 I am not sure how these are made but the sole split -LRB- more like broke -RRB- straight across at the ball of the foot after only a couple months of wear . Not like I go jogging in them or anything . Well made shoes should not do that .
 I 'm on my second , but my last pair of these . The shoe is very comfortable but has two really bad flaws . The first is the back of the shoes . Despite not being hard on my shoes , the backs have worn to the point that the leather has split and the stuffing is literally protruding through . This happened to a previous pair and each shoe was fixed by the shoemaker with reinforced leather -LSB- ... -RSB- . This gave them an additional 6-12 months of usage . Now the same thing is happening to this pair . I 'm not going to fix this pair because of the second major problem with them , the shoes scratch and shed their color by almost looking at them . Yes , minimal abrasion or friction to them cause deep scratches or erosion to the shoes finish . This is unacceptable and therefore these shoes will be discarded when totally worn out and I will not purchase them again .
 The boots were delivered within reasonable time . The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear . Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price . There is however a defect I noted on the second day . There are small cracks , about 12 , 1/4 '' long each at the back of the right shoe . Photo sent . Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund . Unfortunately , I am based outside of US and can not ship back using prepaid UPS provided . Could have been nice shoes .
 Rockabilly Skulls Stars & Cherries Handbag Purse ClutchI do n't think this bag is made particularly well for the price , but my neice just `` had to have it '' , and so I purchased it for her . We 'll see how long it lasts . Personally I think $ 5.00 would have been a must more fair price .
 Bought this based on the good reviews but I ended up with major and painful blisters after a short distance . The leather front is actually very tough and so , buyers beware !
 I was under the impression that this was a mid level shoe . Higher than a low-cut shoe . The 1st day I used them I rubbed a blister on the back of my foot which I have to avoid doing due to my diabetes . I now can only use these shoes to go out in , not for walking that I was buying them for .

 The boots came to me two sizes too small - I 've been wearing 8.5 boots for 30 years , normal width , but these boots could n't take my foot if it were two sizes smaller ! Yet this did n't constitute an `` Amazon Caused Problem '' so I got stiffed full shipping charges BOTH ways.Don ' t ever buy shoes from Amazon unless you can afford to pay LOTS of shipping costs just to find out what the manufacture decides is your size ! In my case I guess that would be a men 's 10.5 or 11 in triple E width!Also - their definition of `` vintage tan '' was more like a `` distressed mud '' color , not even close to the picture color . Once again - do n't buy shoes/boots from Amazon !

 I also ordered the loafers and received sandals . When I tried to return them , I could only exchange them even though my size was out of stock . After three very long calls to customer service , I was allowed to return the sandals for a refund , but had to pay the shipping myself . If you order these shoes and get the sandals , it might be best just to keep the sandals . For me , at three hours of my time on the phone , plus twelve dollars in shipping , it would have been cheaper to keep the sandals .
 I ordered the loafer and got the sandals . I will keep the sandals , they are not bad , but I wo n't order from Propet again .
 The sandals are okay , not terrific , too much of a hassle to return . Probably wo n't order again .
 Propet Women 's Comfy Walker LoaferI also purchased the loafers for $ 34.90 but received sandals instead . Must be a mixup with the photo/item number . Easy return process by printing pre-paid return label . Original shipping charges also to be refunded .
 Shoe is advertized as a leather upper . When it comes it is clearly marked as `` ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS '' inside the heel . Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15 % restocking fee for a `` damaged shoebox '' to 50 % for `` trying-on wear . '' Seller is a rip-off . Do not buy ! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use .
 The product took 2 weeks to arrive since it was originally shipped to wrong state . Then , I received the wrong color . Size ordered fit at least two sizes smaller than same size from any store . Even when color and size were wrong , I had to return to store at my own expense . Poor custumer service . I will not buy from this company again .
 Not the best fit , and not the best color . I wear them occasionally but not often . My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles .
 Other reviews were right that these seem to run a little small . Both a little short and maybe a little narrow too .
 This shoe is pretty and stylish , but not true to size . I ordered a medium width . The shoe fit OK except for the heel , which was way too narrow . I had to return them .
 i was looking for nice plain low heels.i trusted the hushpuppies brand . needed 11 ew . to narrow and bottom of shoes were slick . a plus size girl could slip and fall in these real fast . i returned them . i suggest cloudwalkers instead .
 This is a very cute shoe , especially the style and the height of the heel . However , it is not made of leather as advertised . This makes a difference to shoppers as myself , as shoes made of manmade materials do n't breathe well.Also , I ordered a Medium-width shoe , but this style runs extremely narrow . I have never had to buy a Wide-width shoe in my life and am consistently the same size for dress shoes . However , these are more than uncomfortably tight on my foot.It 's too bad , because the seller mailed the product to me in record time . Their customer service was also very responsive when I contacted them to return the item . Overall , I would not give the seller a negative rating , but would caution people interested in purchasing this product as they may need to order a size up -LRB- esp . in width -RRB- .
 I looked all those nice reviews but I was disapointed when the shoe came . It is pretty but has a slipery sole . And it is not leather as advertised .
 I normally wear an extra wide shoe . I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it .

 I had to return these shoes as soon as I tried them on . The leather along the ankle areas is so stiff it actually hurts your ankle when you walk around . I felt the discomfort immediately . Definitely not recommended to anyone .

 The boots came to me two sizes too small - I 've been wearing 8.5 boots for 30 years , normal width , but these boots could n't take my foot if it were two sizes smaller ! Yet this did n't constitute an `` Amazon Caused Problem '' so I got stiffed full shipping charges BOTH ways.Don ' t ever buy shoes from Amazon unless you can afford to pay LOTS of shipping costs just to find out what the manufacture decides is your size ! In my case I guess that would be a men 's 10.5 or 11 in triple E width!Also - their definition of `` vintage tan '' was more like a `` distressed mud '' color , not even close to the picture color . Once again - do n't buy shoes/boots from Amazon !
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 el producto aun no ha llegado al lugar de destino , tiene mas de un mes de retraso y aun no ha sido despachado para recibirlo en mi local ...
 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 I meant to give it a five stars but for some reason it showed two . Anyways , I just simply love these sandals they are very confortable and light . One recomendation that I find it helpful is when you buy thong sandals make sure that you order a size bigger so they do n't fit very thight on your foot and create blisters between your toes .
 These are cute sandals , but there is not much to them . Just a piece of leather for the sole and the top . I am sending them back because they do n't seem even worth the sale price I paid for them . I am afraid a person could feel every tiny pebble on the ground through the thin soles and that they would n't last long at all .
 THIS PURCHASE WAS CHARGED TO MY CREDIT CARD ON DEC 21 BUT NEVER DELIVERED . I SENT YOU AN EMAIL ABOUT THIS MATTER .
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .
 The boots were delivered within reasonable time . The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear . Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price . There is however a defect I noted on the second day . There are small cracks , about 12 , 1/4 '' long each at the back of the right shoe . Photo sent . Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund . Unfortunately , I am based outside of US and can not ship back using prepaid UPS provided . Could have been nice shoes .

 Wow ! Super disappointed with this bag . Bought as a gift thinking it would be a cute bag to carry for the summer and to my horror it was a disaster . So much smaller than the measurements , more for a toy Barbie doll than an adult . I 've several things from the so called `` world wide fare '' and have always been miffed and disappointed . No more ... never again !!!!!

 This shoe , nice in style and well made was miss sized . I wear a 14 and the shoe was a 12
 Recently ordered these shoes for the price . I wear a size 14 's and could not even get these on my feet . Not sure if they stamped the shoe with the wrong label -LRB- they said 14 -RRB- but they were tiny . On the plus side they were easily returned .
 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 Ok , I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother . I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color . I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes . Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones , The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2 . WTF ? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time . Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift . The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA .
 A few years back -LRB- though it seems like forever ago -RRB- , I was in graduate school for anthropology . I was the studious type and had gone straight from college to grad school , so I 'd never had time for a girlfriend . Sure , I 'd had my dalliances , but when it came down to it my only sustained love was anthropology . It was Spring Break , and I 'd gotten a grant to travel to the Oaxaca region of Mexico and study the indigenous Zoque tribe . Figuring I 'd need a sturdy pair of sneakers and impressed with the rubber shell toe design , I ordered a pair of Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoes -LRB- White/Black -RRB- on Amazon . They arrived the morning of my flight.That day I flew to Mexico City and then took a bus to the city of Oaxaca , where I transferred to another bus to get to the base of Monte Alban . I then climbed Monte Alban to reach the peak , where I 'd read the Zoque tribe could be found . At this point I 'd been on my feet for nearly 16 hours , but I had nary a blister or even a foot ache to speak of . I was beginning to really like my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . But they were caked in dirt and I was getting tired , so I decided to take a break at the summit . As I was about to wash my sneakers in a puddle of water , I heard a rustling of leaves . I looked up and all of a sudden 10 Zoque warriors were surrounding me , spears drawn . I knew a few Zoque phrases from my studies , so I told them , `` Tuk ` ay Tum , '' -LRB- `` I am your friend '' -RRB- but perhaps my dialect was off because that only enraged the warriors more . Soon , the Zoque Chieftan had his spear within an inch of my throat . At that moment , I was certain I would die right there in my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs.But just then , a female hand grabbed the spear and threw it on the ground . I looked up , and standing in the golden sunlight was the most beautiful girl I 'd ever laid eyes on . Her tawny skin glistened like a lake on a cool summer night , her jet-black hair was so soft it made horses jealous , and her eyes were like two perfect almonds . `` I Almika , '' she said , gesturing toward herelf . `` I Dan , '' I timorously replied , awestruck by her beauty . `` Why joo here ? '' Almika asked innocently . `` Study , '' I answered . `` Joo study Zuque ? '' Almika continued . I nodded in the affirmative . At this , Almika 's eyes beamed with excitement . She said something in Zuque that made the warriors lower their spears.Relieved and relaxed , I strolled with Almika toward the Zuque encampment . Between her limited English , my limited Zuque and some hand gestures , we were able to communicate with one another . I learned that she enjoyed weaving and playing traditional Zuque songs on her ocarina , and more importantly that she was looking for a man but was having trouble finding one in her tribe . It was important to her that a man be brave and strong , as many men in her tribe were , but she also wanted a man who was cultured and could show her the world beyond Monte Alban . It was clear to her that I was worldly , but in order to win her heart I knew I 'd have to prove that I was brave and strong . So that night as I fell asleep on my straw bed in the encampment , my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs still caked in dirt , I resolved to show her that I was tough.I rose early and quickly learned that the Zuque men were setting out to fetch firewood . I waved to Almika and then followed them into the woods . Fortunately , I 'd had some experience gathering wood for the fireplace at my parents ' country house in Massachusetts . So I quickly noticed the dry pieces of wood , which impressed the Zuque men . When we returned to camp at midday , I had a haul of firewood in my hands as I espied Almika roasting a cob of maize over a tiny flame . `` Better fire '' I said , and threw some of my wood onto the fire . The sudden burst of flames frightened Almika and she dropped her maize on the ground . Without flinching , I picked it up and held it near the enlarged fire . When it was perfectly crisped , I proudly handed the cob of maize back to her . Beaming , Almika bit into the maize and exclaimed `` Ees tasty ! `` The rest of the afternoon was spent helping the Zuque men fix up one of the elders ' adobes . My repair skills honed on D-I-Y projects with my Dad at our country house in Massachusetts came in handy here . I impressed the Zuque men by patching up a small hole in the roof using some Trident chewing gum I 'd brought in my backpack . When we returned to camp at dusk , the men relayed tales of my handiwork to Almika , who smiled and locked her piercing brown eyes with mine . She walked toward me and we sat on two boulders around the fire during the communal tribe dinner of rattlesnake stew , flirting and laughing all the while.As dinner was winding down , I had my arm around Almika and was about to suggest we take things to an empty hut on the periphery of the encampment . But just then , we heard the shriek of a Zuque child . I looked over and racing toward us was a gigantic jaguar galloping at full speed . Instinctively , I grabbed a bow that was lying next to me and loaded it with an arrow . I 'd learned archery at day camp near my parents ' house in Massachusetts . My parents did n't want me to go because they thought the camp was run by a bunch of ne'er - do-well Hippies , but fortunately I convinced them to let me go . I pulled the bow string back , and released . It was so dark I could barely see what had happened . But then I heard the noise - first a whisper and then a full-on chant `` Dan ! Dan ! DAN ! DAN ! DAAAAN ! '' and when I looked closely , I saw that I 'd hit the jaguar squarely between the eyes ! Almika ran up to me and gave me a bear hug . I held her and just wanted to be with her , but jaguar blood was everywhere - on my arms , on my legs , and on my already dirt-caked Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .

 These shoes are not very good quality . The sole cracked in half after wearing for less than 2 months .
 I loved these shoes until both pairs -LRB- brown and black -RRB- almost simultaneously had complete splits across each sole after only one year of use . I 'm a physical therapist - work in a clinic - I 'm not crawling on the floor or doing anything rough on these shoes . These are Eastlands ! They should last for years to come - $ 75 down the drain .
 I hated these shoes ! I was very excited when they arrived because I thought they 'd be like my others of the same type . But they were patten leather , no real leather look . Also , the size I had before which fit perfectly was now way too small .

 Ordered the Straubing 's in black , brown and taupe . Quality of the leather in both the black and brown seemed sub-par . Almost looked plastic , I would recommended getting the boots in stone if you must . As for comfort , they were fine however these boots are narrow . I order the 6 W -- the boot was a little snug when I zipped it up - but no more than 6 steps the zipper split and the boot was stuck on my foot . I have a friend who purchase the same boots and was pleasantly suprised at how narrow the boot was - good luck .

 The boots were delivered within reasonable time . The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear . Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price . There is however a defect I noted on the second day . There are small cracks , about 12 , 1/4 '' long each at the back of the right shoe . Photo sent . Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund . Unfortunately , I am based outside of US and can not ship back using prepaid UPS provided . Could have been nice shoes .

 I owned a pair of Timberland Pitboss boots before these that have lasted me 4 years and when it was time to retire them I figure Timberland was a great brand so I picked up these at a local store for around 90 dollars ... . what a waste . They started out stiff like most new shoes but after wearing them for 3 months I started developing a sharp pain in my right heel , I have tried several different inserts and even the special heel pain inserts and none of them helped so I brought my old pitboss boots out of retirement and a week later viola ! pain gone ! Wore these 1 day the next week and BAM pain is back in full force . I tell everyone I know to stay away from these shoes and pray they have n't caused permanent damage to my foot.P.S . I work 40 + hours a week in an auto dealer shop on a concrete floorIf you want good work boots get these -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I bought this shoe for my son and really thought it would be everything that it said it was , but we were so surprised when i noticed after just two weeks that the the bottom of shoe on the soles cracked all the way across ! I was so shocked it being name brand that it would do that ! Needless to say i am very disappointed for alot of reasons . Would not recommend this shoe !

 I purchased these shoes for a great price on Amazon . When the shoes arrived , they did not look like the picture . The shoes are very `` pointy '' almost to the point of looking like womens shoes .

 Cute slippers , seemed comfy at first , but has such a high instep that your feet start to pull down on the sides , put extra stress on your feet and ankles so are not comfortable at all , could do without the instep . Would not purchase again
 Although the size in length was fine , they were VERY wide and no where on the advertisement did they say they were for wide feet . So we have n't had too much wear out of them at all.However the shipping time was great .
 Very nice causal/elegant look to them - Also very comfortable and the leather was quite soft and appeared to be of high quality ... . Who knew they would fall apart in less than a year ?? I only wore them about once or twice a week to the office and ocassionally for social outings . Within 9 - 10 months the leather was peeling and cracking , and one shoe began to come apart at the heel seam , rendering them completely unwearable . I will never purchase Giorgio Brutini shoes again ... . Never .
 The shoes were a little small but true to size -LRB- my own fault got half size too small -RRB- . They are unique which is cool but the front of the shoe appears long and just did n't have the look I wanted . Very comfortable , loved how the inside shoe bed was all bubbly and very cushioned.SELLER REVIEW - In short , find these shoes from another seller.Tried to follow their instructions but my order number is not recognized . Seller included instructions with the product on how to return IF purchased on their various websites but these instructions DO NOT apply for purchases on Amazon . I have contacted the seller through Amazon and am waiting for them to approve me to return ! What 's that ? While waiting I decided to check them out on BBB . I 'm nervous to say the least . They can only say `` I can assure you this was not intentional and a very unusual situation '' so many times before it gets old . If you keep reading the complaints there are many reoccurring issues this company has clearly yet to fix . I would check another seller if you want these shoes and avoid the hassle of having to deal with their `` customer service '' and I use that term loosely . Do n't take my word , check them on the Better Business Bureau and have a look at complaints and customer reviews . -LSB- ... -RSB- So many people ... had I checked first I would have never made the purchase to begin with . Love Amazon but not all sellers on their site offer as great of service as they do . I am however , very pleased with Amazon .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I also ordered the loafers and received sandals . When I tried to return them , I could only exchange them even though my size was out of stock . After three very long calls to customer service , I was allowed to return the sandals for a refund , but had to pay the shipping myself . If you order these shoes and get the sandals , it might be best just to keep the sandals . For me , at three hours of my time on the phone , plus twelve dollars in shipping , it would have been cheaper to keep the sandals .
 I ordered the loafer and got the sandals . I will keep the sandals , they are not bad , but I wo n't order from Propet again .
 The sandals are okay , not terrific , too much of a hassle to return . Probably wo n't order again .
 Propet Women 's Comfy Walker LoaferI also purchased the loafers for $ 34.90 but received sandals instead . Must be a mixup with the photo/item number . Easy return process by printing pre-paid return label . Original shipping charges also to be refunded .

 The size was wrong . Etonic has apparently altered their shoe sizes from past years . We matched the size from another pair of Etonic shoes and the new pair of shoes was different when they arrived , even though the stated sizes were the same . The shoes were returned for credit.John Martin
 these boots have heels that are too high . I can barely walk in them and they feel very unstable . The sole is not too flexible and they keep my feet cold . Otherwise they look good and the leather is nice and soft . Definitely not shoes one can wear all day long . Also , they seem to run somewhat bigger .
 Great shoe but realize that their sizes run very small . Get a minimum of a half size larger probably a full size is better .

 These Accept flats by Charles David are really cute - I love the round toes and the vintage-style cutouts . They come in so many colors too and will compliment many outfits . The only thing is , the material is very rigid and will hurt your feet after an hour or so . My feet are slightly wide and after a day of wearing them , the skin was rubbed raw and bloody . Ouch . I have not worn them since .
 I 've got this shoe in black patent . I trusted the brand , but this particular style is so hard that it made blisters on my feet the first time I wore it . The material looks kind of cheap too .

 My 24 month old wo n't wear these and she has other sandals that have never had an issue . She does n't like the way they feel . She will sometimes wear them with socks but they were mostly a waste to buy and I ca n't make her wear them .
 Tevas are great sandals . However , the ones that I 've ordered through Amazon are defective . There are sharp , little nubs sticking up on various places of the sole where the foot is placed -- very uncomfortable . All three pairs of this sandal model that I received -LRB- after several exchanges -RRB- have had this problem . Some pairs were worse than others . I 'm about to return the third and final pair . It must be a manufacturing defect , as none of the other Tevas models that we own have this problem . Hopefully , the pairs of sandals that we returned are taken out of distribution -LRB- i.e. , not passed on to other customers -RRB- .

 The Sole of the shoe is coming off at the heel . Wrote to Keen and sent pics . And I will update this review depending on their response . I had them for about three months . I was hoping they would last for three years . Keen failed me !!!! I was such a believer . now i 'm crushed .
 There 's one major flaw with Bostonian square toes - I have three pair so trust me when I say this

 If you wear a B width shoe , you will likely find this is too narrow for you . It 's more like a narrow width boot .

 Bearpaw Womens Leather Cowgirl Boot - Style 635 WestinI do not like the boots . Despite of the fency look , they are of poor quality . The soles are copletely sleek , I felt slippery even on rug . And the leather feels like a paper . I returned them immediately , but the order cost me a lot sending them back and forth.Avoid buying the boots online .
 I had to sell them they were two big . They said go one size up for half sizes .
 These shoes are super cute , and they look really nice in my closet . Unfortunately , I ca n't possibly wear them . I even took them to be `` stretched , '' and they were stretched as much as possible , but they are still way too small . I wear size 10 but size 10 is usually slightly big on me , so I would say these definitely run small and better not buy them in size 10 if that is actually your size .
 I do n't understand the high price on these when they are $ 21.95 to $ 25.99 for the designer cotton ones all over the Web . I ussually order from Amazon so that I can one click , but not at double the price .
 Would have been happy enough , but one of the shoes digs into my ankle , and literally scratches it every time I wear it . I have to put on a bandaid and really thick socks just to wear this boot . I 'd recommend spending a little more to make sure you get a well crafted boot . Perhaps I got a ` bad ' one of the lot , but , with what I paid for this , could I expect more ?
 A really good price but these shoes are not very comfortable . Pity the man that wears them all day ; I use them to do occasional yard work . The are sturdy and have a thick steel toe . The shoe laces are WAY too long and I have to double knot to take up the slack .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 I was so excited to find these boots in my size at such an incredible price , but they were `` lost in shipping '' and never arrived .
 I must say I am not very happy with these boots at all . I am surprised considering all the good reviews . The boots are way too big in the heel and very wide around my ankle . When I walk in these the extra material in front pushes inward and pokes my ankle . I could only wear for moments ... these will be returned A.S.A.P.
 Having read so many glowing reviews for Danner boots for so long , I concluded that they must be the best US-made boots money can buy and determined to try a few . Having done so , I feel I can safely conclude that my assessment was correct , but that is as far as it goes , as I can also safely conclude now that those who are enamored of Danner boots are the type who insist on buying US-made products in general . Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available -LRB- it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way -RRB- , but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn . The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes , causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking , as you would expect of a dress shoe . The Super Rain Forest -LRB- much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot -RRB- had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn -LRB- over the course of some 25 years wearing boots -RRB- to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking . The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly durable boot needs to be broken in , but for the prices Danner charges , I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots , which I found to be false . More to the point , I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers , as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made , in general . Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful -LRB- for a US Citizen -RRB- , but for the ordinary consumer , there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy . This review , by the way , is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers , but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products , so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots ; I just could n't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers -LRB- i.e. , Zamberlan & Scarpa -RRB- . They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional , but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion . Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots -LRB- as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer -RRB- , which means you would n't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot -LRB- Danner 's specialty -RRB- . It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot , with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner -LRB- the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer , so far as I know -RRB- .
 The Boots look great , but when I first put them on , the steel toe rubbed my large toe slightly . After four hours of wearing them , both sides of my foot were too sore to continue wearing them . One person suggested that they needed to be `` broken in '' , but I am not tough enough to break in the steel toe on the boot . The steel toe looks like it belongs on a regular or even narrow boot . I am now the owner of $ 186 boots that were worn only 4 hours .
 Dear friends of Amazon , I am reviewing the Danner Instigator GTX Gore-Tex -LRB- uninsulated/no thinsulate etc. . . -RRB- , boots . I am military , law enforcement , and an avid hiker ... so I was expecting a boot which fit the description which Danner labeled to the letter . My Danner military boots have lasted through many battles -LRB- on and off the field -RRB- . However , BEWARE !!!! These boots , while decent quality compared to similarly priced boots on the market , are not what I 'd expected . For one thing ... Unlike the photographs ... they are by NO STRETCH of the imagination BROWN with TAN highlights !!!!! These boots are as orange as a pumpkin ! As both military -LRB- uniform -RRB- and law enforcement -LRB- uniform -RRB- requirements are very specific , I discovered that these boots ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE under any conditions to wear for duty . And then I figured , `` Well ... I 'll just keep them for hiking then ! '' But , as soon as I undid the laces , and prepared to try them on for the first time , I quickly discovered that they have a LEATHER collar around the ankle section ... . another misstatement , as DANNER claimed they had a cloth/gore-tex like material which comfortably surrounds the ankle ! Yeah right ! That 's on the outside !? It 's cloth on the outside , and leather on the inside ? HUH ? Anyone who does ANY hiking will tell you that that is a friction problem waiting to happen ! Remember those rub marks when you wore crappy boots as a kid ? So I called them to get my money back . They supposedly have a `` no questions asked '' FREE returns policy right , which was one of the reasons I 'd picked them too ! But -LRB- again -RRB- , since I 'd ordered them through the MILITARY website , they would not take them back -LRB- nor would they take them back if you got them on AMAZON either she explained -RRB- ! So , now I am stuck with a pair of boots which CAN NOT be worn with ANY clothing imaginable -LRB- unless your going as a pumpkin to the next Halloween party of course -RRB- ! Signed , Really pissed off at Danner!PS . Also bought an extra pair of the `` supposedly '' impact dampening inserts too . They were $ 16 , and no better than the cheap gel Doctor Shoel 's -LRB- however you spell it -RRB- inserts one can obtain at any drug store for $ 6 . But do n't believe me ... come on and waist your money too ! My advice is to look at customer photo 's on each site , as when one tries to take a picture of them THEY DO look brown and tan ! But when you take them out of the box in the regular light they are not ! First pair of shoes I 'd describe as functionally and visually HIDEOUS !
 I had ordered a half a size less than I traditionally wear based on the sizing chart offered on the product page , however , the boot is still another half size larger than suggested . The hard heals also make my foot very prone to blisters even after walking only a mile . I would not wear these hiking again . They ruined a hike in Maine this summer . I do like the worn leather though . They look great .
 I thought the quality of this boot was lacking . They were stiff and felt cheap . Also , the lacing is really weird

 The shoe sole was great , but the surface material was too flimsy and tore off a different places within a few days . This shoes is not for regular work-out , but only for casual wear .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 It 's hard to break into the shoes . I have worn them many times and they still hurt , still stiff .
 The shoe is ok . The main disadvantage is that it starts to stink pretty bad after few climbs . My other sport shoes do not smell anyhow but this one should be called Stinky not Smoothy .
 I have three other pairs of Florsheim shoes size 8 1/2 that fit fine . This pair was clearly a 9 , or more , but I needed them immediately . So I put some Dr Scholl 's insoles in them and made do with them .
 This was a gift and she said these slipped off her feet while walking so I had to return and get the ones from the mall that she originally bought . Though she said the memory foam was nice before the slippage occurred .
 I was so disappointed in this product . I bought the ad hook , line , and sinker , thinking that the memory foam was a great idea , that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief . After about 2 hrs of wear , the foam is completely flat , which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard . SAVE YOUR MONEY ! These are awful !
 Product was as described but very little support . I have a pair of Temperpedic brand and these are NOTHING like them . Better to spend $ 50 and get a great pair of slippers rather than these knock-offs .
 DO NOT BUY !!! These are NOT memory foam slippers , they 're pure garbage . Plus the sizing is off , these are wayyyy too small.My feet began to sweat as soon as i put them on , the soles are made of the slipperiest plastic I 've ever seen and there is no memory foam whatsoever in these . Just cheap foam one would find as packing material . Terrible across the board.Wish i had read the reviews before ordering or noticed that these were from the `` AS SEEN ON TV '' folks , they only make cheap knock offs . More like `` ASS seen on TV '' am i right people?Seriously though DO NOT BUY THESE SLIPPERS !
 I had a pair of Tempurpedic memory slippers that I bought at Sharper Image that have worn out . I loved those slippers and wanted to find replacements . So I did a search on Amazon and found these slippers . Just so you know , these slippers are not memory foam even though they say they are on the box . They are a low density foam that springs back up when you step up . Memory foam goes down , conforming to your foot and does not come back up as you walk on them . If you are looking for a real set of memory foam slippers , simular to the ones that Sharper Image sells , do n't get these . You can get slippers simular to these at any department store for around $ 10 . I will be sending these back ! I 'm quite annoyed to have been mislead by these slippers . I think Amazon should take these off their website.Later addition
 While the slipper is comfortable enough , the quality of the product is awful . I have had mine for less than 6 months and the soles are seperating from the uppers , the insoles are seperating from the sole , and the sole on the left slipper is splitting at the toe . I have had cheep five dollar slippers last for several YEARS and these last less than 6 months ! What a waste of money .
 Although these slippers were good looking , my son could not wear them because they were too small and too narrow . The size was his normal size but these slippers tend to be smaller than the usual . I had to purchase another pair in another venue .
 I 've had them for a year now.They do n't break in.They do n't age gracefully.They are anything but comfortable.dr Scholls gels help , but not much.Heaviest pair of shoes , other than a futuristic pair of New Rock boots I have somewhere and will never ever wear , unless I am in a sci fi movie.People keep telling me how great my shoes look though , so I guess that 's the pay off . Anything for the looks ... arrrgh ... I am a musician . Not quite a victim of fashion , but I put some effort in looking good sometime .
 the shoes feel cheap i will not buy anymore pairs , i bought two pairs trying to like them and quality is not there anymore . that was all i bought before ... doc 's .
 I thought I would order the size that was recommended as a women 's equivalent size 9 . I was hopeful , but it so did n't work . The toe box is big and boxy and stiff , and my foot was floating in a shoe that was supposed to be right size for me . When I tried to walk in them my foot kept hitting against where the tongue of the shoe ends in front . Trying different lacing strategies did not help . My suggestion is that if you are a woman trying to buy an equivalent women 's shoe size that will fit you , it very likely will not work . Unfortunately they have to go back .
 Hi . I ordered this item on 4 May 2011 . At the time of order , it is still `` IN STOCK `` However till now 25 August , I am still waiting . I hope Amazon can fullfilled the order as they commit.Now they have replied mentioning that the stock inventory is not correct and they actually do not have this item.Amazon is not doing enough to get this item.It is a BIG Disgrace that they are not able to fullfill a order after 4 months.Totally not acceptable in term of serving the customer .
 The product ordered from Macy 's was as promised , but the customer service failed . The original order did not inclued the promised return label -LRB- or even a return address -RRB- , the only thing in this box with the order was the packing slip . This does not even have an order number on it.I called customer service to return first set of shoes ordered , as they were to big . The 2nd order for exchange , also had nothing in the box for return , just a packing slip . It says in on Macy 's return policy and when you call customer service , you can not only return an item within reason , you can use the enclosed shipping label , which was never provided.It has been over a month & I have not received a credit for first order returned , and had to hand deliver the 2nd order , as these were still not the correct size , to the store to make sure I will receive a credit . I 'm not even as upset about not receiving the shipping label as I ` am about not getting a credit for the 1st returned item , at least so far , and the length to time it has taken.I will not order from Macy 's again , ever.kimi62
 I wanted replace my 3-year-old UK-made Docs . I had read a few bad reviews about the new Chinese-made Docs , but I decided to give them a try . As soon as I took them out the box , I noticed the difference . Cheap looking . Tried them on and they felt and looked no better than similar , knock-off styles of shoes that fall apart in a year or so . As for my 3-year-old UK-made Docs ? They still have some mileage left in them and they 're staying on my feet until I find something with more quality .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I bought these shoes to wear on the way to work , walking through town and to and from the metro . The first day I had two blisters . They are cheaply made and extremely uncomfortable . They cut into my feet . I would not buy them again .
 The fit is tight . I wear a size 10M but these are narrow . My big toe knuckle rubs the edge and becomes very sore . I have to were socks to prevent blisters making the fit much tighter . I sit driving all day so I just wear them when I need to walk . Cost too high for my amount of wear . I like this style of shoe for work . I had found the brown version at Payless Shoes three years ago ; that 's how long it took to wear that pair out . This year Payless did only the black , white , and some other bright colors . That made me sad . Then after my search for brown athletic mary janes I became sadder . Very hard to find ! Finally I found these .
 These shoes were comfortable when I first tried them on , but when walking I noticed my right foot leaning inwards and upon closer inspection the right heel dips down slightly . Are they seconds or did I get a dud pair ?? Also , I got blisters on each foot the first time I wore them , which was extremely painful walking back to my car 1.5 km away after work ! I did n't think I need to wear socks . I 'm keeping them as they 've been worn otherwise I would return them . I 'm hoping I 'll get used to the heel leaning part and the blisters wo n't be an issue once they 're worn in . They do look nice though and were initially very comfortable , hence the 2 stars .
 These shoes are really great walking shoes , but they are very stinky ! They are lined with suede which made my feet stink after only a few wears . I have to wash my feet as soon as I remove them . . and I have heard the same from other people who own them . They are quite comfortable . . but Tsubo makes similar shoes without the ransid problem .
 I am so disapointed but do n't think it 's the shoes fault totally . These are for my work and do n't seem to be bothering anyone else but me . The way the mary jane style cuts across your foot in the front rests right on the bone of your foot . They absolutely kill my feet to the point that I ca n't wear them . I 've tried thick socks as a cushion but it does n't help . Standing or sitting they are fine but I ca n't walk without them hurting.They are not very sturdy either . If you tend to turn your feet at all they wo n't support your foot . I normally love Sketchers but these were not what I expected .
 I read all the reviews and was expecting a great shoe . Not worth $ 50 . There is no arch support and it was very uncomfortable on my big toe ... where the scoop on the top of the shoe is . Very disappointed . Go with j-41 instead .
 The shoes are very cute , but I am WARNING you ! After wearing them several times , they start smell . I am guessing our other reviewers perhaps bought the shoes recently . - Just to clarify , the is the only pair of shoes I have this problem with :-RRB- . The material does n't breathe at all , and the smell is seriously unbearable . After all my efforts at cleaning and spraying , I just had to throw them away . What a waste ! My roommate also had the same problem with a brown pair -LRB- mine were black . -RRB-
 Well it 's nice to read some of the one-star and two-star reviews on this site . I had only heard raving reviews from friends about these shoes , hence why I bought them . I ca n't stand them.First of all , I had to get inserts for arch support . Then I had to deal with them rubbing on my heals . I think I even bled one day . I just thought I had to keep wearing them to break them in . Then I got smart . I now wear socks with them and that helps . It 's the only way I can justify keeping them . I knew that I waited too long to return them to the store and I hate to think I wasted money.I still have to deal with the velcro coming undone so I can only wear them on easy going days . Every time I drive my stick shift the velcro breaks apart . Highly annoying .
 These shoes are really cute , however there are two very big problems with them . The biggest problem is that the velcro on the thin little straps is simply not strong enough to withstand more than a few minutes of walking without pulling loose . I 've cleaned the velcro repeatedly to make it more sticky , but with no success -- the velcro just does n't stay stuck and I 'm left readjusting my shoes every five minutes ! The second problem is that these shoes do n't let enough air flow through ... because I do n't wear socks with them and there is no air flow , they became smelly very quickly . Given these problems , I would not recommend these shoes -- regardless of how cute they are !
 I gave these shoes one star because it looks cute . It has the look of dress shoes with somewhat of a sneaker-feel . I 'm sure there are other shoes out there that can accomplish this without having to deal with the rancid smell . The material is not breathable and make your feet stink ! I 've never had smelly feet issues and they smell only when I wear these shoes . Worse , both my big toes ended up bruised under the nail from wearing these awful shoes after just a few hours . Buyer beware !
 My shoes are fantastically comfy , and surprisingly easy to run in , but for the life of me I ca n't walk in them without my feet turning inwards . These are my only shoes that do that -LRB- it 's not just my funny legs -RRB- and I really ca n't wear them , even though they are cute .

 I order this shoes !! thinking they where brown like show 's in the picture !! but what was my surprise when i open the box ! and found a BLACK shoe !!
 I was pretty excited when I found these shoes , as they are far and away the best deal I 've found yet . However , after trying three different sizes -LRB- yes , 3 -RRB- and losing in return shipping nearly the actual cost of the shoes , I have finally conceded that in this case you do actually get what you pay for - the shoe ran much smaller than every shoe I 've ever tried in the past -LRB- and I am quite familiar with both European and US sizing -RRB- and the toe is oddly shaped , causing even the correct size to feel wrong . Additionally , the curve in the sole creates an uncomfortable tightness in the inner arch of my foot . -LRB- I should mention that I am a woman , and have very slender feet . Normally I wear a size 38 ; with these , even a 39.5 did not fit correctly . -RRB- The one good thing I can say about this experience is that the company I purchased them from , Mountain Gear , was very prompt about refunding/exchanging my purchases . I only wish that they had reimbursed me for each of my mail-back returns -LRB- reimbursement was only offered for the first exchange -RRB- . Be forewarned !

 Comfortable slipper . Top construction is well made and put together but sole material wore out too quickly wearing the slipper around the house and outdoors on occasion to walk out to get the sunday newspaper . Would not purchase these slippers again .
 These shoes were MUCH smaller than the stated size . I wear a 13 and a half shoe , but knowing that house shoes need to be loose , I ordered them in a size 14 . They were SO small , I could n't force my feet into them . And if the seller -LRB- different than the manufacturer -RRB- really had a `` bend-over-backwards '' policy as they state , they would offer a fedex or UPS label so I could send them back for free . / This is exactly why I dislike buying cloths from the internet or by mail-order . But , it is getting harder and harder to find local stores that have the larger sizes -LRB- even big and tall stores -RRB- . I guess I 'm just screwed .
 I wear a size 10.5 D . After reading other reviews here saying these shoes are &#34; true to size &#34; , I ordered a size 11 . I received them and they ar at least a full size too small . This is the last pair of house shoes I will try to buy on line . I know from trying them on in store that you just ca n't trust their sizing . I do n't know why that is , but i 's been the case ith Every pair I 've bought . I happened to be able to give this pair away or a Christmas present instead of having to return them . That said , I regret buying them ... wo n't try it agin .
 I ordered these for my Dad for Christmas , but he was n't able to get his feet in them . They were very small .
 These were sold as mens size 11 , both my son and my husband wear a size 10 1/2 shoe , neither of them can wear these slippers . They are at lease 1-2 sizes too small . The shipping was slower than advertised as well . The slippers themselves are solid and warm with a sturdy sole you can wear outdoors without fear . The only problem is they are much smaller than the marked size .
 cloth on bottom sole not good for hardwood floors , knobs on bottom of sole with cloth glued to them offers even less area for grip . doubt the knobs will be comfortable , but time will tell . solid build and warm for ankle and once fabric on sole wears out and offers some grip -LRB- what where they thinking ? -RRB- it might be comfortable but will definately be warm , if it doesnt make feet sweat ... -LRB- just got them so unknown , but looks like the dearforms inner fabric , sorta . -RRB- if not for the knobs and cloth on bottom , this could get a five .
 I threw them out ! the most cheaply made piece c. . p I ever had . Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
 Having read another review that said these slippers ran small , I ordered the next size up but it was too small . I returned them for the next size but they are out of the next size bigger . This is the only style slipper my husband likes and it is impossible to find them anywhere .
 Do n't order these unless you have tiny little feet . I ordered a size larger than my husband normally wears and he could n't even get them on . If you order them , you better try TWO sizes up than normal .
 normaly this would be my size.could barely get my foot in them . i think this was the only size available.looked well made but jusy wouldny fit . gave yhem to the needy .
 The slippers were ok except the opening is too small to get your foot into it without considerable effort . That made the slippers unusable for me .
 I tried on these slippers on precisely one time , then returned them to the box . They were n't horrible , just not real comfortable , and I got the feeling they would n't be particularly warm . But to be fair , I did n't wear them long enough to judge their thermal efficiency . I just did n't like the feel of them.For my money , better to pay a little more and get better quality .
 Good Quality ... But opening for foot way too small ... My huband couldn &#34; t get his foot in the slipper ... Other wise nice slipper shoe
 I ordered the recommended one size up . The toe box length and width is tight , but the back half of the slippers and sides are a bit loose . A full size increase to a 9M from the size , which I ordered -LRB- 8M -RRB- would be too large and the sides would definitely be too loose . As other reviewers noted , these slippers do loosen up and I hope that the toe box becomes more comfortable . The 3/4 '' rubber raised soles appears adequate . As I write this review , my feet are becoming quite warm , after about twenty minutes , with my athletic socks.After an hour , my feet are roasting in these slippers . Would I purchase again ? Difficult to say , if the toe box does n't loosen up for comfort .01 / 25/2012 UpdateI replaced this pair from DSW -LRB- Designer Shoe Warehouse -RRB- with two pairs , which fit . My feet were never comfortable with this pair . Would not recommend .
 I was pretty excited when I found these shoes , as they are far and away the best deal I 've found yet . However , after trying three different sizes -LRB- yes , 3 -RRB- and losing in return shipping nearly the actual cost of the shoes , I have finally conceded that in this case you do actually get what you pay for - the shoe ran much smaller than every shoe I 've ever tried in the past -LRB- and I am quite familiar with both European and US sizing -RRB- and the toe is oddly shaped , causing even the correct size to feel wrong . Additionally , the curve in the sole creates an uncomfortable tightness in the inner arch of my foot . -LRB- I should mention that I am a woman , and have very slender feet . Normally I wear a size 38 ; with these , even a 39.5 did not fit correctly . -RRB- The one good thing I can say about this experience is that the company I purchased them from , Mountain Gear , was very prompt about refunding/exchanging my purchases . I only wish that they had reimbursed me for each of my mail-back returns -LRB- reimbursement was only offered for the first exchange -RRB- . Be forewarned !
 The boots dig into the heel of the foot . The leather is very stiff and the boots are not very comfortable.NOT RECOMMENDED
 there IS A DIFFERENCE ... . LOVED the bag in the movie . BUT - If you look on Ebay you can see still pics of her wearing this bag in the scene it was portrayed . Compare at how the top LEATHER corner slightly bends over -LRB- real supple leather -RRB- the color is RICHER and the bag is noticeably LARGER than the pics for this replica . I recieved it and it 's just that a cheap replica . It 's cute to have a replica - but the original worn in the movie makes much more of a Statement given it 's dimensions and materials used . I 'll probably hang onto it as it has a funky original shape - but not at All Proud of it as I would have been had it been made better . And Patricia Fields would have been better off supplying the public with what was shown in the movie - large size and real leather - not these cheap replicas . She could have charged more - and believe me - people would have paid for it . ... . You pay less - you get less quality - and this is proof positive ! From Fabulous in the movie to a Frumpy knockoff
 The material used to make this bag is leather look alike plastic , not at all what I had in mind when I bought this bag . I do not think it is worth what I paid and would return it in a heart beat .
 ... so I 'm returning it . I certainly did n't expect a bag of the same quality as the one in the film , but the one I received is pretty cheesy . As noted by earlier reviewers , the material used is rather unattractive - not even a pleather , more of a fabric printed to look like pleather that did n't really resemble leather . Its also smaller than I thought , though the dimensions were listed for all to see , so its my own fault . It 's not the worst bag I 've ever seen , and a younger girl could pull it off , but I know that I 'll never actually use it , so back it goes .
 This bag does n't look like the one in the movie . I was expecting it to be much darker in color and the fringe tassel looks as though it was dipped in gold paint . Thank you Amazon for making returns so easy ! : o -RRB-
 I was so excited to own a souvenir from one of my favorite movies especially when I saw the box at my doorstep . but that is where the excitement ends.I was disappointed to find out the bag is faux leather and not as roomy or luxurious as I was expecting . I paid the sale price of $ 49.99 and it is still not worth that price .
 1 -RRB- I thought the bag was going to be leather , but it feels and looks like `` pleather `` 2 -RRB- you really ca n't use it to really carry anything in it , the way the inside opens you ca n't even fit your wallet in it .3 -RRB- I can handle new fashion trends but this one I could never figure out how to wear it .4 -RRB- I have sent it back , so good luck to all of you , who think its great !
 This bag is a complete waste of money . If I could give it half a star I would . The manufacturers would have been better off making this bag properly . The reality is that the cheap and nasty version does not do the design any justice at all . I would have been willing to pay quadruple for this bag in real leather . Thank god my kid sister is cool and can make the bag come to life with her great style . Otherwise I would have put it on the top of the trash heap . Patricia Field be ashamed , be very ashamed .
 I like this bag , but do n't totally LOVE this it . It does n't live up to what I expected it to be from the picture . It looks very cheap ... not distressed . Although I do like the design and the color . I am waiting to use it during the Fall/Winter ... definately nothing that can be used in the summer . I hate that I paid more than $ 25 for this .
 poor quality ... much lighter than the photo showed.not impressed , definitely online buyer 's remorse .
 I will keep this short and sweet , horrible quality ! The Material is horrific . The `` decoration '' of the studs , i would expect to see them fall off after about a month or so . Maybe a nice bag for the young , but worth $ 80 ... not a chance !!
 most of the reviewers hit the nail on the head when descrbing the quality of the bag -LRB- i.e. poor quality -RRB- in terms of color , the studds and the material of the bag . I would not recommend paying more than $ 30 for this bag . it is however spacious enough for wallet , cell phone and a pair of glasses . the design is defnitely ingenious and novel -- its a decent bag to have in your collection of bags -- dont expect a high quality bag and you wont be disapointed
 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .

 This boot is FAR inferior to thew other boots that 5.11 produces . I have owned several paires of 5.11 boots and have never had to think abouth what size I am ordering . I get the boots and put them on and they fit , NOT the case with these boots ! I got them out of the box the other day , put them on and imediatly had to take them off ! Not only were they nowhere near the 12 that I have worn for the past 3 years , but the construction of these boots was nothing like the other 5.11 boots . Nedles to say Amazon can keep this boot and I will be getting a pair of the ATAC Storm , or ATAC shield !
 I have had these boots for about a year , at first I was wearing them for a couple hours at a time , mostly sitting in a classroom environment . Recently I have been wearing them for the hands on portion of the class and I have to say these boots are horrible . You may possibly get away with wearing them for 3 to 4 hours at the most . But , if any longer than that be prepared to buy some insoles -LRB- which is absurd to consider when paying 100 bucks for a shoe -RRB- . The actual insole in this boot is a joke . NO cushion at all . I 'm about 5 ' 3 115 pounds so I 'm pretty sure its not a weight thing nor have I ever had any issues with boots like this before . The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the outside of the boot and otherwise how the boot has held up is pretty well . No issues with the zippers like some people have mentioned or any kind of issues with the leather . This boot would be perfect if only they could figure out how to make it more comfortable for people who are actually working 12 hour shifts on their feet .
 I wear 10.5 and trying them on when they arrived today they are at least 1/2 to maybe 1 full size to small . I love the boot but trying to exchange for a larger size amazon is sold out of 11 and 11.5 so i guess i will be bootless for awhile longer .

 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .

 I was really looking forward to this shoe , but when I tried it on , it was incredibly narrow . I do n't have a wide foot by any means , so it was rather disappointing that it did n't even come close to fitting . The shoe was exactly what I wanted , but just way too narrow . I returned via Amazon and UPS .

 Material is the paper thin cheap stuff that you will find on 20 dollar shoes from wallmart . FILA used to use a strong weaved material that would last forever . Not anymore , they went cheap . No more FILA for me .
 The bottom of this sandal is very thin . I had a rubber padding put on the large area and on the heel . I even added an extra piece of rubber on the heel , as I walk hard . When I took it to the shoe repair shop , the man told me that this shoe will not last long . If you have wide feet , the toe area is slightly tight -- may stretch a little . The strap toward the ankle has an adjustable buckle .
 I bought these shoes to wear at my daughters wedding and they were good enough for that -LRB- I kicked them off at the reception ! -RRB- , but they really are n't comfortable enough to wear frequently . I might wear them again , but probably not .

 I had ordered a half a size less than I traditionally wear based on the sizing chart offered on the product page , however , the boot is still another half size larger than suggested . The hard heals also make my foot very prone to blisters even after walking only a mile . I would not wear these hiking again . They ruined a hike in Maine this summer . I do like the worn leather though . They look great .
 I thought the quality of this boot was lacking . They were stiff and felt cheap . Also , the lacing is really weird
 I contacted the company through Amazon.com about returning the moccasins I ordered for my husband for Christmas in order to exchange them for a larger size . This is the policy per the Amazon.com website . As it states that returns must be completed by January 31st , I contacted them on 1/6/12 to request a return/exchange authorization , and have yet to receive a reply . I sent another request today , but I do not anticipate any better results.The moccasins arrived in beautiful shape , so I would advise -- order the exact size and color you want , as you will be stuck with what you get .

 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .

 I bought a silver pair last year size 7-8 -LRB- 37-38 -RRB- and I love them ! So much so that I just purchased the gold pair . . same size ... supposedly . The stamp shows 36-38 but they are clearly larger both in width and length . Like another reviewer stated . . a good half inch past my heel kinda looks dumb . Not sure what I am gon na do .
 I had a pair of havianas that broke last summer . . I loved that pair ... I ordered a gold size 37/38 , same as my previous pair ... Color is great . . But the fit is real wide , unlike my other havianas
 I ordered two different pair from Amazon LLC and both pair were shipped a size smaller than I selected . If they did not have them they need to remove their availability from the drop menu .
 The only good thing about these is the color . Hard and not comfortable at all , I just do n't get all the positive reviews .
 I place an order for a women 's size 5-6 and was sent a different style shoe in a children 's size 13 . I have been ordering from amazon for a long time and this is the first time this has happened to me . It make me not want to order from amazon anymore .
 hi i ordered 3 pairs of flip flop from you 's and the slim aqua color and the red ones are really nice . i love them but the metallic ones fit but they are like irregular products , one look nice the other does n't . how can i send these back to you 's . i like the color alot but the flip flops dont look the same . please contact me . thank you for the other 2
 I have so many friends who LOVE their Havaianas ! I could n't wait to get them especially at that great price ! My experience was not the same though . I found them uncomfortable to walk in . The part at the side of the foot hit me in the wrong spot and was painful . I do n't think it is because I bought a pair that was a size too big either as I tried them on in the correct size in a shop and had the same problem . I love the color as it goes with everything and the bottom cushioning was great too , it 's just too bad I could n't walk in them . My experience with Amazon returns was once again a pleasure and hassle free which is why I keep coming back again and again , they make it very easy to shop !
 These flip flops are okay , but they do n't seem to be any different than a cheap pair from Old Navy or Target . I had a pair of Havaianas that were suuuuper comfortable and soft , but they met their unfortunate end at the teeth of a dog . I bought these to replace them , but they 're definitely not the same shoes . I 'm not sure if there are different types of Havaianas and I ordered the wrong ones or if these are just cheaply made , but they 're not nearly as comfortable . The price is right though if you are looking for a standard pair of flip flops and the gold color is great .
 First of all the shoe is tight fitting . I usually wear a 9.5 or 10 and I ordered the 10 and they still felt tight in the toe area . Also , when I ordered this shoe , they did not have a picture of the fabric for this color so I was taking a gamble by ordering them on color name only . Needless to say , I did n't really like the fabric either . I returned them .
 I bought these pumps in November for wear with pantsuits , slacks , and dresses . I do n't like extremely high heels because I am tall and also because I like to walk quickly -LRB- I find very high heels to be a hinderance -RRB- . I got them in black . They were n't too exciting but functional . Or so I thought ... I did n't wear them THAT many times - maybe twice a month maximum . I have 5 pairs of black heels counting this pair . Notwithstanding this relatively infrequent wear , the plastic cap on the heel wore completely through to the metal by June -LRB- yes - within 7 months of relatively infrequent wear -RRB- . I was n't pleased . Normally I have a good experience with Nine West shoes , so I was surprised . I wonder if one of my shoes was defective .
 The silver Nuncio pump appears poorly constructed . The heel looks poorly made and appears like it was glued on and the silver coloring -LRB- which is almost a glittery/snake skin look -RRB- appears cheap looking . I believe the other pumps -LRB- i.e. the leather finishes -RRB- are probably constructed better
 These shoes look great online and I was really excited to try them on . When I did , they were definitely comfortable and they fit very well , but unfortunately the toe was way too pointy for my taste . It made my foot appear an inch or two longer than it actually is and it just looked silly sticking out from my pant leg . As much as I wanted to love these , I had to return them .

 these shoes are so uncomfortable , i am so sorry that i bought them . They really look nice but i tell u they are uncomfortable and they will rub ur foot .
 If you have a high arch , good luck getting these babies on ... bought my usual size and ca n't get my foot past the turn of the shaft.Too bad , because they 're a great looking boot .
 I was very dissapointed . First , as I took them out of the box I could see how steep they were . Then , they were too small !!! I have no problem with my number in other shoe brands , but I would easily need a full extra number to fit into this .
 I was so very excited when I ordered these house shoes , as I have never owned a pair that were this dear in the cost . Indeed they were wonderful , however they did not fit me !! Alas , I had to send them back !
 I ordered these as a gift for Christmas . They arrived in time . On opening , the box marked TAN instead had Pink slippers . These were returned . Then TWO RIGHT SHOES in tan were received . These must be returned.Minnetonka must be the absolute worst in shipping and quality control . The nice product is totally RUINED by stupidity in quality control.AVOID at all costs .
 These slippers are cozy and warm . Unfortunately , they do not fit `` true to size '' and run small . It is too bad these are not made in half sizes .
 These were soft , looked good but the length was not true to size ... had to return . Need to make in half sizes .
 I have purchased 2 pairs of the Women 's Versa Comfort DMX Max shoes in the past . Loved them-really comfortable shoes . I previously used them for walking . About a year ago , I began a combination of walking/running . I asked Reebok online which shoe is recommended for such exercise . Twice no response . Over the weekend , I shopped in nearby stores and found most Reeboks are now cheaply made with much higher prices . Worse yet , they are completely uncomfortable . Did I also say they are hideously ugly ? Decided to buy online today , but find the Versa Comfort DMX Max shoes have been altogether discontinued.I choose the companies and products I buy carefully and I try to buy from companies who are sensitive to customers and make good products . In my opinion , Reebok is no longer among those companies . Wo n't be buying Reeboks anymore !
 These shoes have a high , hard heel and almost no cushioning . It feels like you are walking on two wooden wedges . They make the back of my legs and posterior hurt by the end of the day . They also seem about 1/2 size smaller than previous versions and are no longer waterproof . I have been wearing Rockports for over a decade , but I guess I will have to change brands now .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 The size is terribly small and the material is ultra-thin . Would not buy again .

 These shoes are more of a 5 than a 6 . They are labeled as 6M but I even had an aunt who is 5 try them on and they were tight on her .
 I asked the seller before I bought the shoes whether the color on the amazon page was right , as the shoes appeared turquoise there but dark blue on most of the other pages i 'd seen . He then replied that the amazon color was the actual color and that they used the correct lighting for their pictures etc. . But the color was wrong , they are dark blue not turquoise like I wanted .

 People need to label shoes , indicate for example that the shoe runs small . Linea Paola does that to their shoes on the Nordstrom site . This shoe looks classy , but I will never know how it looks on me . It is an entire size too small .
 Both my wife 's two pairs of Eccos and my one pair had soles that disintegrated after very little wear ... just fell apart in chunks . We 'll never buy Ecco again.I gave it one star because it had to be rated ; but really I give it NO stars at all .
 Before considering Ecco shoes , just Google `` Ecco soles fall apart `` and learn of the many many customers who purchased Ecco shoes , used them occasionally , and experienced sudden disintegration of the soles . Of course , it does n't happen to every purchaser , but if it does , do n't expect that Ecco will help you .
 Considering the price - the soles of Ecco 's will fall apart in a few years even if you only wear them occasionally and the soles appear nearly new . Bought some at Nordstroms years ago , then the soles disintegrated . Nordstrom 's sent them back to Ecco for a free resoling . This time the foam core which was replaced also turned into gummy crumbling mess 4 or 5 years later . Do n't buy them .
 These shoes are a waste of your money . After having the almost new shoes resoled by Ecco the second set fell apart after being worn a dozen times . Tape your money to the bottom of your feet and you 'll get a better result for your hard earned cash .
 When we received the shoes , we were not satisfied with the color . One shoe was much darker than the other shoe - a lot darker.The return process was simple and we quickly received our credit .
 An amazing thing happened to me . Although the dress shoes are supermax comfortable , I did n't wear them for a year or so . When I put them on this week I had them on for about an hour when chunks of rubber started falling off of the heel . Unfortunately , I was enroute to teaching a seminar out of state and I could n't change them . For two days the rubber kept peeling off and falling off - rather embarrassing when standing in front of a group and hunks of your shoes stay behind when you move around.Frankly , I think it 's funny because I 'm 65 and not really worried about what people think of my shoes . But I sure wo n't buy Ecco again -- even though the shoes were probably the most comfortable dress shoes I ever have worn!Tom Nelson , Welches , Oregon , USA .
 I usually like Easy Spirit shoes , but I was n't thrilled with these sandals so I returned them . The quality was good , but they had strange soles which you could n't tell from the picture . They were n't comfortable like my other Easy Spirits . The price was good , I 'll give them a couple stars for that .
 Allen Edmonds Men 's MacNeil Genuine Shell Cordovan Wingtip OxfordI 'd wanted these for a long time and when they went on sale I grabbed a pair . The pair that showed up , which turned out to be the last in my size , were clearly , grossly irregular . I called Amazon for an exchange and that was n't an option as they were out of stock . I called AE in hopes they 'd simply exchange what was obviously defective for a pair that were 1st quality . AE insisted that the shoes had to go back to Amazon for exchange . So , I wound up returning them , which was a real heartbreaker , as with the exception of the manufacturing errors -LRB- uneven attachment of the two pieces of leather that hold the laces only on the left shoe ... a good 3/4 '' off -RRB- , they were great shoes . I will continue to look for another pair .

 These shoes seem to be constructed well and I like how they look , but there just is not enough cushion on the sole . Walking on rocks under the water -LRB- or on the way to the water -RRB- hurts almost as much as going barefoot . They 're fine for walking on sand , but that 's it !
 I ordered these shoes for my daughter who has only one month of dance class remaining but had outgrown hers . I went with the Capezio `` economy '' version since there was just a month left of class but sadly , the Wide is no wider than the regular width . I had to rip the thick cushioned soles out of these shoes in order to fit them on her feet and they still are not wide enough .
 I purchased a pair of tap shoes for my granddaughter . They were cute little shoes but she needed a larger size . Unfortunately , because she lives out of the country , they did not make it back to me in time for an exchange . I wanted just an exchange ... not a refund . But the company claims there are no exceptions to its 30-day return rule , even for exchanges , so I am now stuck with these shoes . A reminder to always carefully read return policies before you make a purchase .
 I ordered this product instead of my intended ` chucks ' based on the price and the description
 I am in the process of returning the shoes because two weeks after wearing them , the rubber `` bumpers '' started to pull away from the base of the shoe and then completely split .
 I remember when Converse meant quality but not anymore . I purchased these for my son and in just a few months the literally fell apart the whole leather shoe came apart from the sole on both shoes . The leather is still in new condition so they were not abused in any way just poor quality .

 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 The leather and warmth on these boots are awesome comfortable nice boots but the sole wore out and fell off in one month . I called the company . They told me nothing they could do about it and to return them to the place I bought them . I thought I would have these boots for years !! Not just one monthThanks for nothing I will never buy a product from this company again.Look around for a better Boot
 All of the other reviews must have been after they recently bought these boots . They are comfortable . The outsoles and leather are durable , but the insole has completely deteriorated in 6 months . I wear these boots on a regular basis for work , so they get good wear . I had a pair of red wings that I had for 10 years . These did not make the cut . Also the stiching is starting to come apart on the boot straps and upper trim .
 These are not very comfortable because your feet become warm . Due to the plastic foot bed , my feet become sweaty if I do n't walk . I should 've got ones w / leather foot bed which does n't make your feet warm . And these also make your feet look dirty due to the black foot bed , showing that its material is not so good .

 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 They sent me the wrong shoes . This is n't a minor mistake , because I ordered grey shoes with white nike symbols . Instead they sent me Navy blue shoes with a red Nike symbol ! WTF ?!?!
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 Shoe was fairly comfortable but did not look `` right '' on foot . The `` front `` of shoe was too short . Item was true to size .
 I just got these in ivory and black and I am returning both pairs . The price was great but the shoes were so unattractive in person and both pairs looked like somebody had been wearing them for a long time . The gold studs were scratched badly and leather part were dirty . Do n't waste your money and time on these pairs .

 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 Made in China , lightweight , and cheap . They made no difference for me . In fact I much prefer dancing in my own dress shoes .
 I ordered these shoes for an event . I ordered wide and a half-sized up . Note to anyone considering these
 `` THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST BUT THE PRODUCT WAS DAMAGED THE METAL AREAS ARE ALL DISCOLORED AND SOME OF THE COLOR IS COMING OFF ON THE CASE IT SELF . THE FLAP IS VERY HARD TO OPEN AND CLOSE . JUST COMPLETELY NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT . ''
 The boots came to me two sizes too small - I 've been wearing 8.5 boots for 30 years , normal width , but these boots could n't take my foot if it were two sizes smaller ! Yet this did n't constitute an `` Amazon Caused Problem '' so I got stiffed full shipping charges BOTH ways.Don ' t ever buy shoes from Amazon unless you can afford to pay LOTS of shipping costs just to find out what the manufacture decides is your size ! In my case I guess that would be a men 's 10.5 or 11 in triple E width!Also - their definition of `` vintage tan '' was more like a `` distressed mud '' color , not even close to the picture color . Once again - do n't buy shoes/boots from Amazon !
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...
 This bag looked good online but when I received it , I was not impressed by the quality of the Leather . It had absolutely no shine and looked as if it rubbed against anything it would have been ruined .

 Florsheim is no longer a quality product if I judge them by this shoe . They look fantastic . However , that is where fantastic ends for these shoes . These are so squeaky and noisy when I walk , that I do n't wear them as it 's embarrassing . Also , the heel wears out fast and with fairly big chunks coming off the heel at times . I thought that these would be step up from the Bostonians as the Bostonian heel also wears fast . However , do not pay more for this shoe .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 Made in China , lightweight , and cheap . They made no difference for me . In fact I much prefer dancing in my own dress shoes .
 I ordered these shoes for an event . I ordered wide and a half-sized up . Note to anyone considering these
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 I have owned the Keen Aruba sandals just under two years and the tread part of the sole is coming unattached from the body of the sandal . I contacted Keen customer service by phone and they were unresponsive to my concern that a $ 65 pair of sandals is falling a part in less that two years . While these sandals are very comfortable , the fact that they do not last makes me say save your money and buy a $ 20 pair of sandals from Target , Walmart , etc. and you will not be disappointed when they come a part after two years .
 I have the exact same feelings as William Hunicke in his review . I also do not have knee problems , but after running with these even for short distances now , my knees hurt . I have had them for probably a year now and I just ca n't take it anymore . I 'm on here to buy a new pair of shoes.I actually think they may have had a bad long term effect on my knees . Seriously , look elsewhere . They might look cool , but that is the only thing they have going for them .
 4 miles onto the first run in these shoes I developed a fore-leg tendon injury that took 4 months to heal . I have been using other running shoe brands for years with no problems.I realize it may just be my specific build/running mechanics , but hey , I will not touch these shoes with a 10-foot pole ever again-Tom
 These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes . The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact . I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them . I returned them and plan to try something else .
 I love ECCO shoes , and wear them almost exclusively . I ordered these , and was unhappy with the sizing -LRB- the first ECCO shoe I 've had dig into my heel - ouch ! -RRB- , and the quality -LRB- the sole looked like molded plastic -RRB- . I did n't know ECCO made thin soled shoes like these - all mine are have special ` shock point ' soles that are amazingly comfortable , no matter what you 're doing , or for how long ! Fortunately , I did n't have any problem returning the shoes to Amazon . And , fortunately , I do n't have to give up purchasing ECCOs from Amazon . Now I check the images Amazon helpfully provides for shoppers , to see if the shoes I 'm considering have the shock-point soles or not , before I order .
 I have bought Bostonian shoes for years . This is the worst shoe I have bought . In fact the shoe fits so poorly and needs so much `` break-in '' I doubt I will ever where this shoe or buy another Bostonian . I put the shoe on and had to take it off immediatley because they just did n't fit the way they should . This shoe says it was made in India . Past Bostonians I have bought -LRB- including my previous pair of Bostonians -RRB- were made in Mexico and fit and felt much better . I guess Bostonian shoes just what they use to be.Be careful of Gabriel Shoes they said they have had a great return policy -LRB- when I bought through Amazon -RRB- and when I contacted them by phone after I had trouble with the shoes they said once the Amazon package has been opened they will not take the shoes backs -LRB- even if they did n't fit and where not worn -RRB- .

 Description correction
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .

 I bought these after reading reviews saying how good they are . While the shoe feels good to wear and I love the quick tie system and the option to collapse the heel , the buckle of the heel adjustment strap makes the shoe unusable for me . I bought them to use in kayaking . But when I place my feet on the foot pegs in the kayak , the side of each foot presses up against the side of the kayak and the buckle is in between my foot and the side of the kayak . For very short paddles , it might not be a problem , but for adventure races where the paddle can last several hours , I am left with a very painful area where my foot has been pressing against the buckle ... . Not sure how it could be designed to prevent this , but I ca n't use this shoe for anything else ...
 I hate these shoes . They hurt my feet . The velcro is exposed and it snags the other shoe when you cross your feet.These shoes looked terrible after about a week . I am very disappointed . They look and feel cheap .
 I have worn Rockport size 10 1/2 loafers for many years . So I had no qualms about ordering them online . These loafers did not fit and seemed to be at least one size too small . I returned them and went to the store and bought them - size 10 1/2 .
 Ca n't even get my foot into the shoe . I do n't have a high arch and always wear a standard shoe size . This shoe must be designed for somebody with an inverse arch .
 I have 4 pairs of Rockport , all of which I bought online . Have never had a size issue until now . This shoe runs at least a full size too small .
 I wear a lot of Rockport shoes . Almost exclusively . I was very disappointed in these shoes . They are the same `` size '' as all of the other Rockports I have , yet they are too small !
 I have played tennis 2-3 times a week for over 20 years and have had generally good luck with purchase of tennis shoes , even purchased via the internet . I have played mostly wearing Addidas Barricades shoes over the past 3 years and believe they are great for my game . I purchased these less-expensive shoes mostly for kicking around in and not for my regular game play . I 've had them for about 10 months and have finally decided to toss them . They really do not fit well and my impression is that they are simply a bad design by Addidas . Really suggest that you try them before you buy them in this case or you may has similar results .
 is ok not super confort but ... not too badaftere few days of use , more confort . .
 Fits fine , but my husband said I look like my Grannie as the style of patter is dated , will wear as I have nothing else and I do n't like wasting money
 I have to say I was very disappointed - I would not buy another pair of Earth shoes again as these are not comfortable at all .
 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .

 I ordered these because they looked like very cute ballet flat type of shoes , and they had good reviews here and elsewhere . When I got mine ... they fit horribly . Uncomfortable to say the least ... I had the Return label printed , the shoes reboxed and back in the mail within 20 minutes of getting the box open . Its too bad that they did n't fit me , because I really like the design .
 So I returned tham and am waiting for a refund on my bank card statement .

 These shoes were very cute , but very uncomfortable and hard as a rock !

 The workmanship on this lanyard is awful . The camo is only on one side of the lanyard . It looks terrible . Even the camo side of the lanyard looks stupid because half of the camo is on the outside of the lanyard and the other half is on the inside -LRB- hard to explain but if you ever get this you 'll unfortunately find out for yourself -RRB- . Spend your money on something you wo n't throw out .

 These boots are shaped very weird . The opening of the boots are larger than I 've seen on other slip on boots . When you have the boots on the soles are sloped in a way that your toes are driven into the front of the boots making them uncomfortable . I returned and was refunded promptly .
 I bought size 10 and the shoes are 11 1/2 even though label size 10 . They are manufacture irregular items as it appears .
 These boots do NOT have leather uppers , they are synthetic . Tag inside says `` man made materials '' made in china , but description says leather uppers .
 The boots arrived in a prompt manner , and looked just like the picture , however , they chaffed my husbands legs so badly that he can not wear them . When I tried to contact the seller , I was told they did not have an e-mail address available . I called the phone number , but did not get an answer . They went in the garbage .
 ORDERED THE CORRECT SIZE BUT WAY TOO BIG ! MY HUSBAND TRIED THEM ON AND THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO SLIP OFF AS HE WALKED
 I ordered size 10 boots and they were swimming on me . I gave them to a family member with a size 11 and a half foot and they fit perfectly .
 The sides of the boots are very rigid . It 's difficult to walk in them . I feel like wearing an all-metal boot .
 I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago . This pair , although priced lower , fit nothing like the first . They were much narrower with a thinner sole . I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China . Buyer beware !
 The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years , however , the two new pairs -LRB- black and brown leather -RRB- were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $ 130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe . The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks . The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China .
 Clarks Men 's Natureveldt , purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month . Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product , awful service .
 I have worn Clarks for over 30 years and those shoes were made in England . These Chinese copies do n't measure up in any way with the originals . In fact , I have sent my shoes back for a refund and are resoling my old Clark 's thru Resole America for 72.00 . The key difference was the foam , comfort air insole inside the bottom of the shoe ; it did n't have the give or immediate fit as was promised . Sadly , I have keep looking for alternative brands that might measure up to these original Clarks .
 Shoe needs more padding . There was none on the tongue and it chaffed .
 I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes , only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered . I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out . I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive . But , no shoes . Finally , after repeated email inquiriea , I received a blunt response saying essentially , `` We TOLD you we do n't have the Chestnut colored shoes '' . I will not order from this company again as it appears they do n't have good internal communication .
 These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes . They are now made in China and are not the same . The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside . A lot of products are finely constructed in China , for example Apple Computer products . Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version . It 's all about supervising the manufacture , not the fault of the Chinese factory . I own a pair of the former version and the current . They do n't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them .
 I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years . The shoes have been very comfortable and durable . In fact , I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new , despite showing moderate sole wear . With this purchase , I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half ! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them ... they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition .

 For several years I had used the size small over my workboots with no problem . This year Tingley made them `` wider , longer , bigger '' and now they do n't fit well at all . They flop around so much that they 're noisy and may be dangerous due to sliding around on my boots . Had they also created an Extra Small size , they would still be worthwhile . I wo n't buy them again .
 High quality material just could not stretc -RRB- over my husband 's shoes . The sizing does n't allow for the stretch neccary to go over shoes .
 had overshoes just over month and used maybe 10-12 days.then , they tore on the bottom.in the past they would last at least 1year . very dissatisied .
 The correct sizing is impossible to determine without trying the product on . I ordered ones that were designed to fit 11 - 12.5 mens and tried to get them over an 11 , 4E -LRB- very wide -RRB- new balance 927 sneaker . They are very tight and removing them is very difficult . Since I wanted these to slip on and off as needed , they are pretty useless to me . I would simply go to the next size up but suspect the `` wide '' aspect may still not be covered ... and since I can not return the ones I have for a different size without that exchange costing more than half of what the product costs , I wo n't be doing that . I called Tingley directly and they found one store in my area that does have one pair of the 1300 in a 2xl that I may take a ride to try on ... if I ever get around to it -LRB- btw
 Garbage . The item shredded in two the first time I put it over my shoe and had to be tossed , unused . Based on this experience , I 'd suggest avoiding the company .
 When my husband wore these to work , he was in dry conditions . He wore them for warmth . by the end of the day they had created condensation on the inside and his shoes were wet . so what good is it to wear themContractor
 The overshoes were quite hard for my husband to put on and get off . He did n't like how they looked . There was not a problem with the quality of these overshoes , my husband simply did n't like them .
 My husband works in a meat Dept. He thought these would protect his feet from getting wet . Well these things riped in 2 days . Not worth it .
 After reading the reviews regarding sizing problems , I decided to call Tingley directly before ordering the overshoes . I was told by the Tingley rep that I would need a size Large overshoe to fit my size 11 1/2 sneaker . However , the Large was too small , so I had to send the overshoe back and order a size Extra Large . For some reason , the Extra Large was sold by a different vendor than the one that sold the Large . The vendor for the Extra Large did not qualify for Prime shipping , so I now have to wait about 10 days to receive the replacement overshoe .
 Based on the diagram of the Tingley Rubber 1300 High Top Work Rubber Stretch Overshoe , I thought I would be receiving the same overshoe that I have used for years . However , I was disappointed to find that Tingley has changed the model 1300 to be `` Bigger , wider and longer '' than the overshoe I was accustomed to . In fact ... the new style was too big , too wide and too long to fit my boots properly . I 've looked everywhere for the `` old '' style -LRB- exact same model number -RRB- but have not been able to find them . I wish Tingley would 've left the `` old '' style alone and just created a new model , with a new model number , to accomodate the bigger , wider , longer boot/shoe . If you 've had a pair of the `` old '' style and you liked the fit , you probably wo n't like the way the `` new '' style fits .
 I was diaappointed in the shoes . I thought they looked a little dressy , but instead cheap . Right now just using for knock around .
 Looked good but had a lip on the back that kept being pushed down . Thumbs down .
 the britness wasnt the way it looks in the picture it was less , beside the shoes dirt my foot with color wich is comes from the shoes it self.the prise doesnt suet the itembut the time of deliverd was good.thanks
 These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes . They are now made in China and are not the same . The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside . A lot of products are finely constructed in China , for example Apple Computer products . Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version . It 's all about supervising the manufacture , not the fault of the Chinese factory . I own a pair of the former version and the current . They do n't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them .
 I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years . The shoes have been very comfortable and durable . In fact , I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new , despite showing moderate sole wear . With this purchase , I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half ! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them ... they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition .
 I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago . This pair , although priced lower , fit nothing like the first . They were much narrower with a thinner sole . I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China . Buyer beware !
 The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years , however , the two new pairs -LRB- black and brown leather -RRB- were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $ 130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe . The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks . The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China .
 Clarks Men 's Natureveldt , purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month . Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product , awful service .
 I have worn Clarks for over 30 years and those shoes were made in England . These Chinese copies do n't measure up in any way with the originals . In fact , I have sent my shoes back for a refund and are resoling my old Clark 's thru Resole America for 72.00 . The key difference was the foam , comfort air insole inside the bottom of the shoe ; it did n't have the give or immediate fit as was promised . Sadly , I have keep looking for alternative brands that might measure up to these original Clarks .
 Shoe needs more padding . There was none on the tongue and it chaffed .
 I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes , only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered . I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out . I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive . But , no shoes . Finally , after repeated email inquiriea , I received a blunt response saying essentially , `` We TOLD you we do n't have the Chestnut colored shoes '' . I will not order from this company again as it appears they do n't have good internal communication .
 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .

 I am sorry to say that the name brand , Bandolino , did not meet my expectations . I wore these shoes 4 times and the bronze coating around the tip of the shoe and on the heel is wearing off . I did not do a lot of walking so why is it coming off ? They are cheaply made , that 's the answer . Not worth $ 35.00 , that 's for sure . I am sending them back and asking for a refund.I would not buy these for even $ 13.00 . Thanks.L . D.
 The sole on these boot wore slick about a year after puchase . I love danner for the comfort I will get a black sole next time for durability .
 These boots are shaped very weird . The opening of the boots are larger than I 've seen on other slip on boots . When you have the boots on the soles are sloped in a way that your toes are driven into the front of the boots making them uncomfortable . I returned and was refunded promptly .
 I bought size 10 and the shoes are 11 1/2 even though label size 10 . They are manufacture irregular items as it appears .
 These boots do NOT have leather uppers , they are synthetic . Tag inside says `` man made materials '' made in china , but description says leather uppers .
 The boots arrived in a prompt manner , and looked just like the picture , however , they chaffed my husbands legs so badly that he can not wear them . When I tried to contact the seller , I was told they did not have an e-mail address available . I called the phone number , but did not get an answer . They went in the garbage .
 ORDERED THE CORRECT SIZE BUT WAY TOO BIG ! MY HUSBAND TRIED THEM ON AND THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO SLIP OFF AS HE WALKED
 I ordered size 10 boots and they were swimming on me . I gave them to a family member with a size 11 and a half foot and they fit perfectly .
 The sides of the boots are very rigid . It 's difficult to walk in them . I feel like wearing an all-metal boot .
 Liked the look but was a bit large . Had to send it back as it slipped on my foot . Got it on a super sale that did n't apply for the next size down so did n't get it .
 First off its Not attractive looking . and it feels stiff and bulky and FLAT . Arch support really ? I do n't feel it at all.It hurt my foot after I wore it a little in the house -LRB- did n't even walk around whole much -RRB- . Very uncomfortable . Ca n't believe the price !!! If this is what Reef offers for all other sandals and it 's considered one of the best ones they have , I say REEF SUCKS .
 These are really nice looking flips . . would give five stars for looks but they are very loose . I only wore once so I do n't know if they will stretch out or wear well . You would need to have a very large , round foot or I received an anomaly .
 They looked good on paper , but when I received them I noticed that the white parts had a shimmer to them , which was n't what I was looking for . Also ordered an 8 , but needed a 9 .
 Are the sizes mis-marked ??? I 've never tried on a pair of shoes that ran this small before!I wear a size 5.5 M , purchased up a size to 6M , and they run very , very short . My heel was at the very tip of the edge which is incredibly uncomfortable!Usually size sixes are a little large on me no matter the brand , but I make due . These sandals are cut incredibly short in the foot length , and have lots of extra room in the band across the foot . Even if they fit me in length they 'd be flipping on flopping right off my foot , they are so wide ! They are kind of cute on , but do n't even come close to fitting ! The shoe is a whopping 4 '' wide!If you have a medium width foot , and wear the same sizes all the time , I say run away from these shoes . They will not fit ! I will tell you that it 's kind of a hassle sending back for a refund . I had to actually call Amazon Customer Service , as the online auto return said I had to pay for return shipping out of pocket ! I called them , and they made everything right by emailing me a return label . Free shipping is n't free if you are out for returns ! And these shoes must be mis-marked ... Buyer beware !
 The wrong color was sent to the house . The picture showed one thing but that sure wasnt what we got . they seller blamed amazon . im not sure who is actually responsible .
 I love Reef flip flops . I bought this pair to replace a pair that I have nearly worn through . Just like my original pair these are incredibly comfortable . However they do run small . I normally wear an 8 1/2 or 9 . The 9s are a bit small for me , wish I 'd ordered up a size . The real problem with these is that they squeak when I walk ! Not right away but after a little while they start to make a definite and loud squeaking noise . It 's awkward and embarrassing and unfortunately I had to wear them all day so I wo n't be able to return them .
 Ordered my size , but was too small to fit . Ended up giving it to my mother in law , who wears a size smaller than me.Seemed like comfortable sandals , but order a size bigger .
 The website said size 6 Mens , the shoes were actually size 6 Womens , and the return process was designed so that I could n't actually return them for shoes in the right size .
 I take a size 6.5 / 7 and the strap on this flip is just too tight . Using effort I can barely get the sandal on my foot , and you can see the pressure from the strap . At the same time I ordered this flip I ordered several Teva sandals with straps across the foot similarly placed and they fit just fine so I know my foot has not suddenly jumped up several sizes.Too lazy to return so will go to the GoodWill box . Will not buy this brand again .
 For years I have worn Reef sandals on the recommendation of my foot doctor . These have always had a raised arch support . I assumed this was a feature of all Reef sandals . When they arrived and did not have this feature I sent them back and requested that the supplier send me a sandal that did . I specified that it could be any style and any color but at the same price , otherwise I requested a refund . I got the refund but was out $ 13.50 because of shipping costs both ways . Since the shoes cost less than $ 25 to begin with I felt this was a steep price to pay . Wo n't make that mistake again .
 The shoe is really cute on , but I think their sizes run quite small . I recommend ordering a size larger than your actually shoe size .
 I bought these as an easy slip-on boot to take my puppy out -LRB- quite frequently -RRB- . Perhaps it 's the rubber or lining , but these are the foulest smelling boots I have ever owned . They smelled like musty mildew right out of the box . Leaving them on the screen porch and using odor neutralizer does no good . I attempted to wear them outside while shoveling snow - my feet were cold within an hour , and I had ski socks on . Perhaps the puppy can cut her teeth on them .
 I wore these boots to deliver mail , and by the end of the day , my ankles and shins were bruised , and I was in severe pain . Due to the stiff leather upper , these can not be worn to walk long distances , but they are waterproof .
 these were so hideous i returned them upon receiving them and they were not the ones in the picture . definitely do not buy these boots .
 The shoe looks great , but it 's extremely difficult to walk in them unless you like taking little baby steps all night .
 I tried this product for drying my surfing booties and it did not work at all . In fact , the passive heating -LRB- no fan -RRB- and warm air seemed to provide the perfect environment for bacterial growth and the booties smelled like something the dog would like to roll in . The low rating is for use as a neoprene booty dryer . I have no experience with it otherwise .
 I had to send the shoedryer back two days after Christmas when the middleof the units both started to melt . . I have to say I have always heard awesome things regarding this product so I was caught off guard . It has been a couple of weeks since I sent the product back and I have still not heard a word . I would like to think it was just a flaw in this unit . I am requesting another unit to replace it to give it one more shot . . Plsdont `` Peet '' disappoint me : -RRB-
 Since buying this item , it has probably been used less than twenty times for drying boots . It works OK as a dryer , if you are very careful and/or do n't put heavy boots on it.The base on this unit is two-piece -LRB- to allow shipping in a smaller box -RRB- . The two plastic pieces are dovetailed together with insufficient reinforcement or gusseting , and the base broke on both sides where the pieces were joined . This is a very poor design.If you do buy it or already own it , I would suggest sanding the edges of the base where they meet , and thoroughly epoxying it together . I could n't find any epoxy , so I used five layers of aluminum tape over the joints.I would not have bought this model if I knew it would break in normal use ; and , I would look carefully at how the base joins , if you consider another model with a two-piece base .
 Peet Family Model Dryer M97 . I ordered this item on the Internet and it arrived quicker than expected . It is quiet and appears to work well . I bought it because I had planned to buy an expensive pair of work shoes and instead of buying two pair to alternate each day I bought one so the dryer would have them ready for another day.The buying experience was the worst . The shopping cart experience was unusual . I was charged sales tax even though I ordered the product from another state . I was given the final price and then afterwards was charged sales tax -LRB- per the receipt -RRB- because it was shipped from a company in my same state . This was not mentioned up front and I have lost all interest in the company and its products.The company did not respond to my emails regarding this extra charge.If you need a shoe dryer I recommend buying it locally to save $ 8.00 shipping and just pay the legitimate sales tax .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 I order the Peet boot dryer . It is a good product . However the page also advertised Peet shoe and glove dryer accessories . There is a picture of glove dryer extensions as well as wader extensions right beside each other . I ordered this product as well and was very disappointed when I only recieved the wader extensions . Why would you put the two pictures right beside each other on the website if they are not sold together . This to me is false advertising and has turned me off from using this site again for on-line shopping .

 I loved the image on the screen when I ordered them and I was not disappointed when I received them , visually that is . they were more the size of and 11.5 than 13.5 that i ordered , and I blame this on quality control issues at over-seas manufacturing sites . But the question must be asked , `` why is it that when you buy a basketball sneaker of the same brand , the sizing is more than adequate , but horribly off in a soccer shoe ? '' I am a life - long fan of Adidas sneakers but found this item to be all flash and poor execution . If you are looking to purchase these online , I would either go an extra size up , or better yet , buy the original Sambas , which are still true to size .
 I ordered these because I needed a casual white sandal and they had a little extra detail to them . They are n't very comfortable . The leather thong in the toe is too rigid and caused blisters . Also , they make my feet look very long and big . They run true to size .

 I need black confortable shoes to work . I am a waitress and I have to walk non-stop , sometimes for 12 hours . I used to wear Reebok Princess Sneakers but with new uniforms , I needed something more dressy , so I bought all the &#34; comfortable shoes &#34; I could find here at Amazon . I was looking for a mary-jane look with a sneaker feel . - Ambulator By Aetrex Women 's B6000 Mary Jane , Black - I could n't even try it because it runs a number and a half small -LRB- at least -RRB- . My size is 9 or 9,1 / 2 . I bought 9M , 9wide and 9 1/2 wide . All too small . Go at least a number up . Another problem is that the insole is too high . My toes and the top of my feet were so &#34; squished &#34; against the top of the shoe that I could n't even give it a quick walk . It looks adorable , - Propet Women 's W3851 Wash & Wear Slip-On - The back is too high so it cuts/rubs on your leg when you walk . Overall uncomfortable . A lot of pressure on your feet overall , sides and top . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 W for me -RRB- - Propet Women 's W0029 Mary Jane Walker - Good support all around , long strap on top , good looking but not enough cushion to walk for 12 hours . fits true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 for me -RRB- . As they did not have it in wide , it makes too much pressure on the front of the foot , just before the toes . - Drew Shoe Women 's Rose Mary Jane , Black Calf/Black Stretch , - Too high where the strap comes out , it hurts as soon as you put it on . It looks so comfortable is the worst offender . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 , 1/2 W -RRB- - Clarks Women 's Wave.Cruise Mary Jane Flat , Black ,9.5 W US - It feels like it is missing half of the sole ! It feels like just the outer part of the sole is on , and the other half is missing , making your foot lean towards the inside . Crazy ! It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .
 The second time I wore these shoes , I found the stitching around the tongue had begun to come out . One of the tabs that hold the laces in place was already unattached , and the stitching had come undone up to the next tab . The tab itself is sticky , like someone attempted to glue it into place .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .
 The boot is great but $ 21.00 for shipping -LRB- YES , within the U.S. , not even international ! -RRB- GIVE ME A BREAK ! Buy these from Overstock ... much cheaper !
 According to this seller , my order was shipped one month ago but I did not receive the item yet . The seller wo n't respond to my emails . Not recommendable . I hope to get my money back from Amazon .
 The Ecco City Light shoe does not have the support that I have come to expect from Ecco . It feels like a slipper . This shows the major disadvantage of shopping on line . You ca n't tell the quality of a product from a photo and you ca n't tell if or how the manufacturer has changed the product .
 Very disappointed , as have bought four previous ECCO shoes size 46 EU and all of a sudden this pair far too large . Check the size as soon as you receive these as you may be surprised if you are a former ECCO buyer .

 I run four to six miles per day and having been wearing New Balance shoes for years . I have n't found any other brand that works as well for me . The price on these shoes was excellent ; the quality is excellent ; however , the fit is not consistent with previous New Balance models -- the toe fit is shorter and wider than the 768 series -LRB- I have three pairs of these . -RRB- and the earlier 765 and 766 . Additionally , I can feel what appears to be the gaps in the tread through the soles of the shoe , giving the impression that my feet are not on a uniform platform of support . While I have only worn them once , at this point in my experience , I am reluctant to recommend them , despite the great price .
 I saw a friend wearing similar and thought they were cute , but they did n't have the same impact on my larger size foot . Because of that , but not because of style or comfort , I sent them back . Did not keep long enough to comment on other .
 Either the design sizing or the quality control of these shoes is inconsistent - the size I ordered based on the prior year shoe does not suit me in this years model . Sizing does not appear to be dependable.The shoes can not be returned once tried without re-stocking fee and shipping costs . Perhaps I should go back to buying running shoes in a shop where a proper fit can be confirmed .
 The quality of the workmanship is n't my expected . It is n't neat as the picture shows . The needle work is very rough . I like the confort of the shoes but do n't like such roughly sewed .
 I 've been wearing Reebok for years and all I can say is

 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .
 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .
 The worst product I have ever bougth any where . I used it 1 time and the brushes started falling apart . It was selling for $ 50 . The thing was not worth more than $ 15 .
 This shoe did not hold up as expecte4d . Within 2 days the shoe started to discolor ever after proper care . After 1 month of use the `` rubberized '' insole started to disintegrate and the velcro tie straps ripped -LRB- also from disintegrations -RRB- within 2 months .
 What I am very disappointed about is actually the Fogdog return policy . I canceled my order just 10 min after placing it because I found out that I can get the same product from the original company with much lower price !! . I got an e-mail that it is too late to cancel the order because the item is getting processed for shipment !! And get this , the boots were shipped 6 days after receiving that e-mail !! I received the return lables but I have to pay the return maling cost . I will never order any product sold by Fogdog !!! the customer service is terrible . They do n't even read the e-mails sent by amazon . All correspondings are done automatically . never again !!!!!
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 At first these things WERE the most comfortable good fitting shoes I ever tried on . They looked good too , however they stunk like gross bandaids or farm hay . So I tried to overlook the smell & being a clean freak figured I could get the gross material smell out - WRONG ! So they stunk but I still ran in them . I have a size 10 am not fat nor skinny , run 10-20 miles per week . These shoes felt great for 2 months then they wore out so quick !!!! I suffered nothing but leg and hip pain and went back to a beat up old pair of nike running shoes .
 I bought these when they still cost over $ 160 . First off , I would not recommend buying Apron Toe Tie models -- dirt and sand stain and get stuck in the stitching . The soles seem to be durable but are not made of the higher grade material that was used in my previous pair of Ecco shoes , the Berlin Plain Toe . Always get plain toe so you do n't get grit stuck in the stitching . Another flaw is the upper/outer edge of the base of these shoes busts open in little flakes when you accidentally kick things . Then you have to rip off the little leather flakes and color the beige exposed inside to match the color of the rest of the shoe , or glue them back in place . The top leather is stiffer and tougher than that of the Berlin however , which means it is n't as soft . You 'll spend a lot of time repairing this shoe!One thing that this shoe does have going for it is you can get the extra wide sizing not available in many other Ecco shoe models . Why it took Ecco so long to even having sizing options for width available or why they do n't have these options for every model I do n't know.This shoe model may be worth it at under $ 100 as of now but it clearly is n't worth it for close to $ 200 . I would buy another model of Ecco shoes .
 Great product , have owned several pairs . Be aware that all are EU sizes , but no width options from this vendor -LRB- or any other online it seems -RRB- . Poor buying and product line sourcing by vendor .
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .

 These boots ARE very cute.Goes great with many outfits.I got them in sz 8.5 , and fits like a 9 . My heals began burning within an hour . And by the end of the day , my heals were scraped , pretty bad . still healing at the end of the week . definitely not shoes for long walks , or maybe it was my pair that was carelessly made .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 I need black confortable shoes to work . I am a waitress and I have to walk non-stop , sometimes for 12 hours . I used to wear Reebok Princess Sneakers but with new uniforms , I needed something more dressy , so I bought all the &#34; comfortable shoes &#34; I could find here at Amazon . I was looking for a mary-jane look with a sneaker feel . - Ambulator By Aetrex Women 's B6000 Mary Jane , Black - I could n't even try it because it runs a number and a half small -LRB- at least -RRB- . My size is 9 or 9,1 / 2 . I bought 9M , 9wide and 9 1/2 wide . All too small . Go at least a number up . Another problem is that the insole is too high . My toes and the top of my feet were so &#34; squished &#34; against the top of the shoe that I could n't even give it a quick walk . It looks adorable , - Propet Women 's W3851 Wash & Wear Slip-On - The back is too high so it cuts/rubs on your leg when you walk . Overall uncomfortable . A lot of pressure on your feet overall , sides and top . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 W for me -RRB- - Propet Women 's W0029 Mary Jane Walker - Good support all around , long strap on top , good looking but not enough cushion to walk for 12 hours . fits true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 for me -RRB- . As they did not have it in wide , it makes too much pressure on the front of the foot , just before the toes . - Drew Shoe Women 's Rose Mary Jane , Black Calf/Black Stretch , - Too high where the strap comes out , it hurts as soon as you put it on . It looks so comfortable is the worst offender . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 , 1/2 W -RRB- - Clarks Women 's Wave.Cruise Mary Jane Flat , Black ,9.5 W US - It feels like it is missing half of the sole ! It feels like just the outer part of the sole is on , and the other half is missing , making your foot lean towards the inside . Crazy ! It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .
 After investing time and effort into finding a pair of cleats he would like , I order them instead of another pair he had chosen only to find out 2 days later that they were out of stock . I wish all vendors would learn to only post what you can actually deliver .
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 The delivery service from Amazon was right on the mark . However , the product itself was dissapointing . After one day of my son wearing the Neoprene water shoes to his day camp , during sprinkler time , both insoles seperated from the shoes . It is a pain in the neck everytime he wears them to keep fixing the soles . After paying just about the same proce for shipping as the shoes cost , I was dissapointed in the endurance of the product . I would be very hesitent to purchase any future products from this company .

She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine .

 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 Boots are very lightweight and sized okay . I wear a 9 1/2 shoe and size 10 fit with plenty of room . Good treads , warm . Very cheap zipper . Broke very shortly after purchase . Am now trying to punch holes to add a shoelace , grrrr !
 Good boots for the first few days , but the zipper broke and the boots are useless since all the cold and snow gets in .
 Since its snowing a lot here in UT I needed boots that were n't fashionable and useful . I saw these and thought they would be perfect with the rubber bottoms . The first day the right boot 's zipper split and is still that way . Two weeks after still needing to wear them , the left zipper actually broke off . I do n't even want to go through the return process for fear of having a brand new pair have zipper malfunctions . You have been warned .
 My wife is not pickey , but she did not like these and I returned them . She said they were uncomfortable .
 The boots are not as they appear in the picture . They are very cheaply made . They were inexpensive enough that I decided not to return them because we were leaving to soon on our vacation in the snow that I needed these for . I would n't be able to get something else quick enough . I will see how they are in the snow but they feel really weird on your feet . It 's like the inside sole is n't set well to the outer sole so when you walk it kinda has a space that pushes downward ?? Really strange .
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 I wrote a bad review on the shoes and the seller of the shoes . I bought three pairs of the same style . I have other shoes , from this shoe maker and love the shoes I have . The three pairs I bought were cheaply made and very stiff leather . They were tight , heavy and uncomfortable . When I requested to return the shoes , the seller told me that I had to pay shipping.However , I contact the seller and explained the situation and the seller promptly sent me return labels .
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .

 While I enjoyed the comfort of the materials on the sides of the shoe , this shoe feels more like a slipper than a shoe . The botton has almost no support , flexing for comfort but providing very little support . While I enjoyed wearing them , sadly they fell apart before the sole even started to wear . It started with a whole between the right heel and the base of the shoe , which eventually expanded to lift the whole shoe off of the back . And , this happened after I took care to use a shoe horn each time I put the shoes on in the morning . I 'm not sure I will purchase another pair of Florsheim shoes .
 When will there be smaller sizes of these shoes available ? i need 8.5 :-LRB- i 've been looking for them all over and there 's no sizes :-LRB- somebody can please help me telling me where can i get these shoes but 8.5 size ?? i will apreciate it very much , thx = -RRB-

 I need black confortable shoes to work . I am a waitress and I have to walk non-stop , sometimes for 12 hours . I used to wear Reebok Princess Sneakers but with new uniforms , I needed something more dressy , so I bought all the &#34; comfortable shoes &#34; I could find here at Amazon . I was looking for a mary-jane look with a sneaker feel . - Ambulator By Aetrex Women 's B6000 Mary Jane , Black - I could n't even try it because it runs a number and a half small -LRB- at least -RRB- . My size is 9 or 9,1 / 2 . I bought 9M , 9wide and 9 1/2 wide . All too small . Go at least a number up . Another problem is that the insole is too high . My toes and the top of my feet were so &#34; squished &#34; against the top of the shoe that I could n't even give it a quick walk . It looks adorable , - Propet Women 's W3851 Wash & Wear Slip-On - The back is too high so it cuts/rubs on your leg when you walk . Overall uncomfortable . A lot of pressure on your feet overall , sides and top . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 W for me -RRB- - Propet Women 's W0029 Mary Jane Walker - Good support all around , long strap on top , good looking but not enough cushion to walk for 12 hours . fits true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 for me -RRB- . As they did not have it in wide , it makes too much pressure on the front of the foot , just before the toes . - Drew Shoe Women 's Rose Mary Jane , Black Calf/Black Stretch , - Too high where the strap comes out , it hurts as soon as you put it on . It looks so comfortable is the worst offender . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 , 1/2 W -RRB- - Clarks Women 's Wave.Cruise Mary Jane Flat , Black ,9.5 W US - It feels like it is missing half of the sole ! It feels like just the outer part of the sole is on , and the other half is missing , making your foot lean towards the inside . Crazy ! It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .
 very cute and roomy . The heels are a cheap light plastic with very slick smooth bottoms ... Be careful !!! Appears BASS took a cheap way out with the shoes , a little better heel would had gone a long way As cute as they are can not wear them on anything but carpet .
 Love the way this boot looks , but the calf part of the boot is super wide and the fit was n't good at all . Too much room in the calf area . Do n't recommend ordering cowboy boots online . You need to go to a store and try them on.I sent them back .
 The fit was terrible . I returned this item a month ago , and have yet to be credited . Based on that , I do n't plan on purchasing anything else from this company .

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I owned a pair of the smooth leather Rainbows and loved them for two years , until the leather began to rub away to the spongy center layer . I tried the premier leather version , but they felt like wearing cardboard . The straps are n't soft enough to stretch and mold to your feet . Stick with the smooth leather version , or buy Reefs . They tend to be cushier and easier to break in .
 These are so incredibly narrow . I waited too long to return them so I ended up giving them away . I 've heard now from another friend to buy mens Rainbows if your feet are n't narrow .
 I 've enjoyed wearing Rainbows for years , and was happy to find a great price on Amazon . However , the inside of the strap was sewn incorrectly and caused blisters , to the point I had to remove them and walk barefoot . Amazon 's return policy was easy , but these were inferior quality and should never have been sold as new . Could be a quality control problem , or this vendor is selling seconds as the real thing .
 They shipped the wrong size . The 30 day return policy expired . I did not know about the return policy . It was suggested I resell the item myself to get as much of my money back as possible.WOW .
 I 've been wearing and loving Rainbow sandals for well over 15 years ... I can walk miles in them comfortably . These that I ordered surprised me as one sole was longer than the other ! I had to return them , needless to say .
 They do not start off telling you that these shoes run smaller sizes . You get the item and what would normally fit , does n't . Then there is the idiotic restocking fee . How hard is it for an idiot to put it back on the shelf ? I was very angry to have to deal with this problem . I sent them an e-mail to tell my feelings , but still had to pay the restocking fee to return the stupid shoes . I was very unsatisfied with Florida Footwear . People , buy these rainbow sandals locally !
 I bought these as a gift for my sisters birthday . They started coming apart a little after a month of her wearing them . She has not abused them at all . I tried to contact the seller but never heard anything back . I have a pair of Rainbows as do most of my friends and my partner . I have no problem with mine and neither does my partner or friends . matter of fact , my partner has been wearing the same pair since 2002 and they still are not torn in any way . I do n't know what to do to resolve the issue I have with this seller . All I want is a replacement pair for my sister . How embarrassing it is for a pair of Rainbows given as a birthday gift to come apart in a month and the seller avoid you ! I do NOT have a problem with Rainbow , I will never wear any other kind of flip flops . I have a problem with the seller and the lack of their customer service/customer satisfaction .
 I used one click ordering and the shipping address was taken from two different past shipping orders therefore the item was not deliverable and was returned to the vendor . I did not reorder . The vendor notified me that I would be billed for the return shipping , tho the error was not mine . I sent an email to the vendor to bill me and I have not heard from them .

 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size .

So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .

 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe . this case is a classic - you get what you pay for . cheap price for a CHEAP shoe .1 -RRB- this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe .2 -RRB- no arch support whatsoever . The rubber is almost too thick .3 -RRB- i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe . feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST . 3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute . this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned -LRB- this is my # 14 pair -RRB-
 I do n't think these Skechers are made out of leather , so I 'm very disappointed . I thought I was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer , but with such a low price it was `` too good to be true '' .
 pretty shoe but I am a narrow and ordered the medium and it is very narrow and tight on my foot .
 I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day . We have a recycle area in our apartment building , but it is usually used for things that are not brand new ! These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on . I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again , unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before .
 This was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line . The fit was awful , there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless .
 Looks pretty good but uncomfortable for outdoor activities . My feet hurt after walking 5 hours .
 These were my first pointe shoes and I absolutely hated them . They had an extremely hard shank , the box was rounded and restrictive and bulky . They had a great demi , but terrible look and feel on pointe . I would not recomend these as a first shoe because it 's likely that the dancer 's feet are not strong yet , and even though it 's neccesary to have a supportive box and shank , you need to be able to go over the box and have a more pliable shank .
 I have not yet received this product , the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month . And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem
 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .

 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .
 I wrote a bad review on the shoes and the seller of the shoes . I bought three pairs of the same style . I have other shoes , from this shoe maker and love the shoes I have . The three pairs I bought were cheaply made and very stiff leather . They were tight , heavy and uncomfortable . When I requested to return the shoes , the seller told me that I had to pay shipping.However , I contact the seller and explained the situation and the seller promptly sent me return labels .

 These shoes are so cute but I was disappointed with these Naturalizers . I expected comfort , but the fabric is so unforgiving .
 I purchased this shoe in a 10N . Although I like the look of the shoe , there are two problems with it
 These shoes may look cute and comfortable but were very disappointng . They hurt a lot - the stiff linen gave me corns . The toe opening is so stiff it caused blisters . The back strap slides off . I wore them a few times and hoped they would soften up . They never did .
 I got these shoes because I thought they were so cute for what I thought would be a `` Naturalizer comfortable '' shoe . They do look very cute on . However , the toe opening cuts into my big toes and makes them hurt so much I can not wear these ! Sorry I spent the money on them : -LRB-

 I bought these for a halloween costume , and even though I selected standard shipping , the cost did n't show up on the balance until I got the confirmation and the order had gone through -- shipping cost as much as the shoes I thought I was getting at a discount!Also , though I used the conversion chart to get a women 's size , they ended up being too small .
 Very uncomfortable shoe . Very little padding at the top and sole and they will wear blisters in the top of your feet in short order .
 When I first recieved these boots I thought `` not bad for $ 65.00 or so '' . After wearing them for a few weeks trying to break in the left one a littlebit due to a bunyun . I find that there is no wear streach going on like I wouldexperience from a leather western boot say . I ride a Harley and started to see athin top layer of material flaking off the shoe where the shifter lever rides , and where ever the lace eyelets rest against the tongue . These boots are coveredwith a thin vinyl like layer that comes off rather easily . It is a dull gray colorunderneath . I think the material these are made of is Cheezy at best . I wo n'tbe back for seconds .
 I bought these shows two months ago . It is upsetting now that I noticed the sole is coming apart from the rest of the shoes .
 Background : I worked at a supermarket doing mostly stocking/pallet pulling at night . Anyway these shoes held up and wore comfortably at first , but after less than three weeks of use the entire sole of the shoe came apart . Horrible durability . Other than that they were great , but the fact I could n't use these for even a month with medium use is what attributed to my rating .

 Length :
 It was delivered at time . And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance ; however , it was n't . When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe , which is the reason why I bought it , the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance . Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons . Any way , the prodoct was n't the same value or quality of pumma 's shoes that I have bought in the past .

 These shoes are far heavier than other steel toed shoes I have worn . If you are not on your feet all day , and want something that looks a bit more business-like , then they may be a good choice . But otherwise , I would suggest something lighter .

 The cleat looks nice and sturdy but it is not a wide cleat at all . It wasted my time and money to ship it back . For that give it a zero rating !

 The area where the big toe has to fit its fabric height is to low that the big toe does not entry on the saldal
 These are not worth buying . They are flimsy and not at all like Birkenstocks which they seem to want to be .
 This is the second pair of White Mountain Sandals I have purchased and my last ! While I love the look , style and comfort of the sandal , it does not hold up . I purchased these sandals specifically for a one week vacation . During this one week trip the bottom , inside of the shoe loosened and began bunching up under my foot . Once it loosens there is no way to keep the material flat under your foot again and it becomes very uncomfortable . The first pair I purchased also did this but I thought it was a fluke and I tried a second pair . Great price but poor quality !
 When I saw these sandals on line I thought they looked similar to the pricierBirkenstocks.They were however not as comfortable and the uppers cut into my feet . In this case it was not ` you get what you paid ' because a few days later I happened to be in Walmart and got a pair of similar sandals by Faded Glory and they are ` glorious ` they were also on sale for the bargain price of $ 5 !! . I had to go back and buy all the colors they had .

 The quality of the boots were horrible ! The straps were stitched with orange threads . The shafts that were put on the soles were of two different sizes and werent for that size sole . The heels on the insides were just thrown together . Bunched up and folded leather that hurt the heel . I was not impressed with this product . I would n't give it one star .

 Unlike most muck boots out there that have a lining , this pair does not have one ! Buyer beware . If it had a good interior lining to it , I 'd give it 5 stars . Still , steel toed muck boots at this price are a good bargain .
 These are not steel toe ! They are n't very comfortable ... I 'm going to buy some kind of squishy insert thing and hopefully that helps with the comfort ... at least they keep your feet dry .
 ordered this since i was not sure I wud b around to pick it and wanted it for a trip & as feared , it did not arrive before the trip . It is however quite heavy . . way too heavy to use for any normal use . but went for a cheap one because of the uncertainity . Didnt want to return since the cost would outweigh the purchase !
 When I first got these boots , they worked really well . However after months of heavy construction use , there are rips that let water in . Well they are rubber steel toe . I guess I have to get a pair of carharts now .
 It seemed like a good price for a steel toed rubber boot , but this one 's just too cheap . There 's no lining and a really low-end sole insert . More importantly , the sizing is unusual . Unlike other comments that complain the boot is too large , I ordered a size up from my actual shoe size and discovered that while the sole was fine , the calf was way too tight . For rubber boots you want to be able to tuck jeans , etc. . INSIDE the boot to keep them dry/clean , and you ca n't do it with this one . It 's WAY too small in the neck , and with no lining , you 're just going to rub your leg raw on the inside .
 Heels are improperly molded , creating a decided slant to the back and outside edge . These must be considered DANGEROUS to wear , especially considering the potential work environments in which they might be used .
 I returned these . My husband hated these as soon as he saw them . They were advertised as rain boots . These boots are way too heavy to wear just in rain . I could see these being good boots to work in if this type of gear is required . But definitely do n't buy this if you 're just looking for rain boots . There are better , lighter boots out there . It 's heavy just picking them up , I ca n't imagine walking in these . Another note is that the sizing is off . These boots run very big ! The plus is that it shipped out pretty quickly .
 I ordered these with the steel toe being the reason i bought these . Confused right now , because i just opened the package to find that there is absolutely no steel toe in them . Just rubber .

 I bought these for a halloween costume , and even though I selected standard shipping , the cost did n't show up on the balance until I got the confirmation and the order had gone through -- shipping cost as much as the shoes I thought I was getting at a discount!Also , though I used the conversion chart to get a women 's size , they ended up being too small .
 I wanted to love this shoe since it 's so pretty , but the band that crossed the toe area was so uncomfortable , that I could n't walk more than 20 steps before having to take them off . They were returned soon thereafer .
 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .
 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 Everyone within ear shot of your child will hate you . As well , I had a pair of these and was unimpressed with the quality . Additionally , when I had an inquiry for this company , their customer service was rude , disrespectful , and most unhelpful even though I mentioned how unquie their product seemed and was most pleasant to them . Invest in a quality shoe without the extra ` bells and whistles '' who puts their customers first .

 I bought these shoes , based on favorable reviews , but was disappointed . If you have high insteps , as do I , these shoes are difficult to put on and constricting . The biggest disappointment , though , is that they are not great for walking , which is why I bought them . I wore these shoes for an afternoon while shopping and after one hour my feet felt sore and my back was bothering me . This does n't happen when I wear running shoes .

 hey am not satisfied with order i order a big kid size for my son and when i receive it , it was way to small it was for my son who is 10 year , s old i have to go get him one more pair
 I do n't know if it 's my nine year old grandson who lives with me or just a gliche with this pair of shoes . I purchased this shoe six or seven months ago for school purposes and the toes lasted 2 months . I gave it one more try but this time they lasted 6 weeks . I decided to pay for a more expensive boot because the cheap ones did n't last very long so I figured more money , longer lasting . I ca n't recomend these boots . Not after purchasing two pair.Twice poor Gramma from Murphys .

 Purchased these boots from a well-known hiking product store -LRB- has 3 initials , starts with an R -RRB- . Was absolutely thrilled with the fit , the springiness , the hardiness of these boots . Wore them right out of the box without any problems . No complaints.I live way out in middle of low desert -LRB- 16 miles in on a dirt road . And , although i do n't hike dailyi do spend a lot of time outside -- gardening , walking dogs , horse-back riding -LRB- i really do n't recommend these for that -RRB- , and modifying the desert surrounding my house.Three years after purchase the soles on the Asolos both separated from the boot -- i mean at the same time . Was i ever upset ! The uppers are in great condition!Prior to purchasing the Asolo 's i bought a pair of Merrell 's Avian . The exact thing happened to them . I paid $ 60 the Merrells but $ 200 + for the Asolos . Use on both was about the same and they both lasted about the same amount of time.Is is just me or are boots not being made the way they used to ?

 These shoe look absolutely gorgeous . But you should only buy them if you have a high tolerance for pain and they also soil very easily . I wore them so I did not return them but I wish I could get my money back because I know I will never wear them again .

 WALLET IS OK , ZIPPER ENDS KEEP COMING OFF EVERYTIME YOU NEED TO OPEN THE WALLET . NOT MADE FOR DURABILITY . OR EVEN FOR DAILY USAGE .
 Probably the store that sells this item wrote the first review , do n`t buy this item it is a very low quality one ... If I would have seen it first i would have payed 1 $ max for it.I ` m returning it now ...
 Los zapatos llegaron en muy malas condiciones . Se podia apreciar con facilidad que los zapatos estaban usados .
 I want to return that item because I received a wrong size . Since now i did n't have a chance to contact to the seller , I hope someone can help me to change this item with the right size that I ordered . By the way I ordered size 11 and got something like size 9 .

 These are very , very tight fitting ! I recommend buying a couple of sizes larger than your normal or you will have trouble sliding your foot in !
 I wear a size 12 shoe and I ordered a size 13 boot . I could n't even get my foot through the neck of the boot . Waste of time and money ! They must run way to narrow .
 Funny you should ask . Each of the two laces broke the first time I tied my shoes.So , it was a TOTAL waste for me.I then had to buy new ones at $ 4.00 each from a shoe repair shop.I would drop this item . Not at the Amazon quality needed .
 We are talking about shoe laces today . The long kind -LRB- 64 inches or so -RRB- that will `` zip up '' your winter boots and hold them secure against the winter snows . I needed a pair for my old , resilient and time honored LLBean boots . I had been putting it off for a while but thought the time was right . Oh I suppose I could have trundled off in my car to the local hardware or tractor supply store but thought why not have them sent right to my mailbox ? After all it was a `` Prime '' purchase , shipping was free and the price was right . I did notice a single and rather less than enthusiastic review about the product but passed over it thinking that the writer perhaps was another malcontent . After all who would ever write a review about a pair of shoelaces other than a curmudgeon probably living in the Montana wilderness with little to do . He said the laces broke immediately after lacing up and he was really angry with Amazon for selling such a miserable product and advising Amazon to remove it from their web site which they obviously did n't do . And then I came along , bought it , broke it while lacing , went to the local hardware store where I bought a better product for less money . I am going off to live in Montana with the wolves .
 They certainly are inexpensive , but they tear far too easily and quickly . Keeping them in one piece requires far too much delicateness than should be afforded to leather shoelaces . Given that these are advertised as `` Outdoor , '' I would have expected more resilience from these laces .
 These shoelaces do not stay tied -LRB- have to double not each time -RRB- , and yet when I try to untie them , they frequently catch on themselves and get into ridiculous knots that require me to take the shoe off before solving . DO NOT BUY . Get real shoelaces from a shoe repair shop .
 The laces I received are very dark brown , almost black . They do not have any gold as mentioned in the text nor do they have any or light tan or rich brown tones as shown in the picture of the laces .
 The shoes I received were 12-13 and they do n't even have the size that is shown 8-9 . Very disappointed !
 I got a pair for my daughter when she was 3 because all the kids had them . She loved them , and I did , too . They were so easy to put on , comfortable , and cute ! The problem is , my daughter is extremely active . She runs everywhere , all the time . These shoes would fall off of her mid-flight , and she would fall flat on her face . Last summer when she was 4 , I bought these thinking they may stay on better because of the back strap . I was wrong . These are worse . She ran , tripped , and landed flat on her face . I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought they may be too big , so I put them away until this year -LRB- she is 5 -RRB- , and again , the first day she wore them , she runs , trips , falls on her face , and gets a fat lip , bloody nose , and a huge scratch on her beautiful face . I think she and I both learned our lesson , NO MORE CROCS !!!!!!

 The shoes are very comfortable and the price was great but the shoes squeak whn i walked . the left one started first then both squeaked . it was embarrasing to walk down the hall . i guess it was the rubber soles had somethine inside them that moved around or something . i wouldnt buy these again .

 I wear a size 12 shoe and I ordered a size 13 boot . I could n't even get my foot through the neck of the boot . Waste of time and money ! They must run way to narrow .

 It 's definitely a sexy boot , but ever so uncomfortable . Hard bottom and if you have a large leg , it only stretches but so far . Yeah , was n't pleased with this purchase at all .
 When I saw these sandals on line I thought they looked similar to the pricierBirkenstocks.They were however not as comfortable and the uppers cut into my feet . In this case it was not ` you get what you paid ' because a few days later I happened to be in Walmart and got a pair of similar sandals by Faded Glory and they are ` glorious ` they were also on sale for the bargain price of $ 5 !! . I had to go back and buy all the colors they had .
 This is the second pair of White Mountain Sandals I have purchased and my last ! While I love the look , style and comfort of the sandal , it does not hold up . I purchased these sandals specifically for a one week vacation . During this one week trip the bottom , inside of the shoe loosened and began bunching up under my foot . Once it loosens there is no way to keep the material flat under your foot again and it becomes very uncomfortable . The first pair I purchased also did this but I thought it was a fluke and I tried a second pair . Great price but poor quality !
 The area where the big toe has to fit its fabric height is to low that the big toe does not entry on the saldal
 These are not worth buying . They are flimsy and not at all like Birkenstocks which they seem to want to be .
 The wool shoe part is lovely and warm and stretches . The same is true with the wool ankle part . But someone FAILED TERRIBLY in the design because where the two parts are joined , the heavy stitching does not stretch and is so tight it feels like a tourniqet and after ten minutes there is a deep compression mark left on your instep . This is where the blood flow to your feet has been restricted . Wearing them for any length of time leads to foot pain . I tried without success to stretch this stitching to no avail . What a shame . And yes , these are my correct size in every other way . A good idea but worthless because the construction was n't thought through enough . Go back to the drawing board Muk Luks Company , I would really like these if you got it right .
 I really wanted to like this product , but I could n't get it on my foot . I figured a medium -LRB- which supposedly accommodates a size 8.5 to 9.5 shoe -RRB- would fit my size 9 foot . I was wrong .
 The knit top wraps around the sole . Seems they would wear out quickly . Also seam where ribbing attached to the foot is tight .
 These were too small for their stated size , 11.5 . I wear 11.5 in Nike shoes and have a pair of white Lunar Control shoes in the same size . These were too short and narrow . Amazon took them back with no problems .
 This is my fourth pair of New Balance Cross Trainers and these are the worse . I had the 1006 and 1005 , then a pair of 600s before them . These are supposed to be the latest and greatest , but they are terrible . I do a lot of circuit training classes and I was feeling a sharp pain in my left foot whenever I bent my foot in these shoes.Very disappointing for a new balance shoe , I would not recommend and returning these shoes .
 I ordered these back in May of 2008 , and these are still very comfortable and mostly in one piece . The only problem with these were within the first couple of months of wearing them , the container inside actually cracked and broke , rendering the whole `` idea '' useless.You 're paying the extra dollar for the gimmick of being able to carry liquids in your shoe , but if the container is n't durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of everyday life , then I ca n't recommend these shoes.And even if the containers were durable enough , their capacity is very limited .
 I have several pairs of Reefs ... hands down the best sandals out there . . but I will be darned if these things leaked after the first fill up . . didnt know till I was headed to the Pearl Jam concert ... filled a little Jamesons in there . . and put them back on ... drip drip drip ... other than that , they are a very comfortable sandal ... but reef makes better utility sandals ... the bottle opener ones , stash box , fuzzy and the golf ones are way better and useful than the flask ... shop around ...
 First , let me say that I 'm a fan of Reef sandals and own several pairs but these sandals disappointed at every turn . I know the flask is a novelty but less than 1 oz . per shoe ... Really ? Come on!The bigger problem arose after only several days of wear when the plastic -LRB- flask part -RRB- on both shoes cracked and crumbled , so even if I did want a drink fit for a lilliputian it would not have been possible.I know what you 're thinking ... And no , I 'm not fat , this is just a terrible product that should have never made it to market .
 It was not the kind of sandal you expected , the finishes seem to be for women and not men .
 The idea of having your flip flop hold some ounces of liquid is a fun idea , however , after wearing the sandals for almost a month off and on , the container shattered and the area that is right under your arc became very uncomfortable . I would stick to the sandals with the bottle top opener .
 This is exactly why we now have TSA agents making everyone take their shoes off before boarding a plane . . honestly , why would you sell these ?
 I have bought two pairs of Drams for myself and one for a friend and they have all leaked the liquid , not from the screw caps . It is the most comfortable and cushioned Reef flip-flop yet , but `` the Dram is not worth a damm ! ''
 Was so excited to get these . . ordered a pair , fit great , but RIGHT foot leaked , because it was missing the seal , returned to get another with the other shoe leaking this time ... also , cheap plastic , pain in the but to fill , and it barely holds one shot ... cool - but bad design
 I thought these sandals were the sweetest thing when I first got them 2 months ago . However , in the past week the flask on both sandals cracked . They are very comfortable and if I were to buy another pair of reefs i would go for the original sandals or the fannings . Please beware when spending $ 50 on a pair of sandals with a flask .
 These sandals are basically well made sandals - nothing fancy , other than you can sneak alcohol into a concert in them . Unfortunately , each sandal only holds about 1.5 ounces of liquor , or a total of two weak drinks . If you are really desperate enough to need the buzz , let someone else drive and drag you along . If you really want the age-old secret , here it is - fill a small `` clean '' cooler with ice and vodka with your unopened orange juice inside . Nobody can tell .
 I bought a set of these and they 're a cool novelty , being the guy who has flask sandals . There 's a couple problems though , one sandal leaked all 1 shot of booze out . The other sandal , even after many washings with dish soap , still make whatever alcohol I put in them taste nearly unbearable , even when poured into a mix . Not worth any amount of money spent on these , do not buy them .
 I was very excited to get these boots , they looked to be excellent quality and a great value . I ordered them in plenty of time to take them on our planned weekend away . They did not arrive , instead I recieved some sort of excercise ball in what was suppose to be the boots . I immediately contacted AMAZON because at that point I only had 3 days before my trip . I asked them to please send the boots immediately because of the mistake . They instead said that I had to contact FOGDOG directly . I did and FOGDOG said sorry , we can only send you the boots if you order , pay for them again and pay for the express shipping . Then return the excercise ball and get refunded for the original purchase . I had to go out and buy the boots at a local store . I am still waiting for the refund of the excercise ball and it has been 3 weeks.After many great purchases from Amazon over the years I am now saidly disappointed . This will change my Amazon purchase plans in the future .
 After wearing these boots for just one day , my calves are left scarred because the inside lining is too rough for my skin even though I had on a pair of long socks that were soft .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 This is the second pair of White Mountain Sandals I have purchased and my last ! While I love the look , style and comfort of the sandal , it does not hold up . I purchased these sandals specifically for a one week vacation . During this one week trip the bottom , inside of the shoe loosened and began bunching up under my foot . Once it loosens there is no way to keep the material flat under your foot again and it becomes very uncomfortable . The first pair I purchased also did this but I thought it was a fluke and I tried a second pair . Great price but poor quality !
 When I saw these sandals on line I thought they looked similar to the pricierBirkenstocks.They were however not as comfortable and the uppers cut into my feet . In this case it was not ` you get what you paid ' because a few days later I happened to be in Walmart and got a pair of similar sandals by Faded Glory and they are ` glorious ` they were also on sale for the bargain price of $ 5 !! . I had to go back and buy all the colors they had .
 The area where the big toe has to fit its fabric height is to low that the big toe does not entry on the saldal
 These are not worth buying . They are flimsy and not at all like Birkenstocks which they seem to want to be .
 They are warm and comfortable while they last.All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out , there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper . The outside of the slipper still looks like new.It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months .
 Both men 's moc 's came apart at the seams ... same place on each one , and the fleece lining wore right through , all within 1 month . I 've bought better slippers at Wal-mart for $ 10 ... and i paid the pre Christmas price of $ 50 . The website represents them as quality American made but the tag says made in China .
 I bought these based on a previous review . After wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart . Maybe the quality control person was out that day ??? I returned them and got a full refund .
 As soon as I recieved and tried on my Staheekum slippers I notice that the wool on the sides seemed loose and when I wore them a flap of wool about2 `` 1/2 long on the side came loose and fell out . Also there is an odor that becomes unpleasant after a while .
 My experience is much like others . Had them 3 months and they are falling apart . Real shame because they are quite comfortable .
 Fell apart within one week - Do n't buy piece of junk - worst slipper I have ever owned for the price they should last longer than on week
 These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I 've ever put my feet into . The concept is good , but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger . That might solve the length discomfort , but there still is n't sufficient heighth comfort . They felt like an all encompassing vise , squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief . Very uncomfortable .
 I bought a pair of these this past March -LRB- 2012 -RRB- and after I recieved them I was fairly impressed even though the fit was a little tight , so a few days later I ordered another pair the next size larger . Both pairs arrived promptly . I started switching back and forth between the two pairs and eventually , over a period of two months or so , the first pair had stretched enough to be comfortable and the second pair was still comfortable from day one . After wearing them for about 2 1/2 months -LRB- switching between the two pairs -RRB- I noticed the sole on the first pair was starting to come apart . It did n't take but a few more days until I realized the sole was going to fall off if I did n't reglue it to the slipper ! I did that and let it dry a couple of days ... then I noticed the 2nd pair was also coming apart just like the first ! I reglued the 2nd pair . Since then , I 've noticed the stitching around the soles on both pairs is deteriorating and that 's what I think is causing the problem , not to mention the fact that the glue they use to attach the sole to the slipper is obviously inferior . I 've now had to reglue both pairs twice over the past 4 months in order to try to eventually get my money 's worth out of these inferior slippers.I just ordered a different brand from Amazon in the hopes I 'll finally get a good pair that will last . I 'll keep you informed .
 I do n't know why or what they put such a heavy plastic sole on these for , unless they wanted to make them for indoor/outdoor use . Other wise they are nice and soft and warm inside . But that heavy plastic sole make them stiff and klunky to ware.I guess they are ok , but I wo n't buy another pair of them .
 Gave a pair to my husband fro Christmas . High points for looks , warmth and comfort , but within a couple of weeks the stitching was coming undone . Considered returning them but he wo n't let me ; I guess we 'll be going to a repair shop instead .
 Not Happy at all with these slippers . Do not buy them . They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot .
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess
 I was very disappointed when I put these shoes on ! I literally have gone through 6 other pairs and bought these since the ones I have Are worn out . I immediately threw away the boxes since I know my size and love the shoe.The next day at work I slip them on and they 're wayyyyy too small . Seems like a full size smaller than marked . I even tried stretching them but to no avail.What a waste of $ 80 + on shoes I ca n't wear or return !!

 I was pretty sure the Rockport name would guarantee that I would be satisfied . However , it seems you have to order - 1 size up . I ordered a size 6 ... . my normal size ... but it was smaller and narrower than a normal 6B or 6M . Could not return for a replacement since I was going out of the country at the time .
 Shoes are OK but is actually quite larger than the size10XX I always wear , my foot is so loose around in the shoes that I have to return it . Thanks to Amazon they handle my return nicely .
 I was unhappy ... I got a pair if loafers in the mule box . I am now waiting -LRB- almost a week now -RRB- for the return shipping label which they are sending in the mail . When I requested the correct shoe , they no longer had my size . The customer service lady was very nice and apologized . I still needed a shoe though . I did order a clog through same Shoemall . Hopefully , I will be able to give a better review when it arrives .

 I tried on my boots , first time out of the box , knelt down to test the flex right above the toes , you know , and snap ! the exterior stitching that connects the leather upper to the rubber outsole broke immediately , and my boots were ruined . In my honest opinion , while may not be a sytematic problem , I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND that you purchase these b/c the design of the stitching that broke on these boots is poorly thought out and I consider it a major liability and I do n't doubt that it has happened to others .

 I really like Chuck Taylor shoes and these are n't my first pair . But they are the first pair that have started to fall apart after 1 month of use . Not really falling apart but developing holes throughout the canvas . Not sure what 's going on but I 'm very disappointed .

 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .

 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .

 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .

 i purchased these boots because I wanted a more supportive rubber boot . They are obviously a good quality boot . They are the right length to be a size 10 but because of all the lining they are way too tight . So tight I ca n't use them . I bought these boots in good faith but they are no use to me . They ended up costing me about $ 180 delivered , I am less than impressed with this product .

 This are the cheapest , awful pair of shoes that i ever paid for , i was so disgusted when i open the box , that i threw them in the trash container , never mind sending it back , i do n't want to have any kind of conversation with such a company.That item is pure TRASH.and belong on the trash can , anybody that bought these shoes and is satisfied , i can say respectfully that they dont know what good shoes are all about.Will never buy from this company again.Shame on you .

I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I tried these shoes I couldnt even put them on because they were too narrow and small . My feet are a little wide but even though I 'm a 7.5 I was triying the 8 and I could n't put them on . I tried other heels that were 7.5 m and most of them fit !!! Actually , those were the only heels I couldnt put on , very uncomfortable , kind of cheap too , agree with the other unfortunated customer .
 I remember how excited i was when i ordered this pumps , but imagine my disappointment when i received and tried it on and realized that i could n't hardly stand in them for a long time because , it was just too tight . I tried to force myself to wear them and walk around in the hopes of breaking into them . It just never loosened up , so i gave it away . Maybe it was just this shoe , because i have another Two Lips sandal and it does n't hurt my feet at all .
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess

 i purchased these boots because I wanted a more supportive rubber boot . They are obviously a good quality boot . They are the right length to be a size 10 but because of all the lining they are way too tight . So tight I ca n't use them . I bought these boots in good faith but they are no use to me . They ended up costing me about $ 180 delivered , I am less than impressed with this product .

 This boot has always been a favorite for my husband so I ordered him a new pair as his old ones were quite worn . We received them and oddly one show was smaller than the other so I contacted the seller and was told I needed to ship them back for an exchange . As instructed I shipped them back only to deal with lots of dead end emails to the company . Almost 30 days later and I emailed them again and was told that they were sorry for the confusion but would just refund my money ??? I am not sure why they did that but I am glad I continued to follow through otherwise I may have been out of the shoes and the money I paid . Buyer beware and order through another company that stands behind their customer service !
 I 've always liked Skechers and have owned several pair and styles . But , the last pair of boots I bought did n't last long . The soles came unglued rather quickly . So , I spent a little more and purchased the Sergeants-Enlisted boots and the first time I tried them on , the lace hooks bent . After tying them -LRB- carefully -RRB- the second time I put them on , I wore them for about two hours . When I took them off , one of the lace clips fell off . I returned them for a refund as the price certainly exceeded the quality . It 's not likely I 'll buy Skechers again ...
 I wear a size 7 , and these boots were at least a half size too small , possibly a whole . I returned them and will not reorder . They do n't look well-made and I 'm afraid they wo n't hold up well .
 although I greatly enjoyed wearing these boots on the first day , the second day I had to return them to the seller due to the first hook on the right broke . The bottom part snapped when I was pulling on it to make sure it was a little tight before looping around the other side . I do n't know if it was just the pair I got but i was very displeased with them lasting only till the second time i put them on . The seller was very helpful in making sure I got a refund and paid return UPS slip to return them immediately upon hearing about my problem .

 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .
 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .

 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
