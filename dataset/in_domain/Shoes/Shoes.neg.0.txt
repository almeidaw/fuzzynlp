 I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole . Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore , so I had to order them through Amazon . Sadly , the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months . My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better .
 The shoes would have been awesome but ... . the sizes run extremely small.I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.The shoes are still too small . .
 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns . But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .

 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .

 Too difficult to attach to my shoes ... I prefer to tie my laces , even though I may have to do it more than once .
 I like everything about these shoes except the velco stap is enormous and overpowers the entire front of the shoe . My son looks like he is wearing orthopedic shoes , I had to return them he just looked way to goofy

 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall .

 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns . But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .

 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 For it being a Clark Shoe , it had NO arch support . I returned item but had to pay the shipping .
 I buy Clarks for the comfort and instant wearability , but I was so disappointed with these ! I wore them around the house for a couple of days , hoping I 'd be able to break them in , but eventually the skin on the back of my ankle and the sides of my feet -LRB- where the little strap crosses over -RRB- was rubbed off and bleeding . I decided to return them . I 'll buy Clarks shoes again , but these were not good !
 Ugh . I was so excited to get these shoes , but they kill my feet ! The band across the top is too tight , and the heels are too loose and rigid . Thre is a definite sizing problem . After one day of wearing them I had raw skin on the top of my foot and my ankles . So painful I went out and bought a different brand of shoes to replace them the next day . Super disappointing !

 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .

 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !
 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .

 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns .

 I was not pleased , there were glue stains and rhinestones missing , but because I was pressed for time I had no choice but to keep them -LRB- they were to wear at my daughter 's wedding .
 My son loves the appearance of the shoe , but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description : - leather-Soft , calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper . I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising .
 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .
 I purchased this product expecting to save some of the shoes with soles that have dry rotted here in the Caribbean and the Shoe Goo would n't stay . I tried with several pairs of shoes , from tennis shoes to sandals and the results were poor in all the cases .
 So I tried this on a few things - attaching a leather strap to a suede bag I made , repairing leather sandal straps and trying to repair a shoe sole . The leather strap pulled off , the sandal repair came apart on vacation and the shoe sole did n't adhere properly , so it started to come off . When I pulled on the side that was coming off it pulled off in one big chunk . It seems like the glue sticks very well to itself , but not to the other materials you are trying to attach . And yes , I followed all of the instructions to a T. Still looking for a better shoe/leather glue .
 This held the rubber to the bottom of my tennis shoes for about 2 weeks . After re-applying this multiple times I ' v decided to seek something that works longer term .
 I bought this product to repair the rand on my hiking boot . It went on easily , but after it dried , it peeled right off the leather part of the boot , and I was able to peel it off the rest . The product was also shiny , very unlike the original rand . I followed the directions for cleaning the boot prior to application .
 DO NOT BUY THIS ... it does not repair shoes . :-LRB- We bought it hoping to fix 3 - 4 pairs of shoes . But it did not glue the sole of the shoe back on to the shoe at all . I am not sure if there is a trick we missed , but it did not work . We followed all the instructions on the package ... and still failed . Save your money and buy a good new pair of shoes .
 HAD A PAIR OF NIKE SHOX THAT THE SOLE HAD SEPARATED SOME . PURCHASED SHOE GOO . APPLIED AND CLAMPED FOR 48HRS . ONCE CLAMP REMOVED SOLE SEPARATED IMMEDIATELY . GOO DOES NOT WORK !!!!!
 I bought this for my husband and when he went to use the tube split in right trought the middle .
 squezing the tube watch out for the back of the tube blowing out and getting goo all on u
 Tried to repair shoes that were pulling away from the soles ... directions said to apply lots of glue , so I did . Once it dried , it made the shoes very heavy ... so much so that I do n't like to wear them anymore . It did seem to hold the soles back together pretty well , but again , made the shoes very heavy .

 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .

Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns . But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .

 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 I thought how could you go wrong with 270 plus positive reviews but shoes are probably the most difficult thing to review because hardly anyone has the same foot or preferences . And they really need to fit well and feel good or they can ruin what should be a good time . Shoes are one thing you should n't buy just for the price.I bought these for hiking but as soon as I put them on I knew I 'd be in trouble after a day out in these . While the fit is great -LRB- it 's very hard to find boots that come wide -RRB- there is hardly any cushion inside - anywhere . They just did not feel comfortable . I prefer to wear thin socks so that does n't make up the lack of comfort . The lining even feels rough . But the worst is the seam that hits right at the ball of my ankle . Scrape , scrape , scrape , that 's all I could feel . Imagine several hours of that . I also did n't notice any arch support at all.Based on other reviews it also seems that the quality is not consistent . I do n't think that was the problem with mine , they just do n't work with my feet .
 I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain , much of it off-trail and over rocks . I 've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years . The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially , but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use . When the foam becomes compressed , the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt . This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds , or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec , as I 've seen it with other boots and running shoes also . Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use . I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes do n't just use suitable footbeds in the first place , but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles , the boots themselves are comfortable , keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated , and the soles provide good traction.UPDATE 2-26-2012My son purchased a pair of these Hi Tec Altitude boots in the last year . After only 100 miles of hiking , the traction lugs on the soles were deteriorating very badly and coming off . Suspect a bad batch of the sole composite material . I purchased some of the very first Hi Tec boots when they first came out and they held up very well . Then , some years ago , our family had backpacked twelve miles into a designated wilderness and the sole of my daughter 's Hi Tec boot completely separated from the upper . Lacking any repair material , I had to hike 12 miles out , drive to town several hours away , purchase a new pair of boots , drive back , and hike twelve miles back in with the new non-Hi Tec boots , just in time to join the family on a 12 mile hike out ! I 'd assumed that perhaps in the years that passed , Hi Tec had solved the quality control issues , that the experience was a fluke , and I went back to them . A mistake , apparently .
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !

 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .

But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .

 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 I bought this shoes from your site . . and only wore them once . . to find out that the sole of the shoes is starting to peel off and the strap in front of the shoes just came off !
 These shoes seem to be constructed well and I like how they look , but there just is not enough cushion on the sole . Walking on rocks under the water -LRB- or on the way to the water -RRB- hurts almost as much as going barefoot . They 're fine for walking on sand , but that 's it !
 Despite the relatively low heel , this cute little number is uncomfortable for walking more than a few feet . Fine for sitting down and looking nice .
 I usually wear a size 7 and purchased a size 7 . They fit OK . I do get a little bit of room in the back of the heels . I have definitely had more comfortable heels than these . I 'm used to wearing heels , but these are some of the most uncomfortable I own .
 I got them in Saddle Croco , which are gorgeous with a good mix of black and brown.I usually wear 6 1/2 , thus 7 in Jessica Simpson . They fit ok , but because of the height , I get a bit of room in the back of my heels . Plus they are excruciating , even with Foot Petals Tip Toes .
 -LRB- I bought the pink nubuck shoes -RRB- these shoes are really really cute and they are comfortable BUT i sprayed them with nubuck protectant and thought i would be ok . i wore them and the parking lot was slightly wet with rain and the bottom of the shoe -LRB- around the edges of the sole -RRB- is REALLY faded . then my jeans touched the back of them and made weird marks on the back and i must have had 1 or 2 raindrops hit them and there are spots . only wear these indoors with no chance of anything touching them besides your feet on the inside of them . i wish they had been leather . i spent the money on them for one night because i wont ever wear them again .
 These shoes are super sexy and beautiful . However , upon receiving them I realized why so many people reviewed them so poorly ! The heel is extremely high and uncomfortable . It 's actually pretty shocking to me considering I own other pairs of Jessica Simpson shoes and they are so comfortable I could run a marathon in them - or keep them on all day while at work . But these pinched in the back and the sizing is so weird . I normally wear a 7 1/2 but bought an 8 and they were still just a tad too small . I would not suggest a friend to purchase these .

 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns .

 Length :
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .

 I thought how could you go wrong with 270 plus positive reviews but shoes are probably the most difficult thing to review because hardly anyone has the same foot or preferences . And they really need to fit well and feel good or they can ruin what should be a good time . Shoes are one thing you should n't buy just for the price.I bought these for hiking but as soon as I put them on I knew I 'd be in trouble after a day out in these . While the fit is great -LRB- it 's very hard to find boots that come wide -RRB- there is hardly any cushion inside - anywhere . They just did not feel comfortable . I prefer to wear thin socks so that does n't make up the lack of comfort . The lining even feels rough . But the worst is the seam that hits right at the ball of my ankle . Scrape , scrape , scrape , that 's all I could feel . Imagine several hours of that . I also did n't notice any arch support at all.Based on other reviews it also seems that the quality is not consistent . I do n't think that was the problem with mine , they just do n't work with my feet .
 I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain , much of it off-trail and over rocks . I 've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years . The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially , but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use . When the foam becomes compressed , the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt . This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds , or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec , as I 've seen it with other boots and running shoes also . Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use . I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes do n't just use suitable footbeds in the first place , but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles , the boots themselves are comfortable , keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated , and the soles provide good traction.UPDATE 2-26-2012My son purchased a pair of these Hi Tec Altitude boots in the last year . After only 100 miles of hiking , the traction lugs on the soles were deteriorating very badly and coming off . Suspect a bad batch of the sole composite material . I purchased some of the very first Hi Tec boots when they first came out and they held up very well . Then , some years ago , our family had backpacked twelve miles into a designated wilderness and the sole of my daughter 's Hi Tec boot completely separated from the upper . Lacking any repair material , I had to hike 12 miles out , drive to town several hours away , purchase a new pair of boots , drive back , and hike twelve miles back in with the new non-Hi Tec boots , just in time to join the family on a 12 mile hike out ! I 'd assumed that perhaps in the years that passed , Hi Tec had solved the quality control issues , that the experience was a fluke , and I went back to them . A mistake , apparently .
 I 've been trying to love these shoes for three weeks now but all I have to show for my effort is a foot full of blisters . I bought them from a very reputable running store where I know all of the employees and I 'm quite sure the fit was fine . But hey , you may have a different experience.I 've also found that the run itself is alot harder on my knees than the runs I take with my Asics 2090s . Finally , be careful in making your color selection . It 's fun to sport the yellow but it 's really , really hard to coordinate this color with anything in your wardrobe .
 Was not happy - shoes did not fit as stated -LRB- fit very small -RRB- and were very narrow for my feet .
 I 've never had an issue with purchases from amazon before ... this one looked ok at first but as I looked closer I realized that a few of the rhinestones were missing , I read the return label and it seemed too much of a hassle to return it . These were suppose to be my wedding shoes ... and now I wo n't be able to wear them .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 These shoes seem to be constructed well and I like how they look , but there just is not enough cushion on the sole . Walking on rocks under the water -LRB- or on the way to the water -RRB- hurts almost as much as going barefoot . They 're fine for walking on sand , but that 's it !
 The soles and laces of these sandals do not flex with your feet . Says it is leather but the laces feel like plastic . Very uncomfortable especially for dancing . Thin soled or would be good for every day use .

 I enjoyed the sandals at first but I 've had them for a few months and the soles are worn down quite a bit and the sponginess was gone after a month or so . I do n't think these are any better than what you might get at AE or Aero but they cost almost double . My last pair of sandals were a heavy rubber sole that made that pair last almost ten years -LRB- though they were heavier -RRB- . These as well as almost everything out there are just foam and wo n't last .
 I bought this pair because my $ 20 sandals from American Eagle had finally seen their last sunset . I was happy at first to get these sandals , but after 4 months , the right one broke . I was stepping out of a car on a slanted driveway -LRB- something I did a thousand times in the other sandals that never broke from that -RRB- . Dont ' waste your time . I went back to American Eagle and got a new pair which will far outlast these sandals .
 Not as nice once I got it out of the box , so I returned it .
 I ordered these a 1/2 size larger then normal , and I needed a larger shoe . I love Nine West shoes 'cause they are usually soooooo comfortable , no matter the height . Not the case with this shoe . Surprisingly uncomfortable . sent back .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 I do n't know what it is with the Structure 10s , but it causes me to get shin splints . I do n't know what they changed about it , but it is no good . I went back to running in my 9 's . And what do you know ? The shin splints went away . I think I will try the 11s next and hope they changed the shoe back to how it was on the 9 's .
 The Nike TRIAX Air Structure 10 I purchased had a very poorly made left shoe , leaning far to the left . It makes me wonder if it is a ` knock-off ' instead of Nike . I 'll stick to my old source and style .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 I bought this to replace a pair of Adidas Mega Bounce . This shoes do not have as much cushion and comfort as the Mega Bounce . I bought it because Amazon did n't have a pair of Mega Bounce on my size.It is ok for short distance walking but for long distance walking and running , I need more cushioning . I felt pain in my toes after a mile and I could use a bit more arch support .
 I ordered a pair of shoes from shoe metro . I sent them an email before i ordered the shoes and still have yet to recieve a response . I dont know about anyone else but I do know that customer service is a vital part in operating a successful business . And shoe metro really does not have good customer service skills . This is part 1 of a two part review .
 I purchased these clogs for my daughter for Christmas , having purchased other types of Betulas in the past and having been very happy . The material these are made out of is just not great . The clogs arrived lookig like someone had already worn the suede off around the edges . It just is n't good material if you want your shoes to stay looking nice for very long . I would recommend the leather Betulas ... those can stay looking nice and you can at least polish them . Skip the suede!This company has wonderful customer service , and I would purchase from them again . Nice return policy !
 Shoes were great but needed different size . Return was lost for sometime but finally found . Big hassle !
 Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only . Supplier does not carry the wide ones . Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths . Not here . No exchange possible . Now I 'm stuck with shoes that do n't fit and midwest sports could n't care less . I wo n't ever order from them again .
 They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks . I sent the size 44 back -LRB- which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks ; is it the Boston ? -RRB- and got the 45 and it STILL feels small . The upper is ok , the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate ; it 's just the size thing that bothered me .
 These are terrible ! They are uncomfortable and cheap ! Suck it up and buy the real thing , you will regret buying these .
 I ordered these as a gift . I had to pay about $ 7 shipping . They did not fit the recipient . I did not know about the 15 day return policy or the 15 % restocking fee . Now I owe more shipping -LRB- must be insured -RRB- and the fee . That is a total loss of about $ 23 for nothing . And I ordered these early to beat the Christmas rush . Now I have one day left to return them - Christmas Eve . Read the small print . I will not buy from a company that sells through Amazon again .

Now I owe more shipping -LRB- must be insured -RRB- and the fee . That is a total loss of about $ 23 for nothing . And I ordered these early to beat the Christmas rush . Now I have one day left to return them - Christmas Eve . Read the small print . I will not buy from a company that sells through Amazon again .
 I ordered a pair of shoes from shoe metro . I sent them an email before i ordered the shoes and still have yet to recieve a response . I dont know about anyone else but I do know that customer service is a vital part in operating a successful business . And shoe metro really does not have good customer service skills . This is part 1 of a two part review .
 I purchased these clogs for my daughter for Christmas , having purchased other types of Betulas in the past and having been very happy . The material these are made out of is just not great . The clogs arrived lookig like someone had already worn the suede off around the edges . It just is n't good material if you want your shoes to stay looking nice for very long . I would recommend the leather Betulas ... those can stay looking nice and you can at least polish them . Skip the suede!This company has wonderful customer service , and I would purchase from them again . Nice return policy !
 Shoes were great but needed different size . Return was lost for sometime but finally found . Big hassle !
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .

 Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only . Supplier does not carry the wide ones . Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths . Not here . No exchange possible . Now I 'm stuck with shoes that do n't fit and midwest sports could n't care less . I wo n't ever order from them again .
 They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks . I sent the size 44 back -LRB- which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks ; is it the Boston ? -RRB- and got the 45 and it STILL feels small . The upper is ok , the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate ; it 's just the size thing that bothered me .

 These were stretched out when I received them . I received them quickly , and was able to return them with no problem . They even gave me a shipping label I did not have to pay for , and then received the refund quickly .
 These look NOTHING like the picture . They are long and narrow and look like they came from a dollar store . Not worth the $ 33.00
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 All I did was walk down a hallway twice in my house and both little toes feel as if they were cut up by razor blades . They look comfy but the front strap is stiff and just cuts right into your toes . Beware .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .

 I had ordered these boots in the black leather in a size 10 . Much to my surprise , they were too small ; more like a 9 1/2 . I have other Nine West boots and shoes so it was out of the ordinary for these not to fit . Plus , the leather did not look like good quality , more like man made materials . Unfortunately , I had to return them .
 I do n't recommend a friend this product . It 's a very poor quality . 0 satisfaction for the client .
 These slippers seem okay , but they run way small . I wear an 8.5 / 9 very consistently , but the size 9 of these slippers is about two sizes small for me . They might be decent slippers , but the inconvenience of having to return them outweighs their merits for me .
 I received this as a Christmas present and even though I wear a 9 1/2 -LRB- and got a size 10 -RRB- they 're too small and I 'm going to have to return them : -LRB-
 I have 2 pairs of Tamarac slippers already , and when they went on sale , I decided to buy a couple of pairs for next year . I bought a size 9 previously in a different style and they fit perfectly . These are beautiful slippers , very well made , but when my second pair arrived , they were too tight and I have to send them back . Very unfortunate because I love the feel of these . I hope this manufacturer will correct these sizing inconsistencies so I can buy with confidence in the future .
 $ 15.00 was best price ever for sheepskin slippers , but the inside seams stuck up all the way around , so not at all comfortable . Had to return . Got the Cabela 's booties instead , lots more $ but much better quality .
 I had to return these because they were too narrow . I usually wear a 7.5 but read these run small so I got a 9 . The length was right but my toes still felt squished because they were too narrow . I ended up finding a different brand and love those .
 I thought these slippers were a good value at first . Fit was not really a problem . They looked like quality slippers and the price was a fraction of similar looking ones . They kept my feet warm . But , that was many months ago . I ca n't believe that I am the only person to comment on the major defect of these slippers
 I received mine yesterday and returned them today . The uppers are glued to the sole in a haphazard fashion . Once you put them on , you can feel the edges where the uppers are glued and clipped on the inside . I doubt they would last long . Glue is not the way to go . They should be stitched . Shoddy workmanship all the way around . I am sorry I paid for the shipping to get them . and the shipping to send them back . All in all , $ 16 to find out they were shoddy . Never again !
 I really liked these when I got them in early January . Actually , $ 34.97 is a LOT for me to pay for slippers , but I bought them anyway , thinking they 'd last ! HAH ! It 's now one month later , and both heels have holes in them , and NO way , as far as I can see , to mend them.Next time I 'll buy the old ` cheapies ' from K-Mart or Walmart & pay $ 6.00 . I 'm REALLY disappointed !
 I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking , `` hey , they 're cheap , is n't all shearling good ? '' Not so much . The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap . They were very sturdy ! Not so comfy.They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered . I 'm a size 7 , and the 8 's were a little small for my feet .
 Another reviewer complained that seams caused discomfort . I carefully inspected mine and found that the sheepskin in the sole had been pieced together , sewn together so that there are ridges to be felt by the foot bottom . This is an absolute NO-NO in the manufacture of shoes . One does NOT utilize scraps of construction material in this manner . Someone needs to supervise this factory .
 There was nothing wrong with these slippers other than they did not fit properly . Information had been provided that these slippers run small , and advice was given to order up a half size . I normally wear a 7 1/2 , so i ordered the 8 's . I could not keep them on my feet . They were very wide and too long . The quality was OK but they were such a poor fit , even with socks , that i just returned them .
 I bought these slippers when Amazon had them for less than $ 15 , so I probably should n't complain , BUT ... First , the size is quite small . I wear a 10 and ordered a 10 and an 11 , based apon others reviews . The 11 BARELY fits , and I can feel my toes bumping against the ends of the slippers when I walk.As far as quality goes , the slippers do look nice , but unlike other similar slippers I 've owned -LRB- and paid a lot more for -RRB- there is little to no cushioning inside the shoes . I 'm not just referring to the cushioning between your feet and the floor , but between your feet and the seams where the sole is sewn onto the bottom . I can feel the pronounced ridges of the seams all the way around the bottom of my foot , and they make standing in the slippers for more than a moment or two quite painful . If the slippers were bigger , maybe I would n't feel it , but I finally had to put in a pair of insoles , which did help a bit . All in all , I 'm pretty dissapointed .
 I recently broke my foot , and got these slippers for recovery . Although they are good quality , the sole is soft and thin . A great buy if that 's what you 're looking for . Unfortunately , did n't work for me .
 I bought the size I usually buy in a slipper , but the toe area is too tight and short . The heel is too loose . The bottoms are not cushioned , at all . Too bad they are nice looking .
 I bought these last year and tried them on - too small , but I thought perhaps they 'd stretch out a bit . WRONG ! I 've been wearing them now - still almost new - for a month now w / no luck on any stretching . My toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt ! I even have a narrow foot , for what it 's worth - not that the width would affect much . Still - bummer . .
 Odd sizing
 These shoes look cute and got good review , so I decided to give them a try . Even though I ordered a half-size larger than I normally wear , they hurt so much when I tried them on that I never even wore them out of the house . I returned them and am planning to buy a pair of Dansko wedges.I should mention that I have very attractive feet - big , flat , and square -LRB- like Fred Flintstone -RRB- - that only respond well to orthopedic-looking shoes . If your feet are of a daintier variety , these might be fine .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 This shoe does not keep shape , nor does it stay on like other slides .
 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .

 I bought these thinking they are quite beautiful and have the low heels I am looking for - surely I can walk around town all day in these . Unfortunately that 's not the case . Even though the rest of the shoe fits fine my toes are really cramped in these . In addition to the tight front , the bottom of the shoe is made of something that feels like soft plastic , it gets absolutely no traction whatsoever . My feet slips walking on carpet !!! Living in a city with hills I am afraid to walk either up or down the hills for fear I 'll slip and fall . Thanks a lot for forcing me to pick out only flat roads to walk on .
 The shoe style is cute except for the front is very low resulting in `` toe cleavage '' a look that I personally do n't care for . I returned these shoes .
 Nice materials . Not much support in the footbed , sandal runs loose . I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I 've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible .
 I really needed a nice pair of shoes that would look good with both pants and skirts . I also hoped they 'd be comfortable . After wearing these for one day , I had a huge blister on the top of my foot . There is a good chance that the blister developed because the shoes are just a little bit to big for me . I am hoping to go to a shoe store to find out how I might wear these shoes without so much damage to my feet .
 Its much heavier than I thought it would be . Would get a better fit if feet are slender
 This shoe seemed to be a smaller fit than the usual size 14 . Could not wear them at all .

 I ordered this shoe and it took over 2 weeks to get , when it finally arrived it is not the actual shoe that they are showing in the picture . Very disappointing ! The shoe does fit true to your size , I ordered a 1/2 size bigger and it is too big . I was planning to return the shoe anyway , since I did not get what I thought I ordered .
 This shoe seemed to be a smaller fit than the usual size 14 . Could not wear them at all .
 I ordered these back in May of 2008 , and these are still very comfortable and mostly in one piece . The only problem with these were within the first couple of months of wearing them , the container inside actually cracked and broke , rendering the whole `` idea '' useless.You 're paying the extra dollar for the gimmick of being able to carry liquids in your shoe , but if the container is n't durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of everyday life , then I ca n't recommend these shoes.And even if the containers were durable enough , their capacity is very limited .
 I have several pairs of Reefs ... hands down the best sandals out there . . but I will be darned if these things leaked after the first fill up . . didnt know till I was headed to the Pearl Jam concert ... filled a little Jamesons in there . . and put them back on ... drip drip drip ... other than that , they are a very comfortable sandal ... but reef makes better utility sandals ... the bottle opener ones , stash box , fuzzy and the golf ones are way better and useful than the flask ... shop around ...
 First , let me say that I 'm a fan of Reef sandals and own several pairs but these sandals disappointed at every turn . I know the flask is a novelty but less than 1 oz . per shoe ... Really ? Come on!The bigger problem arose after only several days of wear when the plastic -LRB- flask part -RRB- on both shoes cracked and crumbled , so even if I did want a drink fit for a lilliputian it would not have been possible.I know what you 're thinking ... And no , I 'm not fat , this is just a terrible product that should have never made it to market .
 It was not the kind of sandal you expected , the finishes seem to be for women and not men .
 The idea of having your flip flop hold some ounces of liquid is a fun idea , however , after wearing the sandals for almost a month off and on , the container shattered and the area that is right under your arc became very uncomfortable . I would stick to the sandals with the bottle top opener .
 This is exactly why we now have TSA agents making everyone take their shoes off before boarding a plane . . honestly , why would you sell these ?
 I have bought two pairs of Drams for myself and one for a friend and they have all leaked the liquid , not from the screw caps . It is the most comfortable and cushioned Reef flip-flop yet , but `` the Dram is not worth a damm ! ''
 Was so excited to get these . . ordered a pair , fit great , but RIGHT foot leaked , because it was missing the seal , returned to get another with the other shoe leaking this time ... also , cheap plastic , pain in the but to fill , and it barely holds one shot ... cool - but bad design
 I thought these sandals were the sweetest thing when I first got them 2 months ago . However , in the past week the flask on both sandals cracked . They are very comfortable and if I were to buy another pair of reefs i would go for the original sandals or the fannings . Please beware when spending $ 50 on a pair of sandals with a flask .
 These sandals are basically well made sandals - nothing fancy , other than you can sneak alcohol into a concert in them . Unfortunately , each sandal only holds about 1.5 ounces of liquor , or a total of two weak drinks . If you are really desperate enough to need the buzz , let someone else drive and drag you along . If you really want the age-old secret , here it is - fill a small `` clean '' cooler with ice and vodka with your unopened orange juice inside . Nobody can tell .
 I bought a set of these and they 're a cool novelty , being the guy who has flask sandals . There 's a couple problems though , one sandal leaked all 1 shot of booze out . The other sandal , even after many washings with dish soap , still make whatever alcohol I put in them taste nearly unbearable , even when poured into a mix . Not worth any amount of money spent on these , do not buy them .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 I ordered these back in May of 2008 , and these are still very comfortable and mostly in one piece . The only problem with these were within the first couple of months of wearing them , the container inside actually cracked and broke , rendering the whole `` idea '' useless.You 're paying the extra dollar for the gimmick of being able to carry liquids in your shoe , but if the container is n't durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of everyday life , then I ca n't recommend these shoes.And even if the containers were durable enough , their capacity is very limited .
 I have several pairs of Reefs ... hands down the best sandals out there . . but I will be darned if these things leaked after the first fill up . . didnt know till I was headed to the Pearl Jam concert ... filled a little Jamesons in there . . and put them back on ... drip drip drip ... other than that , they are a very comfortable sandal ... but reef makes better utility sandals ... the bottle opener ones , stash box , fuzzy and the golf ones are way better and useful than the flask ... shop around ...
 First , let me say that I 'm a fan of Reef sandals and own several pairs but these sandals disappointed at every turn . I know the flask is a novelty but less than 1 oz . per shoe ... Really ? Come on!The bigger problem arose after only several days of wear when the plastic -LRB- flask part -RRB- on both shoes cracked and crumbled , so even if I did want a drink fit for a lilliputian it would not have been possible.I know what you 're thinking ... And no , I 'm not fat , this is just a terrible product that should have never made it to market .
 It was not the kind of sandal you expected , the finishes seem to be for women and not men .
 The idea of having your flip flop hold some ounces of liquid is a fun idea , however , after wearing the sandals for almost a month off and on , the container shattered and the area that is right under your arc became very uncomfortable . I would stick to the sandals with the bottle top opener .
 This is exactly why we now have TSA agents making everyone take their shoes off before boarding a plane . . honestly , why would you sell these ?
 I have bought two pairs of Drams for myself and one for a friend and they have all leaked the liquid , not from the screw caps . It is the most comfortable and cushioned Reef flip-flop yet , but `` the Dram is not worth a damm ! ''
 Was so excited to get these . . ordered a pair , fit great , but RIGHT foot leaked , because it was missing the seal , returned to get another with the other shoe leaking this time ... also , cheap plastic , pain in the but to fill , and it barely holds one shot ... cool - but bad design
 I thought these sandals were the sweetest thing when I first got them 2 months ago . However , in the past week the flask on both sandals cracked . They are very comfortable and if I were to buy another pair of reefs i would go for the original sandals or the fannings . Please beware when spending $ 50 on a pair of sandals with a flask .
 These sandals are basically well made sandals - nothing fancy , other than you can sneak alcohol into a concert in them . Unfortunately , each sandal only holds about 1.5 ounces of liquor , or a total of two weak drinks . If you are really desperate enough to need the buzz , let someone else drive and drag you along . If you really want the age-old secret , here it is - fill a small `` clean '' cooler with ice and vodka with your unopened orange juice inside . Nobody can tell .
 I bought a set of these and they 're a cool novelty , being the guy who has flask sandals . There 's a couple problems though , one sandal leaked all 1 shot of booze out . The other sandal , even after many washings with dish soap , still make whatever alcohol I put in them taste nearly unbearable , even when poured into a mix . Not worth any amount of money spent on these , do not buy them .
 I love Skecher 's shoes for my boys ... they seem to withstand the beatings that the boys can dish out . But I bought these for my 2nd son for his `` back to school '' shoes since they were on sale , they were not laced shoes , and they were not white . He only wore them for 2 months before he was complaining on a daily basis that he could n't get them `` tight '' . After a week of this , I did look at them and he was right , the straps had started unraveling at the metal grommets , then they would get bound up in one spot instead of laying flat . We ended up buying him a new pair of Stride Rites at an outlet and he 's been wearing those instead . We 'll keep buying Skechers , but will definitely stay away from the `` Z-strap '' enclosures .
 I bought a pair of these shoes for each of my two boys.The first day my son wore these shoes one light stopped working.After taking a couple days to contact skechers -LSB- They have limited hours -RSB- the other shoe broke.Skechers then picked up the shoes and sent me new ones.This was a three week process.while waiting for those shoes my other sons lights stopped working.Now after just a week with the new shoes already one more pair has broken.I do not recomend buying these shoes.They are very cute when they work , but now all I have is dissapointed kids .
 Dear customer service ... One of the shoes that I bought does n't work . I am not pleased with this purchase.I am really interests to buy a new pair of shoes but it worries to me the quality of the lights.Regards ... Vanessa Aliendres
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 My daughter owns several pair of Lelli Kelly shoes . The beads have always stayed on very well on her other shoes and withstood lots of playtime . The beads on these immediately started falling off as soon as she wore these . They are pretty , and we love the style , but not made anywhere near as well as the other Lelli Kelly shoes . I think we should have just bought the glitter ones at Target in this style ...

 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .

 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I bought this shoe on a sale price about $ 25 . I got what I paid . Actually I am regret to have it for what I paid . The material of the sole looks really cheap and the worst thing is that it is very SLIPPERY . And the size 9.5 is at least half inch longer than the standard size . It is comfortable anyway . I also bought another pair Unlisted dress shoe which makes me happy but not this pair . Buy something else .
 DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES !!! Do not be enticed by the cheap price as I was . I thought for $ 25.00 even if the shoes only lasted 6 months to a year it would be worth it . However , they only lasted 2 months . The heel came off just like other reviewers said . I took them to get repaired and the shoe repair would not even fix them . He said they were too poorly made . I am also disappointed in Amazons return policy of 30 days even for defective products . They were purely a waste of money !
 The shoes look good , but the materials are very poor quality , too much money for their real value .
 Nice looking shoes for the the money -LRB- sale price $ 25 -RRB- and fair/good quality , but the size 9.5 M I bought was actually more like a size 11.5 to 12 . Evidently the shoes and the box were mismarked 9.5 M. I already have a pair of skis and did not want to mess with sending them back to Amazon . So I gave them to a friend with a bigger feet who could fill the shoes I could not . Anyway , my friend says he likes the shoes and wears them frequently . So when ordering beware that the shoe size I received in the mail ran really big ... like two sizes too big . My bad luck ... a friend 's good luck .
 For $ 24.95 I figured I could n't really go wrong with these shoes . But I was wrong . These are definitely a $ 24.95 pair of shoes . If it did n't say Kenneth Cole Reaction on the box I 'd swear they were from Walmart . Very cheap looking . I actually sent them back to Amazon and kept my $ 24.95 . They should rename these shoes from `` Best Man Oxford '' to `` Cheap Man Oxford '' because that 's what people will think when you walk around in these .
 They do look cheap but not too bad so for a $ 25 shoes . I agree with others that it is very slippery and utterly uncomfortable . I also would have ordered 1/2 size down of my usual size . Yet , being too big was some consolation so I could fit gel insoles to compensate for these highly uncomfortable shoes . Still , I regret buying it . Money wasted .
 Buyers , beware . After I wore the shoes and walked , I almost broke my arm . This floor was not wet or slippery . It was the shoes !! Very uncomfortable as well . I wasted my money . I am going to order Kenneth Cole or Bostonian .
 If you want to waste your money on plastic shoes ... go to payless . These are not leather and have a sticker on the heel that say man-made upper . Please learn from my mistake and go elsewhere to buy shoes .
 They may look cute , but I tell you do not buy them ! Only unless you wear them for less than an hour . These shoes are for really wide feet . Which mine just swam in them , and they were super uncomfortable ! You must order a whole size smaller . The first time I wore them the strap ripped off . I 'm stuck with shoes I ca n't wear . Heck I even bought Dr. Scholls insoles and they were still uncomfortable to wear . I 'm disappointed that they are cute and you ca n't even wear them . Are n't many shoes like that . I love demonia but I do n't love these shoes .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 Cute shoes , but extremely uncomfortable . I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes . I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair . I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned . This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit . I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big , it 's a catch 22 .
 Guys , i needed a pair of shoes for a wedding and had to buy'em quick . so i headed to amazon and purchased these . I 've purchased several pairs of shoes before on this awesome site , but these were off by a way much . It seems to be that Kenneth Cole shoes run way bigger that you normal size . I 'm a size 12 and these were defiantly not 12 . they were at least 13 ! Also once i had them they dont look as much like the picture . AVOID .
 This shoe looks good enough , but on my feet , they looked a bit stumpy . I tried wearing them with jeans and a skirt , but they were n't very flattering on me . I was also disappointed that the sole is thin , that there was no cushion at all in the footbed , and that the shoe was n't made of leather -LRB- it 's actually a man-made , leather-like material -RRB- . Looks aside , the quality of the materials and the potential longevity issue were the factors that made me return them . I think I might have kept them if they looked like they would have handled wear from walking to work and back.In case anyone is wondering , my wife posted this through my account . I do n't wear shoes like this.-CL
 I paid a ridiculously small amount for this pair of shoes - under $ 20 . With how little I paid for them , they are fine . I would not recommend then at full price . They are not worth $ 69 . There is no discernible arch support , the soles are not padded , and the sides are not supportive .
 I do n't know . I guess I feel that Stride Rites purposely size their shoes narrow so that they can tell you your child has a wide foot and you feel that you need to buy their shoes.My toddler ahs been sized at many places and the only place that told her she was a wide was Stride Rite . She wears all sorts of shoes ; Geox , Lelli Kelly , Adidas , Primigi , and even Target shoes and she has no problem with pinching or the width but I purchased these in a regular width and she cried all day.I could n't figure out what her problem was and then I took off her shoes and her little toe was pinched , red , and out of shape . Poor Girl!Maybe 2 stars is a little harsh . Just make sure you get your child sized at a local Stride Rite before buying online and chances are , unless your child 's foot is really narrow , you should get the wide width to be on the safe side .

 The main strap of the shoe is tightens on the bike side of the shoe . And because if this the strap rubs on the crank arm on every pedal . This is a bad design .

 Not A comfortable sneaker at all ! Looks like a wonam 's sneaker .
 This one is quite wide on the sides so my toes slide outside the peep hole of the shoe -LRB- I hate when that happens -RRB- . And the shoes look better in the picture . They are very comfortable though .
 When I started wearing this , the metal studs came off so I hv to throw it away .
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 Very cute , I always get compliments , but I wear them only every so often and the bottoms are all ripped up - you 'd think I wear them everyday ! I 'm just upset I paid over $ 60 for shoes that will BARELY last one season .
 I purchased these about 3 months ago . They have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere . I have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home . They are already ripping in the back.I would n't recommend them ; however , I do get many compliments about how cute they are .

 Hello , I have purchased sperry billfish 3 eye shoes for the last ten years . I have not had a problem until my recent purchase at Peltz shoes . The shoes I received were defective beyond belief . I did get a refund with the help of Amazon.com
 The shoe is ok minus the fact that it started to fall apart after just several uses . Then planet shoes actually had the guts to tell me that it was from normal wear in tear . For a product that is supposedly high quality I would recommend just buying the shoes from the sperrys website that way you do n't have to deal with stupid companies that have terrible customer service . Worst customer service ever .
 I read great reviews and raves about these shoes . They are touted as the `` Original American '' boat shoe . When I take them out of the box the writing on the tongue says it all
 I ordered shoes for our aniversary for my husband , and those are all he wears , well they came and were blue with flat bottoms , not sperry billfish , so i had to return them and needless to say i was without aniversary gift for my husband , first time i have been disappointed with ordering online . . my husband loves the sperry 's and this type is all he will wear ... he wears them till they are pitiful and i make him get a new pair ...
 They have a wrong picture . If you click the shoes that looks like beige , in description , it says tan/beige . And now it looks like I have to charge for refund .
 The top-siders I received had frayed laces . The inside was not as soft and smooth as the last pair I purchased .
 The picture shows a tan shoe . I have ordered this a second time and the two tone shoe arrives . It also arrived as a gift , but no way to ship it back . I see the color says tan/beige , but the color on the picture is only one color , beige.I need to return this item and would appreciate help in that process , as well as finding the correct Sperry.THank you so much , Sharon Ellis
 My son specifically wanted this style and we could not find it locally . Ordered and it was exactly as described !
 poor craftship when it came to the stitching . they look an feel good but , they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly .

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 I tried the dye on 2 black leathers coats , following the directions as specified . Thank goodness I did only a small area as the dye is actually lighter than the black leather . Very disappointed . These are good leather coats , one from Italy and now they are worse than before . The dye looks really black in the bottle but does not end up that way .
 i tried to use it on a car seat.it looks like the dye is pretty strong and wo n't fade away easily.how ever , the black dye has a purpleish color to it when in the light.it looks more like ink then a dye .
 This dye sucks ! I dyed my leather jacket and the dye constantly rubs off on everything including my fingers !! Yes , I followed the directions to a `` T '' . Save your money !
 It looks like I 'm the contrarian since the other reviews are so good for this dye . Maybe I got a bad bottle , but it was just not permanent . I followed directions , planning to apply it to a worn cushion on my leather sofa . But first I did a test spot . I cleaned the area with alcohol spirits , let it dry , and applied two coats of dye . When I rubbed a white cloth on the test area , a lot of dye came off . Then I applied leather conditioner and waited a day to let it sit , and tested again . The product still wipes off . I noticed some people say the product is hard to get off of skin . For me , a couple brisk hand washings took a spot off of my finger , so again , maybe I got a bad bottle . The LESSON FOR OTHERS - TEST BEFORE YOU USE IT .

 I ordered shoes for our aniversary for my husband , and those are all he wears , well they came and were blue with flat bottoms , not sperry billfish , so i had to return them and needless to say i was without aniversary gift for my husband , first time i have been disappointed with ordering online . . my husband loves the sperry 's and this type is all he will wear ... he wears them till they are pitiful and i make him get a new pair ...
 poor craftship when it came to the stitching . they look an feel good but , they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly .
 The picture shows a tan shoe . I have ordered this a second time and the two tone shoe arrives . It also arrived as a gift , but no way to ship it back . I see the color says tan/beige , but the color on the picture is only one color , beige.I need to return this item and would appreciate help in that process , as well as finding the correct Sperry.THank you so much , Sharon Ellis
 My son specifically wanted this style and we could not find it locally . Ordered and it was exactly as described !
 I bought this shoe as a gift for a friend . When he received the shoe , it was in excellent condition , but when he wore it for the first time , their were staple wires protruding inside the shoes . So what he did was to removed it . The second time he wore the shoes , the fake stitching on the side of the shoe was coming off ! I really thought that this shoe was an excellent brand , what a disappointment . Should have bought Kenneth Cole Shoes ! Lousy expensive disposable shoes ! Not worth buying ! From now on , Bacco Bucci is off my shopping list !

 I was extremely disappointed with the shoes upon arrival . They look nothing like the picture . this color -LRB- bronze leather -RRB- is cheap looking and not even close to leather looking .
 I do not find these walking boots to be comfortable , as advertised . They look good , but they hurt my feet . I would like to return them , but I have worn them four or five times , thinking I would `` break them in '' and they would become comfortable . Has n't worked so far .
 Shoe is not up to Clarks High Standard.No Bargain At the sale priceIf you are inclined to purchase they run sliughtly larger than Clasks usual sizingLong Time Purchaser Of Clark Brand

 I ordered the recommended one size up . The toe box length and width is tight , but the back half of the slippers and sides are a bit loose . A full size increase to a 9M from the size , which I ordered -LRB- 8M -RRB- would be too large and the sides would definitely be too loose . As other reviewers noted , these slippers do loosen up and I hope that the toe box becomes more comfortable . The 3/4 '' rubber raised soles appears adequate . As I write this review , my feet are becoming quite warm , after about twenty minutes , with my athletic socks.After an hour , my feet are roasting in these slippers . Would I purchase again ? Difficult to say , if the toe box does n't loosen up for comfort .01 / 25/2012 UpdateI replaced this pair from DSW -LRB- Designer Shoe Warehouse -RRB- with two pairs , which fit . My feet were never comfortable with this pair . Would not recommend .
 Do n't order these unless you have tiny little feet . I ordered a size larger than my husband normally wears and he could n't even get them on . If you order them , you better try TWO sizes up than normal .
 normaly this would be my size.could barely get my foot in them . i think this was the only size available.looked well made but jusy wouldny fit . gave yhem to the needy .
 The slippers were ok except the opening is too small to get your foot into it without considerable effort . That made the slippers unusable for me .
 I tried on these slippers on precisely one time , then returned them to the box . They were n't horrible , just not real comfortable , and I got the feeling they would n't be particularly warm . But to be fair , I did n't wear them long enough to judge their thermal efficiency . I just did n't like the feel of them.For my money , better to pay a little more and get better quality .
 Good Quality ... But opening for foot way too small ... My huband couldn &#34; t get his foot in the slipper ... Other wise nice slipper shoe
 I ordered these for my Dad for Christmas , but he was n't able to get his feet in them . They were very small .
 These were sold as mens size 11 , both my son and my husband wear a size 10 1/2 shoe , neither of them can wear these slippers . They are at lease 1-2 sizes too small . The shipping was slower than advertised as well . The slippers themselves are solid and warm with a sturdy sole you can wear outdoors without fear . The only problem is they are much smaller than the marked size .
 I threw them out ! the most cheaply made piece c. . p I ever had . Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
 Having read another review that said these slippers ran small , I ordered the next size up but it was too small . I returned them for the next size but they are out of the next size bigger . This is the only style slipper my husband likes and it is impossible to find them anywhere .
 cloth on bottom sole not good for hardwood floors , knobs on bottom of sole with cloth glued to them offers even less area for grip . doubt the knobs will be comfortable , but time will tell . solid build and warm for ankle and once fabric on sole wears out and offers some grip -LRB- what where they thinking ? -RRB- it might be comfortable but will definately be warm , if it doesnt make feet sweat ... -LRB- just got them so unknown , but looks like the dearforms inner fabric , sorta . -RRB- if not for the knobs and cloth on bottom , this could get a five .
 I wear a size 10.5 D . After reading other reviews here saying these shoes are &#34; true to size &#34; , I ordered a size 11 . I received them and they ar at least a full size too small . This is the last pair of house shoes I will try to buy on line . I know from trying them on in store that you just ca n't trust their sizing . I do n't know why that is , but i 's been the case ith Every pair I 've bought . I happened to be able to give this pair away or a Christmas present instead of having to return them . That said , I regret buying them ... wo n't try it agin .
 Comfortable slipper . Top construction is well made and put together but sole material wore out too quickly wearing the slipper around the house and outdoors on occasion to walk out to get the sunday newspaper . Would not purchase these slippers again .
 These shoes were MUCH smaller than the stated size . I wear a 13 and a half shoe , but knowing that house shoes need to be loose , I ordered them in a size 14 . They were SO small , I could n't force my feet into them . And if the seller -LRB- different than the manufacturer -RRB- really had a `` bend-over-backwards '' policy as they state , they would offer a fedex or UPS label so I could send them back for free . / This is exactly why I dislike buying cloths from the internet or by mail-order . But , it is getting harder and harder to find local stores that have the larger sizes -LRB- even big and tall stores -RRB- . I guess I 'm just screwed .

 They do n't tell you but some are suede and some are cheap nylon fiber netting . When you have a problem , neither Land 's End nor Amazon will help . It is like limbo , sending shoes back to 1 place and hoping to be credited in another , with NO customer service !
 I 've got these shoes and they look good , but after some minutes of constant using you will feel the hardness of the sole and they will become uncomfortable.Recommended only for using occasionally and for some minutes . Otherwise you will end with feet pain .

 I promptly returned these Easy Spirit shoes . I 've been wearing Easy Spirit for years and these are not their usual quality lacking proper arch support .
 I think this product is a good one but I have had lots of aggravation with my order from start to finish so ca n't recommend them .
 I was a loyal Easy Spirit customer for about 10 years for both walking and dress shoes . My first pair of Romy 's that I purchased a few years ago held up well for a year . The pair I purchased on February 27 , 2012 already look and feel as if I have been wearing them for a year . This pair and the previous pair that I purchased last fall were both were made in China . I am looking at a pair of New Balance that are made in the USA for my next walking shoe purchase .
 I 've heard/read so many great things over the years about Easy Spirit and really liked the idea that this walking shoe was available in C/D width.For me , however , the Avia walker is better simply because the sole has more cushion . On my feet for hours at a clip , I also added my usual tri-comfort and ball of foot inserts just because . So far , my feet are much happier.I could have saved these Easy Spirit 's as a secondary pair , but the Avia 's also cost a couple of bucks less . I 'll give the Avia 's a couple more weeks before deciding on whether or not they are my `` new '' shoe .
 Ordered them from the good reviews but I really should know better than to buy shoes on line . They seem to run short and they just seemed cheap ... thus the price but I have had Easy Spirits before and loved them . I will be sending this back .
 While I love the look of this shoe , is runs small . I will be returning them . I needed them in a hurry and was able to find a pair local . I purchased the same pair just had to go up 1/2 size . The shoe its self is a great shoe very comfortable .
 These shoes were a real disappointment . They appear to be made well enough but the materials are certainly subpar . The shoelaces are thin and hardly long enough to double tie , the `` leather '' is nearly as thin as glove leather and the soles are just hard foam . These were also supposed to be medium width which always fit , but when laced to fit , -LRB- as well as possible -RRB- the leather at the bottom of the tongue was puckered . I ordered two pair of these shoes and now have to pay for shipping to return them .

 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess

 Just to get to the point , my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water . When it rains or snows , the leather gets soaked and in no time , my feet starts to feel wet . This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole . At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon . Distraught , I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle . But alas , after the first day of rain , my feet were soaked again . I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made . Do n't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis .
 My pair of Clarks arrived last week . When I took the shoes out of the box , I was n't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes -LRB- like I thought -RRB- or a cut-down version of a boot . I went back and looked at the picture on-line and , sure enough , I got what I ordered . This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe . With the four eyelets , this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit , plus it looks goofy . The leather , if it really is leather , looks fake . I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered . I also would never wear these shoes with jeans -LRB- if you do , wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek -RRB- . All in all , I give the product a 2 . I would send them back , but it 's not worth the bother . Instead , I 'll wear 'em when I work in the yard .
 These shoes seem to be well constructed , but they are not like the Clarks that I bought 20 years ago . I bought them about 3 months ago , and I wear them 3 or 4 days a week .1 -RRB- They 've lost most of the cushy feel that they had when they are new .2 -RRB- They have an unusual smell that reminds me of band-aids . I had originally thought that the odor would fade , but it has not . I can smell them all of the time , when they are within 6 feet of my person.If it were possible to return them at this point , I would .
 They are very average shoes . Please do n't buy them thinking they are better than any quality shoe on the market . Go to a Vasque dealer and get better shoes .
 The shoe overall was nice , I Like the design and it fits well . However it started tearing at the sides . did not get as much wear from it . I am really disapointed in clarks as I grow up wearing clarks and have to pray for it to damage .
 BROWN LEATHER - COLOR - BEWARE !!! IT IS DARK AND UGLY.I bought this in Brown leather last month and got that shipped to Kuwait.The brown color that looks great in the website picture is TOTALLY UGLY AND UNIMAGINABLY DARK AND UNACCEPTABLE.I am not using the shoes at all.Not in a position either to Ship that back to the US and get a replacement becausethat costs me more than the price of the shoe.James
 So happy to see this style still available . My current pair is at least 10 years old and it 's time to order another pair . These shoes are amazing walking shoes and while I do n't wear mine a lot at home , I would n't be caught dead without them on a trip to a walking city such as NY or SF . I can walk 10 miles per day in these shoes and they 're as comfy as going barefoot . Highest recommendation!Update
 I am a fan of Clarks . Probably last 10 years I have n't worn any other shoes except Clarks.Couple of weeks ago I ordered two pairs of this shoe

 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess
 I ordered these boots in size 12 m regular toe . They came in a box marked 12 m but the boots were 10 m . They did not fit also they had steel toes that I did not want . I do like these boots I have had 4 pairs that I bought from Sears over the years . I thought I would save some money online but it did n't work out . Just a wast of time . I went back to Sears
 I do not find these walking boots to be comfortable , as advertised . They look good , but they hurt my feet . I would like to return them , but I have worn them four or five times , thinking I would `` break them in '' and they would become comfortable . Has n't worked so far .
 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .

 I purchased these shoes for my 14 month old ; days after they arrived they started to fall apart . My toddler did not wear them daily nor did she wear them outside ! they are cute shoes but the sides appeared to be leather and they are not .
 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 I was shopping around for a nice shoe for a little while , and I found this one at a great store called Soccer Plus in Palatine , IL . I bought the shoe and used it to kick a ball around with some friends . By the end , the back of my ankle had a mark from the friction . Next time I used it , I ran on a treadmill . When I finished and looked at my sock , it was covered in blood from that same area . I 'm not sure what the problem was , but I think it was the artificial material and the lack of padding . I would n't really recommend this shoe . Find one with better padding inside .

 This is a OK shoe . But not for the price ... This shoe is not worth $ 130.00 it is worth about $ 35.00 . Very high shoe , and for a wedge they are difficult to walk in . They are also narrow .
 I purchased this bag and returned it . It is very disappointing in appearance , materials and workmanship .

 This shoe was so big for the supposed size it was unbelievable . In my car to be returned . It seems you ca n't trust ANY brands you used to be able to rely on for quality control ... not in any product . I am so disappointed .
 I dont have a large foot but when I look down they look like men 's shoes . The pictures are not representative of the shoe WHEN ITS ON .
 I love ordering from Amazon . They process and deliver my orders in a timely manner . However , I am very disappointed with the Wolverine work boots.The quality of construction has changed ; along with the sizing and they hurt my feet . My first pair of Wolverine work boots were so comfortable that I would take long walks in them . I expected all Wolverine Durashock work boots to be of the same quality and comfort ; they 're not . If you 're looking for comfort , avoid these boots

 este producto parece en pantalla de mayor calidad pero cuando las ves te das cuenta que el material se ve y es malo , ademas el taco es una madera tan mala que va sediendo con el uso . no de gustaron para nada .

 If you buy two of these racks and stack them you ca n't fit shoes on the bottom . The racks are very flimsy and overall quality is very poor . One of the pegs broke the first day I had it . I would not recommend to anyone .
 You really ca n't expect much if you 're not willing to pay for it , but overall I would have taken a pass on these if I 'd seen them in person up front . Basically you get two 5.5 `` x12 '' cedar blocks with three pre-drilled holes and then three slats which are about 1.5 '' x 1/2 '' with dowels on the end that fit into the pre-drilled holes . Basically a middle school shop student could make these without any problem.One of my slats came without the dowel and was not pre-drilled . It did n't come with any extra dowels so I had to improvise . The pieces were only mildly sanded and there was no sanding done at all to the exit side of the pre-drilled holes ... long splinters and a pretty unfinished look.On the other hand , it is made of cedar which smells great and is n't cheap ... but if you found a good deal on 1x cedar , you could easily make the equivalent product yourself .
 I bought two of these to stack and wish I had saved the receipt and box to return them . The space between the racks is very small . I can barely fit the shoes in them . The depth is also limited and does not fit adult sized shoes very well . The edges are sharp - my husband scratched his leg going around the corner . An almost useless product and way over priced !

 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .

 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I do not find these walking boots to be comfortable , as advertised . They look good , but they hurt my feet . I would like to return them , but I have worn them four or five times , thinking I would `` break them in '' and they would become comfortable . Has n't worked so far .
 I love ordering from Amazon . They process and deliver my orders in a timely manner . However , I am very disappointed with the Wolverine work boots.The quality of construction has changed ; along with the sizing and they hurt my feet . My first pair of Wolverine work boots were so comfortable that I would take long walks in them . I expected all Wolverine Durashock work boots to be of the same quality and comfort ; they 're not . If you 're looking for comfort , avoid these boots

 I have been running for over 33 years and have had dozens of running shoes . For the price , even the sale price , the Mizuno Men 's Wave Creation 5 is not a good shoe . There is a lack of cushioning that I expect from a good quality shoe and I am sure that if I was running as much as I used to I would not be able to use this shoe .

 I love ordering from Amazon . They process and deliver my orders in a timely manner . However , I am very disappointed with the Wolverine work boots.The quality of construction has changed ; along with the sizing and they hurt my feet . My first pair of Wolverine work boots were so comfortable that I would take long walks in them . I expected all Wolverine Durashock work boots to be of the same quality and comfort ; they 're not . If you 're looking for comfort , avoid these boots

 I tried to order these crocs two different times and both times I was sent the wrong thing . I spoke to someone about it and they told me they would get back with me but they never did . I wo n't ever waste my time or tell anyone I know to use this service . I understand mistakes happen but if a company refuses to make good on their promise then I have no use for them .

 These looked great in the picture , but beware ... These shoes have the longest point I have ever seen looks great on the side even on , but looking directly down they are witches shoes . With the nicest kitten heels and they are really roomy . I am a 9 1/2 to 10 and I bought these in a size 9 and the fit great . I think I am keeping them for Halloween for $ 19 , what 's the harm ? If you are very trendy at work , these were last year 's trend of pointy toes . This year it looks like round toe 's and Mary Janes and do n't forget Platforms ! Anyway , that 's my 2 cents on this purchase

 First of all , I 'm Mary Graham , not Jessica Shoemaker . I 'd really like these shoes if the white part were black . Please make some of those shoes , all black , the way you used to .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 I ordered these boots in size 12 m regular toe . They came in a box marked 12 m but the boots were 10 m . They did not fit also they had steel toes that I did not want . I do like these boots I have had 4 pairs that I bought from Sears over the years . I thought I would save some money online but it did n't work out . Just a wast of time . I went back to Sears
 These shoes are cute , but they have a weird fit . The back of the heel comes up higher than regular shoes and it gave me quite a blister when I wore them for a walk . They are not terrible . Perhaps I should have bought a half size smaller because there are n't any laces to tighten them up .
 At first these are ok - but throughout the day - they wore on my heel , and my heels got rubbed raw and sore . Could not wait to get them off - I am returning these .

 these clogs were way too tight on my left foot across the dorsal arch . the right foot was fine . i tried to order a bigger size but all the sudden it was n't available in the black lace i wanted . so i decided instead of returning them for my money back , i would try to cut them open . if you want a do-it-yourself project resulting in unprofessional looking clogs , then by all means , these are the shoes for you . they would have been perfect if they were n't poorly sized . ps . my left foot is not larger that my right foot . i measured because i like science and i needed to know this about myself . it might end up working out when i fix the shoe to my specification . but still , not a clean appearance anymore is it ?
 Bought these shoes because I liked the look and needed a new pair of `` driving '' shoes after my last pair wore out after about 2 years of use . I 've had these for about 3 months and they are already falling apart . The rubber on the sole is falling apart , and the leather at the toe is peeling off . I would not recommend these as everyday business casual shoes .
 I have 2 of the exact same pairs of shoes purchased from Macy 's and the pair that I received from Amazon were not only missing insoles and the Steve Madden name anywhere on the shoes , but were fake plastic replicas from China . Completely unacceptable and now have to go through the pain of returning them .
 I have had these shoes for less than three months , and I only have worn them about 20 times in very light wear -LRB- to the store , around the house and such -RRB- . Both shoes are already losing their seams and falling apart . The covering on the leather was so thin it is showing through , and looks like they are three years old , not three months . My wife had ordered these before we read the other reviews , but we decided to give them a try anyway . I wish we had n't . What a hassle ! We are having to return them , and I would never buy another shoe from this maker again . They are garbage . I would have been better off buying some shoe at my local dollar store .
 the only good thing about these shoes is that their comfortable . but beware , they do n't last more than a week or two . the stitching on the bottom of the shoe gets worm out real quick , and then the shoe falls apart . its really not worth the money .
 Bought a pair of these about 5 months ago . Actually bought two ; one brown , one black . I wear the brown a lot more and they go with everything , but after about 2 months the bottoms wear out and fall apart . The bottoms now have holes in them . They shoes were great for a while , now they are going in the trash and will be buying from a different brand .
 I just do n't understand the business logic of manufacturers sometimes . Is it really worth it to save maybe $ 1 a unit and end up with a vastly inferior product?I bought these shoes at Macy 's and they looked amazing . They are a good combination of casual/dress that you can wear them just about anywhere.The problem with these shoes showed up about 2 months later . Apparently to save 15 cents in rubber per shoe , Steve Madden decided it would be a brilliant idea to use a perforated sole and cover the bottom with a thin layer of rubber . This gives the impression that you have 1/3 '' of rubber between your foot and the ground , but actually its 1/3 '' of rubber with a bunch of holes on it covered by a few mm of rubber . Unfortunately for you , that means that after a month or two this thin layer wears off and you start getting holes in the bottom of your shoes!Is rubber really that expensive ? I 'm paying $ 60 - $ 80 for these shoes . Seriously , spend $ 1/unit to make the soles more robust , charge me $ 5/unit more , and end up with a much better product and $ 4 more profit.If you 're interested in this style of Casual/Dress shoes I 'd suggest you check out some Sketchers . Not traditionally what you think of when you think of these kinds of shoes , but I 've had a very similar pair of Sketchers in white that look great for about 2 years now , and they 're still going strong.No more Steve Madden for me !
 The shoe is very handsome . I can tell a lot went into the design except for doing it 's job , i.e. protecting your feet . The shoe has no support and after a few months of normal wear a hole developed in my left toe on the outer leather . Not much longer did the irreplaceable thin leather foot-bed wear down to the rubber sole . If your intention is for the `` sole '' purpose of taking the Maserati out for a spin , then the shoe fits . If you plan on throwing the frisby around to impress the ladies with you mad skills , I suggest you do it barefooted .
 Very bad quality . The thread on side of shoe started tearing off on 1st day . Returned it immediately . Highly discourage any potential buyers .
 Normally 8 or 8.5 fits my feet . But the leather of this shoes is too rough . I first ordered 8.5 and I return it to replace by 9 . Even the size 9 is like a blade in my feet . When walking I feel scratching my feet but it looks very good . Make sure you order one bigger that your size .
 Great looking shoe , but the material at the tip of the shoe is synthetic and the sole is stitched to it . The walking motion of the sole directly contacts the tip and rubs a hole straight through it , exposing the end of your foot . I cant believe these are still on the market . Huge disappointment . Spend the money for something of higher quality because these are extremely cheap made . Not worth $ 25 in my mind . Madden lost a customer for life here !
 These are certainly handsome shoes though there are all kinds of construction issues . Also , do n't get them wet or wear them in winter weather or you will be throwing them out within a week , guarantee . I 'm not sure what they 're made out of , but they end up smelling unholy terrible afterwards . If none of this is enough of a deterrent , I would wear wear these shoes seldom and in dry , warm weather .
 the stitching at the top of the shoe came apart the first time worn . did n't wear until summer so the return period expired . very disappointed .
 These look great and are very comfortable . Having said that , the sole does n't come far enough forward to protect the toe which just happens to scrape the ground with every step . After wearing these maybe 6 times the leather on the toe is almost worn through . I would not buy these again .
 I generally like the shoe . It looks good and is comfortable . However , it is poorly made . The stitching is coming off after four months .
 I bought this shoe from a brick and mortar retailer , not Amazon , so my post may not pass the verified purchase test within Amazon . Irrespective there are good things and bad things about this shoe.The good . Nice leather . Cool Look . Interesting concept in a shoe , only problem is that too much stitching and finished leather like the Uppers are right along the outsole periphery or even the center of the outsole . In anything but the best weather and the smoothest of walking sufaces , this shoe will not last . I need a shoe that will survive the 1 -RRB- walk four miles on a sunny afternoon through the hillsides just because test as well as the 2 -RRB- run across the airport desperately trying to make my connecting flight because American airlines always arrives late into LAX test . On both accounts , this shoe would not cut it . The lateral extensions over the outsole are too exposed to abrasion and ultimate wear . The stitching starts to suffer , and the overall shoe bottom will start to look worse for wear after a few days of walking though some mildly damp streets after a SoCal rainstorm . If the outsoles were 10 % wider on each side , I suspect the shoe would have shown a lot more durability , but it did n't and so the shoe did n't last . Luckily , the brick and mortar retailer did give me a nice coupon towards the purchase of another set of shoes which I used to score some nice Florsheim Oxfords , so I am whole . I wish this shoe had more substance .
 First of all , the inserts are tiny -LRB- both in length and width -RRB- . While its a great idea to have a buddy pad in the platform of your pointe shoe , unfortunately , these inserts do n't work that way . The adhesive used to apply the inserts to the shoe is very weak and wears off after one class , leaving you with a thin cushion slipping around your shoe . Also , they quickly lose their form and become misshapen . If you 're looking for a less padded insert than the standard gel kind , I recommend just buying the thin cloth toe pouches rather than wasting your money on a product that will last one class .
 These are a joke ... they are as little as my big toe and they do n't stick at all . You can still feel the hard shoe right through them . Do n't waste the money .
 I love ordering from Amazon . They process and deliver my orders in a timely manner . However , I am very disappointed with the Wolverine work boots.The quality of construction has changed ; along with the sizing and they hurt my feet . My first pair of Wolverine work boots were so comfortable that I would take long walks in them . I expected all Wolverine Durashock work boots to be of the same quality and comfort ; they 're not . If you 're looking for comfort , avoid these boots

 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 Low quality to be a Puma . My feet hurts when I use it for a long time , the disign looks different when you got the product in your hands .
 Not what I thought ... It was like a track shoe ... A flat ... Thought it was more like a sneaker ...
 I love ordering from Amazon . They process and deliver my orders in a timely manner . However , I am very disappointed with the Wolverine work boots.The quality of construction has changed ; along with the sizing and they hurt my feet . My first pair of Wolverine work boots were so comfortable that I would take long walks in them . I expected all Wolverine Durashock work boots to be of the same quality and comfort ; they 're not . If you 're looking for comfort , avoid these boots

 These shoes lasted a few months of intermittent use before falling apart . They were never comfortable from the onset and never broke in ... just became more unbearable with time . I 've used Danner boots for years but have now switched to Lowa ... the best brand in my opinion .

 When you get these shoes/sandals , they wo n't look anything like they did online . They are very cheap looking and not made very well . Now I know why they are trying to get rid of their stock at such a discounted price . I took them directly to my local Champs Sports store and exchanged them for a nice pair of Nikes . Do n't waste your time on these cheap shoes .

 I bought these at Target for my sons . My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart . Not too long in my opinion .

 I always buy ventilated shoes for summer hiking and decided to splurge based on looks . It 's hard to get a good feel for a new shoe because it has n't broken in so I bought them thinking the extra cost would mean they were more durable . It 's been a month and I 've worn these every day with about 30 + miles of walking overall . Every step feels like walking in huge leather work boots . The huge solid squarish back of the shoe does n't roll down , it just pivots and smacks the rest of your foot down on every step . I keep thinking the sole will break in but it has n't . My poor feet ache if I walk even a mile.What 's good about them ? The venting is ok but not as much as a running shoe or something like that . Absolutely perfect fit on the inside and did n't have any issues with chafing while breaking them in.You 'd probably be better off buying some cross trainers .
 I bought these shoes specifically for hiking in warm climates . While advertised as vented , they still tend to get too warm . Also , I am having trouble with the left shoe squeezing my toes even though I bought them a 1/2 size bigger . They are sturdy and the Vibram sole is great!After trying to stretch these shoes around the toes , I have given up ... should have returned them within the 30 days but I ran out of time .
 Ordered my size but was too small . The shoe ran small . My other Merrell 's -LRB- one I was replacing -RRB- was my size but this pair did not fit . Had to return .
 For flip flops , these shoes weigh a pound each . Not only that but everyone who has them has the little `` key drawer '' -LRB- hidden in the heal -RRB- slipping out . I returned them , and it was not cheap , since they were so heavy .

 I ordered 2 navy shoe bags and you sent 2 beige ones . I would send them in for a return , I need them for a business trip on Monday and it 's not enough time for me to exchange colours . Product is passable quality for the price .

 I was about to purchase these in Black/White , but every time i add them to my cart i 'm seeing the ` Canvas ' image , which leads me to believe these are not ` Leather ' as i had hoped . It 's very unclear and needs to be updated . I wo n't risk buying them just to receive the wrong product .
 It stinks the way Converse has ruined this shoe . The suede sole is gone . The padding around the ankle is gone . The padding in the tongue is gone . The Jack Pucell logo on the tongue is gone . The logo on the heel has changed . The durable shoelaces with metal aglets are gone . The trademark `` smile '' is no longer recessed in the toe . For some reason the insole eyelets are now located partially in the rubber midsole . The material and overall feel of the shoe is now flimsy , thin , and cheap . Oh , and - inexplicably - the blue version of the shoe now features white stitching.The changes were probably for financial reasons , but I 'd gladly pay 10 to 20 dollars more to have the Jack Purcell be like it was back in 2008 or ' 09 . Just save your money and buy a pair of All-Stars and draw a line across the front of each shoe with a marker . Basically , that 's what you 'd be buying .

 I purchased the silver foil and they were sooo ugly . I guess I did n't look at the picture close enough because I did n't notice the `` chipped paint '' look on the heal . Upon opening the package I thought they were damaged . Nope , that 's how they 're supposed to look . Ugly and tacky . Did n't bother trying them on .
 Shoe looks great and is comfortable . But it keeps slipping off . I tried the heel grip things but my feet slide in and my foot keeps sliding out . I got these on sale too and I could not return them . Shoe is great but what is the point if you ca n't wear it ?
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 ... initially when I put it on , I did n't know how much it hurt my feet until I wore it for a full day -LRB- on carpet , so that I could actually keep it in good shape and return it just in case -RRB- . I was limping on the way home , and I had to take it off at around 11AM .
 I thought , wow , Rockports for 25 bucks that 's a deal if I ever saw one . However , I ordered the 8W and what I got was not a wide , so $ 25 down the drain . I donated them , so some lucky woman will be able to use them , but I am very disappointed and will definitely think twice about using this vendor again in the future .
 Very attractive shoes - the perfect warm , rich brown with the flirty cross buckle ; I though they 'd be wonderful casual work shoes . Unfortunately , the rise comes to far up on the top of the shoe for comfort or style . It cuts into the middle part of the foot -LRB- painfully if you try to do a whole day with them -RRB- and the high cut makes my foot look even wider/longer than typical . I love walking cradle , but this higher cut on the top of the foot just does not work .
 These shoes are not comfortable , they feel too big even though they are the right size . The t-strap is too broad and that 's the best feature on the shoe .
 Not as original adidas , this is a fake one . I ordered two pairs for my sons , this one did not last long , it is not even leather .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 hey am not satisfied with order i order a big kid size for my son and when i receive it , it was way to small it was for my son who is 10 year , s old i have to go get him one more pair
 I do n't know if it 's my nine year old grandson who lives with me or just a gliche with this pair of shoes . I purchased this shoe six or seven months ago for school purposes and the toes lasted 2 months . I gave it one more try but this time they lasted 6 weeks . I decided to pay for a more expensive boot because the cheap ones did n't last very long so I figured more money , longer lasting . I ca n't recomend these boots . Not after purchasing two pair.Twice poor Gramma from Murphys .

 HORRIBLE customer service . Very slow at responding via email and does n't honor their 5 % off policy if email is n't addressed within 24hours . And sends the wrong merchandise and does n't refund the return shipping costs .
 These boots are very cute and comfortable . However they are NOT leather as stated in the description . They are clearly labeled ALL MANMADE MATERIALS on the inside of the boot . Since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal , but the price I paid is not worth it for non-leather boots .
 I was very dissapointed when I received these boots . The description clearly states that the boots are leather , but they are NOT .
 Too , too small . I wear a 6.5 and these are very small and tight , i sent them back.dont bother they are not corretly labeled
 I purchased these shoes because I 've always trusted capezio but the shoes just do not hold up well at all . I use them twice a week and have for the last 5 weeks and they already look awful like i 've had them for years . The gathering on the bottom is beginning to come undone already too . I would suggest looking for a better model of shoe .
 Not A comfortable sneaker at all ! Looks like a wonam 's sneaker .

 These are perfect little slippers . The impratical outer fur minimizes cankles and makes your foot look much smaller . Everything about them is nice but they did not feel true to size so they are being returned . A previous pair of Acorn 's women 's slippers were too big . These are too small .

 I hoped to solve the cold-foot problem of standing in Minneapolis waiting for the bus . I thought these boots were promising . They are fine in temperatures above freezing but when it gets down to 20 degrees F , they are not warm enough for bus travel . I think they 'd be sufficient if you were driving everywhere . Otherwise they are practical , comfortable and maintain their appearance .
 The boots fit well and are attractive but they are not waterproof . My feet do not get soaked , but in the front of the shoe -LRB- toe area -RRB- the boots allow water in and as a result , they leave my feet cold and damp . I now wear plastic bags over my socks to keep my feet dry when I wear these boots . Very disappointed .

 I bought these last week for $ 36 - free shipping . Now they are $ 45 . Anyway , I buy Saucony Jazz pair after pair . When I compared this pair with the old one , I 've noticed how the quality of new ones worsened . Outside they look like they have been worn for a few months . Inside , the materials appears to be put together without any regard for the output . Uneven stitches , glue marks . When I tried them on , they are no longer the soft and cushioned sneakers I have enjoyed over the years . They are as hard as walking barefoot on hardwood floor or cement . I believe I was shipped the `` fake '' Jazz . I will see how I can return them .

 I purchased an Adidas shoes from them and when I received it I found out It was too narrow , which the seller did not mention.Although the shoes cost $ 19.95 plus shipping -LRB- About $ 7 -RRB- , I discovered that to return the shoes would cost me another $ 7 . so between paying for shipping and handling both ways , I lost $ 14 -LRB- 75 % of the purchase price.Unbelivable
 These sandals are extremly uncomfortable . I wear a size 10.5 , but I ordered a size 11 , they were still very narrow and pinched my feet . Also they felt like I was walking on concrete . They are not ajustable and look and feel poorly made . For the same price go with Adidas sandals

 At first I really love the sandals , but as I continued to exercise with them it became harder and harder to keep the strings tight . I would have to stop and tighten the strings every few minutes . It got to be such a pain that I do n't wear them anymore .

 I can not believe what I have been through trying to buy slippers for my husband . After searching several department stores , I finally found these . With wide width available they were a perfect fit . He had them for about a week when they ripped at the lacing , causing a large hole in the top of the shoe near the toe . I returned them and had a second pair sent . I thought maybe there was just a defect in the first pair.He had the second pair about a month , with little wear , maybe an hour or so a night . This time the lacing broke at the bow . Now the lacing has loosened and is coming out of the grommets . He had to tie it back together just to keep it from falling apart.I will definitely be returning these and DO NOT WANT ANOTHER PAIR . Going to try Lands End now .
 I bought these for my husband but they just were n't as comfy as I hoped . I 've sent them back and found another pair for half this price and much more comfortable .
 Whoever heard of a rawhide lace breaking ? It broke in two places . I have been wearing moccasins for about 35 years , and have never experienced a broken lace before . Unfortunately , nobody in my area has rawhide laces , so now the moc 's are basically unusable , as without the lace it flops around as I walk .
 I ordered these in a 13ee because I own a pair ina 13d and they are to tight on feet . The new ones came and said they were wide . Truth is they are exactly the same size and width as the regular ones that did not fit . If you have wide feet , save your money . If you have super narrow feet . They are nice slippers .
 Terrible quality . The left slipper started tearing after two weeks . My left toe came right through the tear . The pair I had before this was just a generic brand but they lasted well over two years .
 Get EE if you get these . The D is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable .
 I was excited when the slippers arrived , but they were a huge let-down . Everything except the uppers , even the `` leather '' strings are fake . I 'm okay with synthetic materials , but I expect to be able to tie a bow in my new shoe strings without breaking them . They broke the instant I gave a tug to tighten the bow . It was n't a hard tug . That 's when I noticed they do n't even look real . The lining looks fake as well , and looks like it would wear out in no time . They just do n't look or feel like high quality , and with stuff breaking within 20 seconds of my putting them on , I felt sort of ripped-off . With this experience , I contacted Amazon and arranged a return . UPS just picked them up , and my experience with Amazon , at least , has been good . I just ordered a different slipper that costs a little more and made in USA instead of China . I was tempted to rate these slippers 1 star but I was feeling generous today .
 I have bought these slippers in Navy for a few years , but this last pair has split at the seam near the toe area . My husband had probably only worn them for three weeks ... ca n't return them now . He can still get a little wear out of them , but he is very disappointed . Not sure where to find a suitable match in Navy without paying alot more , but most likely will not buy these again for fear of the same thing happening again .
 We have purchased these slippers for several years and were always happy with them until this year . They changed the cording that weaves the front of the slipper together . Both of the new pairs we bought fell apart after a couple of weeks of use . The suede was cut too small to handle the larger laces .
 I purchased these slippers for my son as a Christmas present . The stitching ripped through the suede after ond day of wear . I am very disappointed .
 My father wears slippers that are much too long for him ; I live in fear that he 'll fall down the stairs due to their excessive length . Unfortunately , these slippers , like every other pair I 've tried to purchase for him , were too narrow in spite of their 5E width . I hope I can find something for him before he is injured . At 85 , he can scarcely afford a fall due to too-long slippers .
 UPDATE : I bought brown rawhide laces on ebay -LRB- color does n't match exactly -RRB- . I can pull as hard as I can on them and they do n't break.It 's NOT easy to thread the new rawhide through the holes , especially the four holes on the top of the shoes where they get tied.Buy 18 '' or 24 '' laces to replace the junk they came with . 12 '' is probably too short , but they can be `` knotted '' -LRB- not nicely tied -RRB- if that 's all you have.I would n't buy these if I were you . --------------------------------- I do n't know if the lacing in this is real or fake rawhide , but it breaks as soon as you pull on it slightly.Without the lacing that goes around where you put the foot in the shoe , it 's VERY loose and ca n't be worn.I suppose I can try to find some laces somewhere , but this is crazy . You 'd think there would be SOME quality control . There is none .
 These slippers are well made and great for the price . I originally bought them because they were listed as having a EE width but they are not any wider than the ones found in the stores with a regular width .
 These shoes looked great , but performed very poorly . Spikes came with these shoes , but they were not permitted on any of the tracks in our area . The plastic bottoms wore down after the second competitive track meet . After that , she slid every time she tried to run or jump while wearing them . They are useless to her now .
 These thongs looked like they would be comfortable . Unfortunately , they are very heavy and feel hard on my feet . They drag on the floor as I walk because of their weight/design . Yuck !
 I usually love Nine West stuff , usually the only shoes that fit without an `` adjustment period '' of pain.And it 's not that these hurt . They 're just so hugely ... UGLY . Maybe it 's because I 'm a size 10 , but the super long , pointy toes just look like they should curl up and I can get work as a court jester.I 've had pointy toed pumps before , and none of them quite made my feet look like gunboats.I 'd recommend these if you 've got a very small foot . Unless you 're trying out for the circus , if you 're a size nine or more ... there are prettier shoes that wo n't make you be embarrassed at your Jackie O-sized tootsies .
 we bought this umbrella for my son along with the matching boots . the boots are great , but the umbrella must have been cheaply manufactured as the hinges to keep the umbrella broke very easily .
 i bought this umbrella and the dino version for my twin boys . the blue dino version is great , but this frog version wo n't stay open . i looked underneath the umbrella and noticed that the tent closures are different - maybe the frog version they have in stock is an older model ? either way , it caused a huge fight with my children over who would get the ` broken ' umbrella because neither of them wanted it . this one 's going back to amazon .

 I own a pair of the Allen Edmonds Eastport boat shoes in British Tan that I wear quite a bit and bought these brown AE Eastport boat shoes for variety and to alternate in with the British Tan pair . While they are the same size , same design and same quality soles and support , the uppers are made of much stiffer materials . Despite being EEE , for 6 months I had them in shoe trees wrapped with towels to widen them . Finally took them to a shoe shop and they were widened slightly over 3 days . Still do n't wear them much since they are uncomfortable . I wonder if they were improperly labeled .

 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .

 I hoped to solve the cold-foot problem of standing in Minneapolis waiting for the bus . I thought these boots were promising . They are fine in temperatures above freezing but when it gets down to 20 degrees F , they are not warm enough for bus travel . I think they 'd be sufficient if you were driving everywhere . Otherwise they are practical , comfortable and maintain their appearance .
 The boots fit well and are attractive but they are not waterproof . My feet do not get soaked , but in the front of the shoe -LRB- toe area -RRB- the boots allow water in and as a result , they leave my feet cold and damp . I now wear plastic bags over my socks to keep my feet dry when I wear these boots . Very disappointed .
 I looked at dozens of slippers online for a long long time and decided on Aussie 's . They were the most expensive but according to Aussie they were the best . I followed Aussie 's sizing chart before ordering . I 'm a solid 10 1/2 , sizing chart read order next size up if your 1/2 size for proper fit . I ordered size 11 . Received slippers fairly quickly , four stars for that . Tried size 11 slippers on and it was like wearing clown shoes , way over sized and had to spend over $ 8.00 to return them . I 'm out over $ 8.00 plus for return shipping and no slippers . Take from this review what you will .

 These shoes are nice looking and reasonably comfortable , but they do not have any leather . It is very disappointing . They are also true to size -LRB- I always wear a 9 in Franco Sarto and these are n't any different -RRB- . I found out what was going on with the item description . The black color is leather , whereas the blue -LRB- the one I ordered -RRB- is all man made . I called Zappos to complain about their description and they updated it already , so check there to see which colors are man made vs. leather .
 Terrible ... this shoes are like stones , it does n't have a piece of leather . Franco Sarto ... no thanks . I wasted my money and I felt angry-sad ...
 I am always on the lookout for navy blue shoes and when I saw them knew I had to have them . When I opened them I was delighted , they were beautiful . Having the platform helped them seem not so high and I could actually walk in them and my 59 year old legs looked shapely and young . Sadly , after wearing them for 10 minutes discovered my heel kept popping up . I was n't sure it was from my toes sliding forward or the fit of the shoe . They were comfortable and surprisingly easy to walk in despite the height of the heel . I may order them in a size smaller because they are such a pretty shoe !
 I should have known better than to order shoes online . I have enough trouble finding shoes in stores but Franco Sarto shoes seem to always fit me and I was excited to see some size 5 ! The right shoe was visably larger than the left shoe - looked and fit like a size 6 . Both shoes were marked &#34; 5 &#34; . I asked for another pair and kept the originals to compare to the new ones before returing . That was a bigger disaster . Both shoes of the new order were again marked &#34; 5 &#34; but looked and fit like a size 7 . !!! How does this even happen ?
 Comfortable fit , but the shoe does start to hurt the ankle after a bit , the heel is quite high . If you are used to that high of a heel , should be no problem , if not , then you should go with a smaller heel . You definately can feel the thinness of the heel when walking . I am 5 ' 8 and rarely wear this pair of heels .
 It was available on stock when I bought it but then I received an email from amazon saying that the item was out of stock and they were to refund the money to my credit card . Now I received an email asking me to rate the item and I just ca n't rate it because i could n't buy it .
 Too , too small . I wear a 6.5 and these are very small and tight , i sent them back.dont bother they are not corretly labeled
 I purchased these shoes because I 've always trusted capezio but the shoes just do not hold up well at all . I use them twice a week and have for the last 5 weeks and they already look awful like i 've had them for years . The gathering on the bottom is beginning to come undone already too . I would suggest looking for a better model of shoe .
 Ordered 2 for my sister and wife . Sizes are 1 full size smaller than US standard . Has to exchange the item . Be careful ... Thanks / .
 These run really , really small , even compared to other Asics shoes .

 it gets dirty easily , and even if you wash it , it does n't become clean.I do n't recommend this shoes . It is durable and comfortable to wear , but I do n't like the design and it stays dirty after washing it .

 Shoe hurts my feet !!! Poorly constructured leather and it 's not going to break in - I wore the shoe and do n't think I can return .
 The shoe is OK , except for the fact that it feels like a toy . The shoe is completely made of plastic - including the sole . The sole does not bend well and as a result the shoe is not that comfortable . Adidas seemed to cut a few corners here ...
 I used to wear these shoes for high school tennis over 25 years ago . I bought a pair recently and they are not the same comfort or quality as the original . They are extremely stiff , no support , and they give me blisters . The do look good -LRB- if you like that classic look -RRB- .
 Very comfortable . Just what I was looking for . Fast forward 1 month , the soles wore out ! There is an actual hole in the sole . I 'm so glad I bought them from Amazon . I wo n't have to fight for a refund . I 'll buy a different type -LRB- from Amazon -RRB- hopefully better quality . Oh by the way , I 'm not a tennis pro . I 'm a retired senior .
 The soles are actually slippery . More like plastic than rubber . Fails the most basic of tests for a sneaker .
 I got this great sneaker shoes from Amazon , but the sole is really bad quality , it is like plastic , very slippery , I would like to have better quality , can someone help me .
 The shoe looks great and is really light BUT I found it was extremely uncomfortable around the toe area where the seam between the side and front panel is . I wore them for two days hoping they would break in but no such luck . It 's a shame because I was expecting more from adidas and I really like the design of these shoes .
 These shoes look great but offer little in the way of comfort for the price . Very little padding and a snug fit , rough edges inside the shoe . I 've gotten my share of blisters trying to break them in . I bought my usual size and they are a very snug fit , you may need to order 1/2 to a full size larger in these
 I 've worn Adidas tennis shoes for 20 years and a 10.5 has always fit perfectly . A 10.5 in this shoe is too small , but I 've already worn them so I 'm out of luck .

 The sole of this shoe is made from several glued pieces of rubber , instead of painting one piece for multiple colors . This is poor design , as the pieces come off and the shoe slips easily . Get a different sole design .

 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 The shoes are beautiful when they arrive . However the stripes on top can be felt and actually rubs against the foot in one shoe . Amazon is great about taking the returns .
 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 This is a good pump . I thought the heel was too high for me . I returned the pump .
 Usually take a size 11 , so ordered those , but they were strangely small.Don ' t understand all the raves here about this shoe !
 The shoe looked nice but did n't accomodate my foot and an orthotic . I am pleased with the service however .
 I bought these through Amazon in June 2005 . I am a beginner squash player and play 1-2 times a week . By November , the seams were starting to rip -LRB- where the blue contacts the white on top -RRB- . I sewed them up with mono-line and it held up for ~ 3 weeks and ripped again . I tried sewing them one more time and it was not use after another week . I used them for a little while longer but the fabric broke down inside and my toes would punch through . Never owned a sneaker that only held up for about 6 months . I would say they are wide shoes and very comfortable and work well on the courts . I would buy them again since the fit is good , but only if I knew they redesigned them to be stronger . But ~ $ 70 -LRB- w/shipping -RRB- every 6 month would be a horrible investment . I am now looking for another brand . Any ideas for people with wide feet ?
 I paid $ 100 for these shoes and after three weeks I threw them in the trash can . The leather cracked on the tops and the entire sole came off of the left shoe . They felt heavy on my feet when I did wear them . There was nothing I liked about these shoes except the design .
 In my first play , the shoes were damaged ... . i ca n't believe it ... better it had bought Prince shoes ... Anyway ... Next time , I will make a better decision ...
 Less than a year old the white is chipping off on one sneakers upper as if it were paint on plastic . Now the gum rubber is detsching from the side of the toe . Not ripped just coming unglued . Will not buy this brand again .
 I PAID FOR RETURNED SHIPPING AND I AM OUT OF MONEY FOR NOTHING.SIZE INFO APPEARED LACKING IN THAT YOU MUST ORDER A SIZE 3 SIZES LARGER TTHAN NORMAL AMERICAN STANDARDS.I AM NOW AFRAID TO ORDER ANYTHING BY E-MAIL . HUSBAND JOHN
 I did not receive the orange kangaroo sneakers I ordered . Instead I received a pair of lime green canvas Kangaroo shoes in the box when I opened up my overnight package . I have yet to hear a response about this mix up ...
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 The sneaker wasnt what I expected at all . Material was not the best and after deciding to return it , it ended up costing me just to get it back to the company . Wasnt please at all .
 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 I did n't actually get a chance to dance on these shoes as the sizing on Amazon.com was horribly off ! As a dancer who usually dances solely in Bloch shoes , I thought I 'd take advantage of the wonderful sale Amazon was having on Capezio pointe shoes to try another brand and see what I thought . Unfortunately , the recommendation to purchase shoes 1/2 size smaller than street shoe sizing was terribly off and I had to return the shoes . When I checked on the Discount Dance website -LRB- those who had actually shipped the product to me -RRB- , I found that they recommend sizing the Capezio pointe shoes 1 size * larger * than your street shoe size , which is a much more accurate recommendation . I attempted to do an exchange , only to find that the shipper was unable to exchange the too-small shoes for a pair that fit correctly because the inventory had been depleted . Had I received accurate information as to sizing in the first place , I could have taken advantage of the sale pricing to try out a new shoe . I notice that this inaccuracy still has n't been corrected on Amazon 's website , so I would recommend the buyer beware when relying on the sizing information provided on this website if you have never tried this particular shoe before .

 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .

 They look nice - but I have only seen one - they shipped me a box missing the other shoe . The box even has large holes in the side and that lonely shoe was just rattling around in there - pretty obviously alone I should think.I called them at the number on the invoice , good service . But no pickup - had to head over to USPS -LRB- on Tax Day ! -RRB- and mail that poor shoe back to them . They did refund the USPS charge as well and in a reasonable period of time .
 cute shoes and great price , but they 're so stiff i do n't know if i 'll ever wear them . uncomfortable ; will take a lot of breaking in , if i can brave it . if you have strong feet , go for it .
 I normally wear a size 10 1/2 shoe . I have always bought Clark 's because of their comfort and durability . I purchased a size 11 med . They were so tight and uncomfortable . I had to send them back and pay shipping both ways . What a waste of money . I will buy them locally to assure a comfortable fitting .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 Be aware that these boots run really short . I wear an 8 and an 8 1/2 were still too short . Not the quality I expected for something made in Canada , that 's more like made in China . They were warm and I liked the style , the length just did n't fit at all . If I went up a 9 then the heel would be too big . Unfortunately , the seller fails to provide any kind of reviews or information for the product on all of the alternate sites it sells on so that potential customers would have been aware of this.The seller , ShoeMall , is also the absolute pits . When I sent back the size 8 -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- to exchange for an 8 1/2 , they sent me a size 8 again . So , I contacted them , and they said they would send a prepaid return label for their error . So , I waited ... and I waited ... and I waited , no label . So , about every 2 weeks I contacted them that I had not received the label to which they replied that they would sent another . The last time I contacted them they did n't even respond . So this is their game . I never received even one of those labels that they supposedly sent . Now they 've dragged it out to 2 months later and I am forced to dispute the charge on my credit card to get my money back for boots that I can not wear . It 's not the first problem I have had a problem with them , but it will be the last since I will never buy from them again .

 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 They look nice - but I have only seen one - they shipped me a box missing the other shoe . The box even has large holes in the side and that lonely shoe was just rattling around in there - pretty obviously alone I should think.I called them at the number on the invoice , good service . But no pickup - had to head over to USPS -LRB- on Tax Day ! -RRB- and mail that poor shoe back to them . They did refund the USPS charge as well and in a reasonable period of time .
 I hate the boots ! I purchased a pair for $ 110 in October of 2012 . After a couple of days the shoes started to squeak progressively getting louder . Regardless of the floor surface ; carpet , concrete , or grass the boots would squeak getting louder and louder . It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem . I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $ 15 . Thanksgiving goes by , then Christmas , then New Years with no word about my shoes . Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes . A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland . I wore them for a week then they started squeaking again . I am out $ 125 dollars and all I have to show for it is a pair of shoes that make a lot of noise .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 I suppose that it 's inevitable , but I was hoping that the shoes would be the same as I remembered as a kid . They are not . To say the quality is inferior is being kind . The sizes run small as well -LRB- about a half size -RRB- and A * com will charge you shipping to return it .
 I bought the shoe and they are ok but they are NOT Stan Smiths . Just a bland old no name shoe .
 When I ordered the shoes , I thought there would be a screen to change to shoe size or else let me cancel the order . It did not , so I had to return them and have not yet received my refund
 I would rate these a lot higher if I could wear them . I used to wear Stans all the time , when a pair would wear out , I would go to the store and pick up another pair , size 11 1/2 . I did n't have to try them on , just buy them and go . Beware of doing that with these . I got 11 1/2 and they run narrow , the length is ok , but they are narrow , and squeeze my feet . I could wear them , and they might break in , and stretch , but I would bet they would also blow out in short order where the upper connects to the sole.I have tried to contact the sell Midwest Sports , to get the issue resolved , but the email came back , and when I contacted the website , it did n't get answered . This is a buyer beware situation . The look good , but I do n't want to look good and feel terrible . I would not buy these online , go to an old brick and mortar store , and try them on .

 They are true to size , no need to go bigger . The toe narrows , so the hard plastic straps above the toe tend to dig into your feet . They are easy to walk in and are very fashionable , but not worth it . I 've worn them one time , and wont wear them again .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 I bought this shoe for use working in a theatre . After a few months I had to have it re-heeled , and then shortly after the heel broke right off , causing me to fall down the stairs . I 'd beware of this shoe , not made well at all .
 I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly . I have extra wide feet , so I was hoping these would be wide . They were NOT at all . Maybe a medium width , but more like narrow . Too bad . I wish I could find shoes that work . I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress , but wo n't look like one without the proper shoes .

 I saw this shoe on a friend & had to purchase it . I bought my size and I usually wear a 1/2 size smaller in JS shoes but this one runs so narrow it squished my toes & i do n't even have fat feet . I would order a bigger size but then it would be too long & leave a gap at the heel . Too bad because they r cute . I have several pairs of JS shoes and they are fine . I have found that some of JS shoes I have tried are too narrow & do n't fit . I had to return these but have found plenty of other JS shoes !
 When I received these shoes I could not even get my feet half way ! These are advertised as a medium but they are NARROW !!! This particular brand of shoes are very poorly described and a very inaccurate fit . There are better fitting brands on Amazon , look elsewhere to avoid dissapointment .

 I normally wear a size 10 1/2 shoe . I have always bought Clark 's because of their comfort and durability . I purchased a size 11 med . They were so tight and uncomfortable . I had to send them back and pay shipping both ways . What a waste of money . I will buy them locally to assure a comfortable fitting .

 Everything was just fine until I tightened the laces for the first time . When the roller style guide pulled out of the boot it left a nice hole clean through the shell , about half way up the boot . So much for water proofing .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .

 I bought these shoes and after wearing them for 20 minutes I had blisters the size of quarters on my heels and toes .
 I was hesitant about buying running shoes w/o trying them on first or getting fitted , but these were true to size and oh so comfortable . You really can feel the difference . Their return policy -LRB- 60 days , used -RRB- also reassured me that if they did not work out , I was n't stuck with them . * UPDATE * I 've had the shoes for a few months now -LRB- well passed the 60 day return period -RRB- and the rubber at the bottom is starting to become unglued -LRB- towards the sides of the shoes -RRB- . I most definitely do n't run everyday so this is quite disappointing to see happen already . Substracting some stars ...

 I had a brown pair and wore them out . I wanted another brown pair but could not find them locally . I ordered them from Amazon and was shipped a black pair.I could have purchased a black pair where I live . Too much hassle to send them back.In addition , the venting/drain holes accumulate water and dirt and the sandals begin to stink like death if you do n't take a garden hose with a nozzle and blast out the `` draino '' holes . It took me a while to figure out where the whiff of stink I was experiencing every once in a while was coming from.Buy yours in your neighborhood .

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes

 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .

 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I bought this shoe for use working in a theatre . After a few months I had to have it re-heeled , and then shortly after the heel broke right off , causing me to fall down the stairs . I 'd beware of this shoe , not made well at all .
 I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly . I have extra wide feet , so I was hoping these would be wide . They were NOT at all . Maybe a medium width , but more like narrow . Too bad . I wish I could find shoes that work . I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress , but wo n't look like one without the proper shoes .

 Photo is inaccurate & the seller refuses to refund my money . They sent a thigh high boot -LRB- over-the-knee -RRB- , NOT the below-the - knee type indicated in the photo . When I contacted them about it , their explanation was `` everyone 's legs are different lengths '' & `` they do not accept returns for sanitary reasons '' . Shoe stores accept returns ! I did n't even try on both boots . Unless the woman is the photo is a giraffe , they are inaccurately advertising this product !
 These boots are fabulous at first sight ! Just what I needed to complete my Wonder Woman costume ! I tried them on when I first received them , and they were great . Here comes the big Halloween weekend , and I have one boot on . Pulled on the left boot and tried to zip it up and the zipper broke . Keep in mind I had NEVER worn these other than to make sure they fit . There was no fixing the zipper , and so in order to have a costume I had to buy white duct tape and tape my boot shut . These are very cheaply made and I am highly disappointed in them . I do n't recommend these boots to anyone .
 I purchased a pair of these from Halloween.com They look great . Feel Great . The heal broke off the first time I wore them . $ 40 for 3 hours in a costume . I asked the company for a replacement , and was told that since I wore them they will only offer a 25 % discount next time . So if I want to buy another cheap pair of boots that are overpriced I can.Terrible customer service.Cheap Product.They look great !
 There comes a time when you wish you had listened to the collective wisdom online , and when you could hear the Internet whispering back to you , `` I told you so ... -LRB- echo echo echo -RRB- `` These boots are not of the highest quality . BUT if you could hold your breath , squeeze your calves tight and manage to zip up the boots , then yup , they would make you look fiercely awesome . In addition to how the boots would only fit crane-like legs , the zippers are indeed scrap -LRB- minus the s -RRB- . You have to be very careful while using force to zip up the boots , all the time worrying that the zippers will break somehow.My biggest peeve with this item is the fact that I am now stuck with them . Future Memories , the vendor 's response is as follows
 I did n't find this flip flop comfortable at all . I am a FF junkie so at the end of the day they ended up in the back of the closet worn just once . Not worth the money .
 My son loves the appearance of the shoe , but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description : - leather-Soft , calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper . I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising .
 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .

 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .
 These shoes are super cute-too bad they size big ! I always wear size 9 , but i should have bought a size 8 in these shoes as my heels totally lift out of the 9s -LRB- and as i live in france , it costs too much to exchange them -RRB- . looks like i 'll be stuffing the toes of my shoes too !
 I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly . I have extra wide feet , so I was hoping these would be wide . They were NOT at all . Maybe a medium width , but more like narrow . Too bad . I wish I could find shoes that work . I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress , but wo n't look like one without the proper shoes .
 I bought this shoe for use working in a theatre . After a few months I had to have it re-heeled , and then shortly after the heel broke right off , causing me to fall down the stairs . I 'd beware of this shoe , not made well at all .
 the adjustability of the shoe depends on being able to apply tension . the first time i wore this shoe the blue hub over the cord came off .

 I bought this shoes mainly for hiking as they seem rugged . Although I was reluctant to the brand -LRB- never heard about it -RRB- , the price made me try them out . After opening the box my impression was positive , they look very nice , and seem to be very well done . But after grabbing one of them I figured out they were heavy , as a result of a very thick out-sole . It turned out not only being thick , but pretty stiff , making me feel quite uncomfortable while walking . Also the tip of the shoe is a continuation of the sole , and is annoying to feel your fingers touching such a hard surface when doing some extreme movement , like stopping suddenly . Overall , they look good , but feel bad , so I 'm returning this and hoping that in the future they use better out-soles , in which case I 'll give them another opportunity .
 Will be returning these shoes after the holiday season . They are a very narrow fit and they do not stretch .
 They are really rough and the loop from the knot on top really rubs the skin raw . Even if wearing light socks it still is abrasive .
 Recieved these as a gift from my dear mother . My face said thank you , but my mind said da HECK . Copious amounts of gross .
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes

 The worst fitting boot I have ever bought . I thought with the North Face name I would n't be disappointed . I usually do not make comments but I do not wish these on anyone !! I even took the sole out and bought a comfy sole , still horrible . I bought these for a trip to Canada and was absolutely miserable . I ended up throwing them away ! BIG WASTE !
 I ordered this shoe in a 10W along with another pair of Life Strides based on a review of wide shoes . I found this shoe to be way too narrow through the toes .
 I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone ! First of all they do n't support the military stationed overseas and second customer stinks . Customer service was very rude and not willing to work with us . They asked for a street address and when I notified them that we are stationed overseas due to military orders they wrote back and stated these exact words with no explanation `` We have canceled your order . ''
 I suppose that it 's inevitable , but I was hoping that the shoes would be the same as I remembered as a kid . They are not . To say the quality is inferior is being kind . The sizes run small as well -LRB- about a half size -RRB- and A * com will charge you shipping to return it .
 I bought the shoe and they are ok but they are NOT Stan Smiths . Just a bland old no name shoe .
 When I ordered the shoes , I thought there would be a screen to change to shoe size or else let me cancel the order . It did not , so I had to return them and have not yet received my refund
 I would rate these a lot higher if I could wear them . I used to wear Stans all the time , when a pair would wear out , I would go to the store and pick up another pair , size 11 1/2 . I did n't have to try them on , just buy them and go . Beware of doing that with these . I got 11 1/2 and they run narrow , the length is ok , but they are narrow , and squeeze my feet . I could wear them , and they might break in , and stretch , but I would bet they would also blow out in short order where the upper connects to the sole.I have tried to contact the sell Midwest Sports , to get the issue resolved , but the email came back , and when I contacted the website , it did n't get answered . This is a buyer beware situation . The look good , but I do n't want to look good and feel terrible . I would not buy these online , go to an old brick and mortar store , and try them on .
 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 Extremely unhappy with this seller 's -LRB- Barry 's Capezio -RRB- ridiculously tight return policy , especially given something as tricky to fit as dance shoes .

 I normally wear a size 10 1/2 shoe . I have always bought Clark 's because of their comfort and durability . I purchased a size 11 med . They were so tight and uncomfortable . I had to send them back and pay shipping both ways . What a waste of money . I will buy them locally to assure a comfortable fitting .
 I bought these for my husband and although they looked nice and cozy they run very very small . I ordered him an 11 , which he usually wears in a slipper , to allow room for heavy socks for winter , and they were so tight across the instep that he could n't stand to have them on . I sent them back . These are too expensive to not fit right .
 When you hover over the picture of the black slippers , it appears that they are suede . When you receive them , they are patent leather . Thankfully Amazon gave me a full refund when I sent them back .
 Inside edge broke down way too soon . I 'm now walking on the side leather instead of the rubber pad on the bottom . I was hoping to get alot more wear out of them .
 You ca n't even get sheepskin from Australia , what kind of world are we living in . I am trying so hard to spend lots of money online ... at Amazon . But everything is from china , and the reviews show quality is bad and prices full retail .
 I bought these for my Dad and he seems to enjoy them . It 's difficult to determine if he 's just saying that or if he really does though .
 I ordered this in size 9 which is the correct size for my husband and he could n't even put his foot all the way in . He would have needed an 11 but I gave up and returned it .
 If you enjoyed the UGGs of old , get ready to be disappointed . These slippers have `` UGG Australia '' written everywhere on the box , on the sole , on every available hang tag , sticker , etc. . The only place it matters is inside the shoe , and sure enough , `` Made in China '' . I can get Chinese-made fleecy slippers anywhere for cheap , hence the desire to find a better pair . Sometimes , you can get what you pay for . Or , as with these UGGs , you just get ripped off . The fleece is junk , the heel is low , the seams ... suffice to say , they suck.Keep looking , and shame on UGGs for the bait 'n switch . Too bad , used to be nice stuff.If you go ahead and ignore the lousy review -LRB- like I did -RRB- and order these , they run way small and you will have nasty little clumps of Chinese chem-fur stuck to your feet.Enjoy !!!
 I have been purchasing these slippers by UGG through Zappo 's for years and never had the problem I am having with these same slippers thru Shoe Buy and Amazon ... These are supposed to be a christmas gift for a friend and when it arrived I opened the box and found that the paper was all wrinkled , the card that identifies them as &#34; authentic &#34; Uggs was down in the bottom of the box and the slippers had the insert stays removed and not put back in properly . It was so obvious it was a return I immediately contacted the company , only to receive an instant reply that said I would be contacted within 72 hours ... four days later I sent another e-mail and was sent the same message . By now it is too late to return these slippers but not too late for them to send another pair in time for Christmas . I will never recommend this company to anyone . I finally got a reply today that said my return had been &#34; approved &#34; , whatever that means ! What it means to me is I am going to be giving a gift that has already been opened , tried on and returned . I am very upset !
 Boots are ok , I am very hard on boots . and the front of the sole is easily worn and will begin to peel off the boot with everyday use . not impressed with the size 13s i recently bought .
 The shoe is excellent , it looks good and would go with so many things . As always I ordered it in a 13M because I range between 12M and 13M , going with the latter when the toe is somewhat pointed . It was way too small . I put that aside.My friend who is a 10M ordered her 10M and it came , she was all excited , alas , alas ... . the shoe is way too short , it looks like she needs a 12M , ideally 11 1/2 . So what is the point of a good looking shoe if you do not indicate that it runs short . It is truly important to indicate that on your shoes . Very disappointed , first experience with a Moda being short , hope it is my last .

 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 These shoes are sized about 1 to 1.5 sizes smaller than what I generally wear . I 'm sure that they are great shoes , but if you cant get them on then really they are of no use . I returned them and they were out of stock ...
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 I loved these when I first got them . They were incredibly comfortable.But after 2 months of wear , the insoles were completely worn out . I emailed the Acorn company -LRB- could not find a phone number -RRB- to find out if I could get replacement insoles , but they have not responded to my email.So , I would rate their customer service 0 stars . For the price , I would have expected better durability and customer service .
 I have an ancient pair of Acorn slip-ons that I just can not throw out because they are my absolute favorite casual shoes . They are in great condition , for around the house and yard-just looking rather frayed on the fabric and beat up on the leather . I needed a new pair that I could wear in public . Thought I 'd try these as they most resemble my favorites , but they are really flimsy and will no way last as long as my old pair . Why , oh , why do you keep obsoleting really great models ??? I 'll keep watching for ones like this with nubuck and thicker soles . I 'm not bothering to buy , until I see the clogs that you made before , I do n't want to be disappointed by a favorite shoemaker !
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 I 'm stunned by reviews here saying that they 're comfortable.They are not.There 's ZERO arch support . Maybe if you have a flat , chunky foot like Fred Flintstone , they 'd feel OK.And the `` window '' to return them to the shady outfit was only one month !

 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...
 I have to wear multiple pairs of socks as to not get blisters on my heels and the tongue of the shoe is extremely stiff and painful against my tendons . Though , on the bright side , they do look good . These are a prime example that beauty is in fact pain .
 I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs -LRB- with socks -RRB- . I had to return them due to several issues
 Laces up awkward , poor traction on the fore foot area , and just a big `` still gangsta '' shout out to all his thugs back home . You should be ashamed Kevin .
 Every time I 've bought shoes with these rubber insert soles , they 've fallen apart at the rubber-leather joint in a few months . They 're terrible .
 It is waste of money and time . . please do n't go this type of things . . it is really looks bad and completely different from the original pictureswhich they posted there . . Thanks .

 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 These boots are HOT ! The look is great but they hurt my arch after only 15 minutes of wearing . Not just a little pain , but so much so , I have to take them off immediately . I gave the boots 2 stars because they look so great but If rating on comfort , the rating would be negative stars . I 've only worn them twice because of this . I 've had a couple of friends try them on and they ca n't wear them either .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 Reasonably priced boots . Purchased these boots to replace a pair of Tingley insulated rubber boots that I had used for at least 15 years . The leather uppers offer no support . The removable liner is nice but seems way too soft . Seems like it will be difficult to use these boots to work in .

 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .

 This a very basic black boot . I choose these because I was 5 months pregnant at the time and wanted something a bit stylish yet low to the ground to help me avoid trips or falls . If you are into a very basic , minimalist look , these boots are for you . If not , stick with stalletos -- always my first choice .

 First of all , it took longer to receive this order than ones I have placed before . It was shipped USPS . When previous purchases were shipped UPS , i received them quicker . When I received the boots they were not the quality I expected . They bunched around the ankles , and the leather was cheap looking . What aggravated me the most was when I returned them , $ 10.98 was deducted from the purchase amount , not the $ 6.00 they stated it would be . I am going to order from another site from now on . There are those that offer free return shipping . They will get my business from now on , not Amazon . ^ ^ ^ After explaining my grievance , a customer service representative refunded my return shipping cost and I am satisfied !

 I bought these shoes because they had really good reviews and I wanted some flat sling backs . But , when I got them I was disappointed because they made my feet look really -LRB- strangely -RRB- flat . -LRB- I mean I know they are flats , and I usually like that , but these shoes are REALLY flat -RRB- I do n't know if anyone else has had this problem , I just thought I should let people know so they do n't have to buy them and return them like I did .
 Appeared to be nice however after wearing once for about 6 hours both inserts are peeling out . Very poorly made and really not worth the money .
 These are the cutest shoes , but they are way too uncomfortable . The top of the shoe rubs up against my foot as I walk and left a brush burn . What is the point of making shoes so totally adorable and so unwearable ?
 Run do n't walk away from these shoes . Save your money and buy real leather or at least a better quality imitation leather . Purchased mine locally for half of amazons asking price and that was to much . Shoes feel comfortable but since I wore for only 10 minutes who knows . My issue is the fake leather which is a joke . It crinkles badly with 1st wear . Once marked up there is no undoing it . I really wanted to like these shoes since I got them cheap and loved the style . I do n't post many reviews unless I 'm extremely pleased or dissatisfied . I would recommend going to a store and checking these out before wasting your money .
 I purchased these shoes based on the great styling -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- and because they were on of the few offered in a 13W that I liked . I wore them daily in an office environment only . Most shoes I use for work last usually 2 + years and I replace them due to the soles becoming worn or losing shine , etc. . Within a month of wearing these , the very fake leather began peeling off of the toe . I should have known buying a non leather upper shoe would cause wear faster , but for the light duty I put them through , this was absurd . The elastic on either sides of the tongue began unraveling within a week after that . Within 2 months , the sole had completely separated from the rest of the shoe starting from the front and going back about 3 inches . Never before had I seen a pair of shoes disintegrate so quickly.After several emails to Deer Stags ' customer service went unanswered , I threw these shoes in the trash where they belong.I would not recommend these shoes to anyone .
 I was sold on the item by its design . The product could have been better with actual leather . Heck , even lower end leather would have been better than the ` pleather ' material used .
 Boots are comfortable but I was surprised to see today that a inch square chunk of the sole has broken loose . I only wear these at work as a retail store manager so they are not subjected to any extreme conditions . Very dissapointed .
 never or i say do n't buy this shoes , i gave it to my brother as a birthday gift and he wore it for a month and starts to break in pieces . i could rate it as negative if there will be negative rating . but thanks to amazon very good customer service . thanks !!! the best shopping online store !!!
 This boot was suppose to be waterproof , it leaked as soon as my husband started using it , we did return it and got a refund .

 Every time I 've bought shoes with these rubber insert soles , they 've fallen apart at the rubber-leather joint in a few months . They 're terrible .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 This boot only lasted me 2 months wearing them every other day . The zippers splits apart . It is not water proof and the air pocket on the bottom popped . Do n't waist your time or money .

 I wrote a bad review on the shoes and the seller of the shoes . I bought three pairs of the same style . I have other shoes , from this shoe maker and love the shoes I have . The three pairs I bought were cheaply made and very stiff leather . They were tight , heavy and uncomfortable . When I requested to return the shoes , the seller told me that I had to pay shipping.However , I contact the seller and explained the situation and the seller promptly sent me return labels .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 I bought a pair of these shoes but they shipped the wrong size and when I asked if I could exchange , the person , Steve at the company said I could . I send the shoes back and have left several messages/emails over a number of weeks but they have not responded back at all . So if you want to buy , then make sure it 's the correct size since some manufacturer 's sizes are a little off and you 'll have no chance of returning/exchanging .
 I bought these shoes and loved them , but they only sent me one of the two pair that I ordered . I have no way to contact this vender ... so basically ... I am out $ 19.99
 I was disappointed with this . When you look inside , the finishing is so bad that you would see pieces of the material hanging . As an adult , even a little stitch hurts and ca n't imagen all that extra material on those little feet . Rather pay more and get the Livie & Luca brand .

 After investing time and effort into finding a pair of cleats he would like , I order them instead of another pair he had chosen only to find out 2 days later that they were out of stock . I wish all vendors would learn to only post what you can actually deliver .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit . Very unhappy with return policy . Wondering if I 'll ever get my credit .
 These shoes do not last very long and they tend to size differently between the left and right shoe . In other words , the size tolerances for the shoes are unusually large which tends to indicate a below average quality shoe .

 I ordered these in green , and this is the first pair of Nine West shoes I might have to donate . They hurt the tops of my feet after walking for just a few minutes , and the bottoms are SLICK . I fell down some carpeted stairs at work in these , and I slipped in my driveway -LRB- which was not wet -RRB- . Unfortunately , I just ca n't work in shoes that slide all over .

 Without a doubt these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever put on . They are so stiff and the straps kill the top of my feet . They are definitely going back . Unfortunately Amazon does n't offer free return shipping like most other online shoe sellers .
 This shoe is poorly made . They look really nice when you get them , but when you wear them they rip apart . They also feel like you are walking on a stiff board . I do not recommend this shoe .
 I usually love shoes by MIA . I have several pair . But like the other review ... the inside tie strap is not really in the tie and does come off . I LOVE the style and they are comfy ... so I plan to take them to get repaired ... but know if you buy them , you will likely have to do the same before you wear them a 2nd time .
 I thought the shoes were adorable but one broke the first day I used them . Major bummer !!!
 I just received these in the mail and loved them and they were very comfortable . After one day of wearing them , the strap broke right at the thong . I would n't buy these , they 're poorly made .
 The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet . The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance . I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all .
 I 'm sure the boots are fine , but do n't buy from PapaShoe . They do n't ship the item and you will get the runaround when you contact them . I purchase alot of items from Amazon and have never had this much problem with one of their retailers . They should not be allowed to sell at Amazon.com .
 I had a set just like this . The glue that holds the sole/heel on failed . The 1 year warr is worthless . Rockey will not email you back or call you back . I wore my boots a total of 6 times over 10 months . Junk . Made in china junk . Save your hard earned money and get another brand .

 I ordered this product in a size 8 despite that , over the course of the past 8 years or so I have actually fit better in an 8.5 , regardless of the makes and types -LRB- e.g. dress shoe , boots , running shoes , etc -RRB- . In fact , I have another half boot product that is an 8.5 that fits like a glove and wears like a boot . This product however , fits like a sherman tank , despite that I ordered a smaller shoe size than what I normally take . They also wear more like galoshes and not boots .
 While the Earth Lazer is a lite weight shoe and free of animal materials it has poor arch support . There is virtually no lateral arch support and there is no heel cup support . The negitive heel causes to much stretch for the foot and ankle . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone . I think the Birkenstock brand has a great deal more arch support for the entire foot and ankle and keeps the foot in a neutural position .

 Based on previous experience , it 's a very good sandal.The pair I received , however , was mis-marked , i.e. , it was approximately1/2 inch longer than my existing Clarks sandal , also marked 7M . I wassorry to have to return the shoes , which had been tried on priorto shipping to me . The store should have known from that customer ` sreaction that the shoe was a larger size than marked .

 I bought these shoes because I am still in high school and did not have the money to buy a more expensive pair of shoes . I made the wrong choice about it . I should have just waited and bought more expensive shoes because these look nice but they are not comfortable at all . I sing in opera choruses so I am not dancing in them , but I am really glad that I do not have to . Do not waste your money on these shoes .
 i ordered these shoes in the size that i wear in all my shoes and have had this size for ages and they were so tight they were no where near the size i needed . and not only do they not reimburse shipping cost , they do not exchange items bought off of amazon , so i would have had to send them back at my own cost , while losing the $ 9 shipping i already paid , and then buy them again and pay the shipping cost again ! needless to say if you want these shoes buy them from their website , not amazon .
 First of all they were too small and I am having to buy a whole new pair , a different shoe altogether because I was not thrilled with these.They have a smooth rubber sole instead of the hard leather you normally find in character shoes.The upper material does not give very well which makes breaking them in next to impossible .
 After reading all of the reviews , I decided to order these shoes for my daughter . They DID NOT run small , so the size larger that I ordered was too big . Now I have to return them , and there is n't time to wait for a new pair before her show opens . Other than the size and inconvenience , they seem to be nice shoes . She did n't wear them , though .
 These shoes run about 1 full size too small . I ended up paying about twice as much for the pair I now have . I purchased them from a local dance shop in town . They are much more comfortable than these.When returning these , you have to pay the shipping both ways -LRB- when you originally purchased them and when you return them -RRB- . I was out just as much money in shipping fees , as it would have cost me to go ahead and purchase the more expensive , more comfortable shoes locally . I do n't recommend these .

 The shoe does what a shoe is supposed to do ; but strangely it does n't take a shoe shine real well . Good everyday CASUAL shoe - not a good dress shoe .

 THESE SHOES WERE THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SHOES I EVER PUT ON - I HAVE A HIGH ARCH BUT THESE HAVE SUCH A HIGH ARCH - THEY HURT ! I THINK THEY ARE DEFECTIVE !
 I bought these for aerobics class , but they did n't feel comfortable to me . They feel heavy too . I just wear to work now .
 I bought these because I needed another pair of running shoes , to rotate with my fave Nikes . Well , I should have stayed with the Nikes . Comfy at first then they chewed the back of my right heel . Bad shoes , Bad . I agree with the previous reviewer who stated these things might be defective . I wore them for a couple hours , took them off my feet and threw them directly into the trash . Ouch
 One of the LOWEST & CHEAPEST quality shoes I have EVER seen !!! Any positive feedback -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- must come from an employee or someone with VERY LOW standards ... DO NOT BUY !!! They WILL NOT last very long !!

 The area where the big toe has to fit its fabric height is to low that the big toe does not entry on the saldal
 These are not worth buying . They are flimsy and not at all like Birkenstocks which they seem to want to be .
 When I saw these sandals on line I thought they looked similar to the pricierBirkenstocks.They were however not as comfortable and the uppers cut into my feet . In this case it was not ` you get what you paid ' because a few days later I happened to be in Walmart and got a pair of similar sandals by Faded Glory and they are ` glorious ` they were also on sale for the bargain price of $ 5 !! . I had to go back and buy all the colors they had .
 This is the second pair of White Mountain Sandals I have purchased and my last ! While I love the look , style and comfort of the sandal , it does not hold up . I purchased these sandals specifically for a one week vacation . During this one week trip the bottom , inside of the shoe loosened and began bunching up under my foot . Once it loosens there is no way to keep the material flat under your foot again and it becomes very uncomfortable . The first pair I purchased also did this but I thought it was a fluke and I tried a second pair . Great price but poor quality !

 The wrong color was delivered , but the seller was very helpful in returning and refunding my money very quickly . I would have taken an exchange , but the color was not in stock . I would do buisness with them again in the future .
 While the Earth Lazer is a lite weight shoe and free of animal materials it has poor arch support . There is virtually no lateral arch support and there is no heel cup support . The negitive heel causes to much stretch for the foot and ankle . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone .

 This is a good looking shoe . But be aware that it 's not made of leather . My son wore it for a few days and his feet were always sweaty and started peeling very bad .
 I love Kenneth Cole , I like the design of this shoe . The color Navy may not suit everyone 's taste though . The worst thing about this shoe is that It 's sooo stiff and hard that it can hurt after sometime . I really wish that the more I wear it the more it gets easy on my feet . Hope so cause I like it .
 They are comfortable and look great but they are poorly constructed . I wore them no more than eight times at the beach . After the first five occasions the transparent plastic parts at the sides of both sandals felt appart . I had to use Crazy Glue to attach them again . i wored them again at the beach and then the upper part of both fell off . I had to glued them again . I just walk with them , I did 'n' t practice any extreme sport with them . Is funny , they are made in Brazil and did n't resist a little sand and water . I have a pair of Rafters Tsunami that I bought three years ago and they resist the beach and every day wearing . Better go for Rafters , or other brand , or even sandals from Sears or JC Penney , they are more durable .
 i ordered them for my wedding and I got pink ones from converse but i never got the green ones and they charged me for the return . not happy at all
 The Logo was on the inside of the Sneaker not the outside.It was defective . disappointed with Macy 's .
 These were a big disappointment.a -RRB- they look very tacky -LRB- pix on amazon just do n't give enough detail to have judged this prior to purchase -RRB- and poorly made . I felt like a female pimp wearing these garish shoes , yuck!b -RRB- they are not at all comfortable . The fit is very odd in that when not walking , it seems to be the right size i.e. in terms of where the toes fit in the shoe , heel etc. but when walking it seems to get loose in the back/heel area.c -RRB- the lining is hard and unyielding.Horrible shoes ! If I could give less than 1 star I would . I would not purchase this or any other shoes from this company b/c the quality and fit just are n't up to par.Before I could even wear them , and was just -LRB- gently BTW -RRB- unzipping it , a tear happened just like that , so I 'm not at all optimistic about how long these shoes are gon na last which is just as well since they suck anyway.I 'm not a curmudgeon , u can check out my other reviews , it 's just these bl ** dy shoes .
 The picture show like it could be comfortable . I was so disappointed it when I tried it on . It was so comfortble and so stiff that I could n't last more than few steps . I do n't need shoes that hurt , I have hundred of them already . Shoe companies need to test their shoes before they release it to the public . I would never trust Nine West without try on .
 These shoes are quite unique , but do n't look too classy in person . Perhaps in a size 6 they would be cute ...

 I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew .
 This came on time but a different color of what I ordered ! I do n`t recommend it !

 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 The shoes look and wear great . However , the leather is pretty weak . I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them . Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it . I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it . Obviously I do n't think this pair will last long at all .
 Feels VERY MUCH NARROWER than the Skechers that I wanted to replace -LRB- I wore them so often that they were just hanging together -RRB- . Maybe Skecher is using a different last now , but if your old medium width feels good order a wide .
 These shoes are tight and very difficult to wear all day . If you are buying these , buy them wide . I honestly regret buying them .
 These shoes were very pretty , however I had to return them because they were too tight . So if you order , order at least a half size up .
 This is a fine looking shoe , seemingly well designed from the picture . In fact , it is stiff , narrow , insubstantial , and uncomfrotable . There 's nothing much to the sole , including comfort .
 I am not happy with this product at all , the quality is not what you have in mind also its very very uncomfortable .
 I am horrified . I bought these in an 8W and I need a 7 or 7 1/2 B because these are too big . Honest , I only tried them on at home on the carpet and realized they did not fit . I sent them back to -LSB- ... -RSB- and asked for them to be exchanged for a smaller size . Instead , they sent the shoes back to me and said they can not accept the shoes because there are scuff marks and wrinkles . They do not fit , so I did not wear them anywhere for that very reason . I got a manager to talk to at their 800 number and all he could say , over and over , was , `` I 'm sorry ma'am . I ca n't override what the inspectors said . Perhaps I did n't explain myself well . There 's nothing I can do . I do n't have a picture of your shoes '' , and other robot-like sayings . I looked through their catalog and was interested in buying more of their comfortable shoes . I am going to write to Amazon , but even if this gets resolved eventually , I will never buy from the FootSmart again . It is not only unfair that they claim I did something to the shoes , but I have never had this problem with returning shoes in my life . It 's not worth the extra stress .
 These sneakers are too low in the heel and my foot comes in and out of them . They are lightweight , which I like in a sneaker . However , they just do n't fit my feet correctly . They might be fine for some people so you might want to give them a try . They just did n't work for me .

 I purchased these in a size 5 for my daughter because a -RRB- they were less than some of the other stride rite shoes and b -RRB- they were adorable . Well , these were just unwearable and I even had them fitted and checked in the stride rite store . The velcro was always coming undone , the shoes always falling off plus they were very stiff so she had difficulty walking in them . In the end , we always had to take the shoes off for her to run around in until I finally conceded and bought a pair of the $ 42 katy -LRB- I belive -RRB- shoes which are what you would expect from a stride rite shoe .
 I ordered this shoes.I love them they are just beutiful.But when my babyhad to used them , shoes where coming off out of her ankle , while she waswalking.She had bad time.Also they where tight.I do not recommendStride rite/Abigail shoes.Thank you , C.rrroemrs
 I was told that this was the fastest running shoe ever . But when I compared them to Nike 's models , they were clearly inferior.Overall -- slowest running shoe ever .
 My son loves the appearance of the shoe , but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description : - leather-Soft , calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper . I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising .
 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .
 I was so excited to get these shoes . I ordered the plain black and the red brocade . When they arrived , I could smell mothballs before I opened the package . The shoes themselves smelled hideous , but they were cute , so I tried wearing them anyway . No deal . I could n't get the smell to go away . I washed them in the machine , left them to dry outside , covered them in baking soda , drenched them in perfume all to no avail . I had to toss them . Hopefully it was an isolated incident , but it WAS 2 different colors . The shoes themselves were comfortable enough and cute , but I ca n't walk around with mothball toes .
 Well , I ordered this boot because the price makes it a fabulous bargain , and it looked good in the picture , but honestly , after trying it on , I ca n't think of a situation where I would wear it . It 's not waterproof , it 's not sturdy or heavy enough for cold weather wear ; snow and salt would probably ruin it in a hurry . The sole looks sturdy in the picture , but it feels very thin , and feels like you are walking barefoot . As far as looks , it 's very trendy and fashionable . If I rated it on looks alone , it would be 5 stars ! A couple more negatives
 Had to return these ... they are nice looking shoes and a great buy BUT you can not get your feet into them !!! They , like many shoes today , are NOT made for the average American foot ! If your feet are incredibly narrow , try these !
 Not A comfortable sneaker at all ! Looks like a wonam 's sneaker .

 These shoes have a high , hard heel and almost no cushioning . It feels like you are walking on two wooden wedges . They make the back of my legs and posterior hurt by the end of the day . They also seem about 1/2 size smaller than previous versions and are no longer waterproof . I have been wearing Rockports for over a decade , but I guess I will have to change brands now .

 I really wish I could give these shoes a better rating because I love the way they look -- and they 're extremely comfortable , they fit like a glove , but therein might lie the source of my trouble with them . The second time I wore these shoes -LRB- I had worn them for the very first time to work the day before -RRB- , I noticed that I could see the inside stitching on the top of the shoe -- stitching that was supposed to be concealed , and I quickly realized that the stitching on the top of my shoe had torn and the shoe was essentially unravelling . That stitching you see on top of the shoe is more than decorative , it 's what actually holds the shoe together . So I was faced with the choice of returning the shoe or trying to re-sew it . Fortunately I had caught the unraveling early enough and I was able to guide the stitch back through with a needle and thread and tie a knot large enough to prevent it from slipping back through . The next day the same thing happened to the other shoe , and i had to repair it too.So three weeks later , I 'm still wearing the shoes . The stitching has n't broken again , but I have to do a status check from time to time while I 'm wearing them to make sure it 's not unraveling -LRB- turns out the knot was n't large enough -RRB- . Bit of a hassle , but like I said , I really like the look of these shoes . Not to say that everyone else does . Reviews have n't been negative , but all I 've gotten so far is `` what 's the deal with the moccasins ? '' a couple of times . And I have to go through my spiel about how they are n't moccasins . Anyway , they get noticed , for whatever that 's worth.So back to the size issue -- maybe if these did n't literally fit like a glove they would n't strain the stitching as much . And they are very difficult to buckle , so after struggling to successfully buckle them the first time -LRB- it took about three minutes , no exaggeration -RRB- , I decided to keep them buckled and slip them on from then on . That may also be straining the stitching , but they slip on and off pretty easily .
 I received these shoes yesterday . They were packaged very well . The shoe look very nice . When I went to put it on it was very painful ! I usually have no problems with a 7M . This sandal was made for a narrow foot . I am returning the product . Very cute sandal otherwise !!!
 Perhaps it was just the pair I received , but the strap broke the second time I wore the shoes ! Definitely disappointed .

 I bought these in black , thought they looked fabulous on ! They were n't too comfortable , although I 've had MUCH worse . But , while walking on cobblestones , my foot turned slightly sideways , the sandal had no give whatsoever and the toe part broke . I had to throw them in the trash .
 I bought a pair that were clearly factory defects . I also got a pair from amazon that were copas with the soft ground studs and those were also defects and I had to return them.If you buy them from here , you will get a good price but it will be a gamble , because the defects may make them unusable.I eventually got a pair elsewhere and they are amazing shoes . They are noticeably ligher than tiempos and have great touch . They also feel very study . My only complaint would be the unnecessarily long laces , but I may have been lacing them not as intended .
 I purchased the Copa 's and upon first wear I was impressed with the outer feel of the boot but my feet responded horribly to the lack of support . I played 3-4 games in them and could barely walk for days after each game . Running around on these feels like running with a flat piece of wood strapped to your foot . They are WAY to narrow as well . The Predators and the F50 's are FAR superior to this boot even though I 've had both break within 6 months of purchasing ; I would easily purchase again over the Copa 's . I know these are supposed to be a throw back , something that is tried and true , but for me , the 1970 's technology in the foot support is horrendous.I played in them 3-4 times , and then gave them away .
 These shoes received some great reviews , and at first they lived up to the reviews of others . They are lightweight and the quality of the leather is excellent . The touch on the ball was quite good . If I had posted a review a couple of weeks after buying the Copas , I would have been raving about them.However , after three months of playing in them 3-5 times a week for an hour or two a day , they simply are n't holding up like other , less costly shoes I have owned.The cleats are wearing out quite quickly and one of the inside seems is coming apart.Comparing these shoes to my cheaper Adidas models shows some serious lack in durability.I love the shoes , but I ca n't afford to replace them as much as they would need .
 I bought a pair of these because I had a pair since high school that were well-made and have held up for the past 10 years or so . I was disappointed when I received them to see that the quality of the craftsmanship has greatly changed , in addition to the materials being used . The cleats seemed flimsy and light , particularly when I compared them to my old ones . Unfortunately , I sent them back . However , it 's worth noting that I recently purchased another pair of Adidas `` Predator '' cleats -LRB- for just $ 50 -RRB- and they seem to be of much higher quality . They require breaking-in , which the Copa Mundial did not , but it should be worth it if they hold up for awhile .

 Length :
 It was delivered at time . And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance ; however , it was n't . When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe , which is the reason why I bought it , the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance . Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons . Any way , the prodoct was n't the same value or quality of pumma 's shoes that I have bought in the past .

 First of all , the shoes received were not as pictured -- they were not low-top hikers , they were higher topped like boots . Then , they were too narrow . Did not come in anything but medium width .
 Never buy it ! I wasted 25 bucks for this stupid thing . Didnt even fit me . Dont get fooled by the picture in the web . Here 's my story.Payed $ 26 ... a $ 8 for shipping alone.I was eagerly waiting for this . Even the most local brands will send the shoes in a box . well , I got it in a dirty white cover ! with black marks all over it . And it comes with a 5 pound load of ads -LRB- now I know why the shipping cost was high ... -RRB- The lace and the spongy stuff in it is all in GREEN color . know what i mean ... anyone can spot your shoe even a mile away ... its so glaring GREEN!The lace allignment is all distorted . Does n't even look decent . I am right now looking at returning this thing.My advice ... DONT BUY IT !
 I have these boots and unfortunately have to agree with the majority of the reviews . I 'm not a fan of coming on here and trashing a product , but I felt like this was warranted . I got them cheap and was excited for what I expected to be a serviceable pair of hiking boots . I was very disappointed . I 've only worn them a few times , and each time they have left my feet aching horribly . The soles , as others have stated , are inexcusably thin . Mine have n't split or broken , but they leave the bottom of my feet hurting because of the lack of support . The entire boot is unstable . They are n't suitable for anything more than a leisurely stroll . Do n't purchase these expecting to do any serious hiking and not be in pain by the end of the day . Get a real pair of hiking shoes .
 I ordered these in brown on brown - the most hideous shade of green arrived . When I called the vendor , Fogdog said they no longer have the brown on brown - yet they are still listing them for sale on Amazon . DO NOT BE FOOLED - YOU WILL GET SOME UGLIFIED MIAMI VICE GREEN BOOTS !!! YUCK ! 5 days before Christmas and I have to go shopping again !
 Itasca is a junk brand . My son had a very similar model and from normal walking in less than a year the sole cracked allowing water to go through the heal . I can only imagine how hiking would destroy these in short order .
 Always seems like the area under heal fall aparts on these inexpensive hikers , these did the same thing.If you were to wear these hikers just for special occasions they are great , and very comfortable too , no beak-in needed.But do n't expect to get a lot of life out of them .
 I agree with others the boot is suitable for only light wear . Support is average to poor . And after 1 week the leather trim has started to crack and peeI . I put oil on it and this seems to have stopped the process . Other than that , I have no issue with color or style . And it was VERY inexpensive , 21 dollars and change , free shipping . The delivery and condition of shoes was fine . If you do get them because of the price , just be aware they 're only suitable for basically walking around town . And you 'll probably have to replace the insole with a better one , and treat the leather trim to prevent it from peeling/cracking .
 The shoes themselves ? Not bad . The very fact that I too were sent the green -LRB- ugly green -RRB- ones when I paid for the brown ones ? Bad . And it seems to be a problematic thing . Find these where you know you 'll get what you pay for .
 My normal size is 6.5 . These shoes were way too big - enough excess space in the toe box for two fingers width from the top of my toe . The shoes stated they were 6.5 , so , I had to send them back . I really liked the color , so I am still searching .

I got them cheap and was excited for what I expected to be a serviceable pair of hiking boots . I was very disappointed . I 've only worn them a few times , and each time they have left my feet aching horribly . The soles , as others have stated , are inexcusably thin . Mine have n't split or broken , but they leave the bottom of my feet hurting because of the lack of support . The entire boot is unstable . They are n't suitable for anything more than a leisurely stroll . Do n't purchase these expecting to do any serious hiking and not be in pain by the end of the day . Get a real pair of hiking shoes .
 I ordered these in brown on brown - the most hideous shade of green arrived . When I called the vendor , Fogdog said they no longer have the brown on brown - yet they are still listing them for sale on Amazon . DO NOT BE FOOLED - YOU WILL GET SOME UGLIFIED MIAMI VICE GREEN BOOTS !!! YUCK ! 5 days before Christmas and I have to go shopping again !
 Itasca is a junk brand . My son had a very similar model and from normal walking in less than a year the sole cracked allowing water to go through the heal . I can only imagine how hiking would destroy these in short order .
 Always seems like the area under heal fall aparts on these inexpensive hikers , these did the same thing.If you were to wear these hikers just for special occasions they are great , and very comfortable too , no beak-in needed.But do n't expect to get a lot of life out of them .
 I agree with others the boot is suitable for only light wear . Support is average to poor . And after 1 week the leather trim has started to crack and peeI . I put oil on it and this seems to have stopped the process . Other than that , I have no issue with color or style . And it was VERY inexpensive , 21 dollars and change , free shipping . The delivery and condition of shoes was fine . If you do get them because of the price , just be aware they 're only suitable for basically walking around town . And you 'll probably have to replace the insole with a better one , and treat the leather trim to prevent it from peeling/cracking .
 The shoes themselves ? Not bad . The very fact that I too were sent the green -LRB- ugly green -RRB- ones when I paid for the brown ones ? Bad . And it seems to be a problematic thing . Find these where you know you 'll get what you pay for .
 I bought a pair of these because I had a pair since high school that were well-made and have held up for the past 10 years or so . I was disappointed when I received them to see that the quality of the craftsmanship has greatly changed , in addition to the materials being used . The cleats seemed flimsy and light , particularly when I compared them to my old ones . Unfortunately , I sent them back . However , it 's worth noting that I recently purchased another pair of Adidas `` Predator '' cleats -LRB- for just $ 50 -RRB- and they seem to be of much higher quality . They require breaking-in , which the Copa Mundial did not , but it should be worth it if they hold up for awhile .
 These shoes received some great reviews , and at first they lived up to the reviews of others . They are lightweight and the quality of the leather is excellent . The touch on the ball was quite good . If I had posted a review a couple of weeks after buying the Copas , I would have been raving about them.However , after three months of playing in them 3-5 times a week for an hour or two a day , they simply are n't holding up like other , less costly shoes I have owned.The cleats are wearing out quite quickly and one of the inside seems is coming apart.Comparing these shoes to my cheaper Adidas models shows some serious lack in durability.I love the shoes , but I ca n't afford to replace them as much as they would need .
 I bought a pair that were clearly factory defects . I also got a pair from amazon that were copas with the soft ground studs and those were also defects and I had to return them.If you buy them from here , you will get a good price but it will be a gamble , because the defects may make them unusable.I eventually got a pair elsewhere and they are amazing shoes . They are noticeably ligher than tiempos and have great touch . They also feel very study . My only complaint would be the unnecessarily long laces , but I may have been lacing them not as intended .
 I purchased the Copa 's and upon first wear I was impressed with the outer feel of the boot but my feet responded horribly to the lack of support . I played 3-4 games in them and could barely walk for days after each game . Running around on these feels like running with a flat piece of wood strapped to your foot . They are WAY to narrow as well . The Predators and the F50 's are FAR superior to this boot even though I 've had both break within 6 months of purchasing ; I would easily purchase again over the Copa 's . I know these are supposed to be a throw back , something that is tried and true , but for me , the 1970 's technology in the foot support is horrendous.I played in them 3-4 times , and then gave them away .

 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 First of all , the shoes received were not as pictured -- they were not low-top hikers , they were higher topped like boots . Then , they were too narrow . Did not come in anything but medium width .
 Never buy it ! I wasted 25 bucks for this stupid thing . Didnt even fit me . Dont get fooled by the picture in the web . Here 's my story.Payed $ 26 ... a $ 8 for shipping alone.I was eagerly waiting for this . Even the most local brands will send the shoes in a box . well , I got it in a dirty white cover ! with black marks all over it . And it comes with a 5 pound load of ads -LRB- now I know why the shipping cost was high ... -RRB- The lace and the spongy stuff in it is all in GREEN color . know what i mean ... anyone can spot your shoe even a mile away ... its so glaring GREEN!The lace allignment is all distorted . Does n't even look decent . I am right now looking at returning this thing.My advice ... DONT BUY IT !
 I have these boots and unfortunately have to agree with the majority of the reviews . I 'm not a fan of coming on here and trashing a product , but I felt like this was warranted . I got them cheap and was excited for what I expected to be a serviceable pair of hiking boots . I was very disappointed . I 've only worn them a few times , and each time they have left my feet aching horribly . The soles , as others have stated , are inexcusably thin . Mine have n't split or broken , but they leave the bottom of my feet hurting because of the lack of support . The entire boot is unstable . They are n't suitable for anything more than a leisurely stroll . Do n't purchase these expecting to do any serious hiking and not be in pain by the end of the day . Get a real pair of hiking shoes .
 I ordered these in brown on brown - the most hideous shade of green arrived . When I called the vendor , Fogdog said they no longer have the brown on brown - yet they are still listing them for sale on Amazon . DO NOT BE FOOLED - YOU WILL GET SOME UGLIFIED MIAMI VICE GREEN BOOTS !!! YUCK ! 5 days before Christmas and I have to go shopping again !
 Itasca is a junk brand . My son had a very similar model and from normal walking in less than a year the sole cracked allowing water to go through the heal . I can only imagine how hiking would destroy these in short order .
 Always seems like the area under heal fall aparts on these inexpensive hikers , these did the same thing.If you were to wear these hikers just for special occasions they are great , and very comfortable too , no beak-in needed.But do n't expect to get a lot of life out of them .
 I agree with others the boot is suitable for only light wear . Support is average to poor . And after 1 week the leather trim has started to crack and peeI . I put oil on it and this seems to have stopped the process . Other than that , I have no issue with color or style . And it was VERY inexpensive , 21 dollars and change , free shipping . The delivery and condition of shoes was fine . If you do get them because of the price , just be aware they 're only suitable for basically walking around town . And you 'll probably have to replace the insole with a better one , and treat the leather trim to prevent it from peeling/cracking .

There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I 'll start out with the statement that this is a good shoe . It fits well and the build quality is fine . It 's comfortable and the shape is great.The major problem I have with the shoe is that there is quite a bit of a very , uh , bright bronze on the toe and side `` stripe '' and lace area of the shoe . The pictures at Amazon.com do not come close to representing it correctly . My sister had ballet slippers that looked just like these areas . It 's as bright as a new penny . More copper than bronze . I took a dremel tool with a buffing wheel and got this paint off . I would n't recommend anybody else try it . It took a long time -LRB- I did it while watching a game on TV -RRB- , but it at least makes the shoe wearable.Be very aware that the toe , side stripe , and laces area are all a very bright copper .
 The sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use . I wo n't recommend it to anyone .
 for $ 30 , i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoes
 I was hesitant about buying running shoes w/o trying them on first or getting fitted , but these were true to size and oh so comfortable . You really can feel the difference . Their return policy -LRB- 60 days , used -RRB- also reassured me that if they did not work out , I was n't stuck with them . * UPDATE * I 've had the shoes for a few months now -LRB- well passed the 60 day return period -RRB- and the rubber at the bottom is starting to become unglued -LRB- towards the sides of the shoes -RRB- . I most definitely do n't run everyday so this is quite disappointing to see happen already . Substracting some stars ...
 Well , the first thing that sucked about these shoes were that they came in and felt way too small . I am a size 9 , and I honestly could not believe what I got was a size 9 . My toes felt so cramped . I could n't wear these shoes all night , they were far too uncomfortable . Also , the way they wrapped them made the part that goes up your leg look weird and warped . They did look good , I 'll give them that , but the pain was n't worth it . The arch on them is so extreme and the material so slippery , that your feet push forward , causing your toes to spill out the front . I think that 's what made them feel they were too small . They just are n't made well at all . They 're made to look good , and comfort was n't taken into account here . So , if you can deal with a lot of pain , get em . If you 're like me and you 'd rather be able to wear them all night without crying , then get a pair of flat roman sandals if this is for a greek or roman costume . Believe me , they feel so much better !!
 With as many people raving about this sandal , I was excited to buy these . Initially , VERY comfortable . However , sole is quite hard - there is n't much cushion for foot at all . After 1 week , the sandal caused extreme heel pain . I have since been dismayed
 I tried them on at a shoe store and they were not comfortable enough to warrant the price . Expected more comfort for the price .
 These things are about the most uncomfortable thing I have ever put om my feet . For the cost of therse things you can buy 2 pairs of Dockers .
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .

 Have worn these shoes for year . Am only sorry that they do n't come in wide and are no longer in stores .

 The shoes are nice and good quality but the size is not at all as it suppose to be 7.5 ! If one insist to buy them u 've to order 2 sizes less ! Unfortunately am going to return them .
 I loved the look of these shoes , they were super comfortable and cute ... until they fell apart ! I have n't even had them for a week , the weaving has come undone in three spots and the sole is coming off of one of them . I 'm disgusted that I spent $ 80 on these . I bought a similar pair from Bass 2 years ago for less money and they 're still in perfect condition after a lot of use . I have n't worn these a lot and I do n't beat them up when I do wear them . Do n't buy these shoes , they 're not even worth 10 bucks , spend your money elsewhere .
 I have 4 pairs of trotters shoes all 8 1/2 . I could not even get my heel into the left shoe . Now I have to waste time and money to send back and get a new pair . I also ordered wider ... I think Trotter shoes in general have been running smaller than a few years ago .
 I have 3 pair of these shoes and love them . I have a very narrow heel and do not have a problem with my heel coming out of the Liz shoe . I was looking for a grey/pewter color shoe , so was excited to see it was available in this style . I was extremely disappointed when I received it . The color of the shoe looks gold , not remotely pewter . I hope Trotter 's will make a grey shoe in the future . I am returning this pair .
 I have ordered Trotters shoes directly from the manufacturer , and this was the first time I ordered this shoe from Amazon . The price was cheaper , but the shoe is disappointing and I 'm wondering if indeed it is a true Trotter shoe . The leather is not soft , and the shoe makes noise when I walk . I will not buy Trotters through Amazon again .
 bought these for work . cant really even wear them to work because they are so uncomfortable . I cant get too mad because I 'm the one who didnt realize they were ` narrows ' . make sure you dont buy narrows -LRB- N -RRB- if you dont have narrow feet !! but the worst part is i literally wore them around the HOUSE once and the soles already looked worn ! So pretty much I was stuck with them . Also the natural color is awful . I will certainly have to try to put some darker polish on them or something . The old brown ones I have look so much more classy . These just look weird . Should have sent them back when I saw the color but had to try to ` make it work ' ... ugh , big mistake . Now I 'm out of 50 $ and STILL dont have work shoes ! lol
 I can not lie . . I was rather disappointed in this order.First of all I get the shoes on time which was awesome . . but when I opened the shipping box . . I found this old shop worn box that looked like it had been in a store since the 70 's ... the leather on the shoes were scratched on the back . . and they smelled funny !! I wanted to return them asap but my daughter being the diligent little housekeeper she is . . threw the box away !!! I have always been pleased with my purchases from Amamzon . . but this order was not one of them ... wont deter me from ordering again but `` just saying '' . .
 Despite the fact that the shoes were labeled `` wide '' , they were extremely tight at the toes . I had to send them back .
 This shoe is extremely tight in the toe area . Had to return them . I wo n't buy this type of shoe again .
 I liked the styling of the shoe but it said that they were leather and they werent so I was very disappointed
 The good - well price $ 19 -LRB- ivory color -RRB- for a leather shoes that have a light color insoles in each and every color of that model is always a plus -LRB- wo n't color your feet -RRB- . The bad - well they do run narrow . Also the side of the shoe seems to run a bit high and did hurt bone on my ankle plus these are very stiff!Knowing that leather shoes do have ability to get bigger with time , these seem to be rather firm -LRB- double layer of leather - first woven , second inside -RRB- , so if you hope that you might walk them off , it might not be as easy as normally is with other shoes .
 Did n't get what I ordered . Instead of Liz loafer , I got black patent and they looked like clown shoes when I put them on . Way too big .

 These slippers were great for a few days then the soles lost all the cushioning and were matted down . Even after running them through the washer they were flat .
 the fabric boots are shiny velour and the buckle is faux diamonds . These boots were a little much for me ; I sent them back .
 I agree with J. Witzel , these boots were a little over the top for my taste . They look better in the picture . I 'm gon na send them back
 Adult one size fits all - not over a shoe size of 10 . I wear a 12 and these do not fit at all . I can manage to get them on but there is at least an inch of my shoe showing at the toe . The overall look and feel is decent .
 I paid $ 10.00 for the real moon boots over 10 years ago.I still wear them . They are perfect to slip on , for light outdoor work like shoveling snow and driving in the cold . I 've been looking for another pair , and the closest I 've gotten is a velcro moon boot by Itasca for $ 15.00 .
 I am sorry to say that these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned . I purchased two pair and ca n't wear either of them . They are extremely cute , but do n't let that fool you . Please understand that I am no stranger to wearing heels or trendy shoes . I rarely ever wear anything but heels and spend hours and hours on my feet . These hurt so bad that I actually had to go barefoot in public!Take my advice and stick to Enzo 's , they have never let me down ! Sadly enough , Steve Madden has lost the business of the biggest shoe addict on the planet . I will never buy another pair of Madden shoes .
 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .
 I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger . Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating .
 $ 63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game . 3N2 basically told me to get bent . I will stick with Tanel . Do n't waste your time or $ $ .
 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...
 I live in Florida and play mens softball . I have played the last 20 yrs . In the last 5yrs I went to turfs . I love those over cleats . First turfs I got from Zappos , and they were Adidas 's . They lasted a long long time.Played in clay , water , small puddles and they kept going . Finally gave out , and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon . Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I 'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust . Once it does the laces will be useless . So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I 'd rather have a heavier turf shoe . Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M
 The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe . The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless .
 These are the worst turf shoes you can buy . The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe . There 's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe -LRB- the black diamond-like shape -RRB- that pops off after about the 3rd time worn . When it pops off , the rest of the bottom comes apart . They are not molded into the bottom like say , Reebok or Mizuno . If you buy these shoes , make sure you have plenty of super glue .

 These shoes look so cheap on you , it 's just embarrassing . They make the foot look wide and flat in an ugly way . The foot also sweats as the material is something like thick oil-cloth . Bad shoes .

 These shoes would be very comfortable if they were sized correctly . They felt okay when I first put them on , but after walking about a mile , my toes curled up . It is usually easy to tell when a walking shoe is too small , but it was n't with these shoes until I walked for a while .
 I was probably in a state of a temporary insanity - I ended up ordering two of these
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !

 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !

 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I purchased an Adidas shoes from them and when I received it I found out It was too narrow , which the seller did not mention.Although the shoes cost $ 19.95 plus shipping -LRB- About $ 7 -RRB- , I discovered that to return the shoes would cost me another $ 7 . so between paying for shipping and handling both ways , I lost $ 14 -LRB- 75 % of the purchase price.Unbelivable
 Great look , very comfortable , but big problems with the design and material used in this model . I purchased these shoes on August 23 , 2007 in time to take them with me on vacation to Italy . I did a fair amount of walking through multiple cities and towns , probably more than two hours each day , always on pavement and in dry , mild weather . After the third day the metallic-style mesh on the side panels began to tear and unravel . After the fifth day the panels had multiple tears and stress lines were forming on the plastic cross-straps . After the seventh day a plastic cross-straps on one of the panels had parted , and others were cracked . The shoes were amazing in terms of comfort , ventilation -LRB- obviously -RRB- , and grip . However , I am sending them back to ECCO for evaluation of the disintegration .
 Our family LOVES ECCO shoes , but this is not a good shoe . Bought a pair for my husband who has problems with his arches and requires shoes that support his feet . ECCOs are the best fit for him . He wore them to work , which consists of him sitting in front of a computer all day , so no wear and tear on them . Within two weeks the mesh was torn and coming apart . Called Amazon , they gladly sent a new pair and we sent the old ones back . Within a few weeks , the second pair was falling apart and had to be returned for a refund . Amazon was awesome to deal with and we had no problems at all , but now we are shopping for a new pair of shoes for my husband . Too bad because he said that they were really comfortable shoes , just like you expect from ECCO . But this shoe was poorly designed .
 I own many much pair of Clark 's shoes and this style is narrower than the average Clark shoes . The center decoration that holds the shoe upper together makes the show have less flexibility than normal Clarks . If your foot is slightlynarrorer than a medium width , this is the shoe for you .
 Pretty to look at but very uncomfortable on . Foot pulls off to side . Had a great experience with other Clarks but this was a waste of money .
 I ordered size 7.5 for myself , but did n't fit me at all . My mother in law wears size 6.5 and they fit her perfectly .
 I was totally disappointed when I tried these on , they look like prom shoes . The rhinestone buckle clinches it , the stlye is very high school trying to look older . On the bright side , the shoes are well made and true to size . I sent them back though .
 I bought these in gold after owning a different pair of nine west slingbacks . They were terrible and never stayed on my foot ! My toes went over the top , they flopped around in the back , and when they were on they were too painful to walk in .
 I have had these boots for about a year , at first I was wearing them for a couple hours at a time , mostly sitting in a classroom environment . Recently I have been wearing them for the hands on portion of the class and I have to say these boots are horrible . You may possibly get away with wearing them for 3 to 4 hours at the most . But , if any longer than that be prepared to buy some insoles -LRB- which is absurd to consider when paying 100 bucks for a shoe -RRB- . The actual insole in this boot is a joke . NO cushion at all . I 'm about 5 ' 3 115 pounds so I 'm pretty sure its not a weight thing nor have I ever had any issues with boots like this before . The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the outside of the boot and otherwise how the boot has held up is pretty well . No issues with the zippers like some people have mentioned or any kind of issues with the leather . This boot would be perfect if only they could figure out how to make it more comfortable for people who are actually working 12 hour shifts on their feet .
 I wear 10.5 and trying them on when they arrived today they are at least 1/2 to maybe 1 full size to small . I love the boot but trying to exchange for a larger size amazon is sold out of 11 and 11.5 so i guess i will be bootless for awhile longer .
 This boot is FAR inferior to thew other boots that 5.11 produces . I have owned several paires of 5.11 boots and have never had to think abouth what size I am ordering . I get the boots and put them on and they fit , NOT the case with these boots ! I got them out of the box the other day , put them on and imediatly had to take them off ! Not only were they nowhere near the 12 that I have worn for the past 3 years , but the construction of these boots was nothing like the other 5.11 boots . Nedles to say Amazon can keep this boot and I will be getting a pair of the ATAC Storm , or ATAC shield !
 Uncomfortable . Even though I got these on sale , I never wear them so the savings are irrelevant .
 These shoes were much too big . I always wear a 8.5 or a 9 in running shoes . These were more than a half size too big for me and I returned them .
 The part the makes to shoes `` cute '' is the interchangeable color slides that go on the sides of the shoe . I bought thoes for my 9 year old for cheerleading and had to order a womens 6 because they run small . The shoes are not leather and cheaply made . She has wore them 3 weeks and they are falling apart !!
 We could not use these shoes . The tongues on these shoes are too short and we had to force them on . They were even a 1/2 size larger than our grandson wore . It was a big disappointment and waste of money . Save your receit .
 These shoes are too narrow and small for the size I usually wear .
 I 've previously owned 2 pairs of Havaianas . Both were store bought . This time I decided to order the same product -LRB- color and size -RRB- from Amazon . These flip flops are flimsier and thinner than my old pairs . I wonder if the quality has been downgraded or if these are counterfeit ...
 Wanted to try these because my Reefs did n't last . These are not as comfortable . The plastic tube that goes between the toes is a skin chafer . Guess I 'm going back to the Reefs .
 THE COLOR IS NICE , BUT THE FLIP FLOP LOOK LIKE IS FOR WOMEN FEET , IS NOT FOR MEN FEET , IS TO NARROW , AND FOR THE SIZE 9 IS SMALL .
 I had two pairs of Havaianas in my life , and both lasted me for years -LRB- and probably thousands of miles ! -RRB- . After my last pair finally died , I decided bite the bullet and order some at amazon . What a mistake ! I do n't know if amazon is selling fakes , or if the brand has totally cheapened its line , but what I received was the equivalent of the ever-popular $ 3 flip-flops from Old Navy . Instead of the high-quality durable rubber I know from my previous Havaianas , the ones I received were cheap , flimsy , and foamy . They broke right away , because after a few steps the knob on the bottom of the sole that holds the toe straps slipped through the flimsy foam material . When I took a step into a small puddle , the foam just soaked up the water , which I then had to listen to getting squeezed out -- squish , squish -- as I kept walking like on a pair of soapy sponges strapped to my feet . You shell out the cash for Havaianas because you want serious , indestructible rubber soles , not for some waste product you can now buy at IKEA for $ 1 -LRB- no joke -RRB- . Do n't buy these is you want something that lasts . And even if you just want some single-use item to stick in the pail at your wedding so that high-heelers can give their feet a break , then do n't buy these either -- you get those much cheaper at Old Navy -LRB- or IKEA , for that matter -RRB- .
 I purchased real Havaiana sandals about a month ago and just recently purchased these because I left mine at a hotel resort in Mexico . I was excited because I had n't seen this color combination in stores and I should have known it is because it probably does n't exist in the real Havaiana collection . The left sandal is so fake that it ca n't even hold my foot in it . My heel goes to the right because the back of the flip flop is too thick . NOT REAL , save your money and go to nordstroms and just buy them for $ 18
 These shoes were not what I expected when received . Very disappointed ! My husband thought they were very cheap looking and not up to the usual standards for this brand !
 the part of the strap which connects to the sole keeps popping out . and these were the more expensive ones ! very disappointing for the price , I hate them , people
 The shoe might be a very good shoe , but if you are looking for something non-leather , this shoe is not that . The description makes it sound like it is non-leather , but that is misleading . For some this is a selling point , but as a vegetarian , it is not .
 I bought these shoes to wear for my nursing job , I thought they were very cute but no what I had thought . When I put them on they did n't fit , the sides of the shoe hits my lateral ankle bone and is uncomforable . So far I havent worn them due to that fact . I dont recommend them .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 i ordered them for my wedding and I got pink ones from converse but i never got the green ones and they charged me for the return . not happy at all
 The Logo was on the inside of the Sneaker not the outside.It was defective . disappointed with Macy 's .
 I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew .
 This came on time but a different color of what I ordered ! I do n`t recommend it !
 The metal is so thin and cheap on the stem that it broke on the second use ...
 Beware of shipping problems with this product . We ordered the shoes for our daughter , who was headed off to sleep-away camp with sore feet and needed them to manage the camp activities . We were promised they would arrive that Friday -LRB- paying extra for that -RRB- . The shoes did n't show up . The seller said they had been unable to contact the warehouse during the week , but promised that for an extra $ 20 we would get them `` for sure '' on that Saturday , the day before she was to leave for camp . The seller was polite and curteous on the phone , but still the shoes did n't arrive . The seller was also unable to give us a tracking number for the package and could n't reach the warehouse and thus could n't even tell us for sure that the shoes had been shipped . Now it 's late Saturday , the shoes are not here , our daughter will have no protection for her feet while at camp , and we are out $ 50 in shipping costs .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ?

 I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon , and was very disappointed and returned them . I normally wear size 10M from Adidas , as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs . Yet with these shoes , size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL , and quite painful . They were returned ... If you order them , make sure you get a larger/wider size !
 I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment ! The look and heel were ok , so does the GTX XCR . However , there is a major problem
 Do n't get me wrong these are nice high end shoes , however , I was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site . Nowhere on the products site was the -LRB- red -RRB- `` Outdoor Plein Air '' color shown as a choice .
 incorrect color was shown on the website . it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase .
 I have heard people talk about these flip-flops being comfy and since I norally wear flip flops all summer long - I thought I would love them for my Mexico vacation . They were not at all comfy and probably the least comfy pair I have . I would not recomend these rubber flip flops .
 I ordered these because I needed a casual white sandal and they had a little extra detail to them . They are n't very comfortable . The leather thong in the toe is too rigid and caused blisters . Also , they make my feet look very long and big . They run true to size .

 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 After only a single month of use the stitching came undone on both shoes ! One month later the sole split . They cost me $ 150 and it was a complete loss . I recommend Havana Joe or Rockport instead . Avoid Josef Seibel at all costs !!!!

 I am writing to warn women that if they wear Clarks Artisan Coreen Wedges , they should be very careful regarding the ankle strap . It velcros down with no room for adjustment of tightness around the ankle , meaning if the ankle strap is at all loose around the ankle , the foot is not stable in the shoe . I have these shoes in tan and in black , and even though they seem to be made very well , the ankle strap is dangerous . I twisted my ankle while wearing the shoe , and ended up with a severe break of two bones -LRB- fibula and tibia -RRB- in my ankle . I feel that the shoe was the cause of my twisting my ankle because the ankle strap can not be tightened . The velcro on the ankle strap has to fit exactly over the other side of the velcro on the shoe itself to close properly . If the ankle strap was adjustable , the shoe would be a great shoe . But beware ! I had to learn the hard way .
 Whoever designed this product never field tested it . The metal hangers that go over the door bend when you put too many pairs of shoes in it . We filled about 20 slots up with regular size shoes and the hangers bent so much that we could not close the door anymore .

 The shoe is pretty , but not very comfortable , and slides off your feet too easily and the heel is small so you really have to watch your balance .
 I had to donate this particular pair of flip flops after only wearing them for a couple of weeks because they 'd pinched my toes and were quite uncomfortable . Go for the Nike Comfort Thongs -LRB- for men and women -RRB- . They are the best sandal out there ! I wear them to work almost every day . You wo n't be disappointed in that particular model .
 THESE SHOES , ARE NOT WHAT THEY APPEAR TO LOOK LIKE , YOU NEED TO HAVE WIDE FEET TO HAVE THEM ON , THEY LOOK STRANGE , AND THE LEATHER STRAP AROUND THE ANKLE IS CRAZY , IT IS NOT PUT OF TO THE SIDE LIKE IN THE PICTURES , THE GOLD METAL ENCLOSURE IS RIGHT IN THE FRONT OF YOUR ANKLE , FOR THE WORLD TO SEE . YOU CAN NEVER WEAR THESE WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN PANTS , SO YOU DO N'T SEE THE BUCKLE MISPLACED .
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...
 Probably my own fault ... I wanted something easily slipped on , and I maybe should have ordered up a size ... but these were definitely too small and narrow .
 I wanted an inexpensive shoe to alternate with just tennis shoes for casual wear . My boyfriend has some adidas and said they were nice.I suppose it is just this model of shoe , but they are very VERY rigid ... even the shoe tongue is awfully hard . It feels like it 's stabbing the top of my foot when I try to wear them . They are also highly INflexible ... my boyfriend says that they would probably be ok if I tried to break them in , but the discomfort is so great that I would n't want to try.I have them around still , but they never make it out of the closet anymore . Adidas makes other comfortable shoes , so I guess it 's just this particular one is a dud . Comfort is a huge deal to me , so I just ca n't deal with these .
 The shoe was too long and narrow for my foot . However , it was well designed . I had to send these back .
 I like velcro type shoes , but this was too tight when I use the velcro to close it and cause major itching on top of foot . It restricted air to top of foot and when I took feet out of them it cause red pressure/look on top of my feet -LRB- major itch -RRB- . These shoes are the first to make my feet itch at the top soooo badly . Do n't recommend these . I tried them out twice for walks and now I 'm stuck with these shoes . Going to buy some other shoe now .
 I ordered the same size -LRB- 10M -RRB- I 've worn at least 5 years . Shoes too narrow , especially in the toes . Really scrunched them up . Wo n't try another size , as I 'm afraid they will also not fit . Also , shoes not nearly as cute as in photo.I wear orthotics , so most slip-ons do n't work for me . Because of my arthritis , I 've been trying to switch to shoes with velcro straps , instead of ties . Very big disappointment . Now I have to deal with returning them , too .
 My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years . When she received her latest pair , it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed . These 61/2 d 's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds . The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long . Quality control very poor .
 Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several , however this particular model # 3902 runs large . Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size . My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes , only the sizing . Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct , they do !
 The sneakers arrived in great condition , packaged well , so I do n't fault the distributor at all . BUT , when I put the shoes on my feet , they were like boats . I still have an identical pair of Propet 's -LRB- same model # / size -RRB- and they fit but are worn out . Probably a quality control issue at the shoe factory .
 I bought these shoes at regular price , in my regular size , at another website . When they arrived , they were clearly too small , either cut skimpily or missized . The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened . I could n't even walk in them . I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand , in my regular size/width . No problem.Later , when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com , I ordered them again -LRB- the price was so low , how could I not ? -RRB- , this time a half size larger . STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe , a bit snug for the ball of my left foot , the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff , awkward , and clunky . At best , they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time . A flexible , supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that , IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size , anywhere .
 This sneaker was a big disappointment . Ordered wide and they hurt . Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great . I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie .
 HARD TO WEAR THEY DONT STAY ON MY FEET . SO NEEDLESS TO SAY FOR ME IT WAS WASTED MONEY . WALKING IN THEM IS IMPOSSIBLE
 This is a horrible sandal the raised bumps on the inside burned my feet and created indents in them after only a half hour of wearing them im sending them back they are awful .
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .

 Los zapatos llegaron en muy malas condiciones . Se podia apreciar con facilidad que los zapatos estaban usados .
 I want to return that item because I received a wrong size . Since now i did n't have a chance to contact to the seller , I hope someone can help me to change this item with the right size that I ordered . By the way I ordered size 11 and got something like size 9 .
 NO PUEDO EMITIR OPINION ALGUNAPORQUE ESTA MERCANCIA NUNCA ME LLEGO , QUISIERA QUE SI LA LLEGARA A COMPRARALGUN DIA ME LA ENVIARAN POR UPS O FEDEX YQUE CUANDO LLEGUE A VENEZUELA SECONECTE AQUI CON DOMESA , ZOOM O MRW.GRACIAS
 I love the look of this sandal and soooo wanted it to work out , but they seem to run a bit on the thin side and I do n't have a wide foot . If you have really thin feet , these would be great for you ! These sandals really are very , very pretty ! I was disappointed to have to return them .

 I 've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe . However , in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday -LRB- blue with red and silver -RRB- is synthetic . Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price , you receive a leather shoe ! You are not `` saving $ 50 '' if it 's synthetic .
 I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper , which is why I bought it . I see now that the description has been corrected , but too late for me.also , the sizing does not run true as the current description states . I usually wear 9.5 , but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes .
 For what should be quality shoes , I am swearing off Bostonian for good . Cheap leather , smell bad , very stiff , hard plastic rubber soles . BAD .
 I was a Huge fan of the Bostonian of years gone by . Ordered the Capi in both black and brown , due to the great looks , and great reviews . Was so excited to receive them.What a disappointment ! The leather feels cheap , and very thin . I wore them in my living room for 5 minutes , and with each bend of my foot during each step , the leather began to crease heavily . This is ok , as long as the leather then returns back to original shape , but this is not the case . When I took the shoes off , the creases were still there , resembling a shoe that had been worn for months . . The leather seems very inferior to be used on Bostonian shoes . Returned both pair back to Amazon .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .

 I needed to check the slipper size chart in order to make a purchase . The size chart provided is for women 's apparel not the advertised slippers . This add left me with cold feet .
 I was given this product as a gift and was sorely disappointed in the quality after having washed them . The stuffing on the bottom of each slipper bunched up and I was unable to get it to flatten out , even after wearing it a few times . The fact that the L and R -LRB- for identifying whether or not is a left or right footed slipper -RRB- on the underneath or bottom side of the slipper is not helpful once the bottom is dirty or darkened . I would n't buy this product , however I do prefer and purchase the terry ballerina slippers -- much better sole plus the chevrons on the side of each slipper for identifying right or left .
 The past couple pairs of isotoners I 've purchased have been too tight in the elastic on the heel . I think they are using a different type of elastic because this never happened previously . Needless to say , I wo n't be purchasing them again until I hear this has been remedied . The funny thing is that the last pair I bought , both slippers were too tight and with this one , just the right was too tight . I still have an old pair just like this and they fit fine .
 I have worn isotoner slippers forever ; these are not of the same quality as isotoners have historically been . Most disappointing is the fact that there is no &#34; left foot &#34; or &#34; right foot ; &#34; there are two , uni-foot slippers .
 I ordered three pair of identical slippers , two of which were incorrectly sized . I contacted the seller twice and never got a response . I filed a complaint with amazon and the situation was resolved within two weeks . This is the first time I 've run into problems with a seller and was pleased with amazon 's response to my dilemma . As for the seller , I 'll not do business with this seller again .
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 The shoes do not look as good in person , as they do online . I wear a size 8 , and these shoes seem to fit very strangely -LRB- they run very large -RRB- . Your foot slips forward , making the shoes look too big in the heel area . It 's cut in such a way that buying a smaller size would not help .
 There 's a bump right on the ball of my foot , and very little padding . I walk a lot at work and by the time I get home , my back hurts . I bought some insoles that made them a little better , but I think I 'll still end up buying a different pair . Preferably something not made by Rockport .
 I 've bought Rockport shoes for over 20 yrs ... specifically the MWT 12W in dark brown ... since my first pair , each successive pair has lacked in quality to a point where my most recent purchase was the last straw . My first pair , bought around 20 yrs ago , took several years to show wear and scuffs ; normal wear and tear in my opinion . However , with each subsequent purchase the newer pairs scuffed much easier , revealing a lack of sufficient dye and workmanship . After this forth , and most recent purchase , I decided to write this review . Paying $ 60-80 for a pair of shoes should yield something of better quality .
 I am always in search of comfortable walking shoes that I can also wear in the office . These looked like they may fit the bill . On arrival , they looked good - just like the photo . A bit more sneakery that I anticipated , but that was ok.I wore them to work that day and boy , they really hurt my feet . Mainly the toes on the outside and the ankle area . My activities included walking around a mall , driving , sitting at my desk , general walking around the office . By the time I got home I could barely walk . Very disappointing . Rockports are normally really good shoes and I have a pair that are pretty comfortable . Unfortunately , these did not do well for me at all.Black , Size 11 - M . There is a $ 6.95 restocking fee from the seller , but they agreed to take them back and refund all but that fee .
 Have used Rockport 's for years . They use to be top of the line for comfort , yet look dressy enough to wear in the office . Comfort , quality , and value ... but something changed . I bought a brown and black pair of this model . They are wearing faster than the older models and are NOT as comfortable . When you notice that you are wearing shoes that is usually a clue that something is not right . The old Rockports you could put on and walk in all day and never think about your shoes or your feet . Not so with this stiffer version . Sadly looks like when these wear out will have to try to find a more comfortable shoe .
 Within days , the sole at the toe started de-laminating . Gluing back together was a pain and left a residue that does not look so good . For the level of quality in the overall construction , I would price these at $ 39.99 . These are not made to last .
 These make a better race driving shoe than a walking shoe . Reason
 I own several styles of Rockport shoes but returned these since the toe box was very narrow . Went to a Rockport store and bought 2 pairs of a different style . I do n't know why the company would n't keep their sizing consistent amongst their various shoe styles .
 I have had these shoes for about a month now , and although the comfort has improved as they have been worn in , the insoles are still quite hard and uncomfortable . These shoes also cause _ horrible _ odor and sweat problems for me that I do not experience with _ any _ of my other shoes .
 Ordered men 's Chocolate Nubuck Classic World Tour hoping for same shoes I have purchased over last 15 years or more . When shoes arrived they were a lighter color than the Amazon image and did not feel as substantial as my latest old pair . Inner sole seemed thiner and entire shoe seemed stiffer and of less quality . Very disappointed . I will check stores to see if I can find a duplicate pair of the old standard and asked what has changed . Rarely disappointed with Amazon or Rockport but this is a definite exception . Returned them same day .
 I bought my last two pairs of these shoes from Amazon and they did n't last nearly as long as the others I had purchased form other suppliers -LRB- e.g. LL Bean -RRB- . I put 2 - 5 miles per day on these and they wear out in much less than a year while my others have lasted several years . The version sold on Amazon is not the top grade . The shoes are fine , but you might want to consider alternative suppliers if you put a lot of mileage on them .
 I have been a faithful purchaser of rocksport and more specifically the world tour model for as long as i can remember 15 + years . I purchased my last pair . It appears they must have changed the compound in the sole and or midsole and it is much stiffer . It reminds me of the days of old when leather soles were all that was available . The comfort factor has dropped way down and they no longer feel the same when wearing them . No bounce in your step . I switched to Dunham 8000 and they are much more comfortable . Shame on you rocksport . You had a great product but you should have paid closer attention to the details .
 These shoes only lasted me half as long as other Rockport shoes I have bought , so I went back to Amazon to find out why . I found out that Amazon Rockports are B - Grade with inperfections . Unfortunatly my inperfection was that the soles came apart .
 The shoe is light weight and fits well . Although it does n't have a good arch support , unless you add an orthotic insert . It may be good for those who HAVE to wear formal-looking shoes at work . I can wear semi-formals at work , so prefer the black colored Asics GT-2150 over these . The Asics 2100 series are a masterclass of a shoe , no other shoe can rival the quality , fit and comfort . Period .
 I received a `` Rockport Men 's World Tour Classic Walking Shoe , Sand '' from Amazon -LRB- sold by Shoe Station -RRB- today , paying about $ 96 . This shoe was made in Vietnam . I have been wearing Rockports for at least 16 years , buying 1 about every 2 years ; and they have all been perfect for me . I have found the Rockports most comfortable for my knees and feet , given that I have arthritis and diabetes . Not this one . After about 8-9 hours of wear and normal walking , I have terrible pain in my ankles and knees . The shoe pinches the outer edges of my feet and appear to be tilting inwards . Also , the appearance is quite tacky -LRB- plastic like -RRB- and different from the picture ... although that is not the real issue here . Comfort and durability are the main reasons why I have been buying Rockports all these years . So this was quite disappointing ; and I hope that this is an exception rather than a drop in Rockport standards .
 I 've worn Rockport for years hiking , working and leisure all with the same shoe and consistently had the shoes last well over a year , even after day to day use . The previous shoe style I would buy , a similar nubuck style , was discontinued . So , I gave this shoe a try expecting similar performance . That did n't happen . The World Tour shoe appears to be as well made as any other Rockport I 've owned but after one week of wearing the shoe , I 'm considering returning it to Amazon as defective . First , the inner soles are not uniform . The lack of uniformity was n't enough for me to send them back , so I worn them for about a week . These are n't walking shoes . These are cheap `` knock-off '' walking shoes . No other shoe or boot I own causes this amount of discomfort .
 I ordered these last Saturday and got them on Monday . Amazon Prime is great!I bought the shoes after reading so many favorable reviews . Most people say these are very comfortable shoes . I got the brown ones . The leather is real stiff . After wearing them for two consecutive days they still do not feel comfortable . They pinch the top of my feet , especially when I walk down the stairs . I will wear them for 2 more days to see if they will break in . Wonder if Amazon will take them back after that if things do n't work out .
 These are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned . Even if I put in my own insoles , I can feel the waffle-pattern on the soles come through and irritate the metatarsals . None of my other shoes -LRB- either with or without insoles/orthotics -RRB- have this problem . I am going to try a pair of harder orthotics -LRB- like SuperFeet -RRB- under the cushion insoles -LRB- to absorb the hard `` nubs '' I feel when I wear these -RRB- . To be fair , these shoes are very attractive and seem to be well assembled ; except for the discomfort factor . One of the laces came saturated in hot-melt glue , making it fray and break . I like the premium factory laces -LRB- which none of the shoe repairs or stores carry -RRB- , so I called Rockport customer service for replacement . They said it was not their problem and to return the shoes to Amazon for a replacement -LRB- for shoelaces ? -RRB- . After I insisted , they referred me to a Rockport accessories service . That person was enraged that they had not received a parts order from Rockport in over six weeks and told me that they never support customers directly . Such poor customer service from a major U.S. shoe manufacturer is unacceptable . I shall not buy Rockport shoes again , as they neither back their products nor support their customers .
 I remember 30 years ago when I was on my feet for hours on end . . I was turned on to Rockports by a friend who said they were the softest shoe around . I bought them and yes , they were.Now , I need them again . I went looking for Rockports . The reviews were wonderful ! I just wonder how many are rockport employees . I paid about 75 bucks for a shoe that could be had for 45 in most places ... But what the hey ! It will be comfortable ! WRONG ! Sure , they fit well . They are homely though . . and the legendary soft sole was gone , replaced with just your typical hard sole you find in most shoes ... Okay for 45 bucks but not acceptable at 75 . I am returning them.Looks , , geekyFit very goodComfort ... ordinary ... Value . not enough .
 I purchased this same pair last year , and they were very comfortable . The pair I just purchased is not made with the same material . The shoe is very stiff and the sole is rock hard , as compared to the same shoe I bought last year . It is a very bad shoe to buy ...
 Over 30 years of buying shoes of various brands this was my first ROCKPORT pair . The shoes are very comfortable , however within two weeks of wearing the shoes one of shoe the lace started fraying . Reason was that one of the eyelet was not set in properly and has a sharp edge that kept cutting on the shoe lace . My first pair ever with a defect and it was a ROCKPORT shoe.Rockport needs to implement their quality control if they want to keep the brand up . Thanks to AMAZON 's return policy . Defective one is out and new one without defect is in . AMAZON took care of shipping both ways . I happened to call ROCKPORT customer service about the defect and their response was , `` send the shoes with prepaid shipping and then the ROCKPORT will provide replacement shoes if the technician determine that the shoes may be considered defective . '' I had better expectation from ROCKPORT .
 I bought this for my working shoe which I have to stand for long hour . The build quality is nice and strong but It has a very hard sol . It makes my foot bruise after couple days , lucky I bought 1/2 size bigger so I can put extra cushion.I wo n't buy this type of Rockport next time .
 I had a pair of Rockports that looked almost identical to these shoes and they were VERY nice shoes . I just bought a pair of these online , and they are n't nearly as comfortable as the first pair I had . The padding around the sides seems thinner and the material seems rougher . They rub on the sides of my feet and hurt . I would not buy these if I had tried them on first . I think I 'll stick to going to the store from now on to buy shoes .
 These shoes are fantastic , I work on concrete and the shoe stands up very well , however , the eyelits on this particular pair are not allowing the strings to be pulled without damage to the lace itself . In the years that I plan on wearing these I will probably go through 10 or more pairs of strings ! This particular lace pulls apart when it becomes blemished !!! Amazon needs to send out extra shoe laces if this is the type of product it is selling -LRB- seconds ??? -RRB- .
 This was my first purchase of a Rockport shoe and I expected a lot more due to all of the glowing reviews of this model . I ordered a 12M and the shoes were the correct size , but the tongue on the left shoe dug into my ankle bone while walking -LRB- others have mentioned this issue as well -RRB- . I wore them an entire day at my office job to see if I could get over it , but a shoe should n't be this uncomfortable during break-in . The stock insoles feel thin and unsupportive as well . The support improved when I put in some aftermarket insoles from my old shoes , but they still chew on my ankle . The overall stitching , leather , and build quality look good but that does n't make up for discomfort . Some people have mentioned the World Tour 's sold by Amazon are Grade `` B '' shoes ... I 'll have to test that theory if I find a retail store that stocks them . Unfortunately I 've only seen the `` Eureka '' model in stores . Returning this set for a refund .
 Absolute junk . Rockport shoes are now a total joke . The cowhide leather and rubber has been replaced now with `` hide of soylent '' -LRB- or maybe dog -RRB- and plastic . This `` Shoe '' is not a shoe at all but rather cheap slipper material with cheap laces . Zoom in at where the very bottom of this shoe meets the upper `` Rubber '' sole . Notice all the glue residue on the sides of the sole ? Looks like a blind man made this shoe . Take a close look at the `` leather '' and compare it to the image in the link below . That 's where Rockport really sold us out . The material is so shabby , you 'll be lucky if it lasts 2 years . Even the threads look like they 've gone from nylon to fabric . If you contact Rockport 's customer service and ask them about this shoe and their new Vietnam supplier , you can just hear them fidget into their chair from shame.Rockport , how much did you save when you sold out your Customers for profit ? Did you think we would n't notice?Goto -LRB- walkingonacloud dot com -RRB- and you will see what a real World Tour Classic K71181 looks like . Unfortunately , walkingonacloud no longer carries the original shoe , they 're now stocking this same piece of junk . Their website just happens to have the original shoe image.Bye Bye Rockport , your shoes STINK !
 These shoes are great , so I have bought them for a number of years . This time , though ordering the same size as usual , they were at least a half size too big . Did Rockport change manufacturers or lasts ? I had to return the shoes thus spending approximately $ 20 on total mailing costs ... not happy about that .
 I have been using this type of Rockport shoes for years and I do not know what 's going on with this company . The shoes that I have got were too big but the size number on the shoes was the same as the previous two pairs that I have - what a mess ! Then , I returned the product and ordered a smaller number . I got it a few days ago but now the shoes are too small . Besides , the leather quality is not the same - previously the leather was much softer . That 's is the downside of buying shoes by the Internet - you can not try them and touch them - just the cumbersome send/return procedure .
 typical low-grade Chinese product . Did n't fit properly , smaller than the size ordered and was too narrow . Too expensive to boot .
 We needed a wide size and the 9M was what was sent . They did n't fit at all and we needed to send them back .
 Completely unsafe on any surface that 's not TOTALLY DRY . I 'm probably going to need shoulder surgery after taking a fall on a single drop of water on a marble floor . Then there 's the sole-separation issue . Pathetic for 90 dollars plus .
 For my surprise , If was for a gift , when the receiver opened the box we saw a pair of used shoes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Worst experience ever.Rockport Men 's World Tour Classic Walking Shoe , Black ,7.5 W US
 I have been wearing Rockport shoes almost exclusively for about the last 25 years . I have very hard feet to fit and Rockport are the onlydress-up shoes that do fit me . I bought a pair of Rockport shoes with this sole after wearing the Vibram brand but these rubber soles were so hard and unforgiving they `` killed '' my feet . I could not break them in and eventually returned them for a refund . It was unfortunate and disappointing as I liked the style .
 i agree with some of the reviews that this revision of the world tour classic makes it stiffer . why the changes rockport ?
 I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the Ecco Track II shoes , which are fairly expensive but fall apart very quickly . As a constant walker and an occasional hiker , I wanted shoes which were comfortable for long walks , which could stand up to the elements , and then look semi-decent in a casual setting.I got ta say these shoes do n't live up . They 're comfortable standing around , but for long walks I find the shoes have stronger support on the outside , giving me a tendency to want to walk knock-kneed . I 've never had any other shoes like that ... I thought I 'd acclimate to them , but I never have.Also , I got the dark brown , they are possibly the ugliest shoes ever created . I mean my expectations were n't high , but they really look terrible . Maybe it 's does n't help that my feet are long . The shoes look wide and formless and without any real lines , it just makes me look like I have big wide duck feet.Additionally , they 're sized larger than I 'm used to , perhaps I could have gone a size down . I 'd say , try these shoes on before ordering.That said , they do seem well-made . I 've owned mine for half a year and do n't really take any care of them , and they 're still in great condition .
 I have ordered all my Rockports online , simply because I knew my size and had tried them on in a shoe store in the past . Buying a new pair of shoes was a `` no brainer '' for me . Except this time . The shoes I ordered were an 11 extra wide , as in 4E size . I usually buy from Zappos directly but this time I chose Amazon instead , because I thought they were doind business together already . Not so . The shoes I received were marked as XW , which is how they are always marked when I buy them . This pair feels a lot narrower than XW . My toes are uncomfortable in this pair simply because I do n't believe they are extra wide . For me to return them woulde be a royal pain , so I shall live with what I have until I need a new pair Other than that I really enjoy shopping at Amazon .
 Same shoe bought 2 years ago for my husband and the fit was better than any shoe ever . This shoe rubbed the inner ankle area and was returned . Was surprised and disappointed .
 Unfortunately I can not give this shoe 5 stars . This is my first pair and granted they are comfortable however , in a little less than 7 months the outer sole on the left shoe has separated . Not sure if anyone else has had this problem but for a $ 90.00 shoe one would think this type of `` wardrobe malfunction '' would not occur .
 I 've been wearing Rockport walking shoes , and in particular the `` Worldtour '' shoe and similar Rockport types since 1987 . I have always been satisfied with their comfort and durability in the past . I spent a lot of time walking on both rough uneven ground and hard concrete surfaces -LRB- not much carpet in my line of work -RRB- . I did not purchase on-line so I was able to have the shoe fitted nicely at the store , purchased one pair each of the Worldtours in Black and Chocolate Nubuck in April of 2011 . I still have a pair of Worldtours from 2003 that are shabby looking at best , but comfortable , after one year the new shoes have little or no support , the sole is peeling away from the body of the shoe at the toe and the black ones are falling apart at the seams , mean while the old pair is little changed and are still comfortable.Something has happened to this company 's quality control and corporate ethos , I called customer service at Rockport and their representative was not any help and asked if I needed a shoe repair specialist in my area!Do yourself a favor and pass on these shoes if you really need some good footware .

 There 's a bump right on the ball of my foot , and very little padding . I walk a lot at work and by the time I get home , my back hurts . I bought some insoles that made them a little better , but I think I 'll still end up buying a different pair . Preferably something not made by Rockport .
 Same shoe bought 2 years ago for my husband and the fit was better than any shoe ever . This shoe rubbed the inner ankle area and was returned . Was surprised and disappointed .
 Within days , the sole at the toe started de-laminating . Gluing back together was a pain and left a residue that does not look so good . For the level of quality in the overall construction , I would price these at $ 39.99 . These are not made to last .
 These make a better race driving shoe than a walking shoe . Reason
 I own several styles of Rockport shoes but returned these since the toe box was very narrow . Went to a Rockport store and bought 2 pairs of a different style . I do n't know why the company would n't keep their sizing consistent amongst their various shoe styles .
 These shoes are great , so I have bought them for a number of years . This time , though ordering the same size as usual , they were at least a half size too big . Did Rockport change manufacturers or lasts ? I had to return the shoes thus spending approximately $ 20 on total mailing costs ... not happy about that .
 I have been using this type of Rockport shoes for years and I do not know what 's going on with this company . The shoes that I have got were too big but the size number on the shoes was the same as the previous two pairs that I have - what a mess ! Then , I returned the product and ordered a smaller number . I got it a few days ago but now the shoes are too small . Besides , the leather quality is not the same - previously the leather was much softer . That 's is the downside of buying shoes by the Internet - you can not try them and touch them - just the cumbersome send/return procedure .
 typical low-grade Chinese product . Did n't fit properly , smaller than the size ordered and was too narrow . Too expensive to boot .
 We needed a wide size and the 9M was what was sent . They did n't fit at all and we needed to send them back .
 Completely unsafe on any surface that 's not TOTALLY DRY . I 'm probably going to need shoulder surgery after taking a fall on a single drop of water on a marble floor . Then there 's the sole-separation issue . Pathetic for 90 dollars plus .
 For my surprise , If was for a gift , when the receiver opened the box we saw a pair of used shoes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Worst experience ever.Rockport Men 's World Tour Classic Walking Shoe , Black ,7.5 W US
 I have been wearing Rockport shoes almost exclusively for about the last 25 years . I have very hard feet to fit and Rockport are the onlydress-up shoes that do fit me . I bought a pair of Rockport shoes with this sole after wearing the Vibram brand but these rubber soles were so hard and unforgiving they `` killed '' my feet . I could not break them in and eventually returned them for a refund . It was unfortunate and disappointing as I liked the style .
 i agree with some of the reviews that this revision of the world tour classic makes it stiffer . why the changes rockport ?
 I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the Ecco Track II shoes , which are fairly expensive but fall apart very quickly . As a constant walker and an occasional hiker , I wanted shoes which were comfortable for long walks , which could stand up to the elements , and then look semi-decent in a casual setting.I got ta say these shoes do n't live up . They 're comfortable standing around , but for long walks I find the shoes have stronger support on the outside , giving me a tendency to want to walk knock-kneed . I 've never had any other shoes like that ... I thought I 'd acclimate to them , but I never have.Also , I got the dark brown , they are possibly the ugliest shoes ever created . I mean my expectations were n't high , but they really look terrible . Maybe it 's does n't help that my feet are long . The shoes look wide and formless and without any real lines , it just makes me look like I have big wide duck feet.Additionally , they 're sized larger than I 'm used to , perhaps I could have gone a size down . I 'd say , try these shoes on before ordering.That said , they do seem well-made . I 've owned mine for half a year and do n't really take any care of them , and they 're still in great condition .
 I have ordered all my Rockports online , simply because I knew my size and had tried them on in a shoe store in the past . Buying a new pair of shoes was a `` no brainer '' for me . Except this time . The shoes I ordered were an 11 extra wide , as in 4E size . I usually buy from Zappos directly but this time I chose Amazon instead , because I thought they were doind business together already . Not so . The shoes I received were marked as XW , which is how they are always marked when I buy them . This pair feels a lot narrower than XW . My toes are uncomfortable in this pair simply because I do n't believe they are extra wide . For me to return them woulde be a royal pain , so I shall live with what I have until I need a new pair Other than that I really enjoy shopping at Amazon .
 Ordered men 's Chocolate Nubuck Classic World Tour hoping for same shoes I have purchased over last 15 years or more . When shoes arrived they were a lighter color than the Amazon image and did not feel as substantial as my latest old pair . Inner sole seemed thiner and entire shoe seemed stiffer and of less quality . Very disappointed . I will check stores to see if I can find a duplicate pair of the old standard and asked what has changed . Rarely disappointed with Amazon or Rockport but this is a definite exception . Returned them same day .
 I bought my last two pairs of these shoes from Amazon and they did n't last nearly as long as the others I had purchased form other suppliers -LRB- e.g. LL Bean -RRB- . I put 2 - 5 miles per day on these and they wear out in much less than a year while my others have lasted several years . The version sold on Amazon is not the top grade . The shoes are fine , but you might want to consider alternative suppliers if you put a lot of mileage on them .
 I have been a faithful purchaser of rocksport and more specifically the world tour model for as long as i can remember 15 + years . I purchased my last pair . It appears they must have changed the compound in the sole and or midsole and it is much stiffer . It reminds me of the days of old when leather soles were all that was available . The comfort factor has dropped way down and they no longer feel the same when wearing them . No bounce in your step . I switched to Dunham 8000 and they are much more comfortable . Shame on you rocksport . You had a great product but you should have paid closer attention to the details .
 These shoes only lasted me half as long as other Rockport shoes I have bought , so I went back to Amazon to find out why . I found out that Amazon Rockports are B - Grade with inperfections . Unfortunatly my inperfection was that the soles came apart .
 Absolute junk . Rockport shoes are now a total joke . The cowhide leather and rubber has been replaced now with `` hide of soylent '' -LRB- or maybe dog -RRB- and plastic . This `` Shoe '' is not a shoe at all but rather cheap slipper material with cheap laces . Zoom in at where the very bottom of this shoe meets the upper `` Rubber '' sole . Notice all the glue residue on the sides of the sole ? Looks like a blind man made this shoe . Take a close look at the `` leather '' and compare it to the image in the link below . That 's where Rockport really sold us out . The material is so shabby , you 'll be lucky if it lasts 2 years . Even the threads look like they 've gone from nylon to fabric . If you contact Rockport 's customer service and ask them about this shoe and their new Vietnam supplier , you can just hear them fidget into their chair from shame.Rockport , how much did you save when you sold out your Customers for profit ? Did you think we would n't notice?Goto -LRB- walkingonacloud dot com -RRB- and you will see what a real World Tour Classic K71181 looks like . Unfortunately , walkingonacloud no longer carries the original shoe , they 're now stocking this same piece of junk . Their website just happens to have the original shoe image.Bye Bye Rockport , your shoes STINK !
 These shoes are fantastic , I work on concrete and the shoe stands up very well , however , the eyelits on this particular pair are not allowing the strings to be pulled without damage to the lace itself . In the years that I plan on wearing these I will probably go through 10 or more pairs of strings ! This particular lace pulls apart when it becomes blemished !!! Amazon needs to send out extra shoe laces if this is the type of product it is selling -LRB- seconds ??? -RRB- .
 This was my first purchase of a Rockport shoe and I expected a lot more due to all of the glowing reviews of this model . I ordered a 12M and the shoes were the correct size , but the tongue on the left shoe dug into my ankle bone while walking -LRB- others have mentioned this issue as well -RRB- . I wore them an entire day at my office job to see if I could get over it , but a shoe should n't be this uncomfortable during break-in . The stock insoles feel thin and unsupportive as well . The support improved when I put in some aftermarket insoles from my old shoes , but they still chew on my ankle . The overall stitching , leather , and build quality look good but that does n't make up for discomfort . Some people have mentioned the World Tour 's sold by Amazon are Grade `` B '' shoes ... I 'll have to test that theory if I find a retail store that stocks them . Unfortunately I 've only seen the `` Eureka '' model in stores . Returning this set for a refund .
 I bought this for my working shoe which I have to stand for long hour . The build quality is nice and strong but It has a very hard sol . It makes my foot bruise after couple days , lucky I bought 1/2 size bigger so I can put extra cushion.I wo n't buy this type of Rockport next time .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 This sneaker was a big disappointment . Ordered wide and they hurt . Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great . I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie .
 Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several , however this particular model # 3902 runs large . Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size . My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes , only the sizing . Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct , they do !
 The sneakers arrived in great condition , packaged well , so I do n't fault the distributor at all . BUT , when I put the shoes on my feet , they were like boats . I still have an identical pair of Propet 's -LRB- same model # / size -RRB- and they fit but are worn out . Probably a quality control issue at the shoe factory .
 I bought these shoes at regular price , in my regular size , at another website . When they arrived , they were clearly too small , either cut skimpily or missized . The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened . I could n't even walk in them . I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand , in my regular size/width . No problem.Later , when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com , I ordered them again -LRB- the price was so low , how could I not ? -RRB- , this time a half size larger . STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe , a bit snug for the ball of my left foot , the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff , awkward , and clunky . At best , they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time . A flexible , supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that , IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size , anywhere .
 My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years . When she received her latest pair , it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed . These 61/2 d 's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds . The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long . Quality control very poor .
 I like velcro type shoes , but this was too tight when I use the velcro to close it and cause major itching on top of foot . It restricted air to top of foot and when I took feet out of them it cause red pressure/look on top of my feet -LRB- major itch -RRB- . These shoes are the first to make my feet itch at the top soooo badly . Do n't recommend these . I tried them out twice for walks and now I 'm stuck with these shoes . Going to buy some other shoe now .
 I ordered the same size -LRB- 10M -RRB- I 've worn at least 5 years . Shoes too narrow , especially in the toes . Really scrunched them up . Wo n't try another size , as I 'm afraid they will also not fit . Also , shoes not nearly as cute as in photo.I wear orthotics , so most slip-ons do n't work for me . Because of my arthritis , I 've been trying to switch to shoes with velcro straps , instead of ties . Very big disappointment . Now I have to deal with returning them , too .

 The product is NOT as described ... no leather foot bed , size is fine , workmanship appears OK , unworn as of yet ... . the seller or Amazon needs to change product description ... if what i received is what they are Really selling . Disappointed !
 Our order for basic Reef Men 's Sandal was never fulfilled . We never received a status update , even after requesting one . This is NOT a reliable and professional seller/vendor .
 Within about a week , the leather began to delaminate from the sole . Now I have t deal with the amazon return policy . There are other similar reviews . Disappointing that reef des nt deal with this .
 Ordered these about a half size larger than normal based on the reviews seen on this site . The size delivered was correct , but the sandals are extremely narrow , especially since where the bands connect to the base is far in from the side . Also , the bar between the toes was very uncomfortable - but this may be because the overall fit was so poor . Returned , will look elsewhere .
 Really I disappear with this producto I bought a pair of sandals using my regular size of shoe but , this item is excesively narrow my feet dont enter in that
 The sandals were comfortable , but they did n't last long . I wore them for less than a week before the soles started to come apart .
 This is a terrible sandal . I purchased these to replace a pair of a Reef Smoothy 's , in a slightly different style , that lasted three years and were crazy comfortable . These however are uncomfortable , poorly designed and poorly made . Under the leather strap is a nylon strap which cut into my foot for the few days that I tried to wear these sandals last year . Then , when I took them out again this year , I discovered that the sole was separating . I 've always had good experiences with Reef products until this sandal . Ridiculous .

 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 BROWN LEATHER - COLOR - BEWARE !!! IT IS DARK AND UGLY.I bought this in Brown leather last month and got that shipped to Kuwait.The brown color that looks great in the website picture is TOTALLY UGLY AND UNIMAGINABLY DARK AND UNACCEPTABLE.I am not using the shoes at all.Not in a position either to Ship that back to the US and get a replacement becausethat costs me more than the price of the shoe.James
 So happy to see this style still available . My current pair is at least 10 years old and it 's time to order another pair . These shoes are amazing walking shoes and while I do n't wear mine a lot at home , I would n't be caught dead without them on a trip to a walking city such as NY or SF . I can walk 10 miles per day in these shoes and they 're as comfy as going barefoot . Highest recommendation!Update
 I am a fan of Clarks . Probably last 10 years I have n't worn any other shoes except Clarks.Couple of weeks ago I ordered two pairs of this shoe
 Just to get to the point , my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water . When it rains or snows , the leather gets soaked and in no time , my feet starts to feel wet . This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole . At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon . Distraught , I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle . But alas , after the first day of rain , my feet were soaked again . I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made . Do n't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis .
 My pair of Clarks arrived last week . When I took the shoes out of the box , I was n't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes -LRB- like I thought -RRB- or a cut-down version of a boot . I went back and looked at the picture on-line and , sure enough , I got what I ordered . This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe . With the four eyelets , this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit , plus it looks goofy . The leather , if it really is leather , looks fake . I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered . I also would never wear these shoes with jeans -LRB- if you do , wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek -RRB- . All in all , I give the product a 2 . I would send them back , but it 's not worth the bother . Instead , I 'll wear 'em when I work in the yard .
 These shoes seem to be well constructed , but they are not like the Clarks that I bought 20 years ago . I bought them about 3 months ago , and I wear them 3 or 4 days a week .1 -RRB- They 've lost most of the cushy feel that they had when they are new .2 -RRB- They have an unusual smell that reminds me of band-aids . I had originally thought that the odor would fade , but it has not . I can smell them all of the time , when they are within 6 feet of my person.If it were possible to return them at this point , I would .
 They are very average shoes . Please do n't buy them thinking they are better than any quality shoe on the market . Go to a Vasque dealer and get better shoes .
 The shoe overall was nice , I Like the design and it fits well . However it started tearing at the sides . did not get as much wear from it . I am really disapointed in clarks as I grow up wearing clarks and have to pray for it to damage .
 I did n't like the look of the shoe - it was more appealing in the website than seeing it live - guess , that what 's you get if you are web buyer .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 I think that they are a load of ! $ % @ ! They are over-priced and my child does n't even fit in them !! I HATE THOSE BOOTS !!
 I 'm guessing this latest pair is at least my 15th , and what junk they are . I 've only had them a couple of months , and they 're already falling apart . The insoles , which only span the rear half of the shoe , have separated from the rest of the shoe and will no longer stay put . They 've curled up like parchment . The leather uppers have completely lost their shape . My son bought a pair at roughly the same time as I bought these , and his have suffered the same fate -LRB- he 's only 15 , and he 's never had a pair before , so he 's got a pretty bad impression of Topsider 's at this point -RRB- . While I ca n't imagine it could be relevant , I 'll note my current pair are Sahara -LRB- as are my son 's -RRB- , while all my previous Topsider 's were Classic Brown . Unless the quality flaws are peculiar to the Sahara color , all I can say is that Topsider 's have really declined in quality . I 'm used to these things lasting for a year or more -LRB- i.e. , until the soles wear out ; the insoles and uppers have never been a problem -RRB- .
 I have worn Top-siders since the 70 's . They have always -LRB- up until now -RRB- been my favorite shoe.I do n't fault Sperry going to China like most shoe company 's , but there seamed to be no quality controls with there shoes now . A boat shoe should not bleed dye on your feet for months when they get wet . This is my first pair that the top stitching up by the laces pull out on both shoes . Now both soles have separated from the leather uppers . Sperry has lost a life long customer!Sperry Top-Sider Men 's Authentic Original 2 Eye Boat Shoe
 These shoes have leather laces and strech when wet.They are so shallow that they easily slip off when the wet laces stretch.They also are very slipery when walking on wet gel coat . I 'll use mine for boat shows only , they do look good .
 They must have changed the soles on them . They are incredibly slippery - and not just on wet surfaces . Wood floors , carpet and worst of all , boats . It 's like having ice skates on . Also wrote to manufacturer to let them know . Only response was that they 'd replace them . Oddly , I am not interested in owning more of these awful shoes . Find something else . These are not the Topsiders we all knew in the past.I even tried to scuff them up some so that they 'd be less of a hazard . Does n't really help . I am throwing them in the trash .
 I loved my old topsiders but I bought another pair recently and after a month the new ones look worse than the old pair . The stitching is frayed and torn around the ball of my foot . The sole is slick , it is like the rubber is dehydrayed . The soles are slick on wood , tile , and concrete and I do n't dare take this new pair near water . I am sorely disappointed in Sperry .
 like so many others , i have worn topsiders all my life ... ca n't tell you how many pair , and all were comfortable , dependable , and lasted . i have bought three pair in the last three years and they are all terrible . the quality in every dimension has worsened . the sides are shorter , weaker , less robust . but my current and frightening problem ? the soles are slippery . not so much in the wet , but on slick dry surfaces and even carpeting . they slide dangerously.i have no idea if this is related to offshore production or not , nor do i care . i just wish there were high quality boat shoes out there , just as sperry 's were before .
 I do n't understand the sizing . I need to order a 10.5 but do n't understand all the choices example : ! 10.5 2 AUS etc.What do all the letters and numbers mean after the shoe size
 I have a pair I bought in the spring . I 've worn them boating , on the dock , and on carpet and wood floors . They have n't been worn a lot , and the tops are fine.On the bottom they are absolutely as slick as glass.NOT worth the money is an understatement .
 I was really excited about these boots . Unfortunately , the third time I put them on , the pull tab ripped out on the right boot . I 'm very disappointed .
 These shoes are very cute but the circle on the top cuts into your foot - ouch . After wearing them for a couple hours I actually sent my back for a refund .
 I think that they are a load of ! $ % @ ! They are over-priced and my child does n't even fit in them !! I HATE THOSE BOOTS !!
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess

 I am diappointed with your service as I can not order thing direct to my address at Saudi Arabia , I have order this item to my friend in America and she will ship it to my address . please send me the way I can order thing directly to my address at Saudi Arabia.Muna Anani
 I bought these shoes at regular price , in my regular size , at another website . When they arrived , they were clearly too small , either cut skimpily or missized . The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened . I could n't even walk in them . I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand , in my regular size/width . No problem.Later , when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com , I ordered them again -LRB- the price was so low , how could I not ? -RRB- , this time a half size larger . STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe , a bit snug for the ball of my left foot , the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff , awkward , and clunky . At best , they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time . A flexible , supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that , IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size , anywhere .
 Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several , however this particular model # 3902 runs large . Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size . My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes , only the sizing . Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct , they do !
 The sneakers arrived in great condition , packaged well , so I do n't fault the distributor at all . BUT , when I put the shoes on my feet , they were like boats . I still have an identical pair of Propet 's -LRB- same model # / size -RRB- and they fit but are worn out . Probably a quality control issue at the shoe factory .
 This sneaker was a big disappointment . Ordered wide and they hurt . Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great . I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie .
 I ordered the same size -LRB- 10M -RRB- I 've worn at least 5 years . Shoes too narrow , especially in the toes . Really scrunched them up . Wo n't try another size , as I 'm afraid they will also not fit . Also , shoes not nearly as cute as in photo.I wear orthotics , so most slip-ons do n't work for me . Because of my arthritis , I 've been trying to switch to shoes with velcro straps , instead of ties . Very big disappointment . Now I have to deal with returning them , too .
 I like velcro type shoes , but this was too tight when I use the velcro to close it and cause major itching on top of foot . It restricted air to top of foot and when I took feet out of them it cause red pressure/look on top of my feet -LRB- major itch -RRB- . These shoes are the first to make my feet itch at the top soooo badly . Do n't recommend these . I tried them out twice for walks and now I 'm stuck with these shoes . Going to buy some other shoe now .
 My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years . When she received her latest pair , it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed . These 61/2 d 's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds . The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long . Quality control very poor .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 The tips are way too long , giving an extra 2 inches to my shoe size . It looks and feels awkward and was quickly returned .

 I did n't like the quality of these boots at all they were not made out of leather but what almost appears to be plastic or something of that nature . I expected allot better quality boots for what they claimed to have been worth.I saw boots for 15.00 at walmart as good as these .
 The moment they arrived I put them on and wore them around the house . 5 minutes later , the heel broke . Poor quality of shoe , but very cute . I 'm bummed because they are new and now I have to take them in and pay more to have them repaired . Booo . .

 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 BROWN LEATHER - COLOR - BEWARE !!! IT IS DARK AND UGLY.I bought this in Brown leather last month and got that shipped to Kuwait.The brown color that looks great in the website picture is TOTALLY UGLY AND UNIMAGINABLY DARK AND UNACCEPTABLE.I am not using the shoes at all.Not in a position either to Ship that back to the US and get a replacement becausethat costs me more than the price of the shoe.James
 So happy to see this style still available . My current pair is at least 10 years old and it 's time to order another pair . These shoes are amazing walking shoes and while I do n't wear mine a lot at home , I would n't be caught dead without them on a trip to a walking city such as NY or SF . I can walk 10 miles per day in these shoes and they 're as comfy as going barefoot . Highest recommendation!Update
 I am a fan of Clarks . Probably last 10 years I have n't worn any other shoes except Clarks.Couple of weeks ago I ordered two pairs of this shoe
 My pair of Clarks arrived last week . When I took the shoes out of the box , I was n't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes -LRB- like I thought -RRB- or a cut-down version of a boot . I went back and looked at the picture on-line and , sure enough , I got what I ordered . This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe . With the four eyelets , this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit , plus it looks goofy . The leather , if it really is leather , looks fake . I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered . I also would never wear these shoes with jeans -LRB- if you do , wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek -RRB- . All in all , I give the product a 2 . I would send them back , but it 's not worth the bother . Instead , I 'll wear 'em when I work in the yard .
 These shoes seem to be well constructed , but they are not like the Clarks that I bought 20 years ago . I bought them about 3 months ago , and I wear them 3 or 4 days a week .1 -RRB- They 've lost most of the cushy feel that they had when they are new .2 -RRB- They have an unusual smell that reminds me of band-aids . I had originally thought that the odor would fade , but it has not . I can smell them all of the time , when they are within 6 feet of my person.If it were possible to return them at this point , I would .
 Just to get to the point , my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water . When it rains or snows , the leather gets soaked and in no time , my feet starts to feel wet . This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole . At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon . Distraught , I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle . But alas , after the first day of rain , my feet were soaked again . I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made . Do n't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis .
 They are very average shoes . Please do n't buy them thinking they are better than any quality shoe on the market . Go to a Vasque dealer and get better shoes .
 The shoe overall was nice , I Like the design and it fits well . However it started tearing at the sides . did not get as much wear from it . I am really disapointed in clarks as I grow up wearing clarks and have to pray for it to damage .

 The best thing that can be said about these sandals is their price . Add in the shipping costs , however , which more than double the price , and it is no longer such a bargain . The sandals were shipped from Canada in an envelope and arrived with the uppers somewhat squished and misshapen . Sturdy bottoms , with massage nubs are adequate , but can be uncomfortable or off-putting against the soles of the foot for some . The main complaint is with the uppers , or the strip the goes over the foot . The inner portion that touches the foot is somewhat abrasive , especially at the point where it joins with bottom part . Sensitive or wide feet need to be cautious as this sandal rubs against the instep and side of foot . I have found similar - and more comfortable - sandals at local major retailers for the same or less money - with no shipping charges and an assured fit before purchase . These sandals are not the worst out there , neither are they the best , but the price is right -LRB- sans shipping -RRB- .

 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .

 i usually do n't take the time to write reviews , but in this case i had to make an exception because the shoe is so bad . kenneth cole has dropped to a new low with the `` Unlisted '' brand . the entire shoe feels as if it is made out of rubber . imagine your crocs or tevas covered with a brown plastic molded to look like a dress shoe . that is what you get with this purchase . i 'm sure at some price level this is a decent value , but for me it would be much closer to the $ 5 range rather than the $ 15 i paid . i 'm serious ; these shoes are that bad . shame on kenneth cole for such a mediocre product .
 Bought these same shoes six month ago for 35 $ and the inside is chipping away right around the toes . They gave good comfort up until this point .
 This was a great looking shoe for the price . Unfortunately , it fell apart after less than a year of steady use .
 These looked like cute shoes in the picture , but when they arrived , they were too wide , even wider than a regular medium .
 I have worn the Liberty Loafer for many years . These run wider than any others that I have -- in the same size . I will not order these again .
 I have worn the Enzo Liberty loafer as my primary shoe of choice for many years , and have owned at least 15 pair . I always knew I could depend on this shoe to fit my foot as if it were hand-made for me , and to be comfortable from day one . Unfortunately , the quality of this shoe seems to have deteriorated while the cost has steadily gone up . This pair is not the soft buttery leather I have grown accustomed to , but feels extremely stiff , does not conform to my foot , rubs my ankle and cuts into my instep . I will not be ordering these again , and am greatly disappointed .
 Ordered a size 8N in blue , received a 9N in black . What more can I say?The seller has no quality control .
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON -LRB- SHOEFLAKE -RRB- AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE . FORTUNATELY , I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO . HOWEVER , I AM OUT $ 60 + DOLLARS .
 Shoe appeared to be the wrong size.The shoe was a bigger size than what was stated , more like a factory reject .
 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 I wear a size 10.5 D . After reading other reviews here saying these shoes are &#34; true to size &#34; , I ordered a size 11 . I received them and they ar at least a full size too small . This is the last pair of house shoes I will try to buy on line . I know from trying them on in store that you just ca n't trust their sizing . I do n't know why that is , but i 's been the case ith Every pair I 've bought . I happened to be able to give this pair away or a Christmas present instead of having to return them . That said , I regret buying them ... wo n't try it agin .
 Comfortable slipper . Top construction is well made and put together but sole material wore out too quickly wearing the slipper around the house and outdoors on occasion to walk out to get the sunday newspaper . Would not purchase these slippers again .
 These shoes were MUCH smaller than the stated size . I wear a 13 and a half shoe , but knowing that house shoes need to be loose , I ordered them in a size 14 . They were SO small , I could n't force my feet into them . And if the seller -LRB- different than the manufacturer -RRB- really had a `` bend-over-backwards '' policy as they state , they would offer a fedex or UPS label so I could send them back for free . / This is exactly why I dislike buying cloths from the internet or by mail-order . But , it is getting harder and harder to find local stores that have the larger sizes -LRB- even big and tall stores -RRB- . I guess I 'm just screwed .
 I ordered these for my Dad for Christmas , but he was n't able to get his feet in them . They were very small .
 These were sold as mens size 11 , both my son and my husband wear a size 10 1/2 shoe , neither of them can wear these slippers . They are at lease 1-2 sizes too small . The shipping was slower than advertised as well . The slippers themselves are solid and warm with a sturdy sole you can wear outdoors without fear . The only problem is they are much smaller than the marked size .
 The slippers were ok except the opening is too small to get your foot into it without considerable effort . That made the slippers unusable for me .
 I tried on these slippers on precisely one time , then returned them to the box . They were n't horrible , just not real comfortable , and I got the feeling they would n't be particularly warm . But to be fair , I did n't wear them long enough to judge their thermal efficiency . I just did n't like the feel of them.For my money , better to pay a little more and get better quality .
 Good Quality ... But opening for foot way too small ... My huband couldn &#34; t get his foot in the slipper ... Other wise nice slipper shoe
 I ordered the recommended one size up . The toe box length and width is tight , but the back half of the slippers and sides are a bit loose . A full size increase to a 9M from the size , which I ordered -LRB- 8M -RRB- would be too large and the sides would definitely be too loose . As other reviewers noted , these slippers do loosen up and I hope that the toe box becomes more comfortable . The 3/4 '' rubber raised soles appears adequate . As I write this review , my feet are becoming quite warm , after about twenty minutes , with my athletic socks.After an hour , my feet are roasting in these slippers . Would I purchase again ? Difficult to say , if the toe box does n't loosen up for comfort .01 / 25/2012 UpdateI replaced this pair from DSW -LRB- Designer Shoe Warehouse -RRB- with two pairs , which fit . My feet were never comfortable with this pair . Would not recommend .
 cloth on bottom sole not good for hardwood floors , knobs on bottom of sole with cloth glued to them offers even less area for grip . doubt the knobs will be comfortable , but time will tell . solid build and warm for ankle and once fabric on sole wears out and offers some grip -LRB- what where they thinking ? -RRB- it might be comfortable but will definately be warm , if it doesnt make feet sweat ... -LRB- just got them so unknown , but looks like the dearforms inner fabric , sorta . -RRB- if not for the knobs and cloth on bottom , this could get a five .
 I threw them out ! the most cheaply made piece c. . p I ever had . Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
 Having read another review that said these slippers ran small , I ordered the next size up but it was too small . I returned them for the next size but they are out of the next size bigger . This is the only style slipper my husband likes and it is impossible to find them anywhere .
 Do n't order these unless you have tiny little feet . I ordered a size larger than my husband normally wears and he could n't even get them on . If you order them , you better try TWO sizes up than normal .
 normaly this would be my size.could barely get my foot in them . i think this was the only size available.looked well made but jusy wouldny fit . gave yhem to the needy .
 There is no lining inside the shoe and it rubs funny , I will have to wear socks with these which is not what I wanted to do . They are cute and comfortable and I would have rated them higher if it were n't for the socks thing .
 sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe . this case is a classic - you get what you pay for . cheap price for a CHEAP shoe .1 -RRB- this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe .2 -RRB- no arch support whatsoever . The rubber is almost too thick .3 -RRB- i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe . feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST . 3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute . this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned -LRB- this is my # 14 pair -RRB-
 I do n't think these Skechers are made out of leather , so I 'm very disappointed . I thought I was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer , but with such a low price it was `` too good to be true '' .
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes

He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .

 This is a terrible product ! I wore these shoes indoors only for less than a day . After less than 6 hours of wear , the material had begun to crack , and then it started to peel ! I do n't know what these are made of , but it 's certainly not leather . They went back to Amazon that same day .
 I really thought these shoes were so darling but they are not very comfortable . The feel like they are not on my foot all of the way and as a result I have to walk stiffly to keep them on . I think that I may send them back since I have only worn them once .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .

 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape . Because the sole is cracked , the boots are worthless . Save your money and look for a different brand boot .

 I really respect the fact that Donald J Pliner is dedicated to making comfortable shoes . However , if comfortable shoes look like this I 'll just take the sore feet ! Some of the shoes in this brand are cute , fun and sexy as well as comfortable but this is NOT one of those examples ! Reminds me of a witch shoe or something my grandma would wear ! This pointy toe thing just needs to go away ! I do n't understand what is so appealing about having your toes crunched into a cone shape and having your feet look bigger ! These do n't look comfortable , they do n't look feminine or attractive and they cost a lot of money . Oh well , I guess everyone has their own taste ! Thanks again to amazon for posting accurate photos .

 I had my reservations about purchasing this tool due to the description being a little off base ... as if it was describing an electric shaver . It does not require the two AA batteries , rather , it has a rechargable power pack inside . It does not have surgical steel blades that easily cut hair . It does work okay , just okay , but for $ 14.00 I guess that 's about how good it works . Built inexpensively and priced accordingly . If you want okay , this will fill the order .
 It does not have a powerful enough motor needed to really polish -LRB- shine -RRB- my shoes.I had an old one that was at least twice as powerful but it was over 20 years old & just wore out .
 This is a horrible product . It does n't have the strength to rotate the brush while it 's touching a shoe . Do not buy this !
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess

 Overall construction is good however the side top edge does not have a cushion for the ankle bone . This caused an abrasion under the ankle . Product was returned and credit was issue in a satisfactory manner .

 BROWN LEATHER - COLOR - BEWARE !!! IT IS DARK AND UGLY.I bought this in Brown leather last month and got that shipped to Kuwait.The brown color that looks great in the website picture is TOTALLY UGLY AND UNIMAGINABLY DARK AND UNACCEPTABLE.I am not using the shoes at all.Not in a position either to Ship that back to the US and get a replacement becausethat costs me more than the price of the shoe.James
 So happy to see this style still available . My current pair is at least 10 years old and it 's time to order another pair . These shoes are amazing walking shoes and while I do n't wear mine a lot at home , I would n't be caught dead without them on a trip to a walking city such as NY or SF . I can walk 10 miles per day in these shoes and they 're as comfy as going barefoot . Highest recommendation!Update
 I am a fan of Clarks . Probably last 10 years I have n't worn any other shoes except Clarks.Couple of weeks ago I ordered two pairs of this shoe
 Just to get to the point , my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water . When it rains or snows , the leather gets soaked and in no time , my feet starts to feel wet . This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole . At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon . Distraught , I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle . But alas , after the first day of rain , my feet were soaked again . I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made . Do n't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis .
 My pair of Clarks arrived last week . When I took the shoes out of the box , I was n't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes -LRB- like I thought -RRB- or a cut-down version of a boot . I went back and looked at the picture on-line and , sure enough , I got what I ordered . This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe . With the four eyelets , this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit , plus it looks goofy . The leather , if it really is leather , looks fake . I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered . I also would never wear these shoes with jeans -LRB- if you do , wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek -RRB- . All in all , I give the product a 2 . I would send them back , but it 's not worth the bother . Instead , I 'll wear 'em when I work in the yard .
 These shoes seem to be well constructed , but they are not like the Clarks that I bought 20 years ago . I bought them about 3 months ago , and I wear them 3 or 4 days a week .1 -RRB- They 've lost most of the cushy feel that they had when they are new .2 -RRB- They have an unusual smell that reminds me of band-aids . I had originally thought that the odor would fade , but it has not . I can smell them all of the time , when they are within 6 feet of my person.If it were possible to return them at this point , I would .
 They are very average shoes . Please do n't buy them thinking they are better than any quality shoe on the market . Go to a Vasque dealer and get better shoes .
 The shoe overall was nice , I Like the design and it fits well . However it started tearing at the sides . did not get as much wear from it . I am really disapointed in clarks as I grow up wearing clarks and have to pray for it to damage .
 The product feature says `` patent '' . Should n't that mean patent leather ? But actually they are not leather at all . I ordered the red one . They look stiff and the color makes me uncomfortable too . Honestly , they are pretty comfortable shoes but make your feet look longer . I guess that 's because of the style . Anyway , I am sending them back .
 The item arrived very quickly - I was impressed . First thing I noticed was that it was NOT a leather sole as advertised . While disappointing , it would suffice . Then the cheap construction showed as one of the tassels fell off while I was attending a meeting out of town . The suporting piece was a very thin vinyl that simply broke . I noticed the other one was pulling out of the tiny hole in which it was set . Well , since I had no idea when it chose to break , I did not have said tassel in my possession . The seller -LRB- Gabriel Shoes -RRB- informed me that Bostonian does not guarantee the tassels ! I can see why since the design is so flawed . I ended up having to have both tassels replaced with 2 that I had taken off an old pair of shoes . Gabriel Shoes did offer and apply a credit of $ 15 for my expense . I will not purchase Bostonian again .
 I have owned Bostonian shoes for a number of years . Recently I purchased two pairs , one in Black and one in burgandy . The quality appears to be the same except that the shoes now has man made soles . This was not a big problem for me except that now the shoes squeak when I walk . I do n't know if the problem is due to the fact that the soles are man made or that the shoes are now made in CHINA . These will be my last pair of Bostonians .
 The worst dress shoe I have ever purchased . Painful . Inflexible and they do not break in at all . This is a classic model but the quality has severely fallen off over the years .
 I bought these shoes and received them a fews days ago . These are the problems
 I wanted so badly to like these shoes . They look really good , come in 12 wide -LRB- which I needed -RRB- and the price was reasonable . However , these shoes hurt worse than any pair of shoes I have ever owned . They are the correct size and slip on fine , but the top of the shoe digs into the top of my foot when I walk . I assumed that I just needed to break them in , so for weeks I wore them , and even went for walks outside my office frequently hoping to loosen them up . I placed cardboard in my socks to reliever the pressure and even tried stretching them using wooden shoe stretchers . And they still hurt!I wear dress shoes every day and have had many different kinds of shoes over the years and all had their plusses and minuses . None were this uncomfortable . I strongly suggest you try them on somewhere to make sure that you like the fit prior to purchasing them online .
 The shoes arrived well packaged , and on-time , but one of the shoes had a huge scuff / damaged leather on the back - looked like someone tried them on , and took one of the shoes off by stepping on the back of the other one . Returns should really be inspected for damage before they 're shipped back out .
 The picture on the web site masks much of the poor qualities of this shoe . The material was cheap and it looked cheap . Save your money and spend it on something else .
 This shoe hurt my feet . I returned it .

 I am a fan of Clarks . Probably last 10 years I have n't worn any other shoes except Clarks.Couple of weeks ago I ordered two pairs of this shoe
 I had to return these shoes as soon as I tried them on . The leather along the ankle areas is so stiff it actually hurts your ankle when you walk around . I felt the discomfort immediately . Definitely not recommended to anyone .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .

 This was the 3rd time I bought Skechers , and I was very leary . I bought myself a pair a couple years ago , and in a very short time the elastic which acts in place of laces broke across the top . I NEVER wear out shoes . I own too many.Then I bought my 4 year old light up ones , and the lights in one shoe burnt out w/in 3 weeks . I 've had Walmart brand shoes who 's lights were still giong when the shoes wore out!Now a week ago I bought these shoes at Kohl 's for my 10 year old , who begged me for them because the commercials are so cool . He wore them to school the first week . Friday he came home , and the stitching had come undone on the elastic strap on one of the shoes . I returned them today , and I will NEVER purchase Skechers again .

 Overall construction is good however the side top edge does not have a cushion for the ankle bone . This caused an abrasion under the ankle . Product was returned and credit was issue in a satisfactory manner .
 Not sure what happened to the Crocs brand , however , the quality definitely is NOT the same as it has been . My 2 year old son wore this pair only a few times before the back strap broke off and it can not be repaired.Basically it was a waste of money and I will have to look for an alternative brand that has n't allowed their quality of product to drop .
 These shoes are not durable at all . My son who is 2 only wore these for a few days before the black plastic piece that holds the strap on the back broke off . I could never get it back on right and eventually lost the piece . They are now completely broken and can not be worn at all .
 We order these for my son 's birthday . They arrived on time on his birthday but they were obviously in Used condition . The bottom of the crocs were worn , and the alligator images on the sides were scratched off .
 These are cute and look comfy however both my kids complain that the straps have cause blisters . The area where the round crocs logo is , rubs on the insides of their feet . Not a good vacation when the kids are complaining of hurt feet .
 I order two pairs of these for my boys , and within five minutes of my older son putting them on for the first time the plastic `` rivets '' holding the strap to the shoe broke . Shortly after that , a `` rivet '' on my other sons pair broke . Two new pairs of shoes both broken within ten minutes of them being worn tells me that this is more than just a manufacturing `` oops '' . The rivets are a design flaw and whatever cost-savings they are to the company , they just paid for in customer loyalty . I will never buy crocs again!BTW , for those of you who have this problem , there is a fix ... Go to the fabric store and buy some Blue Jeans Buttons to replace the plastic `` rivets '' . They fit the openings pretty well , and they 're metal , so they are n't going to break .
 The sizing does not make sense ... I bought a size 4 for my one year old and it could fit a four month old . Wasted my money .
 If you get the length you need , then they are way too wide - like boats and way too big for children to keep on their feet .
 I ordered blue crocs for my child in a certain size . They sent me bright neon crocs , in a smaller size . Why ? I do n't know . I ask for an exchange or refund , and I have yet to receive any . This has been going on for months and it is yet to be resolved . I finally put a review to see if I can get a different outcome .
 My son had a pair of crocs last summer and wore them every day . They held up beautifully . So , I bought him a pair -LRB- same color and style -RRB- for this year and within a month the strap broke off . At $ 20 , these shoes should stand up better than that . I do n't know what happened to their quality , but these were a disappointment .
 I normally love Crocs and buy a pair each year for my kid , but the one 's I just got broke in two days . I want to return them for a new pair .
 The strap broke within 6 weeks of receiving the item . Our now 19 month old has another pair of Crocs -LRB- lego blocks -RRB- that she has worn more and those are still fine . Her previous pair she was able to wear until she outgrew with no problems.I am very frustrated I can not return/exchange these when it seems I must have received a defective pair .
 I have purchased at least six pairs of Crocs previously and I have always had great luck with them holding up through all kinds of wild little boy behavior . Which is why I am really disappointed that the straps on these Crocs broke after my son wore them 4 or 5 times . Maybe these were seconds of some type ? Fakes ? Not sure , but very unhappy to be purchasing another pair less than two weeks after purchasing these .
 I think I would have loved this shoe for my 3 year old , but the black buckle piece broke within an hour of her wearing it ! She was just around the house and it popped off and the inside was broken . The color was cute though . Wish Amazon had not run out so I could have exchanged them . I had to take a refund instead . Probably why they were only $ -LSB- ... -RSB- when I bought them !
 I love my work crocs so I ordered this for my daily use , and all reviews said order smaller way to big !! So I usually wear a 81/2 to 9 in shoes -LRB- on the smaller side normally -RRB- so I ordered a 8 and wow they were way to small !! And even with my foot in them it felt too unstable . Not a great choice for me : -LRB-
 We purchased these from an outlet store so perhaps they were not made properly . However I was informed that the color combination between the shoe and strap was the only difference so I am posting this review for Moms who have toddlers with wide feet . After one hour of wearing the shoes my son developed blisters on the side of both feet . We threw the shoes away . Will not buy another pair . Too bad since I liked the anti microbial aspect and breathability .
 I really do n't want to sound like a naysayer , but I remember reading somewhere that , due to the soft nature of these shoes , then have gotten stuck in the edge of escalators . My children are older , so I did n't worry , but my family and I saw this happen to a young boy first hand . It was quite frightening , and I hate to think of what could have happened if my husband had n't rushed over and pressed the emergency stop button on the escalator . If your child wears these , please take caution to keep his/her feet away from the sides of escalators .
 I was very disappointed with this crocs . It smelled so bad , it had a very strong smell , I would n't let my baby girl wear it as I 'm sure it 's very toxic . I ordered this crocs in Fuschia color size 6-7 and I was really excited to try it on my daughter , but I guess it 's going directly to the trash . I can not return it , cuz I do n't live in the US , and returning it would cost me as much as it costs . . very very unhappy with this order . .
 I ordered blue croc , but I got chocolate color.My son was upset , since blue is his favorite color.I did n't want to take trouble returning it and exchanging it.But we were not happy about it .
 Maybe it is me , but I ordered shoes in what I thought were my daughters size and they came in the exact size of my son 's , whose feet are two sizes bigger . I could have misordered but I was pretty careful about it . The sizing chart is confusing.I agree with the woman who says the shoes are too expensive for what they are . That is probably true for kids ' shoes in general , though .
 I always buy my kids crocs before going to Disney every year . I have never had a problem before . They usually walk alot and stay comfy . This year my 8 year old got horrible blisters on the top of his feet where the shoe opening is . Needless to say he wore gym shoes the rest of the trip . Poor kid was very uncomfortable . I think it might be this style . My other two children wore different styles .
 I 've purchased many pairs of Crocs over the years but the quality has severely diminished over the past few years . I 'm not sure exactly what has changed in the manufacturing but a pair of crocs used to last my daughter a couple of years . At the end of May , the back strap broke on a pair so I bought a new pair through Amazon . She wore them TWICE when one of the straps broke off the back . We decided to do `` surgery '' and took a back strap off an old pair to replace the broken one . I wish we had simply returned them at the time but she liked them so we did n't . Now , the other strap has broken off the back . Please note that the strap off of the older pair is still intact and going strong . You can actually FEEL the difference in thickness between the old and new . It 's really sad because my daughter and most of her friends love them but I will not spend $ 32 on a pair of shoes that breaks immediately . And of course , I ca n't return to Amazon . Hopefully , I 'm not the only one that 's complained -LRB- I also complained directly to Crocs -RRB- and the quality will improve again but for now , we 've purchased our last pair of crocs . And our last pair of shoes from Amazon , PERIOD , due to the return policy .
 The croc buttons were not snapped together tightly . She was heart broken but without the straps she ca n't keep them on her feet . I saved three of the buttons but no such luck on the first one that came off .
 I BOUGHT THIS CROCS FOR MY 2 1/2 YEARS BOY AND I CHOOSE THE 4-5 M US TODDLER . WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT DID N'T FIT HIM CAUSE IT IS TOO SMALL . THE SIZE CHART IS TOTALLY INCORRECT
 Well they are crocks . and the color is not what I expected . Burst is highlighter yellow ! I was expecting more of a butter color judging by the photo . I read the sizing chart and ordered my toddler a size 8/9 his normal shoe size is a 7 . Well he most likely will not be wearing these at all ! By the time he fits in them it will be winter ! Ugh so frustrating !! But the quality of the product is wonderful . Despite the color mix up i really wish his feet would fit into these !!
 I ordered these Croc shoes for my daughter in July , and she wore them 3 times and the strap ripped
 My daughter owns an identical pair of these in light pink in toddler size 8/9 . I purchased a fuscia pair from Amazon in the exact same size , but they are 1/2 '' shorter in length . When my daughter tried them on , her toes were touching the end of the shoes . So I must return them -LRB- and my daughter is extremely disappointed -RRB- . What 's worse , since the return is not the result of Amazon 's error , they can not be exchanged ; I can order a new pair , but would have to incur the shipping charge . I do n't have money to throw away , and with the sizing irregularities , the next size up could still not fit -LRB- it 's anyone 's guess -RRB- . Unless you have time and money to waste on returns and reorders , I would not recommend ordering these online . We will have to find these in a brick-and-mortar store where my daughter can try them on to see if they 're really going to fit .
 Horrible customer service , unresponsive . I ordered purple and I got a Disney Cars model and on a different size . I wrote an e = mail and never received an answer from them . Thank god Crocs is a great company and I was able to exchange them on a Crocs concept store . I dont recommend this vendor
 Hi , I ordered this pair of crocs shoes for my little boy , and I was very dissapointed , because I noticed that the name of Crocs on the bach side of the trap , was inverted in the right foot . I never saw an original crocs shoes with this kind of mistake , so I thought I was frauded .
 I ordered a pair of children 's crocs from this seller a month ago . I got no notice of delay until I wrote to the seller through amazon . They told me only then that there would be a 2 week delay . Finally today , one month after placing the order , I received notice that they would be unable to fulfill my order . Order your crocs from a different seller !
 I bought a pair of these shoes locally about 2 years ago -LRB- size 8-9 for LESS than -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- he was size 8 at the time , they were a little too big on my son I set them aside . It took quite a few months for him to finally be able to use them . Finally he was able to use them , he used them for quite a while . My son is autistic , so once he likes something he wants it ALL the time . Unfortunately he wanted to wear them to bed , since he never went outdoors with them ; I figured that 's not too bad.The only time these would come off was for bath time , eventually they broke -LRB- 3 months later -RRB- . It was a pain to find them locally , they do n't sell them anymore . By the third sleepless night with my son who 'd give a HARD time to be put to bed I came here to Amazon hoping to find help.I ordered the very same shoe same size 8-9 for toddler -LRB- 3 times the price of the originals -RRB- they took 2 weeks to arrive . His size now varies between 9 and 9.5 . They were really tight -LRB- of course -RRB- and he did n't want them ! So I came back and ordered him size 10-11 , surprise ! THEY 'RE HUGE!In my desperation I had to submerge the 8-9 in warm water ... to stretch them , I took newspapers and shoved them inside the shoes and kept changing the warm water . It took 3 days but the shoes FINALLY stretched enough for him to find them comfortable to wear.He 's back wearing them ; meanwhile his foot is growing as I 'm typing here . And yet no shoe sized 9-10 that resembles this shoe at all.Oh but the worst thing is not the size , the worst thing IS THE PRICE ! -LSB- ... -RSB- ??? For rubber shoes ? Are you kidding me ? If I did n't have this emergency I would n't have bought these shoes AT ALL ! These people are deliberately taking advantage of desperate parents!As soon as I find them locally again I 'm ditching these guys , it would n't be so bad if they actually had the size of my son .
 We own several pairs of the old Crocs type slingbacks which had rivets that held the strap in place . These rivets have broken in the past and we had ordered replacements -LRB- not free may I add -RRB- . When I called today I was told that the new style Crocs have machine rivets and therefore the old style is no longer available . I find this to be extremely poor customer service .
 First time buying crocs . Thought they were supposed to be high quality . But after a few weeks of occasional wear by my 5 year old , strap broke off . Hesitant to buy a new pair , but otherwise great for summer b/c they 're close-toed and can get wet . He really liked them ... a few weeks later , we decided to try another pair and this time strap broke on very first day ! What junk . Now he 's wearing one croc from the old pair and one from the new - until those straps break too .
 I bought these crocs for my granddaughter and was very dissapointed that they were too big for her . The sizing is odd so I had to return them
 This is Amazon feedback more than Crocs feedback
 These are made in Mexico , and although it is 100 times better than having them made in China , they are defective . The cuts are not clean . They look like someone sliced them with a knife . I will keep them because it is a hassle to return them but being from CO and buying crocs since they invented them in Boulder ... I am NOT happy with these .
 Not a big fan of these shoes . After my three year old daughter fell numerous times while running in these shoes , we limit her use of them to quick trips to the pool or backyard . She is not allowed to run in them and does n't like to wear them as they make her fall down . She has a narrow foot , and perhaps this attributes to that a bit . These shoes are very wide and loose . Probably more suited to a child with wide feet or a child that does n't run and play -LRB- do they exist -RRB- ? I will not be purchasing these again , as I have found the Keen Newport to be a much better , durable , safer shoe for my child to wear all summer .
 My son has been wearing crocs for years . He has worn the classic style . I thought this would just be the next size up . But the sizing seemed off . We ordered a boys size 2 . The size 2 was about 1/4 inch longer than the size 1 that he had outgrown . But the width was 3/4 of an inch wider in the heel area , at least and equally wide or wider in the toe area . The size was described by Amazon as Medium or M. I looked up the same shoe on the crocs.com website and it was described as their `` roomiest '' or widest fit of the three fit styles they listed . So I think this shoe should be listed as a W or Wide not medium , especially since Crocs run wide anyway . I had my son put one old shoe on and one new shoe on and took a picture . I was hoping to be able to post the picture so that potential buyers could see how wide this shoe is . This shoe would probably fit a kid with short toes and very wide or chubby feet . I am returning them as they do not fit my child 's average size 2 foot .
 While I had high hopes for these shoes , I can not recommend them for little toddlers at least . My daughter , who is 2 1/2 , stopped constantly to get out bits of grass , sand , and rocks that came in the holes around the sides . Not fun ! However , I also bought some crocs with a crocband around this problem area , which are perfect and never do this , so I recommend buying some of those instead !
 I love ordering from Amazon . They process and deliver my orders in a timely manner . However , I am very disappointed with the Wolverine work boots.The quality of construction has changed ; along with the sizing and they hurt my feet . My first pair of Wolverine work boots were so comfortable that I would take long walks in them . I expected all Wolverine Durashock work boots to be of the same quality and comfort ; they 're not . If you 're looking for comfort , avoid these boots
 This product did n't fit my foot , and the material was too plastic . It was not comfortable . I have medium-wide width feet , and usually Women 's size 9 fits . Not this time . I returned these shoes and got a Men 's Adidas slide sandal .
 Wow , We have bought many pairs of slides over the years , but this pair must have been a second -LRB- not mentioned -RRB- the white stripes started wearing off after one use -LRB- B-ball camp -RRB- & the side seam ripped out @ sole . Poor quality !
 I wear addidas sandals and when I ordered this pair it was too small . Also , I ordered the all white pair , and the white was not all white . It almost looked like it was eggshell colored . I was n't happy with this order and returned them for a full refund .

 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .

 Thought I would love these shoes when I got them but after wearing them for awhile my feet started to hurt . I wish I could wear them all day but I had to change my shoes half way through the work day . Disappointed : -LRB-
 I normally wear a 6.5 and I ordered size 6.5 and they fit very tight , my toes were very smashed and I couldnt wear them . I ended up selling them to my coworker who wears size 4 and she loves them.I was very happy with the shoes otherwise , they were lightweight , clean , and arrived very quickly . I was dissapointed they didnt fit.I may try again and just order a size bigger .
 These shoes are all sized incorrectly for USA plus , you can not even get your foot inside to actually try them on . I have returned these shoes for a FULL REFUND . These shoes are TERRIBLE !
 It seems to me that Dr Martens are skating by on name brand recognition now . The stitching on these unraveled before my man had worn them for a year . How is that acceptable ? The leather is also thin and not sturdy or suitable for heavy wear . I also had a not-inexpensive pair of Docs poop out on me because of poor quality , so I guess we 'll have to find other brands for our boot-wearing needs .
 These were Great boots when they were made in England . Now they are made in China and the leather is thin and the Quality no longer exists .
 I chose these boots because they looked cool and because I figured that they 'd be more comfortable than Heeled boots . WRONG ! The reinforced seams in the back make the boots extremely durable , but also tore through the skin of my ankle . The leather is very rigid and difficult to walk in , and the tongue of the boot is cheap , narrow -LRB- so that it slides to one side as you walk -RRB- , and does this weird bubbling thing when you try to lace the boots up that looks SUPER tacky . These boots are NOT worth the cost .
 Los zapatos llegaron en muy malas condiciones . Se podia apreciar con facilidad que los zapatos estaban usados .
 I want to return that item because I received a wrong size . Since now i did n't have a chance to contact to the seller , I hope someone can help me to change this item with the right size that I ordered . By the way I ordered size 11 and got something like size 9 .
 NO PUEDO EMITIR OPINION ALGUNAPORQUE ESTA MERCANCIA NUNCA ME LLEGO , QUISIERA QUE SI LA LLEGARA A COMPRARALGUN DIA ME LA ENVIARAN POR UPS O FEDEX YQUE CUANDO LLEGUE A VENEZUELA SECONECTE AQUI CON DOMESA , ZOOM O MRW.GRACIAS
 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .
 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .

 This shoe is poorly designed . Where shoe hits the ankle is stiff and digs into the ankle when the foot is flexed . Because the lacing is off to one side , there is no tongue like a typical laced shoe . So you ca n't fold back the rigid piece that hits the ankle . If not for the shipping cost -LRB- 7.99 to ship and 5.99 to return -RRB- and that fact that my growing son will out grow these before the next indoor soccer season , I would definitely return . I will never buy a shoe online again unless all shipping costs are covered by the return policy or I have tried the shoe at a brick & mortar store first . This is not a bargain at $ 29.99 . You get what you pay for , a cheap poorly made shoe .
 I love the frosted pink color and small size of this bag , but the quality of the materials is underwhelming . The bag looks and feels like very cheap plastic . Frankly , I did not think this bag was worth the price , but the vendor 's return fees were so high -LRB- nearly 50 % of the purchase price -RRB- that I kept it anyway . I recommend checking this one out in an actual store before deciding to buy it . I 've never before been so disappointed in a Nine West item .
 I was so excited when I got Hunter boots for my birthday during the summer of 2010 , living in Seattle you really ca n't get by without reliable rain boots . I did much research into rain boots , because again I live in Seattle . Of course I did n't break them out untill fall , and only a year later I was in about 1 inch of water and felt water coming into one of my boots . I thought huh ? there must be a manufacturer defect , well Hunter seems like a good company i 'm sure I could contact them . I decided to email them , the response I got was `` Hunter boots are typically made for the rainy days that we do have . Of course , rain can accumulate and we can see knee deep inches of water but at Hunter , we would never recommend using any of our boots in any type flooding , whether it be 2 '' or 5 '' of water . '' So they really do n't stand behind their word at all . I was shocked.Why would anyone pay $ 125 for rain boots that are not waterproof ? Then about a month ago the rubber of my boots cracked exposing the boots lining . I contacted them once more thinking they must be faulty . The response I got over the phone was that they have only a 12 month warranty . Well I did n't understand why they had fallen apart so fast , some reviews I read were from people stating they had the same pair for 15 , even 20 years ! Why would mine be different ? The so called `` realiable hunter originals '' have been made in China since 2008 , identical to the originals originally made in Scotland . I just answered my own question , next time I want rain boots made in China i 'll just go to Walmart . `` Outstanding in every field '' to me is a statement representing false company integrity . The original quote Hunter kept even after their manufacturing was outsourced .
 These boots use to be manufactured in Scotland and were fantastice quality but are now made in China and Brazil.They are now terrible quality and will not last long . But do n't just take my word for it , just put into Google `` Hunters poor quality `` Also look at these sites to see what many others are saying ... Horse and Hound -LSB- ... -RSB- Secret Scotland -LSB- ... -RSB- My fiance bought me a pair of Hunters just 2 years ago and said that they would last for years . Both boots have developed cracks along the soles and are letting in water . It should also be noted that I do not wear them much . If they are used every day they may only last 6 months which is better as they have a 12 month guarantee !
 I have been a longtime buyer of Hunter boots and have considered carrying them in my shoe store . However , I recently learned that Hunter boots produced 10,000 boots with blooming -LRB- the white residue -RRB- and instead of recycling -LRB- which they claim to do in their company statement , instead of donating to Haiti , Goodwill Industries , Salvation Army , you name it , Hunter shoes burned all 10,000 of these boots . I am appalled and disgusted and will no longer be buying Hunter boots .
 I recently purchased a pair of Hunter Originals , it turns out they were made in China according to the box . Previous 2 pair were the real deal and have been worn for years and many miles . After wearing my new pair less than 4 hours-over perhaps 5 occasions-one of the heels has fallen off and remains lost in the mud somewhere on my property ! It is unbelievable that new owners of such a famous brand would throw their reputation away by sanctioning poor quality and inferior merchandise to be manufactured under their name . Face it , the poor Chinese workers are making what their British corporate lords and Chinese mafia shop owners agree is acceptable.The current holder of the Hunter brand must be exposed as a vulture capitalist who takes over a struggling company with a reputable brand for cheap , only to dismiss the skilled workers and extract the last profit by sourcing cheap janky merchandise as the whole business fizzles down the drain . Ethically bankrupt bastards .
 These boots are now made in China , quality dropped . Chemical smell . Develop leaks . Useless ` celebrities ' thought it was ` kewl ' to be seen in them and so greed took over . And another excellent product bites the dust . Save your money . Vote how you buy . Look for substance and real quality and fair prices .
 The boots are faded out washed out colorless . Returned the product twice hoping it was just a rare defect , but apparently it 's not a rare defect .
 I purchased the Hunter original Welly 's and initially was very pleased with them . Six months later they sprung a leak , and upon examination they were crazing and splitting everywhere they flexed . I had expected many years wear for the price , but a quick search of the internet showed that many were experiencing the same problem and that the original company had been sold . These are fashion boots , not rain boots or working in the garden boots , or mucking out stalls boots and they will last for months , not many years , as they once would .
 I bought a pair of these last summer . The piece at the top to tighten the calf broke within a week . I used super glue to repair this , but they never should have broken - especially since I do not tighten them up at all . I was told of the wonderful quality , but I would not buy again or recommend . They do look nice , but many other companies are now making a nicer looking rubber boot at a better price . Look around and you will find something much nicer with better quality .
 I am the girl who has small feet . I wear size 4 woman . Since size 4 is very hard to find , I typically buy size 5 woman . And because of my small feet , I know very well about children sizes , because I can fit bid kids size 3.5 . I ordered a woman size 5 , but received a big kid size 4 boots with someone else 's return label on it . Apparently , this seller is not honest with their products and wants to sell big kid shoes as woman shoes -LRB- the circumference of the boots are different -RRB- . The big kid Hunters only sell for $ 75 at department stores .
 I ca n't get these boots off . I always have to have someone around me to help to pull them off . For the price , I thought they were going to be fantastic . Live and learn .
 I bought my hunter boot at the mall not on amazon.I was very excited when I purchased the boot ! It is very comfortable and look great!Today was heavy rain and felt a leak in the rainboots.I had only wore less than a month , for the first time I notice a leak in the rainboots , my socks were wet.I will return the boot tomorrow ! I am very dissaapointed ! Supposed to be rainboots and water proof!I do not recommend wearing them in a heavy rain !
 I also ordered the loafers and received sandals . When I tried to return them , I could only exchange them even though my size was out of stock . After three very long calls to customer service , I was allowed to return the sandals for a refund , but had to pay the shipping myself . If you order these shoes and get the sandals , it might be best just to keep the sandals . For me , at three hours of my time on the phone , plus twelve dollars in shipping , it would have been cheaper to keep the sandals .
 I ordered the loafer and got the sandals . I will keep the sandals , they are not bad , but I wo n't order from Propet again .
 The sandals are okay , not terrific , too much of a hassle to return . Probably wo n't order again .
 Propet Women 's Comfy Walker LoaferI also purchased the loafers for $ 34.90 but received sandals instead . Must be a mixup with the photo/item number . Easy return process by printing pre-paid return label . Original shipping charges also to be refunded .

 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .
 These pants have a `` relaxed fit '' tag on them when they arrive , translation `` mom jeans '' workout pants . The are high waisted with thick elastic and extra room in the stomach . Also , the material between the legs creates extra friction , making them harder to run/walk in .
 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...

 Very comfortable shoe . But , the color would change with foot temperature . Being that your foot does n't heat evenly , you would have these dark -LRB- very dark -RRB- patches on the shoe . Once you take the shoe off , the color would go back to its original color . Do n't like them .

 The best thing going for the shoe is the low cost . They certainly wil function for wrestling shoes but they are cheap and will start to fall apart in one season . The velcrow lace tuck is junk and the stitching is falling apart , but I have used them for 2 seasons coaching . Time to pick up some asics , they have always been durable .
 Love the look of the sandals , but they rubbed the area raw between the big toe and second toe on my left foot and rubbed an area raw on the top left portion on my right foot .
 I have severe plantar fasciitis and there are very very few products that actually help the condition . I own Birkentock Arizonas , which are better than walking barefeet but are heavy and slip off my feet . So I always walk a certain way to make sure they do n't come off and that causes pains in other parts of the feet . I ordered Reef Fanning 's based on the reviews -LRB- obviously -RRB- , to only wear around the carpeted house . I wore them for 1 week and there was a sudden increase in pain in my heels and now knees . I never had knee pain before . The slippers seem to have fair arch support but the heels are not hollowed to provide cushion -LRB- a must -RRB- . This could very well be how my feet are structurally and not a design issue . Remember the Fannings are not marketed as slippers for Plantar Fasciitis slippers , they only claim to provide arch support - which it does failry decently . The slippers otherwise are well-made and look very cool.-Orthoheel-I returned the Fannings and got Orthoheel Waves , they were uncomfortable the first day and the strap still hurts between the toes and fingers . But they are otherwise comfortable , after a week of wearing them I feel it is safe to keep them and transition over from my Birkenstock Arizonas -LRB- which have a great foot bed btw -RRB- .
 REEFS SUCK , LOOK AT MY PIC . Took a pair of Reef 's to Costa Rica . Everytime they got wet in the ocean the straps left huge black marks on my feet . This was n't like a one time thing . EVERY TIME THEY GOT WET . Complete garbage for an expensive pair of sandals . It looked like I had a crazy foot disease . An it was hard to wash off . Anyways , I threw the reefs in the trash where they belong and got myself a pair of Kustoms . Cheaper , lighter , more comfortable and NO MORE BLACK FEET . I put up a picture of my stained black feet . REEFS SUCK ! Oh and you look like a jack@$$ using a sandal to open your beer .
 I was interested in buying a pair of these sandals since my dog ate one of my sperrys . While perusing the list of styles I noticed that they had two styles that included the colors of the mexican flag . However I saw no style that offered the red , white and blue colors for us US patriotic Americans . Nuff Said !!!
 Lets look at thisYou are going to put the opening of your bottle next to the same surface that you walk in public restrooms on .
 Horrible quality , completely fell apart in 6 months . Broke in , and realized they also make your feet smell like dirty dogs a ** if . you get them wet . * note , when wet you will slip and slide.all over the place in addition to the foul smell that will present itself.More about the quality ; front toe strap partially disconnected @ 4 months , side lower connection shortly thereafter . Can not believe such catastrophic failures from what is supposed to be a good manufacture . I guess that 's why I will be going back to purchasing only rainbow or olulukai sandles as Reef has gone gimmick over quality . * on that note , be careful ! The novel placement of metal `` church key '' beer opener in the slippers arch can cause you to lose control and eat serious s # $ t when descending stairs , ladders etc , especially wood or metal ! `` Stay on your toes '' so to speak !
 I 've long been a fan of reef sandals but this model it terrible . The soles have separated/split apart after two months of wear .
 I have never had a pair of Reefs that has fallen apart so quickly . First the leather lining comes undone on both sandals , then a few months later the nylon part is broken . My past reefs have lasted at least 2 years if not 3 . This pair broke in less than a year . I wonder if the manufacturing process has been compromised . My sons Reefs bought at Costco had to be returned after about 2 months because the leather was delaminating from the sole . What is up with Reef ?
 I bought these based on the high number of reviews and high ratings , but I was in for a surprise . You see this sandals that everyone 's `` husband '' and `` boyfriend '' likes so much and that last `` for 10 years '' -LRB- just check the reviews and you 'll know what I mean -RRB- . Are n't all THAT good.They are a bit large , first I ordered a Size 11 -LRB- my normal size -RRB- then had to exchange them for a pair size 10 . Both times they were shipped fast , no complaints there.The second pair had a good fit , but they make my toes bleed . After wearing them for only thirty minutes or so and some moderate walking around , I had a wound on the second toe on my left foot . The straps between the big and second toe is also quite uncomfortable and quite frankly a bit painful.Overall , I would n't call them total garbage , but certainly not that good and not worth the current price .
 The feeling of it touching my feet is not very comfortable . Moreover , once it gets dirty with dust or sand , you may never get rid of them no matter how hard you try .
 Toe Strap broke within 1 month . Horrible . Other then that good flip flop . t t t t t t t
 These are really cool sandals . Even with the ` novelty ' item of a beer bottle opener on the bottom of 1 is good for a laugh ... once . They are comfortable and very stylish . Here 's the rub ... Bought in July of 20 +11 , I wore them a significant amount of the time . However , when you get to some days in September and then to October ... here in Kansas , it 's not flip flop time . Fast forward to March 20 +12 , and the front sole of the flippers are darn near gone , I mean all the way to the base bottom of the shoe . Now I do n't know how many days I wore them , but I 'm handicapped and do n't walk a lot , which is a factor . So all in all , nifty lookin ' flippers , but they wear out way to quickly . WAYYYYY to quickly . Believe I 'll have to go shopping again . Just one guys opinion on one set of flip flops , perhaps it was a fluke . But it 's not a workmanship problem , it 's a materials problem.Good luck and FINS UP!PART II
 Minimal use over a period of a year . Toe strap broke on one sandal . When I contacted the company about replacement , it was pointed out that the warranty is good for 6 mos only , regardless of use . No more Reefs for me . Other makers have much better warranties .
 I attend a fairly large campus and walk 1-3 miles every day between classes . Last semester I wore a cheaper Reef product -LRB- the Phantom sandal -RRB- , and it provided good cushioning for long walks . However , it flattened quickly , as other reviewers have pointed out , so I wanted to trade up . The angle of the item picture misleads the viewer into thinking that it has good arch support and cushioning . This is incorrect . When I got the sandals , they were very stiff , and the part between my toes was more abrasive than the Phantom sandal . Imo leather is not a good option for a sandal . It does look `` prettier '' , but it 's not that comfortable . But I decided to try the sandals some more anyway . They proved to be more uncomfortable than the Phantom sandal ; walking long distances feels like walking on blocks of cement . My feet were extremely sore -LRB- btw I 'm 21 and almost never have sore feet -RRB- , and that air bubble under the heel was not helpful at all . Furthermore this sandal stains very easily . After wearing it for two hours , there was all kinds of dirt and crud stuck between the crevices of the foot bed . I have never had this happen with a sandal before . So it ends up looking really gross . Overall I do not think it was worth the extra money , either in style or substance .
 I have owned many Reef sandals and was hoping to upgrade by going with a leather pair . The sizing ws accurate as always and they were also stylish , Unfortunately after the first mile of walking in them , the straps starting digging into the top of my feet causing blisters . I have not been able to wear them and plan on sending them back .
 I 've used this sandals for like 5 days now , the reef logos in the back end of the sandal are already fading and looking really bad , like the sandal had like months of use.Also i ordered the black ones and they are getting to look like white dirt or something on the foam bed . I thought they would be more comfortable but not what i expected . This added to the fading logos make the sandal look like at least 1 year old.I should return these , im thinking . For the price , i definately got ripped off . I bought Adidas sandals in the past for the same price i got these , i still have them since Dec 2007 and wore them until i got these and they still look VERY good but i just thought it would be a good time to buy new sandals , either i was wrong or chose the wrong brand . =-LRB- Buyer beware .
 I have had multiple pairs of Reef sandals and love them . UNFORTUNATELY , this pair broke within a month or so , popped out just like the proverbial Jimmy Buffett song -LRB- stepped on a pop top , blew out my flip flop -RRB- , color me disappointed on this purchase .
 Look around through the reviews here and you will see a few people complaining about otherwise good sandals falling apart prematurely . Well , after 11 months you can now add me to that list.The inner straps on the right one pulled free -LRB- all three -RRB- during a walk back to the hotel . I finished the trip barefooted and tugged on the same straps on the left one out of curiosity . They also pulled free quite easily . The straps seem to simply a press fit to holes in the tops of the sandals ; there was no evidence of glue or stitching.Friday afternoon at the Chinese factory or bad design ? I suppose that it does n't really matter . I 'm still out a pair of expensive sandals that are n't covered by a warranty . Since this issue only seems to be hitting a few people , it 's probably just shoddy craftsmanship and not poor design , but buyer beware - if you get a bad pair and they fail after 30 days , you 're eating the cost , not Reef . And as a `` premium surf brand , '' they 're not cheap.Two stars because they WERE great sandals before they fell apart .
 These were very good sandals while they lasted . Mine lasted ~ ten & one half months . The outer side strap on my right one became unattached from the sole - all three foci . It looks like they might have been glued . I did get them wet a couple of times . Mine cost U$ 42.31 . I think I should have gotten more out of them than that . I can buy a lot of rubber flip flops for that money .
 This is the most disappointing purchase I have ever made on Amazon . These sandals slip on wet surfaces -- like the shower floor in my gym , or the area next to the pool , or wet sidewalks . I ca n't believe that no one commented on this in all the reviews that I read before making my purchase . Did everyone else buy them to wear to the mall off of Rodeo Drive ? I missed the window to return these but I will definitely tell everyone I can not to buy Reef sandals . The stupid bottle opener gimmick on the sole of the sandal will scratch your hardwood floors if you wear them inside . Amazon or Reef , please credit my account ! I would be happy to pay the shipping cost to return them - far less expensive than a lifetime of therapy after I slip on a wet floor , crack my head open , and end up a TBI patient . I ca n't believe I paid $ 44.00 for this scam .
 I ordered these to replace a lost pair of reefs that i had for over 4 years with no issues . could not find the same style that i had but these appeared to be similar to them . these weigh at least twice that of my old pair . they are ok i suppose , one of the major issues with purchasing something online without finding them local to try on/touch first . another reason to only buy books or items that you have physically had contact with first from any online retailer . to much of a hassle to return items . bottle opener on sole may be interesting but only a drunk/stoned person would even consider using it to open anything they would be drinking from .
 Way too tight a fit for size 12 foot . The sole size was fine but the vertical rise of the strap was probably made for a size 8 foot . Your manufacturer needs to know that when foot sizes get bigger it is not just in length but in thickness and height also . Unwearable .
 Picked up these about 8 months ago . I researched the REEF 's extensively and choose their most `` Highly Rated '' design ... The Mick Fanning.Fast forward 5 to 6 months and BAM ... the strap broke . Your kidding me ... $ 50 sandals that could not make it through a few months -LRB- purchased in February and broke in June -RRB- . The funny thing is I actually purchased another pair in July -LRB- thinking maybe I got a bad product made on a bad day by an overworked and under paid Chinese person -RRB- . The 2nd pair lasted exactly 3 months . Same flaw ... the toe strap broke during a dinner out . Fortunately , the 2 broken pair -LRB- s -RRB- each broke a different foot . Light bulb goes off ... still in business , I can wear the 2 good remaining feet for a new pair . BAD ! They broke the straps within a week . Now the bad news , the straps are not covered in the warranty . I am sending them back , both pairs , with no warranty , at my cost , to tell Reef , `` Please send this crap back to China and have your underpaid Chinese workers to wear and most importantly enjoy their new REEF Sandals '' . Thanks REEF , but I will be spending another $ 50 on a pair of Rainbow Sandals that actually come with a warranty .
 These were very uncomfortable flip-flops for me . I worst part , though , were that they have a bottle opener built into the sole . This seemed like a great idea when I ordered them , but the metal scratched my vinyl floor . The opener should have been embedded deeper into the sole . I returned these .
 Purchased these for a Caribbean cruise . On the last day of the 7 day cruise the sole fell off one shoe . I thought it was n't a problem as I would return when I got home . When I went to return them , yesterday was the final day I could return for full refund . I have searched for someone to contact , but that info is not available . I liked the shoe , was very comfortable , but did n't last but 1 week . I would not recommend these if you expect them to last .
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return .

 These Shoes are ok but they are overpriced . I have a pair of Bostonian Maldens and they are similar quality . The Bostonian cost less than half of the Florsheims . These shoes are average and I do like them but they do not compare to other 225 shoes on the market.Florsheim customer service was hit or miss . I bought the shoes from the Florsheim website and had them shipped to Canada . Half the time I dealt with with a good customer service rep the other half not so much . My big complaint is that I tried to leave a 3 star review on the Florsheim website and they did n't approve it . It seems they screen all their reviews and if they do n't like what the customer has written they will not publish it . I think this is extremely misleading and dishonest.If you can find these shoes for 150 bucks and do n't have to deal with Florsheim directly then I would recommend them . If it was n't for the price and service I would have given 4 start review because the shoes are nice .
 I 'm really disappointed with the quality and workmanship of the Florsheim shoes . The leather is so tough that they are uncomfortable to wear . I wore them just once and will never wear them again . What a shame !
 Not A comfortable sneaker at all ! Looks like a wonam 's sneaker .

 Horrible quality , completely fell apart in 6 months . Broke in , and realized they also make your feet smell like dirty dogs a ** if . you get them wet . * note , when wet you will slip and slide.all over the place in addition to the foul smell that will present itself.More about the quality ; front toe strap partially disconnected @ 4 months , side lower connection shortly thereafter . Can not believe such catastrophic failures from what is supposed to be a good manufacture . I guess that 's why I will be going back to purchasing only rainbow or olulukai sandles as Reef has gone gimmick over quality . * on that note , be careful ! The novel placement of metal `` church key '' beer opener in the slippers arch can cause you to lose control and eat serious s # $ t when descending stairs , ladders etc , especially wood or metal ! `` Stay on your toes '' so to speak !
 I 've long been a fan of reef sandals but this model it terrible . The soles have separated/split apart after two months of wear .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .

 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .
 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .
 I also ordered the loafers and received sandals . When I tried to return them , I could only exchange them even though my size was out of stock . After three very long calls to customer service , I was allowed to return the sandals for a refund , but had to pay the shipping myself . If you order these shoes and get the sandals , it might be best just to keep the sandals . For me , at three hours of my time on the phone , plus twelve dollars in shipping , it would have been cheaper to keep the sandals .
 I ordered the loafer and got the sandals . I will keep the sandals , they are not bad , but I wo n't order from Propet again .
 The sandals are okay , not terrific , too much of a hassle to return . Probably wo n't order again .
 Propet Women 's Comfy Walker LoaferI also purchased the loafers for $ 34.90 but received sandals instead . Must be a mixup with the photo/item number . Easy return process by printing pre-paid return label . Original shipping charges also to be refunded .
 While these boots are very comfortable to walk around in , I found out today that they are NOT waterproof . I am in New York City 's snow storm , and the streets are a mess . As I stepped in several deep piles of slush/snow/water I found both of my feet getting wet . Very disappointing .

 Bought these shoes because I liked the look and needed a new pair of `` driving '' shoes after my last pair wore out after about 2 years of use . I 've had these for about 3 months and they are already falling apart . The rubber on the sole is falling apart , and the leather at the toe is peeling off . I would not recommend these as everyday business casual shoes .
 Very bad quality . The thread on side of shoe started tearing off on 1st day . Returned it immediately . Highly discourage any potential buyers .
 I generally like the shoe . It looks good and is comfortable . However , it is poorly made . The stitching is coming off after four months .
 I have 2 of the exact same pairs of shoes purchased from Macy 's and the pair that I received from Amazon were not only missing insoles and the Steve Madden name anywhere on the shoes , but were fake plastic replicas from China . Completely unacceptable and now have to go through the pain of returning them .
 I have had these shoes for less than three months , and I only have worn them about 20 times in very light wear -LRB- to the store , around the house and such -RRB- . Both shoes are already losing their seams and falling apart . The covering on the leather was so thin it is showing through , and looks like they are three years old , not three months . My wife had ordered these before we read the other reviews , but we decided to give them a try anyway . I wish we had n't . What a hassle ! We are having to return them , and I would never buy another shoe from this maker again . They are garbage . I would have been better off buying some shoe at my local dollar store .
 the only good thing about these shoes is that their comfortable . but beware , they do n't last more than a week or two . the stitching on the bottom of the shoe gets worm out real quick , and then the shoe falls apart . its really not worth the money .
 Bought a pair of these about 5 months ago . Actually bought two ; one brown , one black . I wear the brown a lot more and they go with everything , but after about 2 months the bottoms wear out and fall apart . The bottoms now have holes in them . They shoes were great for a while , now they are going in the trash and will be buying from a different brand .
 I just do n't understand the business logic of manufacturers sometimes . Is it really worth it to save maybe $ 1 a unit and end up with a vastly inferior product?I bought these shoes at Macy 's and they looked amazing . They are a good combination of casual/dress that you can wear them just about anywhere.The problem with these shoes showed up about 2 months later . Apparently to save 15 cents in rubber per shoe , Steve Madden decided it would be a brilliant idea to use a perforated sole and cover the bottom with a thin layer of rubber . This gives the impression that you have 1/3 '' of rubber between your foot and the ground , but actually its 1/3 '' of rubber with a bunch of holes on it covered by a few mm of rubber . Unfortunately for you , that means that after a month or two this thin layer wears off and you start getting holes in the bottom of your shoes!Is rubber really that expensive ? I 'm paying $ 60 - $ 80 for these shoes . Seriously , spend $ 1/unit to make the soles more robust , charge me $ 5/unit more , and end up with a much better product and $ 4 more profit.If you 're interested in this style of Casual/Dress shoes I 'd suggest you check out some Sketchers . Not traditionally what you think of when you think of these kinds of shoes , but I 've had a very similar pair of Sketchers in white that look great for about 2 years now , and they 're still going strong.No more Steve Madden for me !
 The shoe is very handsome . I can tell a lot went into the design except for doing it 's job , i.e. protecting your feet . The shoe has no support and after a few months of normal wear a hole developed in my left toe on the outer leather . Not much longer did the irreplaceable thin leather foot-bed wear down to the rubber sole . If your intention is for the `` sole '' purpose of taking the Maserati out for a spin , then the shoe fits . If you plan on throwing the frisby around to impress the ladies with you mad skills , I suggest you do it barefooted .
 These look great and are very comfortable . Having said that , the sole does n't come far enough forward to protect the toe which just happens to scrape the ground with every step . After wearing these maybe 6 times the leather on the toe is almost worn through . I would not buy these again .
 I bought this shoe from a brick and mortar retailer , not Amazon , so my post may not pass the verified purchase test within Amazon . Irrespective there are good things and bad things about this shoe.The good . Nice leather . Cool Look . Interesting concept in a shoe , only problem is that too much stitching and finished leather like the Uppers are right along the outsole periphery or even the center of the outsole . In anything but the best weather and the smoothest of walking sufaces , this shoe will not last . I need a shoe that will survive the 1 -RRB- walk four miles on a sunny afternoon through the hillsides just because test as well as the 2 -RRB- run across the airport desperately trying to make my connecting flight because American airlines always arrives late into LAX test . On both accounts , this shoe would not cut it . The lateral extensions over the outsole are too exposed to abrasion and ultimate wear . The stitching starts to suffer , and the overall shoe bottom will start to look worse for wear after a few days of walking though some mildly damp streets after a SoCal rainstorm . If the outsoles were 10 % wider on each side , I suspect the shoe would have shown a lot more durability , but it did n't and so the shoe did n't last . Luckily , the brick and mortar retailer did give me a nice coupon towards the purchase of another set of shoes which I used to score some nice Florsheim Oxfords , so I am whole . I wish this shoe had more substance .
 Normally 8 or 8.5 fits my feet . But the leather of this shoes is too rough . I first ordered 8.5 and I return it to replace by 9 . Even the size 9 is like a blade in my feet . When walking I feel scratching my feet but it looks very good . Make sure you order one bigger that your size .
 Great looking shoe , but the material at the tip of the shoe is synthetic and the sole is stitched to it . The walking motion of the sole directly contacts the tip and rubs a hole straight through it , exposing the end of your foot . I cant believe these are still on the market . Huge disappointment . Spend the money for something of higher quality because these are extremely cheap made . Not worth $ 25 in my mind . Madden lost a customer for life here !
 These are certainly handsome shoes though there are all kinds of construction issues . Also , do n't get them wet or wear them in winter weather or you will be throwing them out within a week , guarantee . I 'm not sure what they 're made out of , but they end up smelling unholy terrible afterwards . If none of this is enough of a deterrent , I would wear wear these shoes seldom and in dry , warm weather .
 the stitching at the top of the shoe came apart the first time worn . did n't wear until summer so the return period expired . very disappointed .
 These Shoes are ok but they are overpriced . I have a pair of Bostonian Maldens and they are similar quality . The Bostonian cost less than half of the Florsheims . These shoes are average and I do like them but they do not compare to other 225 shoes on the market.Florsheim customer service was hit or miss . I bought the shoes from the Florsheim website and had them shipped to Canada . Half the time I dealt with with a good customer service rep the other half not so much . My big complaint is that I tried to leave a 3 star review on the Florsheim website and they did n't approve it . It seems they screen all their reviews and if they do n't like what the customer has written they will not publish it . I think this is extremely misleading and dishonest.If you can find these shoes for 150 bucks and do n't have to deal with Florsheim directly then I would recommend them . If it was n't for the price and service I would have given 4 start review because the shoes are nice .
 I 'm really disappointed with the quality and workmanship of the Florsheim shoes . The leather is so tough that they are uncomfortable to wear . I wore them just once and will never wear them again . What a shame !
 I wore these shoes to dinner once . I knocked the heel against a dining table chair and the more than thin fabric ripped . The other shoe heel similarly ripped during the course of a two hour , very sedate dinner , sitting in a chair doing nothing out of the ordinary . I have three other pairs of Arche shoes . These shoes are by far the worst as far as durability . Why would you pay Arche prices for shoes that are so quickly and easily ruined ? I will never buy Arche shoes again . The quality is no longer there , and there is no excuse for the fabric on the shoe tearing so easily . Will you buy these shoes ?

 Unfortunately , my review for these is not good . The shoe sizes are way off . I ordered my size which is 10 and they were more like an 8 when I tried to put them . They are very small shoes and that was extremely disappointing to me .
 from the picture this boot looks wonderful , sturdy , and great looking . in reality , it was poorly made , ran small and was uncomfortable . I returned it same day .
 These boots were cute in the photo but when they arrived looked like they were made of plastic-obviously fake leather -LRB- which they were ! -RRB- . I ended up returning them and had to pay for shipping them back . They just looked too fake .
 I bought these cause they looked so awesome in the picture and they had a great price . The shipping was quick I got them really fast . I was so disappointed when I opened the box , they looked so cheap . I 've worn dr martens since I was about 12 , I knew these boots were n't going to be the same quality but I just did not like them I sent then back and I 'm still waiting on a refund .
 they came in my size and calf shape ... according to the chart . they were short on calf material by 2 inches . that 's like a whole other size ! so in order to make that look decent , i would have to be a stick figure .
 I bought these boots for my girlfriend as an anniversary gift . They fit great , but they split where the material meets the heel after five months of her owning them . I do n't know if the material was cheap or if I had just a faulty pair , but if you can buy your boots elsewhere .
 Just by looking at these boots you can tell they are poorly made and made cheap ! Shipped them back the next day
 I bought a size 9M . I usually wear size 9 in all types of shoes . When I tried these boots on , the toe box was too small and when I tried zipping up the boot , it was difficult when it came up to my calves . At the ankles the material also slouched , and looked so awkward on me , probably because it was made with a not good material .
 I bought these boots cause I wanted a pair of boots to wear out in the sticks . They 're not warm , too tight to wear thick socks on under , they 're hard to lace . And wear on my ankles after about 3 hours . I have thicker calves , and have these laced to fit , but they 're not worth the 30 I paid for them . I waited until we went camping to wear them and unfortunately that was well past the return time ... . I own other Volatile shoes these are by far the most unimpressive ones I 've bought
 The boots were shipped as a gift to an out of state friend so I have not seen them . When the boots arrived , the left boot zipper was not sewn in properly . My friend had to take boot to a shoe repair , thus creating an unnecessary expense on her part . No return information was included in the packaging . Amazon needs to review the quality of this vendor 's work . Will not buy from this vendor again .
 Had these boots for about 11 months . Things started scuffing or falling off with in the first 6 or so . The zipper . OH the woe 's of zippers . I can no longer wear them because the zipper is broken already . They are really adorable but far to expensive for something that should have come out of a vending machine .

 I was very disappointed when I received these shoes . They were not the same shoes that are in the picture . I could see all the glue that was used to hold them together . The soles were frayed all around the rubber . Simply put , these shoes are cheap and not well built . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THEM !! I sent them back for a refund the next day .
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return .

 I was disappointed to receive the `` knock-off '' -LRB- imitation -RRB- version of this product , which can be purchased at a much lower price . Amazon offered to replace the item , which we readily accepted . However , we once again recieved the cheaper version , not the Western Chief Boot .
 This was my first time ordering and I am very , very disappointed . This shoe was made from China all right . Cheap glue , juice stain on the outside , deteriorating mold on the inside , and the sign that says Western looked like they pasted it on with a bubble gum strip . I ai n't lying !! I 'm CONVINCED that a 5 year old made this shoe . The sign that says Chief should really say CHEAP ! Child Labor is cruelty !!! AND I want my money back !!! I really want to rate these a negative nothing , but that was not an option .
 I ordered these boots in size 12 m regular toe . They came in a box marked 12 m but the boots were 10 m . They did not fit also they had steel toes that I did not want . I do like these boots I have had 4 pairs that I bought from Sears over the years . I thought I would save some money online but it did n't work out . Just a wast of time . I went back to Sears
 When I first got these shoes , I loved them . They were cute , comfy and a good fit . Within a few days , I noticed they seemed to be a little large after all . After a week or so , I realized they were stretching and were quite loose . But they stayed on my feet -LRB- kind of -RRB- , so I kept wearing them . After a few weeks , they had stretched so much that I could no longer wear them - and then I noticed that the heels had worn half-way down and there were actual holes developing in the bottoms ! This is after less than a month of wearing -LRB- and I 'm not mountain-climbing in them either -RRB- . I called the seller -LRB- Footsmart -RRB- and they said they would not take the shoes back as defective since they had been worn , but gave me the manufacturer 's number . The manufacturer said they had a warranty , so I reported the problem . When I did n't hear back , I tried again . I was told it would take two weeks to receive a response . I waited two weeks -LRB- I work for a manufacturer - we respond to customer complaints within one business day -RRB- . No response . Several calls and one month later , I am still waiting to receive a mailing label so I can send the shoes to the manufacturer for evaluation . I will update this if I do receive a satisfactory solution at any point , but as of now , I would say to stay away from these shoes !
 I 'm a size 9 , through and through , and I 've never had the problems with other shoes that I had with these . Do n't get me wrong - I 'm a Softspots fan , but these shoes are not well-designed . I tried these on and could n't take more than 2 steps in them , they hurt my feet so badly . When the shoe bends as you 're walking , the strips on top come together to pinch the skin on the top of my foot .
 This was without a doght the worst pair of shoes I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to purchase . First they were ugly , second they were way too tight , and last they would never be something I would buy . It cost $ 10 to return and I could not have worn them if I wanted to . This was false advertising if there ever was one .
 The quality of the shoe was good , but I returned them because the fit in the heel was too wide . Slipped up and down when I tried to walk .
 These shoes look great but stretched out so much after wearing one time , they are unwearable . I contacted the seller who ignored my inquiry . I wasted my money . Not recommended .
 Softspots Women 's Trinidad Slip-OnLast year I ordered a size 9 in this shoe . It was a too big but I used a sole insert and a heel pad which solved the problem . The shoes wear well and are comfortable . This year I ordered the same shoe style in size 8 1/2 thinking it would fit perfectly . It was so tight I could not get it on . I returned the shoes and reordered a size 9 which fit but are very snug . These shoes have a strong chemical odor . I have aired them for a week with no improvement . The entire closet literally fills with this odor and I now air them in the garage . I may have to return these shoes too .
 Wasted my money on this shoe . The first day my wife wore them they fit perfectly . By the second day , they streched so much she had difficulty keeping them on her feet .
 I ordered a women 's 5 1/2 , but they are much longer - probably 6 or 6 1/2 . They 're a shade more than an inch longer than my other 5 1/2 shoes . Also , they run fairly narrow and the lining started coming out at the toe on first wearing.I would have returned them but lost track of time , so will donate them instead . I 'm going to try the Bates womens shoe instead .

 I brought a pair of these from a company Snow River on Amazon ... . Be careful ladies/gentlemen the boots stitching separated from the sole . I 'm dealing with amazon on this issue ... . WARNING
 Returned this pair of `` UGG '' boots because by internet findings , they were stamped made in `` austrailia '' which the REAL UGGS are now made in China . Certainly had me fooled when I ordered until I examined closely upon receiving item . No problems with customer service and refund appeared promptly .
 I ordered these boots in size 12 m regular toe . They came in a box marked 12 m but the boots were 10 m . They did not fit also they had steel toes that I did not want . I do like these boots I have had 4 pairs that I bought from Sears over the years . I thought I would save some money online but it did n't work out . Just a wast of time . I went back to Sears
 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .

 This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out . Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky , and the fabric does not appear to breathe . I 'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this . For cooler weather , I 'd prefer something like a good pair of tights -LRB- Sugoi for example -RRB- .
 I asked the seller before I bought the shoes whether the color on the amazon page was right , as the shoes appeared turquoise there but dark blue on most of the other pages i 'd seen . He then replied that the amazon color was the actual color and that they used the correct lighting for their pictures etc. . But the color was wrong , they are dark blue not turquoise like I wanted .

 if you order a size 10.5 mens , this pair of shoes will cost you an extra $ 25 ! that is outrageous !
 I bought these because they were so well priced . They are durable , however I have foot pain for the first time ever .
 These shoes felt great at home . Wore them to work and there is a seam where the shoe bends that rubs the side of my feet raw . The shoe bends in a different place than normal shoes because of the safety toe , that takes some getting used too also . Because I wore them I can not return them !
 These shoes hurt my daughter feet which is who they were for . I did not recieve the shoes for approximately 10 days and by the time my daughter came over to try them on and I got on the site to download the info . to return them I was already past the 15 day limit to return . This was a horrible expierience and not sure I will be using amazon anymore .
 I 've been wearing a size 12 for almost 30 years , so I ordered a size 12 , but could n't begin to get my toes in it . I have normal feet -LRB- no wide width shoes in my closet -RRB- . This shoe was incredibly cramped at the toes and loose at the heel . I boxed them back up and sent them back to Eastbay within an hour . I 'm now out $ 26.90 for shipping -LRB- to and fro -RRB- , and do n't even own a pair of shoes yet .
 In this case , the old saying is true

 I bought these boots and after 3to4 months the insides were shot , and this was not from hard work , as I do inventory for my job . the plastic in the heal plate came out and kept cutting into my feet . . just expected for the price and the name a lot better quality .
 I thought steep steps and crutches were bad . These shoes , while super cute , are very clumsy to walk in . Also , the orange leather flower started to fall apart after only a few wears . I regret this purchase .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .

The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .

 I honestly bought these because of the Anne Klein name . These were horrible . The peek toe gripped my big and next to it toe in a stronghold pinching grip ... I do not have fat feet or toes . I walked 10 feet and almost had to crawl back . The curve , which should have been at the arch was on my heel . These are VERY uncomfortable . I found them true to size but not true to the name ... ANNE get these shoes off the market ! Also they looked cute with the quilted texture , but looking down they looked like a blanket . Save your money or you can get the pair I am sending back . They made me sad .
 I bought this show after having my child 's foot measured . He wore it once and his big toe blistered up about double in size from rubbing the inside of the hard shell-top of this shoe . Dad did n't learn his lesson the first time and bought the same shoe a few months later in a larger size of course and the same thing happened again . My advice , buy shoes made for children and not miniature adult shoes .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again .

 in the discription it said these are leather shoes , nothing on these shoes are leather , very disapointed
 These Shoes are ok but they are overpriced . I have a pair of Bostonian Maldens and they are similar quality . The Bostonian cost less than half of the Florsheims . These shoes are average and I do like them but they do not compare to other 225 shoes on the market.Florsheim customer service was hit or miss . I bought the shoes from the Florsheim website and had them shipped to Canada . Half the time I dealt with with a good customer service rep the other half not so much . My big complaint is that I tried to leave a 3 star review on the Florsheim website and they did n't approve it . It seems they screen all their reviews and if they do n't like what the customer has written they will not publish it . I think this is extremely misleading and dishonest.If you can find these shoes for 150 bucks and do n't have to deal with Florsheim directly then I would recommend them . If it was n't for the price and service I would have given 4 start review because the shoes are nice .
 I 'm really disappointed with the quality and workmanship of the Florsheim shoes . The leather is so tough that they are uncomfortable to wear . I wore them just once and will never wear them again . What a shame !
 I have been a fan of this road running shoe for the last 5 years but this new version stinks . As I run , I feel that I am going to slip out . The last three versions had a reinforced stitching around the ankle area . This shoes seems to have done away with that and the tread seems cheaper . It feels like a flimsy $ 35 shoe . I have returned my shoes after trying them out once on the treadmill . Dissapointed ex-reebok fan .
 I had to return these sandals . They were so high . I do wear high heels all the time but not as high . I could n't stand on them . Walking was out of the question . The make was impeccable , though .
 They have a weathered leather appearence and not so comfortable to wear . Would n't recommend to any one . Too late to return .
 The ` toe post ' -LRB- the part between your toes -RRB- broke out of the sole after six months . Unfortunately my girlfriend threw them out before I could send them back to Dr. Marten 's for replacement . They were comfortable while they lasted .
 disappointed . These are very good appearance and materials , but they have a defect in their manufacture , shooting the finger placed it very annoying because of where it should go back and annoying , making it impossible to walk with them , perhaps this the reason for its price so low , Is not an offer , a deception !
 in the discription it said these are leather shoes , nothing on these shoes are leather , very disapointed
 I wore these boots 6 times , less than 1 hour each time , in 3-4 months and the right one is splitting apart . Seller would not back their product !
 These shoes are really great walking shoes , but they are very stinky ! They are lined with suede which made my feet stink after only a few wears . I have to wash my feet as soon as I remove them . . and I have heard the same from other people who own them . They are quite comfortable . . but Tsubo makes similar shoes without the ransid problem .
 These shoes were comfortable when I first tried them on , but when walking I noticed my right foot leaning inwards and upon closer inspection the right heel dips down slightly . Are they seconds or did I get a dud pair ?? Also , I got blisters on each foot the first time I wore them , which was extremely painful walking back to my car 1.5 km away after work ! I did n't think I need to wear socks . I 'm keeping them as they 've been worn otherwise I would return them . I 'm hoping I 'll get used to the heel leaning part and the blisters wo n't be an issue once they 're worn in . They do look nice though and were initially very comfortable , hence the 2 stars .
 I read all the reviews and was expecting a great shoe . Not worth $ 50 . There is no arch support and it was very uncomfortable on my big toe ... where the scoop on the top of the shoe is . Very disappointed . Go with j-41 instead .
 I bought these shoes to wear on the way to work , walking through town and to and from the metro . The first day I had two blisters . They are cheaply made and extremely uncomfortable . They cut into my feet . I would not buy them again .
 The fit is tight . I wear a size 10M but these are narrow . My big toe knuckle rubs the edge and becomes very sore . I have to were socks to prevent blisters making the fit much tighter . I sit driving all day so I just wear them when I need to walk . Cost too high for my amount of wear . I like this style of shoe for work . I had found the brown version at Payless Shoes three years ago ; that 's how long it took to wear that pair out . This year Payless did only the black , white , and some other bright colors . That made me sad . Then after my search for brown athletic mary janes I became sadder . Very hard to find ! Finally I found these .
 The shoes are very cute , but I am WARNING you ! After wearing them several times , they start smell . I am guessing our other reviewers perhaps bought the shoes recently . - Just to clarify , the is the only pair of shoes I have this problem with :-RRB- . The material does n't breathe at all , and the smell is seriously unbearable . After all my efforts at cleaning and spraying , I just had to throw them away . What a waste ! My roommate also had the same problem with a brown pair -LRB- mine were black . -RRB-
 Well it 's nice to read some of the one-star and two-star reviews on this site . I had only heard raving reviews from friends about these shoes , hence why I bought them . I ca n't stand them.First of all , I had to get inserts for arch support . Then I had to deal with them rubbing on my heals . I think I even bled one day . I just thought I had to keep wearing them to break them in . Then I got smart . I now wear socks with them and that helps . It 's the only way I can justify keeping them . I knew that I waited too long to return them to the store and I hate to think I wasted money.I still have to deal with the velcro coming undone so I can only wear them on easy going days . Every time I drive my stick shift the velcro breaks apart . Highly annoying .
 These shoes are really cute , however there are two very big problems with them . The biggest problem is that the velcro on the thin little straps is simply not strong enough to withstand more than a few minutes of walking without pulling loose . I 've cleaned the velcro repeatedly to make it more sticky , but with no success -- the velcro just does n't stay stuck and I 'm left readjusting my shoes every five minutes ! The second problem is that these shoes do n't let enough air flow through ... because I do n't wear socks with them and there is no air flow , they became smelly very quickly . Given these problems , I would not recommend these shoes -- regardless of how cute they are !
 I gave these shoes one star because it looks cute . It has the look of dress shoes with somewhat of a sneaker-feel . I 'm sure there are other shoes out there that can accomplish this without having to deal with the rancid smell . The material is not breathable and make your feet stink ! I 've never had smelly feet issues and they smell only when I wear these shoes . Worse , both my big toes ended up bruised under the nail from wearing these awful shoes after just a few hours . Buyer beware !
 My shoes are fantastically comfy , and surprisingly easy to run in , but for the life of me I ca n't walk in them without my feet turning inwards . These are my only shoes that do that -LRB- it 's not just my funny legs -RRB- and I really ca n't wear them , even though they are cute .
 I am so disapointed but do n't think it 's the shoes fault totally . These are for my work and do n't seem to be bothering anyone else but me . The way the mary jane style cuts across your foot in the front rests right on the bone of your foot . They absolutely kill my feet to the point that I ca n't wear them . I 've tried thick socks as a cushion but it does n't help . Standing or sitting they are fine but I ca n't walk without them hurting.They are not very sturdy either . If you tend to turn your feet at all they wo n't support your foot . I normally love Sketchers but these were not what I expected .
 These shoes are not made in America , they are made in India . The sizing is off , an 8.5 2E is more like a size 7.5 narrow . And they are NOT made of leather . The printing inside the shoe says that only the `` soles '' are made of leather , the rest are `` man-made materials . '' They are the poorest quality shoe I have ever seen.When I bought these shoes the description said `` Stacy Adams and men who know style have been a perfect fit for over 100 years . Founded in 1875 in Brockton , Massachusetts by William H. Stacy and Henry L. Adams , the Stacy Adams Shoe Company has long been a part of American culture . '' They want you to think that they are made in America by Americans who have a 135 + year history and actually care about the product but that 's a lie ! They are really made in India , and very poorly made of sub-standard materials.And just in case they change the description after my complaint , here 's more of what the original description read when I bought this garbage in January , 2012
 Ordered 2 for my sister and wife . Sizes are 1 full size smaller than US standard . Has to exchange the item . Be careful ... Thanks / .

 I bought these for my husband for Xmas and they are already shot . These are thin , cheaply made sneakers . Not really what I use to think of when I purchase Reebok but I guess they are the brand 's really low end model .

 These shoes are gorgeous and well-made . But definitely order up . The EU39 - which supposedly translated to a US9 - was extraordinarily tight and narrow around the heel and toebox . Granted , my feet are more `` US-sized '' than European , but still recommend going up a size if you 're looking for comfort . Pretty high heel ; almost too much for me .

 Having owned multiple Danner boot products over the last thirty years and having been 100 % satisfied with previous purchases , I was very surprised at the poor quality of construction of these Mountain Light Hikers . The front eyelets on the right boot were not installed symetrically and the gussetted tongue on the left boot was installed incorrectly . Ca n't understand how this pair slipped past quality control inspection . I am returning them to Amazon .
 I ordered these to compare with a pair of Alico Summit boots . A stitched on sole was the one thing I really wanted . These absolutely do not support your ankles whatsoever and I personally think it could actually contribute to turning your ankle . Also the leather seemd more like leatherette or vinyl to me . I asked my wife 's opinion as well and she said , &#34; Are these leather ? &#34; The only saving grace for these was that they are made in the USA . If you are looking for a well made quality boot with a sewn on sole you should seriously conider looking at Alico . Danner has goretex and Alico does n't but there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to keeping water out . This is just my opinion and I would go with Danner since it is a sewn on sole only if there were no other options . Overall very disappointed because I was really really wanting to purchase a boot made in America with sewn on soles but I guess I 'll just have to wait .

This is just my opinion and I would go with Danner since it is a sewn on sole only if there were no other options . Overall very disappointed because I was really really wanting to purchase a boot made in America with sewn on soles but I guess I 'll just have to wait .
 Worst Doc Marten 's EVER !! Size and fit OK . BUT the outside sole Cracked/BROKE after a couple use . VERY Disappointed !!! Emailed the the manufacturer about the problem with the sole but never get back or replied to my complaint !!

 I did n't actually get a chance to dance on these shoes as the sizing on Amazon.com was horribly off ! As a dancer who usually dances solely in Bloch shoes , I thought I 'd take advantage of the wonderful sale Amazon was having on Capezio pointe shoes to try another brand and see what I thought . Unfortunately , the recommendation to purchase shoes 1/2 size smaller than street shoe sizing was terribly off and I had to return the shoes . When I checked on the Discount Dance website -LRB- those who had actually shipped the product to me -RRB- , I found that they recommend sizing the Capezio pointe shoes 1 size * larger * than your street shoe size , which is a much more accurate recommendation . I attempted to do an exchange , only to find that the shipper was unable to exchange the too-small shoes for a pair that fit correctly because the inventory had been depleted . Had I received accurate information as to sizing in the first place , I could have taken advantage of the sale pricing to try out a new shoe . I notice that this inaccuracy still has n't been corrected on Amazon 's website , so I would recommend the buyer beware when relying on the sizing information provided on this website if you have never tried this particular shoe before .

 I returned these shoes . I have an average width foot with a narrow heel . I walked right out of these . They probably would have been comfortable for someone with wider feet .
 Do n't get me wrong ; this is a beautiful looking shoe . However , as many Zappos reviews can attest , Clarks ' sizing is often a half to a whole size off . But buying a half-size lower does n't take care of the problem . The shoe will not flex at the proper place , and will lead to a lot of discomfort . I bought the size 8 and wore them on vacation , thinking they 'd be a great walking shoe . They were comfortable for the first 1-2 hours , but for the next 2-4 hours , they caused intense pain because they did n't flex at the same place where my foot would flex . I ended up wearing my Nikes instead , even to nice restaurants because I could n't deal with these shoes . There is nothing more disappointing than buying a shoe for perceived comfort and having it fail !
 I absolutely loved these shoes when I first purchased them in March . I needed them for my job , since I do a lot of standing . The fit was unbelievable good . I wore these shoes everywhere . Now it 's just barely June of this same year , and the sole of one of them is coming off the back . I do n't think I 'll be purchasing Clarks again .
 I liked these shoes however they were 1/2 size too large . I had to return the shoes for a refund .
 I would not recommend this shoe to anyone . I wore it for less than a month and it fell apart .
 As of today one month later , I have never recieved the product and I have never recieved any information I tried to obtain wondering where this shoe was . I tried to track it ; I show it delieved to city of Industry , delivery pending ??? Please find out about this asap and get back with me immediately . Poor follow-up
 I purchased these slip ons because I wanted to get my mom a different grasshopper shoe , since she loves them so . Unfortunately , one look at the shoes and they went right back into the box and sent back . My mom has really wide feet , due to a condition that causes her to have high levels of water retention in her legs and feet . If she 's on her feet for too long , her feet further swell . These shoes did n't look capable of holding a regular wide foot let alone an extra , extra wide one . Maybe as a regular shoe they 're awesome , but if you 're looking for a pair to accomodate a wide foot , look elsewhere .
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 el producto aun no ha llegado al lugar de destino , tiene mas de un mes de retraso y aun no ha sido despachado para recibirlo en mi local ...
 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .
 I 've had good luck with Stacy Adams ' shoes but with this pair I wore them once and the finish began flaking off the right shoe . You could rub a cloth against the shoe and the finish came right off . Hassle-free returning the shoes but I had to pay return postage .
 The service and everything was fine , I just did not like the product . Instead of being cute like Uggs are -LRB- which is what I was looking for -RRB- , they were big and clunky . They looked like men 's work boots . I hated them .
 nice boots , soft , warm inside , but too bad they sent me two different sizes ! i have 11.5 mens , and they sent me a mens 11 and a mens 12 and i ordered size 12 . boo hoo .
 Typical chinese fit , too wide in heels , too narrow in toe . In spite of warmbat australia logos all over , the little tag deep inside says made in China . At least one size too small , returned for refund
 JUNK ! Shoes started to rip only after a couple of weeks . Amazon is TERRIBLE about returns ! The claim they did not get the shoes that we mailed back . The whole thing was really a mess . Dr. Martens just are n't what they used to be !
 I 've been buying the Lily Waters Tara tote for years . I have 5 , and for Christmas received the Tara tote in Twilight . Beware ! The styling has changed . There is ONE interior pocket ... used to have 6 like the Vera Bradley bags . I 'm very disappointed ! Might as well spend a bit more and get a Bradley bag if you like the interior organization .
 I received a glass instead of this bag.I returned the glass & most of the money back and never got the purse .
 I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run . I did n't really buy this a3 for its `` functionality '' but rather the look . I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool . However , I DID NOT at all feel being `` propelled through every foot '' , and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff . I even poked it with my hand , oh man it 's hard . I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness , but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement.BTW , if your feet are wide and flat like mine , it 's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes . *** UPdate *** November 15 , 2006It 's been 2 months since I 've been wearing these shoes , and I 've changed my opinion them . Once you get use to the a3 sequence , they are actually quite comfortable . The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now . Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible .
 Well I guess the title says most of it . I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT . Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed . I 've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dose n't work they look the same as before . But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them . They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I would n't recommend them .
 One of the eyelets busted and now I ca n't wear them . Just a big waste of money for me . They felt comfortable the short time I was able to wear them .

 The overall look and construction are fine ; however , when used in wet conditions -LRB- as jungle boots are to be used -RRB- the material on top of the sole began falling apart right away . It appears to be either a real poor quality leather or even cardboard . Boots were used at the Boundary Waters in Minnesota . Drained well and otherwise held up very well . If you plan to use them one trip these are probably worth the cheap price , but you 'll need to put a shoe insert inside increasing the cost some what . If you plan to use multiple times , my U.S. Army issued jungle boots from 1985 held up great , so go the extra expense for regular issue jungle boots .
 I was not impressed with this shoes , very uncomfortable and they are not especially flattering on the feet . They look better in the magazine or on the screen !
 I wore these for approximately five minutes before ditching them - they have zero arch support and pinch in the toes . These shoes were an incredible waste of money !
 This shoe is just beautiful but not very comfortable . That would not have mattered because it is so good looking except that the wood chips off the bottom . I wore them once and a huge chunk of wood chipped off the front -LRB- of the toe area -RRB- and another small piece off the back . Wood looks nice but does n't necessarily hold up well .
 I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly . I have extra wide feet , so I was hoping these would be wide . They were NOT at all . Maybe a medium width , but more like narrow . Too bad . I wish I could find shoes that work . I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress , but wo n't look like one without the proper shoes .
 I bought this shoe for use working in a theatre . After a few months I had to have it re-heeled , and then shortly after the heel broke right off , causing me to fall down the stairs . I 'd beware of this shoe , not made well at all .

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 I just bought these sandals . I was disappointed in how cheap they look in person . Had I looked at them in a store I might have paid $ 15 . Also , while they feel comfortable to step into - the patent `` leather '' cut my feet after a few minutes of walking . In addition , the cross strap `` bled '' black color and particles ? on my feet . Avoid .
 I got the gold and the color was more of a yellowy brown , then a sparkly gold . Just not what I expected . The shoes were quite stiff and even though I have this style of shoe in a suede , they were just too small with the flexible and ungiving patent material . I 'd recommend going up a 1/2 size if chosing this material

 This are nice shoes , but when I washed them in the washing machine , -LRB- I always wash this kind of shoes in washing machine , and never had problems -RRB- , the plastic parts -LRB- faux leather -RRB- turn from black to white .

 Unlike other Mezlan shoes I 've purchased , this shoe is made of cheap leather . It was on sale from just over $ 200.00 to $ 75.00 . I know why now . The Mezlan Carmichaels are far superior to these shoes . I would definitely not recommend them .
 These are by far the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn . They are stiff as a board and have no flexibility when you walk . They look cute on , but are unbearable to wear .
 These shoes are cute , but they have a weird fit . The back of the heel comes up higher than regular shoes and it gave me quite a blister when I wore them for a walk . They are not terrible . Perhaps I should have bought a half size smaller because there are n't any laces to tighten them up .
 At first these are ok - but throughout the day - they wore on my heel , and my heels got rubbed raw and sore . Could not wait to get them off - I am returning these .
 So disappointed in these boot . They do not stay on and the velcro is cheap and keeps coming undone . Would not recommend buying .
 after inspecting the measurements provided by this seller for baby shoe sizes i then measured my child 's foot and based on those measurements , purchased the size indicated by the seller.upon receiving the shoes , i noticed immediately that the shoes were over an inch too large and then remeasured my child 's foot and re-compared it to their size chart . their size chart is off.as a result , i returned the shoes because they simply did not fit . i was then sent one email confirming my desire to return and eventually one email that that my return had been received . i have not yet received the exchanged item i have requested.i do not recommend this seller . they do not know how to process returns and/or exchanges . nor do they know how to issue refunds .
 I bought these for my 5 month old daughter who is on the big side -LRB- 17lbs -RRB- , but listened to the reviews that said the boots sized large so to size down . I got size 1-2 and they were way too small . I think they might have fit , but I could n't get her foot in past the back of the shoe - it 's like the stitching prevents you from putting them all the way on . I 'm going to return these and get the ones that have velcro on the back .
 I was so in love with these Mocassins and very excited to receive them . They definitely do run large so order down . Once my baby actually fit the shoes I realized that her heel does n't fit all the way down in the shoe so they fall off so easily . Since I had kept them large and waited for her to fit in them I could not return -- they have never been worn . I 'm actually surprised that no one else has had this problem . I am so bummed but I do love the look . It is like the stitching in the back prevents her heel sliding down all the way . It is very frustrating and I 'm considering another pair with no stitching on the back but I 'm afraid all Minnetonka moccassins could be ill fitting .
 Only wore these boots 4 or 5 times and when I returned home the other day it felt like something had stuck to the bottom ; instead , there was a square inch rip in the rubber sole at the ball of the foot . I thought these boots would be a lot more durable .
 I was disappointed in this shoe . Even though it seems very well made , it is not comfortable . The construction / stitching near the little toe created a pressure point . I tried different sock weights without success .
 These shoes rubbed where the leather was stitched on the top and were not as comfortable as I was expecting . I ordered some softspots . I hope they will be a little more comfortable .
 These are nice shoes ; however , the right one caused significant pain to my right foot where the little strap connects to the side of the shoe . I was on vacation and as we were walking from the hotel to Thanksgiving dinner at a nice restaurant , my foot was hurting so much that most of the way there and all the way back I walked with my right foot half-out of the shoe ... very uncomfortable . I have not worn them for walking very far since then .
 I have always wanted a pair Clark 's shoes but could never justify spending that much money on a pair of shoes for myself . I finally caught a break and was able to get this shoe at a very reasonable price and I have to say ... Ouch ! These shoes hurt . They are very true to size , the proper width , etc , but the little strap that comes around the vamp to the side of the shoe digs into your foot . It is excruciating by the end of the day . I had to raid the first aid kit at work for band-aids to put over the spot that was being tortured on my foot.This is the absolute wrong shoe for me , but it may be great for someone else .

 These boots arrived with three separate blue ink stains on them , as well as a dark sticky spot of glue on the front that wo n't come off . Not sure if I 'll return them since they were only $ 12.00 ...
 Do not purchase these shoes . These are the worst shoes I have ever bought . The soles cracked the arch broke and the stitching is already coming out . All of this within 2 months . I 'm done with wolverine . For what you pay them they could give you a better shoe . I gave them a second chance after the last pair I had had the soles come apart . Like it was put together in pieces . If I could I 'd rate it a zero ! They are n't the same company that Dad used to wear on the construction site .
 I have worn this model of work shoe for years . After 2 months of wear the bottom soles have split . Why bother paying the extra for Wolverines ? This makes me sad as I have loved the fit of these for over 10 years .
 Do not buy these shoes !!!!!!!!!!!!!! The soles crack after a month or so of moderate use . Wolverine will send you replacement shoes , but those soles crack also . When the soles crack , water can enter into the shoe . Check out other sites , you will find many other threads detailing the same problem . They finally sent me cost for the shoes plus return shipping . They stood behind the product , but why buy defective shoes ?
 These shoes were recommended by my brother so a pair was purchased . Within 3 months they had become so uncomfortable they had to be replaced .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 I bought these boots as a Christmas present for my son . He wore them for about 6 weeks before they started to fall apart . After 3 months they were totally worn out and are now in the garbage . The soles separated from the shoe . These boots are worthless in my opinion .

 First , I have to admit the shoes look gorgeous . That is why I ordered them and gave 2 stars here . But it is so difficult for me to walk because the wedge heels lack elasticity so for every step the shoes would slip off the heels of my feet . I kind of feel myself like an acrobat on these high wedge heels . Have to return them although they look beautiful .
 The shoes are great looking , but the heels are very heavy . The style of the top of the shoes is flattering , however , there is nothing to help keep the shoes on my feet . There is no flexability to the heel at all , so when my foot bends ... the heel stays down and I walked right out of the shoes . I do n't care for ankle straps , but I think this shoe needs something . I usually LOVE the comfort of Nine West shoes , so I was disappointed .
 Looks can be deceiving ! This shoe is so cute and stylish , but it hurts my foot like crazy . I used shoe stretch , asked my daughter to walk in them , hoping for some kind of relief . The sole is hard an does not bend making me walk very strange and uncomfortable . NOT a walking shoe , but if you want to sit and be cute , nice shoe ! Sorry Nine West .
 I 've own 100 's of shoes . These are the first to hurt my foot . Something is poking me . Made in China ! Will find some New Balance made in U.S.A.
 I still didnt receive the shoes ?????????????? its been a month now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Received these shoes for Christmas and like other reviewers , was more than a little surprised at the extent of the `` distressing '' that Sketchers has applied to the shoe . These shoes literally look as thought the UPS truck that delilvered them actually ran them over a few times . There are strange and rather non-stylish black smudges all over the shoe . People have commented that the shoes look like those of someone that has been changing oil and rotating tires all day . The pictures do not show this . Indeed , I think online is the only mechanism that these shoes will be sold ... if you saw them in the store you would probably throw up !
 I ordered these shoes based on the picture provided , when they arrived i was dissappointed the color was much darker than it looks and it looked much different .
 SHOES WAS NOT EXCALTY THE SAME AS PIC SHOWN ON WEB SITE IT WAS KIND OF USED ...
 I have to say that the distressed look is fairly ugly . These do NOT look like the pictures on amazon.com . Also , these shoes are so wide on my feet . This is ridiculous honestly . I wish I could return them for a full refund including them paying for my shipping , because if I could , then I would . There is absolutely not support in these shoes . I ca n't even still my own orthotics in these shoes to fix it because they are so wide . I normally buy wider shoes like new balances because my feet are wider than normal and my feet fall right out of these . There is no way that I could wear these for more than fifteen minutes without them hurting my feet or just pissing me off since my feet keep popping out . Unless you are into what looks like worn shoes that are extra wide , then do not buy these .
 Hey , if these shoes are supposed to have the ` distressed ' look , then it needs to be displayed on the picture and told in the description ! Like the other two kind ladies who gave their review , I too , received the pair with black streaks and they looked filthy . I did n't expect that so I returned them and although I want to get another replacement , I see that the other woman ordered a pair and got the same streaks again on her second reordered pair so I 'm hesitant to proceed with another order . I too will be pursuing a full refund for these shoes .
 I experienced the exact same problem with my order as the lady who posted ahead of me . The shoes arrived extremely dirty and distressed , like they had been left out in the rain . I contacted Amazon 's customer service , told them about the problem , and they immediately agreed to ship another pair free of charge . The new pair arrived looking exactly the same as the first pair and I am livid . I will be returning both pairs of shoes and insisting on a refund .
 I bought this sneakers because I considered Skechers a big reliable brand . I was so mistaken ... I have owned them for 2 and a half months and the sole is already worn out and one of them has even a small hole in it . I am not much of a sportsman y I use them only for work -LRB- at the office -RRB- . I have had similar sneakers from another leading brand for more than five years now . You see , I am not like a `` shoe-destroyer '' or something.Conclusion
 I bought this shoe for use working in a theatre . After a few months I had to have it re-heeled , and then shortly after the heel broke right off , causing me to fall down the stairs . I 'd beware of this shoe , not made well at all .
 I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly . I have extra wide feet , so I was hoping these would be wide . They were NOT at all . Maybe a medium width , but more like narrow . Too bad . I wish I could find shoes that work . I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress , but wo n't look like one without the proper shoes .

 I ordered these shoes for a girlfriend as I prefer stilettos and heels over wedges . The shoes look gorgeous on her feet as I would expect from any J Lo shoes , but she complained about the tightness of the vamp on her toes after wearing them while standing and walking . I would recommend these shoes for a dinner date or to just sit and look pretty but not for dancing or events where you must stand and walk a great deal .
 These shoes are absolutely adorable ; however , I 've never managed to get them on my infant daughter and probably never will be able to . I do n't know what genius thought that having to try to manuever a tight elastic cord loop over a button was the best fastening mechanism for baby shoes , but I assure you , it is n't ! They 're too tight to just shove on over the foot without undoing the straps too . By all means buy them if you enjoy making babies cry !
 The Propet Model 3910 size 12M shoes that I received were too short . The shoes were not just `` a little short '' , they were short by about two sizes . I did not have the means to measure the actual size but I estimated that the marked size 12 shoes were , probably , size 10 or smaller . I ordered the Propet brand because I have an older Propet size 12 pair that fit well . I returned the shoes and received a credit without event .
 The shoe size is all wrong . I ordered size 10D , the size must be for some other country . The size I received was more like 9D . Would like to send shoes back .
 This is a nice enough shoe but the pair I bought came with a strong chemical smellthat takes weeks to dissipate -- and several months in , it is still noticeable.Probably has something to do with the processing of the leather . Anyway , I have neverhad a shoe that smelled this strong and for this long . It 's not an unpleasant smellbut it is very noticeable . Maybe I just got a bad pair . Otherwise , the shoe is fine .
 I bought , looked , called Reebok , and returned item because I wanted leather shoes.I wrote a review and was rejected because Reebok 's phone number was it . Amazon , I wish you had returned my original so that I could amend it.The gist is that there shoes are NOT leather . See Reebok 's response to my query.Thank you for contacting Reebok.com customer service.The Reebok Classic Leather shoes are made of the synthetic soft leather .

 I purchased Reebok shoes from Marcus Uniforms . I had this same pair of shoes previously purchased elsewhere and they were perfectly comfortable from day one which is the reason I wanted another pair when my first pair was getting worn out . From the start they hurt the top of my left foot on top left side where the tongue is sewn in corner . I wore them maybe 6 times -LRB- they were not dirty or really worn etc when I returned them . . were in like new condition -RRB- . . kept hoping they would stretch a bit and not hurt any longer but never happened and explained this to the customer rep when I initially spoke to her . Contacted Marcus Uniforms and told them what I said above . I had to pay to send them back to them and was told if they looked at shoe and seen nothing wrong I would have to pay . . again . . to get them back . They told me they seen nothing wrong and had to pay $ 10.00 in Postal Money Order only to get them back again . I had a nice customer rep who tried to help but she kept deferring to a gentleman who she stated was the owner and he refused to do anything about it . . no replacement , no credit for shoes ... nothing . I will not be purchasing from this place again . These shoes cost me a lot of money after all the shipping back and forth plus purchase price and now I have a pair of shoes that I can not even wear . I am not a happy customer.UPDATED AGAIN -- I contacted Reebok directly and spoke to the supervisor . Told me to send the shoes back to them with a tracking number which I did the next day . I called him and gave him tracking number and he immediately sent me the same brand new shoes to me before even receiving my defective pair . They fit and feel great ! Definately something wrong with the pair from Marcus Uniforms . Thoroughly disgusted with them for their horrible customer service !

 I loved these shoes and begged my feet to be slimmer to fit into them , but alas , it was n't to be . I ended up giving them away to my friend 's sister-in-law , who is the same size as me , and younger and slimmer . Unfortunately , they were too narrow for her as well , so she passed them on too . It was a crying shame , as they were beautiful . I hope they have gone to a good home . Next time , I will just return for a refund .

 I 've worn the Tommy Hilfiger flag shoe for years and liked them . But , this time I am disappointed . The shoe has gone cheap . The leather is cheaper , the flag symbol is sewn differently and less stylish . The insole is glued on , so ca n't easily be removed to place sole inserts . This will be the last pair of Hilfiger shoes I buy . They 've obviously changed materials and construction to cut costs , and it shows .

 I normally wear a size 10 1/2 shoe . I have always bought Clark 's because of their comfort and durability . I purchased a size 11 med . They were so tight and uncomfortable . I had to send them back and pay shipping both ways . What a waste of money . I will buy them locally to assure a comfortable fitting .
 After a min of putting them on , I felt the blood flow being cut off from my toes . I ordered a size 5 -LRB- true to size -RRB- , but the toe opening is so small ... I own a pair of Penthouse shoes , and their toe opening is a little larger than these.Returning them .
 Sole
 First of all , the size chart is way off . I ordered size 9 -LRB- men 's -RRB- / 10 -LRB- women 's -RRB- for my husband , who wears size 9 , but he could not even put them on . I tried the slippers myself -LRB- I wear women 's size 9 -RRB- and , even though there was still some space for probably half a size length-wise , they were way too narrow even for me.Both upper and sole material is very tough , unflexible and as `` comfy '' as cardboard . I could not walk in these slippers , only drag or slide my feet . Inside was n't as soft as in my LL Bean sheepskin slippers.On top of that I had to pay to return this item to Amazon -LRB- there is no `` does not fit '' return reason -RRB- .
 These slippers are anything but comfortable . Besides the sizing being to small , I felt like I was putting my foot into a kid 's slipper . The width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone 's foot , and the inside material is also anything but comfortable .
 It is ironic that you would send this to me . I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers . I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas . Everyone had cozy slippers but me ... SO instead of paying over $ 60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon . I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match . I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner . The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off . I was upset and sewed them , and glued them . The following week the left slipper fell apart . I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers , they were $ 29.00 . SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed . Please forward to WARMBAT .
 After buying these for my girlfriend of 5 years . She broke up with me and never talked to me again . Worst shoes ever ...
 I purchased a pair of Clark 's Roar Boot in Black just before Christmas 2008 , and began using it intermittently with 2 other pairs of Timberline boots . I only use these boots during the Winter months in the Chicagoland area as we have plenty of snow here . I do not use them once Spring arrives . Notice that I do not wear the Clark 's Roar Boots a lot since I have 2 pairs of some other boots to use.All the same , the sole of the Roar Boots , specially by the heels , are deteriorating at a rate that I find troublesome given the price of the boots and the reputation of Clark 's products . The material used apparently is substandard.Most often times Western manufacturers either set up Chinese manufacturing operations with design of the plant , and Western management team utilizing Chinese workforce . In other instances , Western companies subcontract to Chinese manufacturers by sharing the designs and specifications , and ask the Chinese to deliver products to specs . I do n't know what happened here , but the material used to make my boots are unacceptable as they do not stand up to light use in Chicago Winter .
 The left shoe deflates air like balloon with the sound and the feel of stepping on leaking balloon with every step . This product was not inspected , I hate buying a made in china product , half of the quality I 'm used to from Clark 's . There is something to be said about buying shoes from a store as I would not have bought them if I tried them on .
 I love this design of shoe , and the clarks Roar look really good . I got through two pairs in the space of 8 months . the first pair came apart at the heel -LRB- inside -RRB- but i thought it must just be a duff pair , so i got a second lot and after just two months , the sole started coming away from the shoe ! i had to glue it back together which is not something i want to be doing when i spend $ $ s on a pair of shoes.they look good , but are made very poorly .
 I owned/wore these boots for less than 6 months.I was initially very happy with the boot . But Which started after one weekthat changed quickly . They were unconformable , and I developed a callous on the side of my foot from them . On top of that , The tread started wearing away after the first week.after that the sole completely separated from the boot . I had to supergoo it in place . I 've since bought a set on martins that have lasted 6 months with out a problem and no signs of wear . These shoes were poorly designed.I 've owned several pairs of Clarkes and used to swear by them . I do a lot of walking , as I run a large hospital , and expect a shoe to hold up for this kind of money . I would n't recommend them , except for the occasional night out . I was very disappointed . On top of that I had trouble contacting the company to tell them what happened.Poor customer service . If you buy these boots , View them as a cosmetic accessory that will not hold up . Read some of the other similar reviews if you need verification.I 've steered many people to Clarke 's , but that has changed due to this bad experience . Especially with customer service . Dr.Martins are made much better and they offer more contemporary designs than they used to be known for . try them out .
 i next day ordered a pair of boots for my daughter who is attending a week long outdoor camp at wolf ridge in finland mn . while the kaya sorel boot is a keeper for warmth and daylong outdoor activites , it is NOT the boot as advertised in the description or photo . the collar at the top of the boot had a black faux fur collar . the boot we were sent had a plain puffy sewn collar . as i can not return the boot for the advertised version in time for her camp experience , we will have to keep this boot , but she is sorely disappointed . every girl needs her cute factor as well as warmth !

 Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit . Very unhappy with return policy . Wondering if I 'll ever get my credit .
 These shoes do not last very long and they tend to size differently between the left and right shoe . In other words , the size tolerances for the shoes are unusually large which tends to indicate a below average quality shoe .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 I actually came across these shoes on Amazon again because I am looking for a pair to replace them . I bought these in wide width from a specialty store . They offered me a great deal and I thought they were so comfortable . The shoes were tight but I thought they would `` break in . '' By the time they broke in I had lost most of the foam because it seemed to melt to my socks/tights and come out bit by bit with every wearing . I actually lined the interior of the shoe with grip tape just to make them last a little longer . And the strap across the top never stopped feeling like it was practically breaking my foot.If you 're going to invest the money , there are much better brands out there . It 's a shame , because these shoes were so cute !
 The one thing I liked about the shoe was that it was patent leather . It ends there -- Much too clunky looking -- and did n't fit well . Certainly was not the comfort I was looking for .
 i ordered these because of the stylish nature of the product , they are so cute ! but once i had them on my feet i felt amazingly robbed . the way they are described left me to believe they would be comfortable but in fact they were the most uncomfortable shoe i have ever worn . the tight side elastic and hard shell of the shoe left me desirous of nothing else but to be out of them ; the pain only stopped as long as i was standing , putting pressure onto the sole of the shoe which indeed , was very soft . the moment i lifted my foot to take a new step forward the pain returned , clenching around my foot . generally id say i like shoes to be a bit loose , but these were just ridiculously tight . : -LRB-
 This shoe looked so adorable and I could hardly wait to get it ! When the box came , I ripped it open and to put them on right away and much to my dismay I could hardly cram my feet into them . The length was too short and they were n't wide enough -LRB- I had ordered the wide width -RRB- . I was so disappointed to have to send them back ...

 These are most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn . I understand that there is a break in period for leather , but you ca n't possibly wear these enough times to ever break them in -LRB- if they ever do -RRB- . I feel like I have two boards strapped to my feet . They pinch in the heel and leave blisters within a few hours . The manufacturer may want to condition , rub 'em or whatever to make these a bit softer before they sell them .
 These were the most uncomfortable boots I 've ever worn . Even though I wore heavy socks with them they still rubbed my ankles raw and caused blisters on my heels .
 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!

 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .

 I wore these 2 times & one of the heels started peeling from the rest of it . A lady complimented them but noted that the same thing happened to her . This company was nice enough to refund me my money when I let them know what happened .

 I got these thinking oh how cute ! But they did n't fit ! The opening is very tight and there is no way of adjusting them because they do n't lace up or anything . It 's a slip on ! It was just too tight and too snug a fit . I returned them .
 These shoes are definately not for you if you intend to be on your feet a lot , especially at work . The sparkles started falling off of the shoes within the first few hours of wearing them , and the bottom sides of the shoe are peeling away from the leather already , only after 1 weekk !!! I DO N'T recommend them to anyone else .

 These are ok ... they look great , but the lining by the heel of my left boot always gets wadded up making it difficult to get the boot on . I have other Frye boots that I love and have n't had any trouble with . I 'm would n't buy these again .
 The shoes look nice from a distance , but the quality is pretty low.Cheap leather -LRB- if that 's even leather -RRB- .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 The boot looked to be of very good quality . . but , sadly , they seemed sized too small . I ALWAYS wear a size 10 . . but could barely fit my feet in the boots ... and could not zip them up at all . I gave them away , as I missed the return deadline because I live OS and had mailed them to my sister in the U.S. Too bad .
 Any shoe that does n't come larger than a 7.5 is pointless.What about the women who wear size 12 or 13 , what are we supposed to wear ?
 These shoes look nice and are reasonably priced yet after three years I find myself in need of navy shoes again . I only wore the shoes intermittently and only on Sunday 's , so not much wear and tear at all . Yet the stripe that runs down side of shoe all the blue has rubbed off and look tacky now . Disappointed . Quality does n't match looks .

 These are most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn . I understand that there is a break in period for leather , but you ca n't possibly wear these enough times to ever break them in -LRB- if they ever do -RRB- . I feel like I have two boards strapped to my feet . They pinch in the heel and leave blisters within a few hours . The manufacturer may want to condition , rub 'em or whatever to make these a bit softer before they sell them .
 these shoe is not the same that i have before , this dont have cushion , its hard on the foot , compared to the one i got couple of years ago , i still have it , and even untill now after so many years of using it , is still comfy compared to this one ! this sucks ! im thinking of returning this .
 Although this shoe is really lacking in the comfort area , I gave it 2 stars for price as I purchased it for just under $ 25 . I 'll be sure to wear them when much walking is n't required .
 Wow , since brutta means ugly , Brutini is an appropriate name for this shoe . It basically looks like a womans shoe , but maybe that is the idea .
 The shoe is a bout two sizes larger than what you anticipate . The style of the shoe seems a bit exaggerated in real life , which makes you feel like you 're wearing stylish elf shoes .
 I bought these shoes , size 9 , but unfortunately they are smaller size . I could not even wear them as there was not given the size at all . The purchased item can not be sent back from Georgia - the country if my residence . It means that I paid for nothing .
 I have always had great respect for Clark Shoes ; however these classic oxfords are not in the same league . Clarke is known for comfortable `` walking '' shoes -- these shoes are like walking on stones with your bare feet ; no shock absorbing quality at all . Though these shoes are great looking and appear to be well made for an amazing price , if you have any issues with your legs
 For a flat shoe , this is surprisingly uncomfortable . There is no arch support at all . The insole is hard and thin . Worst of all , the thin strap running around the top of the foot was already cutting into my skin the second I slipped it on . I ca n't imagine walking in it ! Additionally , the design has the effect of making your foot look extremely wide .
 Warm and comfortable , I loved these boots . However , after only a year of part-time wear -LRB- October - March -RRB- , the sole started to come apart . Then today , the zipper failed , during only their second season of use . Sadly , they 're in the garbage .
 First of all , I 'm Mary Graham , not Jessica Shoemaker . I 'd really like these shoes if the white part were black . Please make some of those shoes , all black , the way you used to .
 We had bought such shoes from a store in the US last year for our 4 year old son and he loved them.Since we live in Europe and do n't find them here , when I saw them on Amazon , I decided to please him again and ordered a pair.When they arrived , what a desappointment
 I bought these shoes in Miami Red for my teenage daughter . They looked so cool in the picture , but we were extremely disappointed when they arrived . Instead of the stripes being bright they were extremely dull and the color in the picture is nothing like the color on the actual shoes . Also , the stripes are fuzzy . It 's extremely wierd . We have n't decided if we are keeping them or not . I think maybe the all white shoes or the ones with the dk . blue stripes might be OK , but those stripes are probably fuzzy -LRB- wierd -RRB- too .
 The picture does NOT do this product justice . I blindly bought the shoe since it was on sale -LRB- and also because it is pink and I am a big fan -RRB- . When I opened the box and saw how HIDEOUS the product was , I didnt even bother trying it on . I resealed the box and sent it back for return , IMMEDIATELY . Unless you dont care about how a shoe looks -LRB- in that case , go buy a $ 5 shoe at payless ! -RRB- , this is NOT the shoe to buy.Trust me , I would give this 0 stars if I could .
 The shoe was defective due to the inner sole being totally lifted . Amazon sent a replacement but it had the same defect . Product looks good but not as comfortable as other kid brands such as UMI or Stride Rite .

 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 These shoes were cheap enough so I tried them.Walking on my feet was a nightmare.It was a bad time and I 'll never buy a bargain shoe again .

 These are the most dreadfully uncomfortable shoes I 've put on in years , really clunky . This is the last time I 'll ever buy a brand of shoe I do n't know before actually trying it on .

 the laceless design give you a loose fit , but it gives you wierd ball feeling , and it is really hard to get your feet into it without the lace . i wo n't buy another one .

 Do not waste your money . Not water proof and fell apart on my first day of using it . Tried to return it to the merchant but was redirected to the manufacturer .
 I bought these boots in the middle of December , and found them to be very well suited to what I needed them for -LRB- working as a cart attendant in western Michigan -RRB- . Unfortunately , over the last month and a half , they have developed a number of problems of varying severity have ensued -LRB- listed in chronological order -RRB- :1 -RRB- The insoles that were included in the boot wore out within a week of their arrival . Not a big deal , but it did make the boots rather uncomfortable until I could replace them .2 -RRB- One of the eyelets yanked out of the leather . This did n't impede my ability to wear them any .3 -RRB- One of the laces broke , which was of course easily replaced .4 -RRB- Holes began to develop in the sole . It is at the point now where they need to replaced soon.Now , I walk pigeon toed and I am particularly hard on shoes , but 1.5 months seems to be a very short life span . I 've gotten a longer lifetime out of my cheap wal-mart tennis shoes .
 I bought these for my husband who loved them when he first tried them on . After the second time using them the sole came apart ! They are flat and now cause him back pain . We bought inserts but they can only do so much . The boot is also not as warm as you would think.Overall , not worth the money ! Spend a little bit more for a durable boot . I am very dissappointed with this purchase .
 I bought these boots end of November for my husband and he has just recently started using them in the snow here in Minn. . He has only used them a handful of times and they are now coming apart between the leather and the rubber . Also the rubber is splitting from the leather to the rubber vertically . We already kind of tried to ignore the other fact that they tend to have a traction that holds the snow causing it to be slippery when coming inside to our hardwood floors . Also that we had to waterproof them to keep them better isulated from wetness . They are SNOW BOOTS right ? . are n't they suppose to be able to go into the snow ? . The sealent we purchased from a local shoe and boot store works wonders however we are very displeased at the fact that BRAND NEW boots purchased 3 months ago are already falling apart , not to metion they have n't been worn 3 solid months and he only wears them to go out in the snow and for nothing else like doing oudoor work and the such . I would definitely not reccommend these boots to anyone . Save your money and find another type .
 Sadly , these boots fell apart in one week . I would not buy them again for any cost . Beware . Your money is better spent on a more expensive boot .
 Got boots 2 weeks ago ... no soft insoles !!! ... whatever ???? . A 15 dollar pair of dr. Scholls later things are going great . Not exactly waterproof but okay . Then yesterday an eyelets ripped out while I was tying laces . $ $ $ $ $ wasted , find another brand . Thank you .
 I bought these from Sports Authority , after reading on Amazon that they are waterproof . Beware
 bOUGHT THESE FROM THE SAME SELLER ON eBAY FOR $ 24.99 , thought I was getting a good deal since the local retail store wants $ 60 for them . HA ! These were a christmas gift to my husband and after only having them since November the inseam is ripped wide open the eyelets are falling off , they are supposed to be waterproof and they are not ! I complained to the seller who told me to call the manufacturer yet the seller did n't have their number ! How do you sell a product from a manufacturer you deal with ALL the time yet not have their number !! Seller knows they are selling crap boots . Got my money back from paypal though so I 'm happy . Buyer beware these boots are crap .
 The boots are fine if you want to use them once a month and then throw them out after a year . These boots have lots of complaints about them from various people for their shoddy quality . The best thing is trying to contact the manufacturer is one of the biggest pains I have ever had . I would steer clear of these boots unless you need a throw away pair .

 When I received these , I noticed that the sneakers seemed quite a bit darker than depicted on the website . They also run a bit small . I should have ordered a half size higher . There was also a loose thread on the pair I received . They looked cute , but just did not work out for me .
 I usually love Kenneth Cole shoes , but these ones look and feel really cheap . I bought mine on the end of November and they lasted me a month and a half and they already broke . The sole came off by the heal and there 's no way to fix them . Really disappointed .
 Have had a pair of Kenneth Cole New York 's that I could not be happier with . They no longer make them , so I thought I would give these a try . Not even close to the same level of quality . The entire shoe is synthetic . Synthetic uppers were not real leather , and the finish scuffed right off the toes the first day I wore them . You ca n't repair the scuff , because it pulled the color right off the shoe , and you ca n't put shoe polish on synthetic material . Very displeased with the quality of these shoes . Will not be buying reactions ever again .
 Very disappointed , very hard leather , shinny look ok for a prep school teen but not for me . I own several pairs of Kenneth Cole shoes and this is the first time that I had to return because that was no way I could wear it . On the plus side , Amazon price and shipping time always the best ...
 Website description says leather . When you actually get the shoes , you will notice on the tongue they clearly state man made upper . For $ 70 + , these are a rip-off . I can get fake leather shoes that look almost identical to these and are about the same quality for $ 30 at any of those shoe warehouse type stores . Returned immediately .
 This shoe is so ugly i bought it without looking at top view , the look like Bozos shoes when you are walking , the sole is horrendous , makes too much sound and the back of my foot is destroyed . You have been warned .
 I am using these shoes for 2 months and its quality is quite bad , I 've never bought shoes so bad , look like cardboard , so little time they have used seem to take positions for longer than 1 year , I do n't recommend this product cause they are really bad , I hope the store or brand to respond but definitely I will not buy Kenneth Cole again
 The shoes are good looking enough , but they squeak too much and , as other reviewers have mentioned , are stiff and dig at the back of your ankle as you walk .
 I purchased these shoes and they squeaked so loudly , I had to return them . They are not of any minimum quality . Very disappointed .
 Shoe shipped to me with two different size , one is 8 and another is 9 . I have received refund yr corp released.I 'm very satisfied with your reply .
 i weared it once and craked on me , super cheap quality and made me look fool at the partydont recommend it to any one , i also didnt get a refund yet , which im going to contact my credit card for this
 These shoes are beautiful and elegant , but quite hard on the ankle . Not comfortable at all , contrary to all other Kenneth Cole shoes I had .
 I have owned many Kenneth Cole shoes in the past and these are by far the worst shoes i have ever owned . The fit of these shoes will leave your feet blistered and in pain , do n't waste your money on these shoes .
 Hello . I bought a pair of Ken Cole Reaction Sim-Plicity Oxfords -LRB- Brown , size 11 -RRB- and have found them to be of very poor quality . I 've had them for 3 weeks , and both shoes ' upper is tearing away from the glued-on sole . I do n't abuse them -- this is just from walking.I wrote the company an e-mail , and it has n't been personally returned after 2 days -LRB- though the automated response assured me it would be -RRB- . I then called 1-800-Ken-Cole , and the customer service representative told me to return them -LRB- I pay shipping -RRB- , and in 4-weeks or so , I 'll get a repaired/replaced pair . So I get to walk around in flip flops or buy another pair in the interim ? Ken Cole presents itself as a mid/high-end clothing company , but they are most certainly not . They should have directed me to the nearest retailer for a replacement pair.So I have the following observations :1 . The quality of these shoes is not consistent with the $ 100 they cost .2 . Ken Cole does n't stand behind their products like other mid/high-end companies do .3 . I will never buy another clothing article from this company .4 . I will never buy shoes on-line again ; rather , I will buy from a reputable retailer like Nordstrom 's . Thanks for reading . I feel a bit better now !
 I bought these when I bought the suit I wore to my wedding . I squeaked all the way down the aisle . I squeaked at the reception . I squeak on my way to work . I squeak whenever I go to the copier . I squeak whenever I do anything in these incredibly poor quality , blister-inducing , noise-making , overpriced shoes . I kept them past the return time frame because I figured they just needed to be worn in . Two months of wear and they still squeak nice and loud whenever I move , they still hurt my feet , and they scuff VERY easily . I took them back to Macys today and they told me to try putting felt on the areas that rub together causing the squeak . For nearly $ 100 I shouldnt have to make a trip to a craft store so that my shoes dont make noise.In short
 The quality of these shoes is very disappointing . I have had a few pairs of different Kenneth Cole REACTION 's over the years and they just do n't hold up well -- and I work in an office all day . And when I contacted customer service they were very unsympathetic . For the price I expected much better quality . Do n't waste your money on any Kenneth Cole shoes .
 I got lucky with a pair of clearance Kenneth Cole New York shoes from another online store a few weeks ago , and these shoes looked really nice , too , so I thought I 'd take advantage of the markdown -LRB- $ 35.99 -RRB- . I needed another pair of dress oxfords for work.Unfortunately they have that cheap , fake plastic look to them . Maybe these are OK for a high schooler dressing up for prom , but not for a business environment . Even worse , they dug into the tops of my ankles when I tried to walk in them.Maybe I am one of the few nay-sayers , because people really seem to love these on zappos , but I would recommend something else .
 The shoes literally fell apart . First it was the glued-on leather part on the heel . I repaired that and a few days later the whole sole of both shoes just fell off . I only got to wear these shoes maybe 6 or 7 times before they fell apart and I was inside for most of the time I wore them . I do n't feel it is even worth it having them repaired and I am never buying another pair of Kenneth Cole shoes in my life . I 've owned shoes of innumerable brands and have never before seen a product this poorly built .
 This is only the second time I have worn these shoes and the sole is already breaking away from the shoe . Extremely poor quality , especially for the price . Do not buy these shoes !!!
 No one can argue it is a very good and professional looking shoe . The issue I have is both of my shoes are coming apart after less than 2 months . I work in an office and wear them inside all day . The front of my right shoe is separating resulting in the front flopping . The left shoes glue had come off on the side to the point where I can basically see the underside of my foot . Also , my boss had purchased the same shoes in a different color and he could n't wear them because they squeaked every time he walked.Save your money and buy a different pair . I had a pair 3 years ago that held up wonderfully they must have changed their manufacturing techniques
 I got these shoes in a 9 and they were just too big . I have to wear two pairs of socks . They are also very heavy .
 These shoes run very small to size . Ordered size 8.5 2E and seems more like a 7 - 7.5 w. . . certainly NOT extra wide and not a size 8.5 . Have n't returned yet , so not sure how THAT will go . I 'm quite leery of trying for an exchange ... what if THAT does n't fit either ? Am I going to be charged for returning ? twice ? Uh , uh ... I 'm thinking just return and cut my losses . Also , both boxes -LRB- outer shipping and inner shoe box -RRB- were crushed upon delivery . This had BETTER not cause a problem with a return and refund !

 The shoe seems true to size but just felt weird . The front part was not as long as it looks in the picture . The color of the pewter looked very dark and cheap .
 These are most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn . I understand that there is a break in period for leather , but you ca n't possibly wear these enough times to ever break them in -LRB- if they ever do -RRB- . I feel like I have two boards strapped to my feet . They pinch in the heel and leave blisters within a few hours . The manufacturer may want to condition , rub 'em or whatever to make these a bit softer before they sell them .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 These shoes appear to be yellowing - literally yellowing - on the shelves in stores all over New York City . I do n't know what they made the white part of the soles from , but they should consider changing it because it actually turns yellow with age like the plastic on an old computer , except apparently much much faster.I ca n't speak to their comfort , however , because Amazon/FootLocker sent the wrong size , so I had to return them to a FootLocker that had stopped carrying them .
 The leather is too thin to have the feet on it without support . It 's slouchy in a way that makes it look akward .
 I had to return these sandals . They were so high . I do wear high heels all the time but not as high . I could n't stand on them . Walking was out of the question . The make was impeccable , though .

 At first I really love the sandals , but as I continued to exercise with them it became harder and harder to keep the strings tight . I would have to stop and tighten the strings every few minutes . It got to be such a pain that I do n't wear them anymore .
 I bought these for my husband a couple of months ago and they are good for everything except running . The stitching on the shoe gives a bump on the inside at the front of the arch . Every time he runs over two and a half miles he ends up with big blisters in the arch of both feet , at first he thought he should break them in , but two months later it 's still happening . He has normally shaped feet and has never had this problem before . This is not a manufacturing defect - it 's a design defect . If you do n't do much mileage these are decent shoes , if you plan to run or do a lot of walking in them stay well away .
 Material is low quality so I dont expect it to last that long . I have only worn it once and it has that shiny coating which is not the greatest according to me . I like the styling and it is comfortable to wear . Overall it is just another shoe . . not a winner .
 I bought these at local store and loved them from the start . They were very comfortable and the styling did n't scream `` workboot '' like traditional ones do . These boots had everything I was looking for . Then after two months of every day wear , the stitching around the top of the left boot split open . I returned them to the store where I bought them and they told me that several other pairs had been returned for the same issue . I opted to replace them and found the same issue less than a month later with that pair . I returned them for a pair of a different brand . I contacted Skecher 's directly concerning this issue and basically received the response that their products are of the highest quality and they essentially denied a problem . My first pair of Skecher 's was a gift of tennis shoe style three years ago and they lasted me a year . My subsequent pairs have not held up near as well and I am leaning more and more away from their products , which is quite sad as they put out very nice styles . The quality is just slipping .
 I just bought these boots at the end of August and less then three months later i am replacing them . My current line of work is not even rough on boots but these began to fall apart in the first month , wearing holes in the toes and having the plastic connection for the safety toe break apart inside the boot . I have never had a less durable boot .
 Clarks England ?? but the shoes are actually made in China ... i 'm dissapointed I paid to buy a pair of Shoes made in England not in china ...
 super cute , but really cheaply made . we bought them for christmas and they are falling apart . not worth the $
 Purchased these for my 6 year old niece who goes to private school , so only wore them infrequently . After only two months , the sole has separated from the boot base ; very disappointing . The boots were worn in Arizona so it 's not like wet or snowy weather impacted the wear . Save your money and just by Uggs , the may be expensive but will last much longer .

 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 Ok , I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother . I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color . I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes . Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones , The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2 . WTF ? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time . Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift . The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA .
 A few years back -LRB- though it seems like forever ago -RRB- , I was in graduate school for anthropology . I was the studious type and had gone straight from college to grad school , so I 'd never had time for a girlfriend . Sure , I 'd had my dalliances , but when it came down to it my only sustained love was anthropology . It was Spring Break , and I 'd gotten a grant to travel to the Oaxaca region of Mexico and study the indigenous Zoque tribe . Figuring I 'd need a sturdy pair of sneakers and impressed with the rubber shell toe design , I ordered a pair of Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoes -LRB- White/Black -RRB- on Amazon . They arrived the morning of my flight.That day I flew to Mexico City and then took a bus to the city of Oaxaca , where I transferred to another bus to get to the base of Monte Alban . I then climbed Monte Alban to reach the peak , where I 'd read the Zoque tribe could be found . At this point I 'd been on my feet for nearly 16 hours , but I had nary a blister or even a foot ache to speak of . I was beginning to really like my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . But they were caked in dirt and I was getting tired , so I decided to take a break at the summit . As I was about to wash my sneakers in a puddle of water , I heard a rustling of leaves . I looked up and all of a sudden 10 Zoque warriors were surrounding me , spears drawn . I knew a few Zoque phrases from my studies , so I told them , `` Tuk ` ay Tum , '' -LRB- `` I am your friend '' -RRB- but perhaps my dialect was off because that only enraged the warriors more . Soon , the Zoque Chieftan had his spear within an inch of my throat . At that moment , I was certain I would die right there in my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs.But just then , a female hand grabbed the spear and threw it on the ground . I looked up , and standing in the golden sunlight was the most beautiful girl I 'd ever laid eyes on . Her tawny skin glistened like a lake on a cool summer night , her jet-black hair was so soft it made horses jealous , and her eyes were like two perfect almonds . `` I Almika , '' she said , gesturing toward herelf . `` I Dan , '' I timorously replied , awestruck by her beauty . `` Why joo here ? '' Almika asked innocently . `` Study , '' I answered . `` Joo study Zuque ? '' Almika continued . I nodded in the affirmative . At this , Almika 's eyes beamed with excitement . She said something in Zuque that made the warriors lower their spears.Relieved and relaxed , I strolled with Almika toward the Zuque encampment . Between her limited English , my limited Zuque and some hand gestures , we were able to communicate with one another . I learned that she enjoyed weaving and playing traditional Zuque songs on her ocarina , and more importantly that she was looking for a man but was having trouble finding one in her tribe . It was important to her that a man be brave and strong , as many men in her tribe were , but she also wanted a man who was cultured and could show her the world beyond Monte Alban . It was clear to her that I was worldly , but in order to win her heart I knew I 'd have to prove that I was brave and strong . So that night as I fell asleep on my straw bed in the encampment , my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs still caked in dirt , I resolved to show her that I was tough.I rose early and quickly learned that the Zuque men were setting out to fetch firewood . I waved to Almika and then followed them into the woods . Fortunately , I 'd had some experience gathering wood for the fireplace at my parents ' country house in Massachusetts . So I quickly noticed the dry pieces of wood , which impressed the Zuque men . When we returned to camp at midday , I had a haul of firewood in my hands as I espied Almika roasting a cob of maize over a tiny flame . `` Better fire '' I said , and threw some of my wood onto the fire . The sudden burst of flames frightened Almika and she dropped her maize on the ground . Without flinching , I picked it up and held it near the enlarged fire . When it was perfectly crisped , I proudly handed the cob of maize back to her . Beaming , Almika bit into the maize and exclaimed `` Ees tasty ! `` The rest of the afternoon was spent helping the Zuque men fix up one of the elders ' adobes . My repair skills honed on D-I-Y projects with my Dad at our country house in Massachusetts came in handy here . I impressed the Zuque men by patching up a small hole in the roof using some Trident chewing gum I 'd brought in my backpack . When we returned to camp at dusk , the men relayed tales of my handiwork to Almika , who smiled and locked her piercing brown eyes with mine . She walked toward me and we sat on two boulders around the fire during the communal tribe dinner of rattlesnake stew , flirting and laughing all the while.As dinner was winding down , I had my arm around Almika and was about to suggest we take things to an empty hut on the periphery of the encampment . But just then , we heard the shriek of a Zuque child . I looked over and racing toward us was a gigantic jaguar galloping at full speed . Instinctively , I grabbed a bow that was lying next to me and loaded it with an arrow . I 'd learned archery at day camp near my parents ' house in Massachusetts . My parents did n't want me to go because they thought the camp was run by a bunch of ne'er - do-well Hippies , but fortunately I convinced them to let me go . I pulled the bow string back , and released . It was so dark I could barely see what had happened . But then I heard the noise - first a whisper and then a full-on chant `` Dan ! Dan ! DAN ! DAN ! DAAAAN ! '' and when I looked closely , I saw that I 'd hit the jaguar squarely between the eyes ! Almika ran up to me and gave me a bear hug . I held her and just wanted to be with her , but jaguar blood was everywhere - on my arms , on my legs , and on my already dirt-caked Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 Item arrived quickly . Initially I was impressed with these boots . But , within 3 weeks the sole was coming off . The tread on the bottom showed substantial wear . If you wear boots to work in Do n't Buy These you will regret it .
 they run really big . the do n't look as good as they do in the picture . the soles feel like plastic there is no support for ankles . Not a very good boot , plus they smell weird .
 These are more comfortable than my worn out boots . I used these on patrols about twice per week and they started showing wear on the sole after the first week . The boot laces were a little short for my preference . And it is funny to me that I serve the people of Iraq and the United States wearing boots made in China . These seem to be a good inexpensive boot . I am curious to see how they stand up to a little more use/abuse . The results are that these boots feel great ... for a very short period of time . The sole wore out within two months . Just walking in gravel and dirt tore these things up in less than a month , the next month was rough on my feet . I had to break down and buy some quality boots .
 These are worthless . The layers of the sole started to separate after a 10 mile hike . The rubber started to wear through very quickly as well . I woulddnt give these to a 4 year old
 If you are looking for desert boots for yard work or maybe re-enacting , these will probably do fine . But if you need something more durable these are not the boots for you . The soles on mine quickly wore down and peeled like string cheese . However , the price was cheap and they are comfortable .
 Do not fit worth a darn poor quality and awful support big waste of money do not buy this product
 I could not believe the quality in these shoes ... HORRIBLE!The material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper . They have an awful smell and are uncomfortable . I bought chinese shoes in china town for $ 2 , they were wonderfully comfortable , still smelled funny , but they were awesome.these are not !
 My daughter has been wearing crocs for a few years . This is the first year we purchased the mary jane style . Within the first hour of wear , she was complaining they hurt the sides of her feet and we took them off . She had blisters on both feet , both sides where the strap is attached to the crocs symbol . We returned them right away and exchanged them for the classic croc style which has been fine .
 bad shoe for sure . it is not for running . but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work . this may do
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 These are the most dreadfully uncomfortable shoes I 've put on in years , really clunky . This is the last time I 'll ever buy a brand of shoe I do n't know before actually trying it on .
 Based on previous experience , it 's a very good sandal.The pair I received , however , was mis-marked , i.e. , it was approximately1/2 inch longer than my existing Clarks sandal , also marked 7M . I wassorry to have to return the shoes , which had been tried on priorto shipping to me . The store should have known from that customer ` sreaction that the shoe was a larger size than marked .
 Ok , I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother . I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color . I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes . Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones , The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2 . WTF ? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time . Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift . The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA .
 A few years back -LRB- though it seems like forever ago -RRB- , I was in graduate school for anthropology . I was the studious type and had gone straight from college to grad school , so I 'd never had time for a girlfriend . Sure , I 'd had my dalliances , but when it came down to it my only sustained love was anthropology . It was Spring Break , and I 'd gotten a grant to travel to the Oaxaca region of Mexico and study the indigenous Zoque tribe . Figuring I 'd need a sturdy pair of sneakers and impressed with the rubber shell toe design , I ordered a pair of Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoes -LRB- White/Black -RRB- on Amazon . They arrived the morning of my flight.That day I flew to Mexico City and then took a bus to the city of Oaxaca , where I transferred to another bus to get to the base of Monte Alban . I then climbed Monte Alban to reach the peak , where I 'd read the Zoque tribe could be found . At this point I 'd been on my feet for nearly 16 hours , but I had nary a blister or even a foot ache to speak of . I was beginning to really like my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . But they were caked in dirt and I was getting tired , so I decided to take a break at the summit . As I was about to wash my sneakers in a puddle of water , I heard a rustling of leaves . I looked up and all of a sudden 10 Zoque warriors were surrounding me , spears drawn . I knew a few Zoque phrases from my studies , so I told them , `` Tuk ` ay Tum , '' -LRB- `` I am your friend '' -RRB- but perhaps my dialect was off because that only enraged the warriors more . Soon , the Zoque Chieftan had his spear within an inch of my throat . At that moment , I was certain I would die right there in my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs.But just then , a female hand grabbed the spear and threw it on the ground . I looked up , and standing in the golden sunlight was the most beautiful girl I 'd ever laid eyes on .

 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 I am on my second pair of sierra flip flops since August-The first the strap pulled out and the company sent me a replacement pair-The replacement pair 's bottom came off this morning . These cost too much for this to happen .
 I was looking for some light weight plain black shoes for everyday use . This item is plain alright , but pretty damn heavy . I ended up returning it so ca n't comment on the comfort .
 I have a pair of chaco 's and really enjoy them . I wanted a nice looking pair that is more for casual wear and purchased these . They look very nice , however I could not even get them on my foot ! I do not have fat feet , but still could not slip these on without forcing my foot in . I suppose if your feet are very thin , you wo n't have any trouble . If your feet swell at all , I definetely would not recommend these , you might not be able to get them off . I still like chaco 's for their arch support , but perhaps their earlier shoes that have adjustable straps are better .
 I purchased this shoe and have only worn them once . The shoe has no comfort , and the material -- I do n't know what it is -- is very hard . It 's not leather . To give an example of how hard the shoe is at the toe , the first time I wore the shoe , my nail chipped from the friction of rubbing against the hard surface material of the shoe . Spend a few more dollars , and buy a nice shoe . I have a lot of Charles and Charles David shoes . Sometimes you have to pay the price to look good . But , this shoe takes that concept to another level . Do n't do it .
 My daughter has been wearing crocs for a few years . This is the first year we purchased the mary jane style . Within the first hour of wear , she was complaining they hurt the sides of her feet and we took them off . She had blisters on both feet , both sides where the strap is attached to the crocs symbol .

She said something in Zuque that made the warriors lower their spears.Relieved and relaxed , I strolled with Almika toward the Zuque encampment . Between her limited English , my limited Zuque and some hand gestures , we were able to communicate with one another . I learned that she enjoyed weaving and playing traditional Zuque songs on her ocarina , and more importantly that she was looking for a man but was having trouble finding one in her tribe . It was important to her that a man be brave and strong , as many men in her tribe were , but she also wanted a man who was cultured and could show her the world beyond Monte Alban . It was clear to her that I was worldly , but in order to win her heart I knew I 'd have to prove that I was brave and strong . So that night as I fell asleep on my straw bed in the encampment , my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs still caked in dirt , I resolved to show her that I was tough.I rose early and quickly learned that the Zuque men were setting out to fetch firewood . I waved to Almika and then followed them into the woods . Fortunately , I 'd had some experience gathering wood for the fireplace at my parents ' country house in Massachusetts . So I quickly noticed the dry pieces of wood , which impressed the Zuque men . When we returned to camp at midday , I had a haul of firewood in my hands as I espied Almika roasting a cob of maize over a tiny flame . `` Better fire '' I said , and threw some of my wood onto the fire . The sudden burst of flames frightened Almika and she dropped her maize on the ground . Without flinching , I picked it up and held it near the enlarged fire . When it was perfectly crisped , I proudly handed the cob of maize back to her . Beaming , Almika bit into the maize and exclaimed `` Ees tasty ! `` The rest of the afternoon was spent helping the Zuque men fix up one of the elders ' adobes . My repair skills honed on D-I-Y projects with my Dad at our country house in Massachusetts came in handy here . I impressed the Zuque men by patching up a small hole in the roof using some Trident chewing gum I 'd brought in my backpack . When we returned to camp at dusk , the men relayed tales of my handiwork to Almika , who smiled and locked her piercing brown eyes with mine . She walked toward me and we sat on two boulders around the fire during the communal tribe dinner of rattlesnake stew , flirting and laughing all the while.As dinner was winding down , I had my arm around Almika and was about to suggest we take things to an empty hut on the periphery of the encampment . But just then , we heard the shriek of a Zuque child . I looked over and racing toward us was a gigantic jaguar galloping at full speed . Instinctively , I grabbed a bow that was lying next to me and loaded it with an arrow . I 'd learned archery at day camp near my parents ' house in Massachusetts . My parents did n't want me to go because they thought the camp was run by a bunch of ne'er - do-well Hippies , but fortunately I convinced them to let me go . I pulled the bow string back , and released . It was so dark I could barely see what had happened . But then I heard the noise - first a whisper and then a full-on chant `` Dan ! Dan ! DAN ! DAN ! DAAAAN ! '' and when I looked closely , I saw that I 'd hit the jaguar squarely between the eyes ! Almika ran up to me and gave me a bear hug . I held her and just wanted to be with her , but jaguar blood was everywhere - on my arms , on my legs , and on my already dirt-caked Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .
 These are the most dreadfully uncomfortable shoes I 've put on in years , really clunky . This is the last time I 'll ever buy a brand of shoe I do n't know before actually trying it on .
 Because there is no stretch , the back slips off your foot when you take a step or go up stairs . Really cute shoes but they just do n't work .
 Having just received these shoes , I noticed a strong smell emanating from the box . Upon opening that packaging , I was overwhelmed by a smell that seemed like a bicycle inner tube . I have bought other similar shoes online and never experienced anything like this . I only hope the smell dies down over time , as I like the shoes otherwise.BTW , they tend to run a tad large .
 These shoes maybe nicely priced . Returning them because of the atrocious smell that never went away . Also , started to rip in places . Never abused . Stay away !
 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 The fit of these is not bad , I have no complaints - otherwise I would n't have bought them in the first place.However , the reason why I decided to go out of my way to rate these is because I believe the materials used in these shoes are susceptible to and promote shoe odor . Now , you say ... `` that 's a matter of opinion and for all I know , your feet just stank ! '' Two things
 I had purchased these shoes in June ,2008 in $ 35 . The shoes are lightweight and looks nice when new , but the quality of the shoe sole is very bad.Its december and the shoe sole has worn out . There is big hole in the shoe sole . . Its just 6 months since I bought the shoes.I wo n't recommend this shoes to anyone .
 All I want to share that this shoe stinks and I do not know how to remove that bad smell except throughing this shoes.Waste of money .
 Not happy with purchase . Shoe was not true to size . Not a true fit .
 I needed to change the address for the shipment on an item and it turned into a nightmare . Their customer service number was always busy , and when I did get through I did n't get a sense of security that my matter would be resolved . They have not followed up when they said they would and I have had to call back several times to find out the status of my order . Not good in my opinion .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 I used this shoes only to go shopping or the supermarket , very soft use , and only after 1 week of use , the leather broke in the seam . The shoes are almost new , with little and mild use and they opened through the seam . I highly recommend not to waste your money in these shoes .
 purchased these four months ago and wear them a couple times a week , casual wear only.The front toe of one of the shoes is coming apart showing the material underneath.very disappointed in the life of these under relatively light wear.I Need a wide width and ordered wide but my feet swim in these shoes . . im tossing them and wont buy Skechers again
 I am a faithful Sketchers customer . I have purchased 6 pairs of Sketchers shoes in the past 5 years . The shoes have always proven durable . This pair , however , lasted less than one month ! The sole came detached from the toe , and they are no longer wearable .
 Seams have ripped on both shoes on the leather upper . These shoes are defective , do n't buy them .
 I 'm a long time user of Skechers shoes and this is by far the worst product they ever put out . They are hard and stiff and make a lot of noise when you walk . Like they are made out of cheap plastic instead of rubber .
 I bought this shoes in brown , the color of the received shoes is an unpleasant very dark brown . As a whole the shoes are looking ugly and much more different than the image . I am a very long time devoted customer of Amazon , this will be my first and last time when I buy shoes from Amazon .
 I thought Josef Seibel made good shoes ? The soles on these shoes have quickly worn through from the inside ! The leather looked frayed and the soles wore through within a few months . It 's a casual style , and I loved the looks so much that I kept them , but I do object to something so shoddy even being sold!Very disappointing !
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 The Boots look great , but when I first put them on , the steel toe rubbed my large toe slightly . After four hours of wearing them , both sides of my foot were too sore to continue wearing them . One person suggested that they needed to be `` broken in '' , but I am not tough enough to break in the steel toe on the boot . The steel toe looks like it belongs on a regular or even narrow boot . I am now the owner of $ 186 boots that were worn only 4 hours .
 Dear friends of Amazon , I am reviewing the Danner Instigator GTX Gore-Tex -LRB- uninsulated/no thinsulate etc. . . -RRB- , boots . I am military , law enforcement , and an avid hiker ... so I was expecting a boot which fit the description which Danner labeled to the letter . My Danner military boots have lasted through many battles -LRB- on and off the field -RRB- . However , BEWARE !!!! These boots , while decent quality compared to similarly priced boots on the market , are not what I 'd expected . For one thing ... Unlike the photographs ... they are by NO STRETCH of the imagination BROWN with TAN highlights !!!!! These boots are as orange as a pumpkin ! As both military -LRB- uniform -RRB- and law enforcement -LRB- uniform -RRB- requirements are very specific , I discovered that these boots ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE under any conditions to wear for duty . And then I figured , `` Well ... I 'll just keep them for hiking then ! '' But , as soon as I undid the laces , and prepared to try them on for the first time , I quickly discovered that they have a LEATHER collar around the ankle section ... . another misstatement , as DANNER claimed they had a cloth/gore-tex like material which comfortably surrounds the ankle ! Yeah right ! That 's on the outside !? It 's cloth on the outside , and leather on the inside ? HUH ? Anyone who does ANY hiking will tell you that that is a friction problem waiting to happen ! Remember those rub marks when you wore crappy boots as a kid ? So I called them to get my money back . They supposedly have a `` no questions asked '' FREE returns policy right , which was one of the reasons I 'd picked them too ! But -LRB- again -RRB- , since I 'd ordered them through the MILITARY website , they would not take them back -LRB- nor would they take them back if you got them on AMAZON either she explained -RRB- ! So , now I am stuck with a pair of boots which CAN NOT be worn with ANY clothing imaginable -LRB- unless your going as a pumpkin to the next Halloween party of course -RRB- ! Signed , Really pissed off at Danner!PS . Also bought an extra pair of the `` supposedly '' impact dampening inserts too . They were $ 16 , and no better than the cheap gel Doctor Shoel 's -LRB- however you spell it -RRB- inserts one can obtain at any drug store for $ 6 . But do n't believe me ... come on and waist your money too ! My advice is to look at customer photo 's on each site , as when one tries to take a picture of them THEY DO look brown and tan ! But when you take them out of the box in the regular light they are not ! First pair of shoes I 'd describe as functionally and visually HIDEOUS !
 The Saucony Women 's Jazz LoPro shoes seemed very comfortable , however the right shoe was off-kilter causing my big toe to ride on the edge of the sole.Sincerely Jeana Muir
 My `` tween '' daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes.They are comfortable and stylish.This is her 3rd pair.I 'm glad that I found them online.They are both old-school and stylish /
 I own a pair of pink Saucony Cambridge Originals and was so pleased with them that I wanted another pair , unfortunately I could n't find any on Amazon so I decided to go with another shoe from the Saucony brand . I ordered the same size I had gotten before but these shoes are almost a whole size bigger . Very disappointing , I sent them back and will go back to looking for some Cambridge Originals .
 This shoe is not uncomfortable for any means . However , it is not particularly comfortable either and certainly does not provide the support needed for walking , jogging or running . I ordered yellow/navy and was very happy with the color . The quality was fine for the price , but the shoe seems to run wide . No matter how tight I tie the laces , my heel slides around . These are going back .
 I 'm a Saucony girl through and through but this sneaker was by far the most DISAPPOINTING sneaker I 've ever owned.I work long hours and I 'm on the go a lot @ work . The style of the sneaker gives a `` cleaner '' appearance so i decided to try it . It is near impossible to break in , damn near stumble over it sometimes and @ the end of the day , my heels and calves hurt . Totally NOT an exprience I 'd ever gotten from any saucony ; I will NEVER purchase this style again
 I love Minnetonka Moccasins , but these came today and when I opened the box I was shocked and disappointed . First of all I normally wear a size 9 , and my other mocs are a size 8 and too small now , so I ordered a 8.5 . These are larger than my 9 's ! Second ; The shoes looked worn , so I used socks when I tried them on , and the brown suede stained my socks ! I am returning them , ordering another pair in a size8 and different color . I know Minnetonka 's are good , but not this pair . Do n't know what went wrong , but lately have n't been having good luck shopping on Amazon . Hope it gets better .
 I am overweight and these slippers do not offer any support . I had trouble after many wearings determinining which was the left and right shoe . I thought they were irregulars and wrote the manufacturer twice ... they never answered me .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 The boots were very good looking and great quality . I read all the reviews before I decided to order and specifically ordered the extra wide size -LRB- designated as EE or 2E -RRB- as I was expecting steel toes to be a little more restricted . I was very excited when I got them . They looked great out of the box , the leather and workmanship seemed very high quality.Then I slipped them on and immediately noticed how tight and uncomfortable they were . I thought may be that day my feet were tired so I will try them on in the morning again . Same result , they were extremely tight and uncomfortable . I double-checked to make sure they sent me the 2E size and so it said on the tag , but they were n't anything like 2E size - tight all around even though my feet are not wider than normal and usually I get the regular size . This time I decided to get the 2E just so I can have extra room.I emailed the company to verify they sent me the right size . Customer service was very good . Unfortunately this was their widest model . They did accept the shoes back and refunded my money but I was very disappointed because they had manufactured a product with a wrong size.I ordered different boots -LRB- Irish Setter -RRB- again 2E and they had plenty of space for my feet in that size.The Rocky 6 '' Iron Clad Waterproof Work Boots are manufactured in wrong sizes , be aware of that.Pros
 I got these boots for Christmas and had to send them back soon after putting them on . They fir very awkwardly and were too uncomfortable . It felt like there was enough padding and they were well constructed . They just felt really weird on my foot . I opulent walk easily in these boots .
 I bought these boots for work . I ended up returning this product . The tongue in the right boot did not fold properly and hurt my ankle . The right boot also leaked at the toe.P.S . I replaced these boots with some Keen steel toed boots < 3 'em !
 Product is great ! Lots of cushion comfort . However , be cautious with the sizing . Ordered mens size 11 's and they were too small , re-ordered size 13 's and they fit fine . Have not had luck with credit back on size 11 's from Shoes.com . They say it takes average of 10 days to complete returns ... been 14 days and not a peep from them . I would not recommend buying from Shoes.com ... unless you were extremely confident on the fit of your particular shoe 's size .
 The shoes are a good product but I would not buy from this retailer again . I bought size 13 'S and they were too small . I sent them back and never received a refund . They were n't interested in processing the refund.Such a pity as I had Flojo 's before and they are awesome shoes .
 I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed , the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen , and whats worse - these just sort of look cheap . I returned them , and I will avoid buying this brand again
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 Tried to wear on several water hikes and each time I had to cover my toes with bandaids because the shoes really hurt and caused many blisters . I do n't recommend this shoe at all .
 Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro , they are too short . I tried to add velcro , but that did n't work . I had to give the shoes away . The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable . Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side .
 I 'm a big Ecco fan , and have been buying their shoes exclusively for work for the past few years . This was the first pair to disappoint.First , the color of the leather as received is much duller and browner than the somewhat orange sheen that shows in the pic.Second , they lack the signature comfort of previous pairs of Eccos I have enjoyed , although that may be due to the fact it 's a loafer and not my more typical Helsinki or Seattle slip-ons . The stitching is also more pronounced than the photo shows and than is typical for a loafer , making them look more casual than you 'd expect.Finally , the latex sole at the front is already starting to show the first signs of separation of the shoe . So this pair do not appear to be nearly as durable as other Eccos.Sorry to be a party-pooper amidst these other glowing reviews , but this is my honest opinion , and in this case I think you get what you pay for , i.e. a cheaper Ecco offering is in fact cheaper .
 I sent these back as I purchased them for the comfort of the memory foam insole , which was very thin and not very comfortable . Very disappointing after searching long for what I thought was going to be a great slipper .
 Flimsy and more flimsy after they were washed . These slippers would be good for someone who can not fit into a regular slipper because their foot is swollen but for a regular everyday slipper , they do not grip the foot and I kept walking out of them .
 I looked forward to getting a very comfortable pair of slippers . Unfortunately they ran big and the cord covering the open edges was abrasive and unpleasant . The support in the sole was good , but I needed a pair I could wear . I ordered two pair of Daniel Green slippers at the same time and they both had the rough cording around the edges . I wo n't order another pair of their slippers . I did appreciate the refund . The second pair also had no support , was a flat sole with not much there .
 As said above for the Daniel Green Tess slipper , these definitely are NOT a narrow - they are much too wide .
 the slippers are cut too high in the back which will give blisters , and the velcro is hard to fasten when you get a firm fit . Very uncomfortable .
 These slippers look comfortable and pretty . They are . BUT the narrow size is NOT narrow . I bought these for an elderly friend who wears a narrow shoe and they have lots of room on the sides of her feet . NOT a true narrow . Not happy about this .
 This was not a good fit for my mom . It says `` narrow '' but the slippers were way too wide for my mom . She nearly fell -LRB- thankfully I caught her -RRB- when she slipped wearing these uncomfortable slippers , In addition , there was not enough padding under her foot to make these at all comfortable . I returned them and I am STILL awaiting a credit to my account !
 I ordered the sneakers that i always wear because I love the fit . They are comfortable all day . However , the sneakers that were delivered to me were wide . As a result , the fit is stiff and not very comfortable
 I buy this product twice yearly and have done so for over 5 years . This is the first time it 's not fit . I do n't know if it is the seller or what is it . Had to return them . Disappointing .
 I had to order my sketchers on here since Sketchers was out of my size , and got them in they were good for only 2 weeks and I had the same issue as T. Hunter did where they have already pulled apart along the seam on the inside right shoe . So now it feels like the toes are loose on them . I do n't know what Sketchers has done this year . I had bought so many of this pair before and never had this problem . But I am contacting them to let them know they maybe loosing me as a buyer!We shall see how it goes I just called Sketchers today and they want me to send them back so they can check on them and see if it was a flaw on their part and replace them . Fingers crossed !
 I purchased these from an actual Skechers store in my area and at first I loved them . They were comfortable and of course easy to slip on . Now to the bad part ... I have only owned these shoes for two weeks -LRB- today matter of fact -RRB- and already they are stretched to where they 're loose and already cracking where they bend near the toes . My sister also owned a pair of these that quickly wore out as well . Had I known these were the same she had , I would never had bought them . Very poor choice of material !
 I had to return them , I could n't get my foot in the sneaker . They do n't stretch wide enough to get you foot in them .
 I bought the correct size and I have several other Skechers shoes that I love . However , I could n't put the shoes on . I found them too tight around the top . THe idea of `` slip on '' is really not correct . I think making these shoes with a regular tongue and velcro straps would be a better idea . They would be easy to put on . I returned them the day after they arrived .
 I love Skechers shoes . In fact I have 2 pairs of the Skechers D'Lites Opal mules . I live in them and they are so comfortable . BUT thinking the D'lites were comfortable so should these slip on shoes . Boy was I wrong . I wear a medium size 6 . I ordered a size 6 for these shoes.My other Skechers are a size 6M . It was so painful trying to get them to slip on my feet . I have had other &#34; new &#34; slip on shoes that did not go on as tight as these . When I compared the front of this shoe to my other skechers shoes , my other shoes showed a wider appearance as compared to these . These were much narrower . I may try a &#34; wide &#34; version of this shoe but not sure . At any rate , I did not keep them and sent them back . The size is not true to fit in my opinion . Sorry Skechers you blew it on this style shoe for me . I 'll stick to your mules .
 Have had other slip on Sketchers which fit well - this particular shoe is very hard to get foot into -LRB- the hole seems too small . -RRB-
 I have a high arch , and the top part is very stiff , i had to cut the strechy part just to finish the day . Not very comfy at all .
 Too small . . I should buy 8.5 size . I normally buy 7.5 and 8 , but this really small on my feet . Kinda waste my money on this . I did not return , probably will cause me more . : - -LRB-
 the shoe was not correct size . Apparently , a larger width is not available . Size 11.5 W is needed . Shoes were returned
 I have worn these Reebok Nylon Classics for years . They just fit and were a reasonable price . However , when they outsourced these to China in the 90s the quality started to go down . When they went to Vietnam they got worse but I still bought them . The last pair I bought was made in Cambodia . A poor fit to begin with and almost no arch support anymore . Then after only two weeks , the tread on both shoes began to come off . What were once really good , affordable sneakers have now been reduced to third rate junk - all to meet the bottom line of Reebok . Geez , bring them back to be made in America ...
 I have been buying this model for at least 35 years and was always satisfied , now they changed the internal parts of the shoe taking out the arch and using a thinner pad with a different feel . They will not get my businessanymore , trying to reduce cost on material and design is a big mistake . Good bye Reebok , my last shoe .
 Very pretty shoes , but the second I put them on , I knew I would never be able to wear them . I ordered them even a little large to accommodate the pointed toe . They hurt so much the second I put them on , I have not been able to wear them at all .
 These shoes LOOK adorable . I was so excited when I received them , to see how pretty they are . But then I put them on ... there was about a half inch of room in the heel even though they were my size , and there was absolutely NO traction on the bottom so when I tried to walk across the carpet , I could n't move forward and when I did , the shoes fell off .
 The sole on these sohes have started to come off after 3 weeks of wear . Bad product !!! I asked Foot Locker for a return they told me to buy a new pair .
 Got this pouch for paintball in the Bay Area . Attached it to my molle vest the night before . Started play at 12:30 PM the following day . By 2:30 ish PM , latch needed for grommet had detached . I guess it was n't meant for repeated openings and closings before and after games . The pouch , received the night before , was rendered useless as a result . Since it is a metal latch , it is definitely not worth it to have it repaired . Stay away from this POS ... Stay far away .
 Got this Black 2-Pocket Ammo Pouch Black in October 12 , 2010for cell phone , 2 keys and wallet , not a overload.The cover clip broke off Jan 6,2011 -LRB- 87 days -RRB- and it cant be returned : -LRB-
 in brief : - very uncomfortable compared to every other shoe ive ever worn -LRB- i think even wal mart flip flops have an edge on them -RRB- - likely caused me what has been a period of unprecedented knee and ankle pain -LRB- ca n't prove theyre the cause but their use is strongly associated with it -RRB- - provide absolutely no cushioning of impact-no insole support-while at the same time basically bind your feed , compressing your foot and basically inhibiting its ability to function properly-are wearing out quicker than any other pair of normal shoes ive had in memory , -LRB- edge is separating from sole in particular -RRB- - actually make me dislike walkingi bought them as a cheap option in a rush.EDIT
 I tried to order these crocs two different times and both times I was sent the wrong thing . I spoke to someone about it and they told me they would get back with me but they never did . I wo n't ever waste my time or tell anyone I know to use this service . I understand mistakes happen but if a company refuses to make good on their promise then I have no use for them .
 They sure are cute but have rapidly fallen apart . The soles separated from the shoes , the scuffs seem instant . Very displeased with the shoes .
 we had several problems w / this shoe . 1 . after purchase noted the poor quality in stitching . Stiches were pulling slowling coming apart after only 3 wears . 2 . scuffing was rediculous , you can hardly rub the shoe without it making a mark . doubt this shoe will make it through a second child . 3 . the laces are a super poor design . they are just cosmetic but flip open tongue of shoe and see how they are stiched . again poorly but also frayed ends stick out of shoe and cause a bump on top of foot . not very comfy . on a more positive note , even scuffed and frayed still got compliments on what a cute shoe it was . tried to email company 3 times w / no response . will not buy see kai run again
 I wish I could give them -5 stars.I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $ 170 should be really good . I could n't be more wrong . The lining of these shoes started falling apart just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day !!! Stay away at all cost !

 I do not usually report on transactions with Amazon as they are usually smooth and without issue . This however has been the worst experience I 've ever had with an online vendor . Let me start by saying these shoes , when not defective , are comfortable and worth their price . However , shoebuy did not provide me with a good product . I received these shoes as my wedding shoes . I left them in the box until closer to the wedding and then opened it up tried them on and my fiance noticed that one shoe had a crease where the other did n't . She did n't like it and asked me to exchange them for a new pair . I contacted shoebuy , reported the defect and asked to exchange - they could not process the exchange in time for our wedding -LRB- which was abroad -RRB- so I returned them and purchased the same shoe from Nordstrom . I was out of the country for three weeks waiting for word that the return was processed but no word - three emails during my honeymoon later I finally receive a response from shoe buy DENYING MY RETURN based on their assertion that the shoes were not returned in the same state they were in when delivered . I did try these shoes on but NEVER WORE THEM and did not cause the DEFECT the shoes suffered -LRB- a crease in the left shoe -RRB- . No matter to shoebuy - I 've spoken to several customer support representatives and a manager all of whom reviewed the pictures that shoebuy took of the shoes -LRB- with a flash to extenuate any marks or scuffs -RRB- all of whom simply denied the return and refused to take responsibility for their faulty product . As it stands now , I am disputing the charge with american express but I have little hope for cooperation from shoe buy . They will not accept the return , will not acknowledge their mistake , will not act as a sensible business and take back their own faulty product and will not do anything to help me . I am out $ 400 because of their horrible return policies and over-the-top effort to dump their defective product on their customer . I urge all Amazon customers to look elsewhere when making purchases of expensive shoes - this company is irresponsible and does not practice a sensible and customer focused business . They are simply unwilling to take any responsibility for a defective product and instead expect customers to bear the expense of being sent a bad pair of shoes .
 These shoes are comfortable and well-made . The leather is soft but durable , and you will not have to worry about setting off any airport or courthouse alarms as they do not have a metal shank . They are elegant and stylish enough you can wear with just about any suit , but not feel as though you are wearing uncomfortable , stiff dress shoes . They are quiet , do n't squeak on floors or make clicking sounds , and they have good traction . The shoes have maintained their shape well these past four months I 've worn them , about two to three times a week , without creasing over the toes . A bit pricey compared to other shoes , but you get your money 's worth.Update

 I ordered this item in tan . Product received in incorrect size and color . Have attempted several times to contact the company by phone and email with no response . They required I send the product back at my cost saying they would reimburse me . Too date -LRB- 6 weeks -RRB- I have not received a credit , refund or even a replacement . Nothing . They ignore all requests . I have since ordered from `` Save On Dancewear '' twice and they have been wonderful in the product quality and service .
 They sent the wrong size to begin with and I had adance class coming up shortly , so I had to wear themonce , Customer service was terrible and they didnot reply to my e-mail requesting a return .

 Any shoe that does n't come larger than a 7.5 is pointless.What about the women who wear size 12 or 13 , what are we supposed to wear ?
 I bought these for a trip to Discovery Cove -LRB- Orlando , FL -RRB- but did not have a good experience . The rubber literally ripped my feet apart and it was very painful . The straps also were not comfortable and I wear a regular size 9 . They also came in blue .

 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 bad shoe for sure . it is not for running . but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work . this may do

 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 Hello FriendsI am not very happy with you because of the order last December 30 did , this product ordered on 4 December and I have still not arrived , sent him again and I do not appear in orders so please need a Responding to this.Walfred Astudillo
 These shoes are great for shock obsortion , but lack alot in fit.My right foot is perfect , but my left shoe leans in the minute I put them on.I 've tried to keep the weight of my foot on the other side while I am walking , but it does n't help.I have worn them outside or I would send them back .
 The last pair I ordered were in white , and they were much more comfortable than the ones I ordered in black . I have only worn these a couple of times , just to make sure that I did n't miss something . Will not be ordering these again !
 the shoes are too stiff , not flexible , I really did not like at all like the models I 've seen here in Venezuela , the suit and I regretted
 I received these and just had to send them back , they were to tight . I 've never had issues with a shoe feeling tight . I have a regular foot , not wide or anything and have had shoes that fit snuggle , but could still wiggle my toes , these were just squeezing my foot and no room at all . Was very dissapointed .
 The shoes feel very heavy & clunky , plus they rub on my ankle bones . There is some sewing inside that I had to cover as it would rub on my foot when I was walking . I wish I had ordered the Performace shoe instead as it would have probably been more comfortable . I have been trying to break these in , but my feet really hurt by the end of the day . I will just have to figure out how to make these more comfortable . I walk daily , but have to remove my shoes as soon as I am done . I have already added gel pads , but they are not enough.Skechers Women 's Energy - Atomic Sneaker

 It was delivered at time . And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance ; however , it was n't . When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe , which is the reason why I bought it , the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance . Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons . Any way , the prodoct was n't the same value or quality of pumma 's shoes that I have bought in the past .

 I love my MBT Lifestyle shoes , however , working with MBT is a drag . I kept my shoes in the box for two months . Then on the Fourth of July , I entered and walked the 1/3 marathon in Crested Butte , CO. . That was brave , if not dumb , but the shoes were awesome , and I had no recovery period . Then I started wearing the shoes regularly for walking because I was so encouraged by my first experiece . After two months of wear , the shoes started coming apart . I contacted MBT via their online-email service over six times , and they never responded . So keep in mind , that although the shoes are wonderful , that once you buy them and wear them , you own them . Take precautions so that they do n't fall apart on you . Mine started wearing thin right where the heel fits in the back of the shoe . The mesh unraveled and the padding started falling out . This only happened in the right shoe and not the left shoe . No luck with MBT responding and giving me even some advise . I am now outside of the six month warranty window , so now I 've resorted to using packaging tape to keep the shoes together . Now , I 've noticed that the inside of the upper is falling apart as well.So in summary , I wore the shoes for two months , and started having difficulty . After attempting to contact MBT , I put the shoes aside . After giving up on hearing from MBT , I started wearing the shoes again , and they 're continuing to fall apart . I can not tell you how much I wish I were one of the people whose shoes were lasting them for two years without hitch . I am not that person .

 Slippers did not fit well even though they were the correct size . Also , memory foam did not bounce back and finally I had to stop wearing them after only a few weeks .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 Now I used to buy Ugg boots ... that was when they were made in Australia and New Zealand ... but I really ca n't understand all you folks with your Chinese made UGGs ... whats with that ??? you might as well buy Bearpaw or Emu for all thats worth . Personally I will not buy a pair of UGG Australia boots for $ 125 upwards that are made in China ... because I do n't like the concept of being ripped off ... and for all you folks with your plush UGGs made in China ... whatever ... you are wearing expensive Chinese copies as far as I am concerned . Amazing what some people will buy just because of a name .
 This review is for the customer service of the seller , I can not review the specific item becauseI did not end up getting the item from here . I was charged my credit card on one day and then refunded the next day . The item was a Christmas present and here I was waiting for the item and the seller did not even have the decency to send an email informing me that they were out of the item . I had to send emails to track down the item . Will be highly skeptical before buying anything on-line .
 I am convinced that men are not supposed to wear any kind of Ugg based shoe products . Much like sandals , Uggs convey a message that 90 % of men just can not convey . Perhaps European guys who weigh 90 pounds and drink tea while eating a crumpet , but not American men . We have Neanderthal feet , which should not be prettified in any way - it 's just like putting lipstick on a pig . It 's the reason you rarely see men chatting about their shoes - real men only care about two things with regard to their feet
 I am unable to fathom the success of these hideous boots . If I wore these I would have to kick my own a $ $ .
 I bought these to replace another pair which finally wore out after 13 years of use . The rear seam of one of these new boots split wide open while i was trying them on . The sole is n't what it used to be and the boots weigh half as much . I sent them back and got emu boots which i like much better for less money

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I purchased a pair of Baffin boots for my husband four years ago and they were great . He absolutely loved them so when he mentioned the rubber was starting to crack , I ordered another pair as a Christmas gift . He opened them Christmas morning and was very happy with his gift . Today he mentioned the liner in the boots is wearing out in places already ! I can not believe how the quality has gone down hill . I believed the boots were a good product ... guess not ! It has been only one month !

 I wear a size 6 shoe so I purchased a 5/6 flip flop . The sole of the flip flop is the right size , but it is so thin , you might as well go barefoot ; whatever you are walking on , you can feel through to the soles of your feet . I also do not like the straps - maybe a mistake was made during manufacturing . It looks/feels like size 10 straps on 5/6 flip flops ; the flip flops will not stay on my feet . I will use them when I have to run outside for a few moments - but otherwise they are worthless if wearing more than a few minutes .
 I enjoy the sky blue color and the soles are squishy , more comfortable than many flip flops ... HOWEVER , the rubber toe hold has caused painful blistering due to rubbing when I walk . I think I will stick with my Teva flip flops and wear these sandals for showering when I camp .
 I was so looking forward to these flip flops . Ca n't seem to find the old school kind that do n't hurt . These were expensive for what they are and they hurt . Pieces stick out weird on the thong and hurt . Sorry I ordered them ...
 I ordered the -LRB- 37-38 / US 7-8 -RRB- shoes and received a pair of shoes clearly marked `` US 6 . '' I need to return these because they are way too small .
 I ordered these because I thought they would be more comfortable than most flip flops . They were n't ! I wanted the green which is really pretty , but the plastic thong part is really uncomfortable . I gave mine to a consignment shop .
 I searched everywhere on line for flip flops because I had hurt the top of my foot and thought I had pay dirt when I found these and read all of the positive reviews . They are uncomfortable , they have unfinished rubber pieces all over the edges making them rough . The thong piece and the two side pcs that goes through to the bottom do not lay flat and that is also uncomfortable . Add a rough foot bed and it adds up to a big waste of money for a thong that looks like a piece of rubber from an old tire . The final kicker was that night when I went to payless I found a beautiful collection of flip flops in different colors and styles at $ 3.99 each , buy 1 get the second 1/2 price -LRB- $ 2 -RRB- .
 I ordered these flip flops , but they sent me the wrong size THREE times . Amazon barely helped with the returns . They allow returns , but the whole process was a mess.So , to summarize . I had to return the three pairs of flip flops , and I never received flip flops in my size .
 I LOVE Havianas Tops but , this pair - in the same size that I have ordered before - was too small . Very disappointed . Reordered from Zappos , hope they get it right .

 It was delivered at time . And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance ; however , it was n't . When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe , which is the reason why I bought it , the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance . Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons . Any way , the prodoct was n't the same value or quality of pumma 's shoes that I have bought in the past .
 I purchased a pair of Baffin boots for my husband four years ago and they were great . He absolutely loved them so when he mentioned the rubber was starting to crack , I ordered another pair as a Christmas gift . He opened them Christmas morning and was very happy with his gift . Today he mentioned the liner in the boots is wearing out in places already ! I can not believe how the quality has gone down hill . I believed the boots were a good product ... guess not ! It has been only one month !

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Unbleached WhiteI guess I should have read the `` fine print '' ! I was expecting a pair of American Made REAL CONVERSE Tennis Shoes ! Instead , I got a POOR INDONESION Copy of a rubber sole -LRB- NO cushion insole -RRB- with a CHEAP upper top ! VERY DISPLEASED !!! Size 11 and about 3 inches wide ! Must fit a Long , Norrow Indonesion foot , Not what I expected from CONVERSE !
 These are not real naughty monkeys . I bought these and they were beyond cheaply made . If you really like these buy the ones that amazon has for 74.95 . $ 19.95 is a rip off !

 Unfortunately I do n't like this bag . It reminds me of a bag for a bowling ball - nice large size but a little too rounded/domed at the top . Good quality and the shipping was perfect but personally not what I expected .

 The boots arrived in a prompt manner , and looked just like the picture , however , they chaffed my husbands legs so badly that he can not wear them . When I tried to contact the seller , I was told they did not have an e-mail address available . I called the phone number , but did not get an answer . They went in the garbage .
 ORDERED THE CORRECT SIZE BUT WAY TOO BIG ! MY HUSBAND TRIED THEM ON AND THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO SLIP OFF AS HE WALKED
 I ordered size 10 boots and they were swimming on me . I gave them to a family member with a size 11 and a half foot and they fit perfectly .
 The sides of the boots are very rigid . It 's difficult to walk in them . I feel like wearing an all-metal boot .
 These boots are shaped very weird . The opening of the boots are larger than I 've seen on other slip on boots . When you have the boots on the soles are sloped in a way that your toes are driven into the front of the boots making them uncomfortable . I returned and was refunded promptly .
 I bought size 10 and the shoes are 11 1/2 even though label size 10 . They are manufacture irregular items as it appears .
 These boots do NOT have leather uppers , they are synthetic . Tag inside says `` man made materials '' made in china , but description says leather uppers .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 At lesst 1 - 1.5 sizes too small . A lot of the comments said to go a half size bigger which I did , but they were still way too small . Amazon charges for return shipping so I definately would recommend a different supplier .
 I had these shoes in suede but left them in a hotel . Since the patent was all they had in black I tried them . There is just one spot where they rub and make a red spot on my foot . I can not wear them .
 I purchased these in purple suede size 7.5 . The size is true as I wear all 7.5 shoes . The shoe is flexible and would seem comfortable , except it is not . I have narrow feet , nothing out of the ordinary , these shoes absolutely killed the back of my foot the first day I wore them . The front part under the embelishment is so flat -LRB- not narrow but rather shallow -RRB- , that it squashed my nails from the top . Overall the look may be nice , but comfort level is terrible .
 i bought this shoe in black patent size 8 . this shoe looked good on my feet . however it was not true to size . i have slim feet and yet it felt small . the back of the shoe constantly rubbed the back of my ankle causing blisters . i wanted to cry . if i had known , i would have gotten it in a size bigger . could n't return it for it was shipped to me back home in manila .

 I have a different style of spira walking shoes and they have worked good for me . They are comfortable and have nice lateral support . However , this style has a sort of bump at the toe area . I think the bump is supposed to fit under your toes . I had to re-order these three times because the bump kept hitting on the ball of my foot . Really uncomfortable . Gave me pain .
 My expectations were high and I was excited to receive my Spira 's as I now walk 2 miles to work . However , I quickly realized that while this shoe may be good for some people , they are not good for my feet . I am a supinator -LRB- wear down the outside edges of my shoes -RRB- and I have a very high arch . I find the heals of these shoes particulary hard -- almost like you can feel the metal spring inside the heal . I ended up inserting an extra gel sole inside each shoe , which has helped . Overall , a big disappointment , especially given the price .
 I purchased this shoe for my wife . It was her second pair . The first pair was fine and she liked them , so we bought the second pair . This pair wore out in five weeks . The lining in the heel broke down . As it was too late to return them to Amazon , I contacted the manufacturer . When I discussed the problem with customer service , she told me there was no problem with the shoe , the problem was that the shoe did n't fit right . I asked to speak to someone higher up and she connected me to the head of the returns depatment . When I described the problem to him , he also immediately told me it was a problem with the fit . I asked him why we would have a problem with this pair and not with the first pair . He responed thats a good question . I do n't know about you , but I ' v never had a problem like this , and I ' v had hundreds of shoes in my life . From the way they acted it appeared to be a common problem . They were very quick to say it was a problem wiyh the fit . I think they have seen it a lot . Anyway he told he he could n't help , but he would talk to the head of the on-line store , who was off that day , and she would return my call . They never did return my call.Very poor customer service and they do not stand behind their product . I will not buy from them again , $ 135.00 of a pair of shoes and they wo n't retun a call when theres a problem
 I wanted a pair of shoes that I could wear for extended period knowing that I would be doing alot of standing and walking . From time I put these shoes on I knew that I was going down hill . But the reviews from other customers was so wonderful , that I thought well maybe it 's just me . So , I decided to were them to a day long festival . I would have walked barefoot back home , if i could have . These shoes are so very uncomfortable and they feel that like they were not properly made . However I did not return them in the 30 days and reading other customers complaints I realize that I am just out of luck . So , please if you do decide to order these shoes and feel that they are not right for you , listen to yourself and execise your right to return them before it is too late.Sadly , stuck with another pair of shoes !
 I would think for the price , this shoe would have lasted longer than it did . I purchased this pair of shoes in January . Seeing as how I live in the Northeast and we get plenty of snow , they were not worn daily . Then spring and summer time arrived and sandles became prevalent . I have worn these shoes maybe about 5 months out of the 8 months I 've owned them , and the material/cushion on the inside of the shoe has worn away in certain spots . I am not a person to hike , run -LRB- on the road or on a track -RRB- , take fitness classes , etc. . . These shoes were not over worn . It 's just the quality that lacks duribility . I will not spend this kind of money on a substandard shoe again ~
 Great except for one very important problem
 I am an avid walker , 5-6 miles a day , and have worn many brands of walking and training shoes . I decided to purchase these Spira shoes based on online reviews in May 2010 . My initial impression was very good and I rated the shoes this way . However , I was recently wearing the shoes and the left one became very noisy . I thought I picked up a little stone in the shoe . Kept walking . Then the shoe started a low pitched squeek . When I got home I discovered a 3 '' x 1/4 '' hole in the sole of the left shoe , exposing a metal plate . I have never experienced this problem after wearing walking shoes for such a short period of time , and have returned them for a full refund . Perhaps my shoe was defective and this is not a reflection on Spira . But I will not purchased this brand again .
 They are nothing more than any other shoe that I 've bought at a local shoe store for half the money . They really are n't anything special to warrent the price . Although they fit my narrow feet well , I ca n't be truely happy with them . My knees still hurt after work every day and the inside is n't as comforting as they were promised to be . There is no spring action that I can feel , but I can surely hear the squeek with every step I take . My advice is save the money ! These shoes are not worth this price !!!
 I ordered this shoe for a trip to Ireland . I was disappointed because it did n't look like the picture . It had no heel and look like an orthopedic shoe . I 'm sure it was comfortable but it was n't appealing to me . I went to DSW and got a very good walking sneaker that suited my needs for comfort and attractiveness in a shoe .
 I ordered a pair of the womens wavewalkers for work , since i had heard they were great shoes , they were somewhat comfortable but within just a few days started coming apart . and the customer service is horrible after 2 months I am still trying to get my money back !! Dont waste your time !! will only buy Saucony from now on !!
 After reading all good reviews , I bought this pair of shoes . It looked okay and felt okay when I walked around the house . So I wore them today at Legoland all day , and my feet were not very happy at the end of the day . First , I felt the springs on my heels , and my heels became sore in the middle of the day . Second , the sides of my small toes were hurting as well , both feet , by afternoon . I can not figure out why since nothing really felt hard on the side of the shoes , but regardless , they were tender after a long day of walk . It felt like I am wearing a pair of dress shoes when they are supposed to be comfortable walking shoes.I do not understand how $ 100 shoes are made such that I feel the springs on my heels ? I actually felt round shape of springs on my heels . Ca n't you believe it ? The company can not put thick enough padding?In terms of my small toes , I bought wide shoes . I had enough space on the front so I can not figure out why the side of my toes hurt.I am very unhappy . Since I wore the pair outside for one day , I can not return them , and it cost me $ 100 . It is very expensive shoes to be thrown away after one day of wear.My suggestion
 I bought these as an easy slip-on boot to take my puppy out -LRB- quite frequently -RRB- . Perhaps it 's the rubber or lining , but these are the foulest smelling boots I have ever owned . They smelled like musty mildew right out of the box . Leaving them on the screen porch and using odor neutralizer does no good . I attempted to wear them outside while shoveling snow - my feet were cold within an hour , and I had ski socks on . Perhaps the puppy can cut her teeth on them .
 I wore these boots to deliver mail , and by the end of the day , my ankles and shins were bruised , and I was in severe pain . Due to the stiff leather upper , these can not be worn to walk long distances , but they are waterproof .
 these were so hideous i returned them upon receiving them and they were not the ones in the picture . definitely do not buy these boots .

 I could n't figure it out until I went back to an older pair of running shoes . It was this pair of shoes that was causing the pain . Bad pain . If you have any type of lower back problem do not purchase these shoes for running . Spend the extra dollars and get better technology shoes like the Saucony Echelon -LRB- if you have a neutral gait -RRB- .
 This is my upteenth pair of Shadow 6000
 I bought these pair and when it arrived , i was really frustrated.Quality wise , fitment wise it 's just not good.I wear a size 9.5 and the one 's I 've got was too snug to wear , so if you 're buying this shoes , buy an inch bigger . I returned this sucker ASAP and got me a pair of the NEW BALANCE 992 . SO i Would n't recommend this shoes regardless . SAVE ur MONEY , save a hassle .
 They do n't look great , kind of like they belong at the GYM which is why I bought them , cool . They 're easy on the knee 's and back .

 I bought this for my son who is not chubby . After several attempts , I still could not fit his foot in . I had to throw them away : -LRB-
 I was very disapointed when I recieved the shoes with the ink tag still on them . From what I understand it happens a lot with this company . Then to learn I would have to return the shoes , wait for them to crdit my account , and re purchase them . Instead of the company just removing the ink tag .
 I found these boots to be kind of narrow in the shaft and in the foot . They were n't as comfortable as I need my boots to be if I am expecting to wear them often in the fall and winter , so I am returning them .
 The design for these booth are wrong.foot is bigger then the calf area .
 The croc buttons were not snapped together tightly . She was heart broken but without the straps she ca n't keep them on her feet . I saved three of the buttons but no such luck on the first one that came off .
 These shoes are not durable at all . My son who is 2 only wore these for a few days before the black plastic piece that holds the strap on the back broke off . I could never get it back on right and eventually lost the piece . They are now completely broken and can not be worn at all .
 These are cute and look comfy however both my kids complain that the straps have cause blisters . The area where the round crocs logo is , rubs on the insides of their feet . Not a good vacation when the kids are complaining of hurt feet .
 I order two pairs of these for my boys , and within five minutes of my older son putting them on for the first time the plastic `` rivets '' holding the strap to the shoe broke . Shortly after that , a `` rivet '' on my other sons pair broke . Two new pairs of shoes both broken within ten minutes of them being worn tells me that this is more than just a manufacturing `` oops '' . The rivets are a design flaw and whatever cost-savings they are to the company , they just paid for in customer loyalty . I will never buy crocs again!BTW , for those of you who have this problem , there is a fix ... Go to the fabric store and buy some Blue Jeans Buttons to replace the plastic `` rivets '' . They fit the openings pretty well , and they 're metal , so they are n't going to break .
 The sizing does not make sense ... I bought a size 4 for my one year old and it could fit a four month old . Wasted my money .
 My daughter owns an identical pair of these in light pink in toddler size 8/9 . I purchased a fuscia pair from Amazon in the exact same size , but they are 1/2 '' shorter in length . When my daughter tried them on , her toes were touching the end of the shoes . So I must return them -LRB- and my daughter is extremely disappointed -RRB- . What 's worse , since the return is not the result of Amazon 's error , they can not be exchanged ; I can order a new pair , but would have to incur the shipping charge . I do n't have money to throw away , and with the sizing irregularities , the next size up could still not fit -LRB- it 's anyone 's guess -RRB- . Unless you have time and money to waste on returns and reorders , I would not recommend ordering these online . We will have to find these in a brick-and-mortar store where my daughter can try them on to see if they 're really going to fit .
 Horrible customer service , unresponsive . I ordered purple and I got a Disney Cars model and on a different size . I wrote an e = mail and never received an answer from them . Thank god Crocs is a great company and I was able to exchange them on a Crocs concept store . I dont recommend this vendor
 Hi , I ordered this pair of crocs shoes for my little boy , and I was very dissapointed , because I noticed that the name of Crocs on the bach side of the trap , was inverted in the right foot . I never saw an original crocs shoes with this kind of mistake , so I thought I was frauded .
 I ordered a pair of children 's crocs from this seller a month ago . I got no notice of delay until I wrote to the seller through amazon . They told me only then that there would be a 2 week delay . Finally today , one month after placing the order , I received notice that they would be unable to fulfill my order . Order your crocs from a different seller !
 I bought a pair of these shoes locally about 2 years ago -LRB- size 8-9 for LESS than -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- he was size 8 at the time , they were a little too big on my son I set them aside . It took quite a few months for him to finally be able to use them . Finally he was able to use them , he used them for quite a while . My son is autistic , so once he likes something he wants it ALL the time . Unfortunately he wanted to wear them to bed , since he never went outdoors with them ; I figured that 's not too bad.The only time these would come off was for bath time , eventually they broke -LRB- 3 months later -RRB- . It was a pain to find them locally , they do n't sell them anymore . By the third sleepless night with my son who 'd give a HARD time to be put to bed I came here to Amazon hoping to find help.I ordered the very same shoe same size 8-9 for toddler -LRB- 3 times the price of the originals -RRB- they took 2 weeks to arrive . His size now varies between 9 and 9.5 . They were really tight -LRB- of course -RRB- and he did n't want them ! So I came back and ordered him size 10-11 , surprise ! THEY 'RE HUGE!In my desperation I had to submerge the 8-9 in warm water ... to stretch them , I took newspapers and shoved them inside the shoes and kept changing the warm water . It took 3 days but the shoes FINALLY stretched enough for him to find them comfortable to wear.He 's back wearing them ; meanwhile his foot is growing as I 'm typing here . And yet no shoe sized 9-10 that resembles this shoe at all.Oh but the worst thing is not the size , the worst thing IS THE PRICE ! -LSB- ... -RSB- ??? For rubber shoes ? Are you kidding me ? If I did n't have this emergency I would n't have bought these shoes AT ALL ! These people are deliberately taking advantage of desperate parents!As soon as I find them locally again I 'm ditching these guys , it would n't be so bad if they actually had the size of my son .
 The size was listed 1-3 , but too wide looking , the starp was too cheap , came off easly . I will be returning this pair again !
 If you get the length you need , then they are way too wide - like boats and way too big for children to keep on their feet .
 First time buying crocs . Thought they were supposed to be high quality . But after a few weeks of occasional wear by my 5 year old , strap broke off . Hesitant to buy a new pair , but otherwise great for summer b/c they 're close-toed and can get wet . He really liked them ... a few weeks later , we decided to try another pair and this time strap broke on very first day ! What junk . Now he 's wearing one croc from the old pair and one from the new - until those straps break too .
 I bought these crocs for my granddaughter and was very dissapointed that they were too big for her . The sizing is odd so I had to return them
 This is Amazon feedback more than Crocs feedback
 These are made in Mexico , and although it is 100 times better than having them made in China , they are defective . The cuts are not clean . They look like someone sliced them with a knife . I will keep them because it is a hassle to return them but being from CO and buying crocs since they invented them in Boulder ... I am NOT happy with these .
 Not a big fan of these shoes . After my three year old daughter fell numerous times while running in these shoes , we limit her use of them to quick trips to the pool or backyard . She is not allowed to run in them and does n't like to wear them as they make her fall down . She has a narrow foot , and perhaps this attributes to that a bit . These shoes are very wide and loose . Probably more suited to a child with wide feet or a child that does n't run and play -LRB- do they exist -RRB- ? I will not be purchasing these again , as I have found the Keen Newport to be a much better , durable , safer shoe for my child to wear all summer .
 I 've purchased many pairs of Crocs over the years but the quality has severely diminished over the past few years . I 'm not sure exactly what has changed in the manufacturing but a pair of crocs used to last my daughter a couple of years . At the end of May , the back strap broke on a pair so I bought a new pair through Amazon . She wore them TWICE when one of the straps broke off the back . We decided to do `` surgery '' and took a back strap off an old pair to replace the broken one . I wish we had simply returned them at the time but she liked them so we did n't . Now , the other strap has broken off the back . Please note that the strap off of the older pair is still intact and going strong . You can actually FEEL the difference in thickness between the old and new . It 's really sad because my daughter and most of her friends love them but I will not spend $ 32 on a pair of shoes that breaks immediately . And of course , I ca n't return to Amazon . Hopefully , I 'm not the only one that 's complained -LRB- I also complained directly to Crocs -RRB- and the quality will improve again but for now , we 've purchased our last pair of crocs . And our last pair of shoes from Amazon , PERIOD , due to the return policy .
 I ordered blue crocs for my child in a certain size . They sent me bright neon crocs , in a smaller size . Why ? I do n't know . I ask for an exchange or refund , and I have yet to receive any . This has been going on for months and it is yet to be resolved . I finally put a review to see if I can get a different outcome .
 The strap broke within 6 weeks of receiving the item . Our now 19 month old has another pair of Crocs -LRB- lego blocks -RRB- that she has worn more and those are still fine . Her previous pair she was able to wear until she outgrew with no problems.I am very frustrated I can not return/exchange these when it seems I must have received a defective pair .
 I have purchased at least six pairs of Crocs previously and I have always had great luck with them holding up through all kinds of wild little boy behavior . Which is why I am really disappointed that the straps on these Crocs broke after my son wore them 4 or 5 times . Maybe these were seconds of some type ? Fakes ? Not sure , but very unhappy to be purchasing another pair less than two weeks after purchasing these .
 Maybe it is me , but I ordered shoes in what I thought were my daughters size and they came in the exact size of my son 's , whose feet are two sizes bigger . I could have misordered but I was pretty careful about it . The sizing chart is confusing.I agree with the woman who says the shoes are too expensive for what they are . That is probably true for kids ' shoes in general , though .
 I always buy my kids crocs before going to Disney every year . I have never had a problem before . They usually walk alot and stay comfy . This year my 8 year old got horrible blisters on the top of his feet where the shoe opening is . Needless to say he wore gym shoes the rest of the trip . Poor kid was very uncomfortable . I think it might be this style . My other two children wore different styles .
 We own several pairs of the old Crocs type slingbacks which had rivets that held the strap in place . These rivets have broken in the past and we had ordered replacements -LRB- not free may I add -RRB- . When I called today I was told that the new style Crocs have machine rivets and therefore the old style is no longer available . I find this to be extremely poor customer service .
 My son had a pair of crocs last summer and wore them every day . They held up beautifully . So , I bought him a pair -LRB- same color and style -RRB- for this year and within a month the strap broke off . At $ 20 , these shoes should stand up better than that . I do n't know what happened to their quality , but these were a disappointment .
 I normally love Crocs and buy a pair each year for my kid , but the one 's I just got broke in two days . I want to return them for a new pair .
 We order these for my son 's birthday . They arrived on time on his birthday but they were obviously in Used condition . The bottom of the crocs were worn , and the alligator images on the sides were scratched off .
 I think I would have loved this shoe for my 3 year old , but the black buckle piece broke within an hour of her wearing it ! She was just around the house and it popped off and the inside was broken . The color was cute though . Wish Amazon had not run out so I could have exchanged them . I had to take a refund instead . Probably why they were only $ -LSB- ... -RSB- when I bought them !
 I love my work crocs so I ordered this for my daily use , and all reviews said order smaller way to big !! So I usually wear a 81/2 to 9 in shoes -LRB- on the smaller side normally -RRB- so I ordered a 8 and wow they were way to small !! And even with my foot in them it felt too unstable . Not a great choice for me : -LRB-
 While I had high hopes for these shoes , I can not recommend them for little toddlers at least . My daughter , who is 2 1/2 , stopped constantly to get out bits of grass , sand , and rocks that came in the holes around the sides . Not fun ! However , I also bought some crocs with a crocband around this problem area , which are perfect and never do this , so I recommend buying some of those instead !
 We purchased these from an outlet store so perhaps they were not made properly . However I was informed that the color combination between the shoe and strap was the only difference so I am posting this review for Moms who have toddlers with wide feet . After one hour of wearing the shoes my son developed blisters on the side of both feet . We threw the shoes away . Will not buy another pair . Too bad since I liked the anti microbial aspect and breathability .
 I really do n't want to sound like a naysayer , but I remember reading somewhere that , due to the soft nature of these shoes , then have gotten stuck in the edge of escalators . My children are older , so I did n't worry , but my family and I saw this happen to a young boy first hand . It was quite frightening , and I hate to think of what could have happened if my husband had n't rushed over and pressed the emergency stop button on the escalator . If your child wears these , please take caution to keep his/her feet away from the sides of escalators .
 I was very disappointed with this crocs . It smelled so bad , it had a very strong smell , I would n't let my baby girl wear it as I 'm sure it 's very toxic . I ordered this crocs in Fuschia color size 6-7 and I was really excited to try it on my daughter , but I guess it 's going directly to the trash . I can not return it , cuz I do n't live in the US , and returning it would cost me as much as it costs . . very very unhappy with this order . .
 I ordered these Croc shoes for my daughter in July , and she wore them 3 times and the strap ripped
 I BOUGHT THIS CROCS FOR MY 2 1/2 YEARS BOY AND I CHOOSE THE 4-5 M US TODDLER . WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT DID N'T FIT HIM CAUSE IT IS TOO SMALL . THE SIZE CHART IS TOTALLY INCORRECT
 Well they are crocks . and the color is not what I expected . Burst is highlighter yellow ! I was expecting more of a butter color judging by the photo . I read the sizing chart and ordered my toddler a size 8/9 his normal shoe size is a 7 . Well he most likely will not be wearing these at all ! By the time he fits in them it will be winter ! Ugh so frustrating !! But the quality of the product is wonderful . Despite the color mix up i really wish his feet would fit into these !!
 My son has been wearing crocs for years . He has worn the classic style . I thought this would just be the next size up . But the sizing seemed off . We ordered a boys size 2 . The size 2 was about 1/4 inch longer than the size 1 that he had outgrown . But the width was 3/4 of an inch wider in the heel area , at least and equally wide or wider in the toe area . The size was described by Amazon as Medium or M. I looked up the same shoe on the crocs.com website and it was described as their `` roomiest '' or widest fit of the three fit styles they listed . So I think this shoe should be listed as a W or Wide not medium , especially since Crocs run wide anyway . I had my son put one old shoe on and one new shoe on and took a picture . I was hoping to be able to post the picture so that potential buyers could see how wide this shoe is . This shoe would probably fit a kid with short toes and very wide or chubby feet . I am returning them as they do not fit my child 's average size 2 foot .
 Not sure what happened to the Crocs brand , however , the quality definitely is NOT the same as it has been . My 2 year old son wore this pair only a few times before the back strap broke off and it can not be repaired.Basically it was a waste of money and I will have to look for an alternative brand that has n't allowed their quality of product to drop .
 I ordered blue croc , but I got chocolate color.My son was upset , since blue is his favorite color.I did n't want to take trouble returning it and exchanging it.But we were not happy about it .
 Good fit but leather is very hard . My son had several shoe bites and no longer wears the shoe .
 I was thrilled when I got these because the lights and colors on them looked great and I 've always had success with the Skechers brand . However after less than a month the velcro closure strap on both shoes tore quite a bit , to the point where I thought each time my son put on these shoes would be the last . If I had to do it over again I 'd still go with Skechers but probably a different type .
 the ankle strap is n't long enough . but the shoe itself fits good . The color is good too . I do n't think its a 5 &#34; heel ether
 this plastic ornament digs into my feet , I can not walk at all , it hurts too much
 I think the shoe is fairly comfortable , but a little too clunky and heavy around the sole area ! Eccos are better !
 The shoe runs a little narrow , so if you need a wide , order up a 1/2 size .
 These could have been good shoes but they fall off when you walk . Not because they are too big , but the heel is to loose . I wear a 10.5 and that 's what I got . They fit comfortably but am falling out of them when I walk . Glad they where cheap , if I where not so horribly lazy would have tried to return them .
 I ordered size 10 and I could n't get my feet into them . I would suggest that if you have swelled or just large feet that you order a higher size . Because there is no elastic , the top of the shoes just does n't have any give at all . The shoes were long enough for me but just could n't wear them . My feet are n't all that big either .
 These were a comfortable shoe for the first month or so . Then I started noticing a weird popping sound accompanied by a mild snapping sensation in the sole . Could n't see any sign of trouble at first . During the second month of ownership , the popping got worse and cracks started developing . At the end of 2 months , they were unwearable . You can flex the soles and see a spider web of cracks that literally go thru to the insole . I live in Colorado and wore them in the first couple of months of spring . Did n't wear them in the mountains on sharp rocks . No 130 degree asphalt . I 'm not obese . I just wore them on the weekends and some evenings for working around the house . No reason for the soles to go to pieces like this other than it 's just a very bad rubber formulation . These are complete junk . You 're better off spending more money on some Merrell mocs . I just ordered a pair for $ 66 here on Amazon . They 're more than double the cost but at least I know they 'll last at least a couple of years versus a couple of months .

 Watch out future buyers , this bowling shoe in particular has a major size difference . I ordered a 7.5 , got the 7.5 , but when I tried them on , the shoe size fit like a 9 . Be cautious !

 the ankle strap is n't long enough . but the shoe itself fits good . The color is good too . I do n't think its a 5 &#34; heel ether

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 These are not as comfortable as other UGGs I have . There is a strong possibility that these are knockoffs - the lining , supposedly shearling , feels manmade . All in all , I should have saved my money and gone to the UGGs store at the mall . Disappointing !
 the ankle strap is n't long enough . but the shoe itself fits good . The color is good too . I do n't think its a 5 &#34; heel ether

 I 've bought these heels several times the last time I bought them I was very dissapointed when I received them . They are not the same material feels different definitely not as soft as the ones I 've bought before like I said I 've both the same shoes before . It says they 're BCBG but I do n't know I 've bought them before and they do n't feel the same not as comfortable as before . Months after they are still in my closet -LRB- almost new -RRB- and now I find myself looking for them again . It is how I came across this review I had written . I 'm glad I recognized my renew since I wrote it before I actually got the heels thinking I would like them . I 'm definitely not buying them from here again .
 I have purchased many BCBG Katchen Shoes on line from Amazon . This is the 3rd pair of this shoe I have purchased in the last three years . I wear them as daily work shoe.Unfortunately , thie entire sole of this last pair came off within 3 weeks of wearing them . It was neither snowy or rainy . It was surprising as this shoe has always performed very well for me and BCBG is top quality . I wonder if Amazon had very old inventory in stock where the glue on the sole was separting.I was quite disappointed . But if you can get a normal quality pair , they are great . They look good and are very comfortable . I have never had an issue in the past and would still recommend them for women working in the office .
 Well , I was very excited to get these shoes because I had seen them in the mall , and they looked super cute , but I had never tried them on . Now , I have big feet , a size 11 , but pretty much every pair of 11 's that I 've tried on/bought have always fit.Anyway , I decided to purchase these , because I needed a nice and simple black pump . When they came in the mail , I ripped through that box so quickly -LRB- I was really excited to get them -RRB- , and I think I spent a good couple minutes trying to cram my foot into this VERY narrow and tight shoe . I thought , `` It 's okay , they 'll stretch out . '' So I walked around the house in them for a bit.Two things I noticed :1 -RRB- The point of the toe is so long , that when you walk , the empty part of it actually bends , leaving a bit of a crease . It seemed like this crease would only get deeper and deeper , making the shoes much less attractive .2 -RRB- I went to walk on the carpet , and I slid around all over the place -LRB- just so you know , I have a LOT of experience walking in 3 , 4 , and even 5 inch heels/pumps -RRB- . It was very awkward , and something I have never had a shoe do before.And beyond all that , they just plain hurt . They felt like I was cramming them into a size 9 . I do n't think that they would have ever been comfortable , broken in or not.Sadly I ended up returning them . I really wanted to try to make it work , but for $ 67.00 , I had to LOVE them . They looked great online , but not on my feet .
 I love the look of these but they are very uncomfortable and run small . I ordered an 8 which usually fits but was tight in these shoes .
 These shoes came as a rec . from a friend who swears by them . As a girl who has to dress in business professional attire everyday for work I was excited to try these . I have not even had them for 2 weeks and the metal is already worn through the heel , mind you I am 5 ' 11 '' and thin . I have shoes from Target that are better made than these ! The heel looks chewed up and the bottoms are almost worn . I am not on my feet a whole lot so I ca n't see why these shoes would already be as worn as they are , except for being cheaply made . Other than that , the out side of them looks nice ... but if I could return them I would . Not impressed BCBG !
 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .
 Completely dissapointed . The published size is wrong . Notice the item description is 6.5-8US Wms . The boots are actually 8-9 .5 US Women .
 If you are considering buying these overboots I would suggest trying them on at a store first . I wear size 11 shoe and purchased the size XL for -LRB- 11-12 .5 -RRB- shoe and ther is no way they will fit over them , and they are a sneaker ! I found the boot localy and tried the XXL size and barely got them over my shoes because the tight ankle area , and when I did finally pull them on and walked in them they were very sloppy in the toe area -- enough to make you trip on the extra rubber at the toe !
 Received large size as ordered . I wear a size 9 + and these boots will NOT pull on over my shoes . Very tight fit . They bind at the top open end when trying to get shoe to go in . So i cut the top 4 '' off and they now go on easily . A totally poorly designed product . Dont buy .
 had n't planned on grading Tingley yet . Will change the gradeing based upon the response . The boot is of solid construction and exactly what I 'm looking for but the size does n't match what I bought . It was suppossed to be an overshoe between a size 9 1/2 -11 . I wear a size 9 . My boots wo n't fit into them . I believe the issue is the are actually a 8-9 1/2 but where mismarked . I would have gladly contacted the vender but could not find a phone number or link . The only link was back to Amazon . By the way , I 'm in Afghanistan and need the boots now .
 these overboots seem like they are well made but lightweight . they are a little pricey . they 're just the thing for a wet day at work.UPDATE !!! i bought these boots in late spring and have n't used them due to a dry summer . they have sit on my covered front porch for six months . i got them out this morning after a rainy night and put them on over my shoes . they have dry rotted and had holes and cracks in them . turns out that they are JUNK .
 This was my most disappointing purchase on Amazon
 This is by far the worst product I have purchased from Amazon to date . I read all the reviews before purchasing these overshoes and felt confident with the purchase based on all the positive reviews . So based on the reviews , I thought I planned right by ordering Large -LRB- Mens 9.5-11 -RRB- overshoes for my size 8-8 .5 shoes . To my surprise , I had to use a tremendous amount of effort to stretch the rubber overshoe over my Rockport casual shoes . When I tried to take the overshoe off , it took my entire shoe off my feet . I ca n't believe I need to order XL for my small feet . Really poor design in terms of true shoe size . The other problem I had was that the hole used to button the overshoe was completely closed so you could n't button the overshoe .
 I bought these shoes for my boyfriend for basketball . Ever since he 's used them , he has had problems with his ancle and the bottoms of his feet . Not to mention he only had them a couple months and they started to fall apart . I dont recommend any of the Iverson 's !
 Does not produce results as expected . I have had better , not sharp Would have expected more from Martha Stewart . Sorry
 I BOUGHT A PAIR OF THE MARY JANE STYLE HOPING THE STRAP WOULD HOLD THEM ON MY FEET.THEY STAY ON BUT THEY LOOK RIDICULOUS . I HAVE AN A2 FOOT AND THESE CROCS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE PERSON WITH LESS THAN A MEDIUM OR WIDE SIZE FOOT . TOO BAD FOR ME AS I WOULD BUY SEVERAL COLORS . OH WELL - I TRIED .
 Mary Jane Crocs showed up with a torn strap and when I went to send back and re-order , none were available in the size and color I wanted . was refunded money with shipping costs .
 I was very excited about receiving these Crocs , until I was sent two left feet in the mail . What a disappointment ! If it was n't for having to return them , I may have enjoyed these as they felt comfortable -LRB- on the one foot -RRB- and are not as bulky as the original model of Crocs .
 material looked faded -LRB- definitely not as deep of a black as picture and felt stretched out . Also right shoe straps keep coming unclipped which is very annoying .
 These crocs are too narrow for my feet , I have another size 8 pair and they are wider , what 's UP ? The seller did not say they were a narrow size .
 I 've been trying to wear these maryjane croc during the summer months for the past 3 years . I am finally giving them up as worthless for me . Before I explain what has not worked I will say that Crocs are great indoor/outdoor messy chore shoes being protective of my toes , waterproof and easily cleaned . Because they 're cushiony and easy on/off -LRB- especially with the heel strap removed -RRB- I liked to wear them as house shoes . For this use , I was content with the style since I wear a womens size 10 and the the maryjane is definitely less bulky than clog style.Unfortunately , if I wear these shoes any extended length of time for walking or standing such as grocery shopping , cooking and washing dishes , etc. . I end up with aching feet . I mean painful ! As shock absorbing as they seem to be , I guess the support is just not there . It 's not like they 're flat either , they have some built in arch . I never had this problem with my feet with any other sandal or flip-flop before . Not sure if that 's coinciding with the onset of middle age and being more susceptible to plantar fasciitis or the fact that I tried to wear these shoes alot because of their benefits . Another drawback I tolerated for too long is that the bottom of this shoe tends to `` grab '' on a hard or tile floor and can cause a trip or fall while walking . Definitely annoying if not dangerous!I 'm sure the plastic they 're made of will last forever , so I feel really guilty about putting them in trash , but for me the cons of crocs outweigh the pros .

 I really like Anne Klein shoes and have bought some in the past . I purchased these shoes thinking that they would be as comfortable and fit the same as the other Anne Klein shoes I have purchased . These shoes turned out to be very uncomfortable in the heel area and I have not been able to break them in . Everytime I where them I get blisters and can barely make it through the day wearing them . I am not sure if it is because I need a half size bigger or if the heel is so stiff that it ca n't be broken in .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .

 At 6 ' 2 , 280 I was glad to find this nice looking , well-fitting shoe at JCPenny . In less than a year , the heel has noticably cracked where it bridges , though , which is why I am here trying to find a bargain on another pair . Maybe a Metro-sexual only shoe ; -RRB-
 I 've had my eye on these shoes for a while , then I just decided to go for it . I was so sad because on my feet , it just did n't fit right around the toe area ... it 's strange to describe , but it almost seemed as though it ` puckered ' in between the straps ??? I love the look of the shoe ... especially the heel ... but I just could n't deal with it .
 I was very disapointed when I recieved the shoes with the ink tag still on them . From what I understand it happens a lot with this company . Then to learn I would have to return the shoes , wait for them to crdit my account , and re purchase them . Instead of the company just removing the ink tag .
 i live in slip on sketchers.they 're all i wear around the house and i 've had many styles but never on that was uncomforatable that i did n't feel sturdy in . My calves are sore from illness and that 's why i wear sneakers but these made my calves ache after only a few minutes it felt like i had worked out . I also did n't notice when ordering them that they had laces which i did n't like . . the end kept getting stuck in the shoe . I will give these to charity and use my other sketchers slip ons . These were the only uncomforatable ones i ever bought from this brand.Also they ran a bit small .
 I liked how light the shoe was . But the third time I wore them they ripped . They have a BIG hole them . They could have been made a lot better!So I only wore them three times and then they saw there way to the trash .
 I purchased these slip ons because I wanted to get my mom a different grasshopper shoe , since she loves them so . Unfortunately , one look at the shoes and they went right back into the box and sent back . My mom has really wide feet , due to a condition that causes her to have high levels of water retention in her legs and feet . If she 's on her feet for too long , her feet further swell . These shoes did n't look capable of holding a regular wide foot let alone an extra , extra wide one . Maybe as a regular shoe they 're awesome , but if you 're looking for a pair to accomodate a wide foot , look elsewhere .
 My daughter has wide feet , so when I saw this shoe available in wide , i could n't resist . she wears other styles of stride rite shoes in wide widths with no problem . this shoe never fit right . it is too tight at the top . my daughther cried every time i tried to put them on . these are very cute shoes , but the fitting is poor .
 Normally I like Stride Rite Products because I know that they will fit right . But this pair of 7W were too SMALL for my daughter 's foot and she 's sized at 6.5 . This was a very disappointment .
 I purchased these for my daughter to wear over the holiday 's . I bought an size larger than she wears -LRB- 8 -RRB- only to find the shoes are made very small and she could not wear them ... Dissapointed
 Compared to other shoes the same size , these were too small & my daughter has never been able to wear them . I was disappointed in these Stride Rite shoes .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .

 Under Armour is an Excellent product . Bought 3 pairs of socks for Christmas presents ... The material works just as described ... perfect .
 THIS SHOES FITS SO BAD IT IS PAINFUL . I WISH I COULD HAVE RETURNED IT THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER I WORE IT . IT DOES NOT FIT LIKE IT LOOKS IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE . THE STRAP RUBS THE BACK OF MY FOOT RAW .
 I did n't like the quality of these boots at all they were not made out of leather but what almost appears to be plastic or something of that nature . I expected allot better quality boots for what they claimed to have been worth.I saw boots for 15.00 at walmart as good as these .

 Great boots when in warranty - but after , not so much!Some of the Asolo materials selected ` degrade ' and break down over time and they will NOT warranty them!The soles of my $ 300 boots literally broke off from the boot!They do NOT stand behind their product !

 These booties are not made for wide feet at all , the rubber sole has curled up around my front toes & they do not lay flat when I wear them . Also the material is not very warm , so if you are looking to get these as a slipper they wont be warm .
 These were not comfortable at all , the plastic bottoms radiate cold if you are standing on a cold floor . I would not recommend these .
 Ummmmhhhh ... not quite what I thought . The elastic around your ankles will become loose very quickly making it uncomfortable to wear . Cheaply made if you ask me . Would n't recommend purchasing .
 Do n't buy these . They are n't worth the tiny price . I 'm not returning them , but I 'm not thrilled with them . Do n't throw your $ away .
 Actually it should be ZERO stars !!! REALLY DISAPPOINTED !!! I love the Baggallini bags and own a couple of them . I have been thinking on getting the red Only Bagg for a long time and when I saw the price I could n't resist . This bag seems to be an imitation or second hand item . It does NOT have all of the zippered pockets -LRB- 7 -RRB- inside and is missing the 2 meshed bottle holders completely !!! The coin purse is missing the id window as well . Amazon is sending an replacement , so I will update my comments once it arrives.Well , I received the replacement and again the Bagg was not up to the quality I 'm used to from Baggallini . Both Baggs have been returned . VERY DISSAPOINTED !!!
 I bought this bag based on the Amazon reviews and I completely disagree with most of them . This bag is bulky , and the lining is so thin between compartments that the bag has no structure . If you put something in the middle compartment , it sticks out in to the outer compartments and everything feels like a big mess . The bag is n't deep enough and feels bulky on my shoulder when filled -LRB- not over-stuffed -RRB- . Not a good bag .
 I was very disappointed that the bag was not as photographed . A key selling point was the photo window on the small enclosed bag pictured . If the photos can not be trusted , I am going to be very cautious about buying items from Amazon .
 Felt that the quality was quite poor for the price . Gratefully , I was able to return it . The customer service was good .

 the ankle strap is n't long enough . but the shoe itself fits good . The color is good too . I do n't think its a 5 &#34; heel ether
 My son has worn stride rite shoes since he was born and I have never had a problem with any of their shoes before . They 've always been comfortable for him to wear and never hurt his feet . BUT these sandals , hurt his feet to the point that he will take them off . The design on these sandals is what causes them to hurt his feet . The clasps on the front and back of the shoe are not designed well . there is a space in between where the velcro closes the material around the toe and around the ankle , also the material has a weird hook type effect where u clasp the velcro area that actually flips down onto the foot and causes it to dig into his skin . Makes no sense to me why they designed the closure areas to have the material turn down . Anyway this is the only pair of stride rite shoes that I have not liked , but he has only worn these maybe 5 times and I 've already sent them off to Goodwill . I would suggest going with a different design the Sunfish and the TT Tallon sandals are wonderful , I will never stray again .
 My 2 year old daughter has always worn Stride Rite shoes . They have always fit her well . This particular model is HORRIBLE ! It digs into her skin and she screams no when I try to put them on her . I put some molefoam in them and that helped a little -LRB- she does n't scream about them with the molefoam -RRB- , but her feet still get blisters and indentations in her foot -LRB- just not as severe as without the molefoam -RRB- . This sandal is a poor design . Why would stride rite have rubber on the inside of the strap over the foot that has a texturized rubber ? That 's what leaves an indentation in her foot .
 My 18 month old son loves wearing his shoes , specifically his Stride Rite tennies . So I figured Stride Rite was the best for sandals . Just putting them on his feet for less than a minute , he was yelling `` Off ! Off ! '' I tried five different times to get him to wear them - just aruond the room . Each time with the same expression . I returned them . They must have been rubbing his little feet wrong . I guess I need to try them on in the stores so I know that they dont rub .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .

 I own many much pair of Clark 's shoes and this style is narrower than the average Clark shoes . The center decoration that holds the shoe upper together makes the show have less flexibility than normal Clarks . If your foot is slightlynarrorer than a medium width , this is the shoe for you .
 Pretty to look at but very uncomfortable on . Foot pulls off to side . Had a great experience with other Clarks but this was a waste of money .
 I ordered size 7.5 for myself , but did n't fit me at all . My mother in law wears size 6.5 and they fit her perfectly .

 the pair I received was defective . the pleats on the toe area were not as pictured -LRB- it was wrinkly and not perfectly folded over -RRB- . also , i 've only worn them a couple of times but the seam between the two pieces of the toe area is unraveling . i noticed it when i first got it however now it is beginning to tear the leather right at that `` V '' part . i was going to order a new pair but they do n't have my size anymore . even though they fell apart , i would buy a new pair -LRB- if they still had my size ! -RRB- because they are so cute .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .
 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized . DO NOT buy if you need steel toe .
 I ordered the sandal and it arrived as slide , not comfortable at all , verry small -LRB- about 2 sizes -RRB-

 Ordered mens 6.5 for my son , shoes are sized a womans 6.5 -LRB- say mens 6.5 on box and shoe -RRB- . I 'm going to have to pay $ 6.50 to return them for a larger size . Do n't waste your money , Buy NIkes !
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I wanted an inexpensive shoe to alternate with just tennis shoes for casual wear . My boyfriend has some adidas and said they were nice.I suppose it is just this model of shoe , but they are very VERY rigid ... even the shoe tongue is awfully hard . It feels like it 's stabbing the top of my foot when I try to wear them . They are also highly INflexible ... my boyfriend says that they would probably be ok if I tried to break them in , but the discomfort is so great that I would n't want to try.I have them around still , but they never make it out of the closet anymore . Adidas makes other comfortable shoes , so I guess it 's just this particular one is a dud . Comfort is a huge deal to me , so I just ca n't deal with these .
 I am sorry to say that these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned . I purchased two pair and ca n't wear either of them . They are extremely cute , but do n't let that fool you . Please understand that I am no stranger to wearing heels or trendy shoes . I rarely ever wear anything but heels and spend hours and hours on my feet . These hurt so bad that I actually had to go barefoot in public!Take my advice and stick to Enzo 's , they have never let me down ! Sadly enough , Steve Madden has lost the business of the biggest shoe addict on the planet . I will never buy another pair of Madden shoes .
 I first ordered one pair , and ordered a second pair after trying them on ; in a different color . I did not know that the soles are painted , they do not seem to be leather , but rather a man made material -LRB- CHINA -RRB- , which wears off ! This is not good . The fit is o.k. . The leather is not the best.Johnston & Murphy is a good brand name , but this does not measure up.Are they knock offs ?
 looks good on screen , but when i got the shoe it looked really cheeasseee ... as soon as i put them on it hurt ! color is way off from what you see on screen.not a good shoe .
 I wore these shoes once and had to have my husband take me back home to get my pair of Calvin Klein ballet flats . My feet hurt so bad I wanted to cry . I had to go home and apply bandages . My feet are still healing .
 Las fotos no son claras ... y los guayos no vienen completos.No quede satisfecho con la compra .

 These shoes are so cute but I was disappointed with these Naturalizers . I expected comfort , but the fabric is so unforgiving .
 I purchased this shoe in a 10N . Although I like the look of the shoe , there are two problems with it
 These shoes may look cute and comfortable but were very disappointng . They hurt a lot - the stiff linen gave me corns . The toe opening is so stiff it caused blisters . The back strap slides off . I wore them a few times and hoped they would soften up . They never did .
 I got these shoes because I thought they were so cute for what I thought would be a `` Naturalizer comfortable '' shoe . They do look very cute on . However , the toe opening cuts into my big toes and makes them hurt so much I can not wear these ! Sorry I spent the money on them : -LRB-

He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 Honestly , folks , people would buy these sandals if you would give customers a chance to indicate the desired size !
 I bought two pairs of these for my girls and , when I first got them , I loved them . They go from hopping and skipping down the garden path to puddles like a dream . The problem ? Five weeks after I bought them , my youngest 's soles started separating from the bottom -LRB- both pairs -RRB- at the toes . Since I bought them online and Teva is a good name , I figured perhaps she 'd scuffed her toes or something and just Shoe-Gooed them back together . Two weeks after that , the SECOND one 's soles started doing the same thing . I Shoe-Gooed THOSE back together as well . Three weeks after that , the BACK soles of the first kids were coming apart . More Shoe Goo . And now , as I 'm putting away the summer gear for school shoes , the older kids heels are also now coming apart . I think I spent more money on Shoe-Goo than I did on these over-priced sandals.I have a pair of Teva that have lasted through some pretty rough hiking on rocky terrain . It surprised me these were so poorly constructed , especially as my kids only used them for normal use , not the rough backwoods hiking my own pair has gone through and lasted several years . At $ 25 a pop , I expected a LOT more from these shoes . At least a full season ! The cheap $ 7.99 leather sandals I bought at WalMart have gone through all three of my kids!Teva should know better than to tick off it 's customer base by selling shoddy sandals that fall apart . Now not only am I not going to buy any more sandals for my kids , but when my $ 80 ` old faithful ' pair which is finally beginning to show heavy wear kicks the bucket sometime next summer , I 'll be looking at another brand for MYSELF as well . If I wanted cheap ` made in China ' stuff that falls apart , I 'd have BOUGHT sandals from Walmart !
 i like teva shoes and sandals but this one is tight . my little one can hardly push his toes in front .
 I bought my son Teva 's and before the summer was over the velco would no longer stick it had worn out . I emailed Teva 's customer service and I got no response so I emailed them again and again NOTHING ! I no longer buy Teva anything and my whole family has switched to Keen . Last summer my active son 's keens held up so well they can even be passed down to his little brother . Keens cost about double but they are worth it because they last all summer and then some .
 When I graduated college , I went to the local department store and purchased a suit and a pair of Rockport wingtips . Those shoes were comfortable and lasted me a very long time . Ten years later , I think I have worn my last pair of Rockports . Sadly , the quality is not there any longer though the comfort is . Rockport -LRB- a Reebok company now -RRB- has replaced the Vibram outsoles with a foam outsole that wears out in weeks and squeaks like those toddler squeaky shoes that are so cute ... on a toddler . The squeak is embarassing and I ca n't spend $ 75 every month . I have now moved on to a Rockport imitator . Thankfully there are several in the department stores . Brands to consider
 1 . They weigh nothing at all ... so no substance .2 . The straps are extremely flimsy and thin .3 . The straps are tight in the wrong places so it pinches .4 . The sole of the shoe is too soft.Basically a bad buy . I wish I could return it . It was a complete waste of my money .

 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack
 The shoe sole was great , but the surface material was too flimsy and tore off a different places within a few days . This shoes is not for regular work-out , but only for casual wear .
 These shoes are beautiful & if you have a narrow foot , will be fine but they are sized small . I would estimate that a US 10M are actually a 9 - 9.5 maybe a medium width .
 no enough room for anything the clip keeps pupping open very unsatisfactory for the cost of the product extremely over priced
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 these are cute , and probably would work fine for slender feet , however the soles are hard with not much give and the straps do not like it if you feet swell in the heat , so if you feet do n't sweat or swell and you do n't mind hard soles and are just looking for cute sandels these are the sandles for you

 The shoes are so pretty . The problem is that the slingback strap is too big , so even the shoe fits you well , it 's not well adjusted to your foot/ankle and it 's loose when you walk . It 's a shame because they are really nice shoes .
 I had to return the item because it was not true to size . There was no way , that this item was the size it was marked . I ordered an extra wide shoe , and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them , without them being loose on her . I wasnt happy at all .
 I bought this thong in a 13 B -LRB- medium -RRB- , and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top . My toes still curl over the top , just not as much . The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe , and actually broke the skin . They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on . I am guessing , though , that that is the nature of any flip-flop . I bought these because I do not like flip-flops , and wanted something a little more classy . It certainly looks nice , but I will never buy a flip-flop again .

 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .

 These shoes had no flexibility whatsoever and were very painful . I ended up throwing them out after I realized there was no breaking them in .
 I bought these shoes and they are the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I own . Bronx shoes are usually very comfortable and i 'm usually very satisfied with them but not this particular pair . Wore them once and nevermore !

 This was the second pair of Reebok Time and a Half shoes that I have owned . Just like the first one the sides split out after about a year and a half . The shoes were comfortable but not durable enough . Will not purchase again .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .

 The boots are baggy around the thigh area . They lace up about 6 inches from the top , but not enough to create a snug fit .
 I returned my thigh high boots cos the boot portion fit well but the ankle was not fitting . . so when i returned the item . They charged me a 15 % re stocking fee , when it just did n't fit right and refused to refund it . The Quality of the shoe is poor they where hooker boots not stylishly made thigh highs . . which are in fashion now . I do not recommend this store . Victoria Secret does n't charge you restocking fee . . nor does any other shoe store . . i think these ppl think they are Harrods or something .

 None of these boots are leather or close to a material feels like leather . The cheapest quality shoes I 've ever seen ! Paper like material , weird texture feels like badly recycled stuff and pretty badly glued . I do not even wan na talk how unconfortable they are !
 These shoes are pretty awful and not because they are Minnesota Timberwolves shoes . The logos are attached very cheaply and the tongue feels like it covered with cheap plastic . The shoes are also very , very thin and I could n't even wear the shoes . It is no wonder they got discontinued .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .

 The Vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors , and make it so I can not wear them at work . I love Rockports in general , and these are comfortable and well made as expected , but they leave a trail of scuff marks .
 This was the second pair of Reebok Time and a Half shoes that I have owned . Just like the first one the sides split out after about a year and a half . The shoes were comfortable but not durable enough . Will not purchase again .
 Within 1 month , there were two spots that were starting to get wear spots . Within 1.5 months , there were 3 spots and the plastic end came off . So 2 months and in the garbage they go . I work inside in an office and I only wear these shoes every other day so they have not seen any `` abuse '' . If you want shoe laces to last like the ones that came with your shoes , keep looking -- these are very poor quality . To make it worse , they are expensive and poor quality .
 I am disappointed to receive my laces and see that they are n't white . So now I 'm back at the website and I see that what I ordered was actually called ` natural ' . The picture made them look white , so I ordered them , period . I should have checked the writing as well . Also I 've noticed that there are actually no true white laces on the ` athletic shoe ' , flat lace section . Who woulda thought ??? You know ? So when I scrolled through the colors which are n't clear by the small pics , I found what looked like white in the enlarged picture . Mistake . I do n't know - just sort of misleading in passive way . Surely the owners know they do n't sell white and that many people want white ...
 i made an order for 63 &#34; fat white shoelaces . i recieved skinny laces . i called back to return and they &#34; dont carry fat laces 63 &#34; in white &#34; , the website says otherwise . better of going to footlocker
 There was an honest mistake on the part of this company where the first page said `` FLAT '' shoe laces and I ended up with FAT shoe laces . Being there are also spaghetti style laces I assumed `` Flat '' meant traditional laces . I was pretty disappointed to receive huge fat laces in the mail .
 Inferior quality to original laces on my Adidas Adi Racers ; these are excessively plastic-y and too thick . I paid nearly $ -LSB- ... -RSB- shipped , when I could have gotten equivalent -LRB- these are very low-end -RRB- laces for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- with free shipping via Prime . I expected better laces based on the premium and the pictures and am really disappointed .

 This is a narrow fit sandal . Fortunately , it is an open toe sandal . Hope it wo n't cause bruises . The real problem is the heel is only 2.5 '' , feels like wearing 4 '' heel , hard to balance , easy to fall over . Material is average , if not for the brand name , I 'll consider $ 20 too expensive for the sandal .
 I wore these shoes for the first time today , and my feet are paying for it . I have never wore a pair of clogs that hurt as badly as these do . Although they are cute and trendy , I do n't think they 're comfortable at all . I 'm sticking with Eastland . I have always had great comfort with their clogs .
 I was excited when I found these sexy shoes but I had to return them . The footbed was very narrow and I have a narrow foot ! My toes hung off the sides . Too , the leather up around your foot was very stiff .
 I ordered these for my 83 year old father . They are good quality but I thought they ran small . He wears a 12 . I ordered a 12 and could n't get them on his feet .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I need someone to confirm to me that this order was cancelled.when I made this order I was told that the order is cancelled and my money credited back to my account . I never got this product and I have not checked to see if you have done that and now I 'm being asked to rate this order . What is going on . Do you think I got this product?Did you credit my money to back to my account ?
 10 D is too short , 10.5 D too loose and sloppy . Do you carry C or B widths ? Like the style though .
 I just received this item today , the packaging was very nice but when I first started looking at the shoes , it looks so terrible , the snake skin seems to easily come off , and I did not not toally feel comfortable when I wore it on ... IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE TRY , AND YOU WILL BELIEVE ME !!!!

 disappointing product . This is not the Daniel Green slipper I remember from the past . Not soft nor flexible . Very uncomfortable . Had to put foam insoles in to tolerate walking in them .
 Due to a recent injury , and a very swollen foot , I ordered WW width . I was hoping to have something that I could get on my foot , since this will take a long time to heal . The slippers that came are actually more narrow than a regular width ! The box label says WW but they are FAR far from it . I am NOT impressed . BEWARE !
 Size is totally WRONG !!!! Ordered another 8N in a different color and it fits fine . This product is defective and should not be sent to any other customer . .
 Sides of slippers bowed out . They were extremely uncomfortable as there was NO padding at all in the sole . Obviously I returned them .
 I suffer from severe swelling of my legs and feet and ordered these slippers and paid a huge premium to have them delivered on a Sunday . Not only did they not deliver them the next day , they did n't refund any of the shipping costs and waited almost a week to ship them with it taking several more days in transit . The item did n't fit so at great difficulty and pain to get to the post office to return them . Because I used Amazon 's method to return the item I have no record that the item was returned . So I do n't have the mechandise , I 'm out of pockect for the purchase price and the huge fee for sending the item next day.I 'll tell you one thing - if I ever have to return something to Amazon again I am NOT going to use the Amazon Return Authorization paperwork . It 's sad that the only recourse I have is to warn others about this vendor . But I mostly hold Amazon.com responsible for the entire problem.Sure the cost to return the item was free but who cares when I am now $ 56 out of pocket for an item that sells for $ 38.95 . Sad part is that this item was fulfilled by Amazon LLC .
 the quality of these slippers is most disappointing . i do not recommend them.i was very please with amazon 's process and will use again
 I bought these for my elderly aunt and although they were wide width they were much too narrow .
 After wearing them only once or twice , these slippers required repair . The insole came apart from the sole itself and needed gluing . At the price charged for these slippers , and given the company 's reputation , I expected much higher quality and a reasonable period of problem-free wear .

 this shoe is just perfect with everything but when you walk with it for a long time your toes will hurt w/the wooden sole ... Just to painful . . good for short distance walking .
 This shoe is very uncomfortable . The pinky toe gets caught between the straps and it hurts very badly . I tried to give them to my aunt and she would not take them for free .
 This shoe is extrememly uncomfortable !! The straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail . I wo n't ever wear them again .

So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I have worn Dansko 's for over 20 years and never had any problems . They have always been my favorite most comfortable shoes and well worth the cost . In the last year I have had 3 pairs of Dansko 's less than 3 years old fall apart suddenly . It is like the soles just disintergrated . I store my shoes in boxes w / silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated . I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly . I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also . I gather Dansko has changed the material for the soles in the last few years and it is common for this `` dryrot '' issue to occur .
 I bought this for my wife . I ordered brown , and I received old brown.She is a surgeon and needed to replace the previous right away . Because she needed the clogs NOW , and she could n't afford to wait another week for a replacement , she will be stuck with the wrong pair for a while .
 Do n't buy these from Amazon . My wifes pair arrived packaged nicely in the original box but it was clear that the shoes had been worn before . The leather on the left shoe was stretched by someone walking in them and they missed a spot when they wiped off the bottom . White is a hard color to clean dirt from so it was obvious . There was also a nice sweat/dirt line just inside the left shoe . If this pair would have been offered at a shoe store I would have asked for a different pair or a discount . I will no longer trust Amazon for a new shoe purchase .
 the clogs would have great if they were the correct color and came on time . I paid for expedited shipping and should have gotten them in 3 days . It took over a week and they were the wrong color . The shoe company was very nasty and refused to refund my shipping , and when i returned the shoes , they refused to give me a credit , claiming they never got them . UPS sent me the name of the person who signed for them at their store !!! This company is horrible , I would never order from them again . The seller was Shoes Central . Do n't order from them , they are awful . I would give them zero stars but that is not an option
 I have heard nothing but good things about these shoes but when I bought a pair and put them on , I just could n't stand them . I bought a half size larger because I have a wider foot but they just dug into my instep like a torture device . Perhaps they are only for people with narrow feet and low insteps .
 I ordered this shoe , , , the quality is great ... but sizing is WAY off . . I ordered a size 11 ... . however ... there is a discrepancy on the EURO sizing ... I have made many attempts to buy Euro sizing in other brands ... too risky and not standard . I have an American foot .
 I have bought white pair few years ago and loved it so much I wanted another pair . However , I have recently tried 3 new pairs of Dansko clogs -LRB- all dark colors -RRB- and they all dye my socks . They are extremelly comfortable but I hated to see my white socks dyed after few hours of wearing the clogs . I returned the shoes -LRB- black and blueberry colors -RRB- and ended up with Dansko Nubuck in light blue . The inside is light brown . That too does dye my socks , but at least it is not black.It is still the most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned , but be ready to see your white socks black .
 I have n't even received my order and am furious with Amazon ! I was charged twice for my order by Amazon and when I called Customer Service I was told the first charge was a pre-authorization and I should contact my bank about getting it credited back . So I did call my bank and was told that if Amazon would send a fax explaining what had happened the bank would credit my account for the $ 99.99 . I again spoke to an Amazon Customer Service rep and was told they could submit my request to billing but it would take at least 3 days for my request to be processed . Word of wisdom
 Dansko 's quality has continually declined since their split with Sanita a few years back in 2007 . Sanita made the Dansko clogs for years until Dansko went their separate way and decided to produce their clog elsewhere , so now Dansko 's are now made in China , whereas Sanita 's are still made in Europe . The quality difference is VERY evident.Not realizing that Dansko was n't held to the same standard as it used to be I ordered a Dansko professional and the professional XP as well . They were so clunky , huge and heavy , I felt like a child wearing my dad 's shoes !! Plus the sizes on the Dansko 's were so inconsistent I was n't able to find a size that fit , even when I went to the Walking company store and tried on several different pairs of the same size , one 38 was almost right , the next was way too tight , one 39 was way to wide , the next just plain huge in every way.Dansko will accredit it to the hand made feature but those of us who have been wearing hand made clogs for some time can attest to the fact that it is so much more than that , Dansko is just not the same shoe that made it famous in the first place . Now it 's just poor quality . I wear a 7.5 US , sometimes an 8 which put me perfectly in a size 38 . Whereas a 38 used to fit me perfectly now they are too short and my big toe smashes every so slightly up against the end to the shoe when I take a step , well no biggie , I 'll just order up one size . So i ordered the 39 which was so huge it flopped off with every step , even with thick socks there was just no way to make them work . 38 's too small , 39 way to big . why the huge jump ?! I have a normal foot , never worn or needed to wear a narrow or wide ever in my life so when these shoes fit so incredibly wide and clompy , I knew that it was n't my foot but their shoe.But the most disappointing point of all was that the quality had noticeably declined.I had the same issue with the XP 's . And a little known fact about the XP memory foam version is that the memory foam base will only last a few months TOPS before going flat , and the cost to replace just the inserts is $ 40 a pair ... ouch ! So after I realized that Danskos would n't work anymore , I decided to search for another clog , that 's when I did some research and discovered that Dansko had made the break from the original maker of the shoe -LRB- sanita -RRB- . I did n't realize that you could actually order Sanita 's until then . That 's when I decided to try a pair of Sanita clogs instead . SOO happy that I did !!! Now I have the quality I remember in a size that fits perfectly . So for those of you on the fence ... try Sanita 's instead . THey were the makers of Dansko that made them famous in the first place . They are better quality , better materials , not made in China , and not so wide you can barely keep them on without sizing down to the point where they are way too small . You wo n't be disappointed . However , due take note because when I went to scrubs and beyond to try the KOI clogs -LRB- made by Sanita as well -RRB- to get an idea of sizing , I did chose to size up so now I wear a size 39 , but who cares ... the quality is back and they actually fit !!
 I was SHOCKED at how uncomfortable these shoes were , after having worn and loved Dansko brand for many years . I found out that the company changed manufacturers -LRB- made in China now -RRB- and the quality of both fit and comfort is so much more obviously underpar ... I literally could not believe how these shoes could pinch and hurt my feet so much in one evening ! I mean , we are not talking about high fashion platform shoes here.I have attached this info from the Sanita shoe website -LRB- the old Danish company that USED to make Dansko clogs -RRB- : `` For many years Sanita manufactured clogs for Dansko . The Sanita and Dansko relationship ended in the Fall 2007 . Since then , all Sanita manufactured products sold in the USA have been sold exclusively under the Sanita brand . `` There you have it . Save your money and your feet . Sanita still makes clogs , thank goodness . Dansko on the other hand ... same high price , but NOT the same shoes .
 I work in a pharmacy and I am on my feet up to 12 hours a day . I had heard so much about how great Dansko shoes are . I got this pair and I was so excited because they are a very nice looking shoe . I wore them 1 day and decided that there was just no way I could keep them . They are way to heavy . I was trying to find a shoe that would help reduce the swelling in my ankle an old injury I still have trouble with -RRB- . My feet were aching and my BOTH ankles were very swollen . Maybe it was just this style ? I have spoken with many nurses that love Dansko and would n't put on any other kind . But for me , I 'm going to have to go back to the Born Toby . Sorry ... I really wanted thee to work out .
 SanFran Jo says : I , too , noticed a difference in fit and also that the pair I recently purchased was made in China . I had to return my pair because they were not comfortable . I already have two other pair of Dansko Professional clogs , and they are very comfortable . I am disappointed in the comfort of the most recent pair I purchased . I have noticed that some of the clogs do say by Danita . Thanks to happy mommy mentioning Sanita , I googled Sanita clogs . Below is a statement found online from the Original Clogs website : For the last 17 years , all Dansko Professional clogs and all Dansko Stapled Clogs have been manufactured by Sanita in Europe . The relationship between Dansko and Sanita ended in August 2007 . Since then , Sanita entered the US market and is now distributing their products directly . If you are looking for the Original stapled clogs with patent number 0060240 stamped on the bottom -LRB- made by Sanita exclusively -RRB- , then look no further as our website features Sanita Clogs ' products exclusively.I ordered the `` original '' clogs by Sanita and they fit as comfortably as the two other pair I have . The number mentioned above is stamped on the bottom .
 first off for $ 120.00 there should not even be any vinyl on them but the plastic vinyl covering the piping is coming off after 1 month of use so i will need to use a black marker to hide it dansko was great till they left sanita now they are cheaply made in china , hungry , italy , and they dont even fit these are some of the problems i have found over the last 3 months i have tried aprox 50 pairs of dansko cabrio professional i should be waring a 37 -LRB- us size 7 -RRB- but now i cant , i need a 38 and most of the 38 are too small also 1 shoe bigger than the other in some pairs the left is tight and the right shoe feels great and in some pairs the right is too tight and the left feels great then after of 3 months and 50 pairs of trying on the pair i did keep the VINYL piping is coming off dansko is no longer good i will now only buy sanita COME ON DANSKO YOU ARE TAKING THE CHEEP AND EASY and you soon will loose customers
 2 consecutive blow outs of the Dansko oiled Cutter style shoes . The first pair split one of the soles at 10 months of use . This was in July of 2009 . Took them back to the store where they were purchased and they sent them back to Dansko to see if they would honor a replacement . They did , although the process took 4 months before I got the replacement pair . Fast forward to last Sept 3 2010 . After less than 9 months of usage one of the soles on the replacement pair not only split completely across the sole but separated on both sides . Plenty of usable tread on the soles so they were not worn out at all . So of course I take them back to the store they came from . Manager of the store calls me today and says they can not help me because now Dansko only has a 6 month warranty on failures and I have to contact them on my own . I 'll see what happens . Dansko = ExpensivePoorly made in China .6 Month warrantyEPIC FAIL !
 I like these shoes but recently they have gotten tight !! Or my feet are swollen I wear them with thin socks and they still are a pain
 Dansko 's have a great reputation but buying them on line is a bad idea . Dansko 's need to be tried on as they are individually made and sizes are very difficult to judge . I ordered a pair that I thought would fit perfectly , they were too small and I had to reorder my shoes . And return the original pair . I made my initial order on August 29 , 2009 . Today is September 29 , 2009 and I have not received my shoes . All of my friends that wear Dansko 's love them but have urged me never to buy them on line again .
 This was my second pair of Dansko professional clogs and again , they did n't fit properly . I wear a size 10 and therefore purchased a size 41 on my first purchase . They 're extremely tight fitting across the top middle section of my feet and my feet were actually NUMB after wearing them for just an hour . I could n't stand it any longer than that and did n't want to risk permanent nerve or some type of circulatory damage to my feet . My feet also slipped out of the heels frequently . The second purchase was even worse ! I purchased a larger size , 42 , thinking that it would alleviate some of the problems and ended up barely able to even put my foot into the right shoe and could n't even get my foot into the left shoe at all . They were extremely tight and unforgiving . I HATE DANSKO 'S ! I could n't give them anything less than one star and would actually give that star for the way they look . I actually loved the color and style . They 're just poorly made for the price . I ended up buying Klogs brand which look very similiar to Dansko 's and cost about $ 10 less on average .
 They started out comfortable especially since I travel and work on the hospital floor supporting physicians and nurses during EMR implementations . I had a pair of reliable flats , but I needed something with a heel . It all went south when I went to pick up my rental car in San Francisco . Walking on the pavement , I sprained my ankle and fell in the lot . I simply attributed it to clumsiness and the slanted driveway . It was n't a bad sprain and I wore the shoes without any issues afterwards.That was until I parked my car in the cobblestone driveway and wiped out again when I hit the incline . This time it was a little more bloody . Ended up with a swelling , bloody knee , a tetanus shot and grounded by the Medical Clinic at the airport for three days . I concluded that I could n't possibly be that clumsy . I realized that the only thing that changed was my shoes and both times I wore them walking in a driveway , I went down . So if you must have them , be sure to stay on level ground.Mine went back to the store and I have an appointment with an orthopedics specialist .
 Was disappointed that these Dansko 's are not as comfortable as my other pair of Dansko 's . These run a little big and slide on my heel . Also , the top rubs the top of my instep and something about them makes the top of the bottom of my left foot sore . Will still try another pair of Dansko 's later , however .
 My wife ordered these to wear to work . She is on her feet almost continually . When they did n't fit as well as the REAL Dansko 's she was replacing , we looked inside and saw why . MADE IN CHINA was stenciled on the uppers . We got our money back but no wonder they were such a good `` bargain '' . Always make certain they are not knockoffs when you buy . The original Dansko 's are great shoes for working people .
 I work in restaurants , so I 'm on my feet for 6-14 hours a day , and I heard so many good things about Danskos I thought I would buy a pair . They were really comfortable for a long time , but the first pair I bought was patent leather , and the leather was tearing around the toe and it was squeaking while I walked . So I returned those and got a plain ol' leather pair , and those too were ok for a good 6 months . Now , not even a year later , the colour on the inside of the shoe is rubbing off on my socks , turning my white socks nearly black , and even going through and staining the soles of my feet . On top of that , I come home every night and my feet are stiff and swollen , and I 'm starting to have aches in my knees . I got some gel inserts and they 've helped marginally . I understand I may be putting quite a bit of stress on these shoes , but I think a 120 dollar pair of shoes that markets itself as `` occupational shoes '' should not be doing this in less than a year of use . I wo n't be buying another pair in the future , to save my knees and my back .
 The shoes were very uncomfortable , hard , blistered my feet . And i discovered that the shoes of the same size and make are do not fit the same , maybe i should have bought them from a store . Never again
 I bought the brown oiled leather Dansko 's for a vacation to the UK and returned them promptly after getting back home to the US . I thought since I 've heard great things about these shoes and since Danskos are so ugly , they have to be comfortable . I was totally wrong !! These shoes proved to be the absolute worst choice in footwear for European travel and for those that have low arches!The Dansko 's work great for people with high arches , but I felt like I had a river rock jammed in my arch and the aftermath left me with intense pain in my arches and heels days after switching to my Crocs for the remainder of my vacation.The Danskos also have a thick , stiff arch which is a disaster when walking on uneven pavement or cobblestone as the shoe does n't give . I rolled my ankle countless times while walking on cobblestone and ended up with a mild sprained ankle on the first day of my vacation . I have very strong ankles , excellent balance -LRB- I 'm a yoga instructor -RRB- , and I 'm a lightweight so I 'm not the type of person that takes a step wrong or prone to rolled ankles.Last time I vacationed in Europe , I wore $ 20 clog Crocs and walked 10 + miles everyday without experiencing any problems over the cobblestone . I do n't think I 'll experiment with other shoes such as Danskos for the next vacation I take .
 I was so excited to finally purchase a pair of Dansko 's but I 've tried on clogs before and they always seem to run small . Given that information I went ahead and ordered a size larger than I normally would have . I wear a standard size 10 in US Women 's shoes , I ordered a size 11.5 US -LRB- 42 EU -RRB- in these and there is no way they are this size . I also have several pairs of Birkenstock shoes at size 41 that are longer than these . I wondered if perhaps they sent the wrong size in the box , but it is stamped quite clearly on the bottom of the shoe size 42 EU . It simply is not possible for me to fit my smaller foot -LRB- my left foot is smaller by about half a size -RRB- into these shoes . I am so disappointed as I really was looking forward to having my first pair of Dansko shoes that I 'd heard so many great recommendations on . It is my opinion that at the larger sizes these shoes run very small . I think perhaps one size larger may fit , however I still have n't decided if I 'm going to try a larger size . If I do , I will update my review with how that turns out .
 They are not comfortable at all really do n't like them . If I knew how to send them back I would .
 I just recently purchased a pair of the Dansko professional oiled leather clogs . When they arrived I tried them on , it was difficult to get them on they felt a full size smaller . The feel was stiff and hard not comfortable at all.I have a pair that I purchased in 1997 that were the same size as the new pair that fit perfectly and oh so comfortable.I put the 2 pairs together and it was quite obvious the new pair was a few inches shorter.I contacted Dansko and spoke with 2 different representatives who really had no explanation and suggested that I just return them and exchange them.My concern is was it that particular pair or has the sizing changed.I decided to do some research and have read that the new clogs are manufactured in China and the quality is not the same . I checked inside the shoe and it is printed made in China.I think my best bet is to return them .
 I seriously am not understanding the positive reviews on these shoes , but I fell for them and now I 'm sitting here with sore feet . I think some of the problems are unique to my situation while others could possibly be more universal , i.e. something for everyone to consider when thinking of dropping $ 100 + on these shoes . I 'll break the review down into `` universal '' and `` unique '' issues.Universal : - The bottom , i.e. insole , is hard . Maybe if this were n't the case , these shoes would be less painful for me . There just is not cushioning on the inside . I do n't get it . How are these shoes comfortable to anyone with no cushioning , and why do n't they have any ? - These shoes seem to come at least a size or half a size smaller than normal . This makes it difficult to reliably order online , and I am glad I did actually go to a store and try shoes on . Originally , I had called the store up to get the plain Dansko professional leather shoes set aside for me to pick up , told them my size and they held them for me . I got to the store , and those shoes were just too small and uncomfortable . Went a size up , and still ... could barely get my left foot in the shoe -LRB- my left foot is slightly larger than my right foot -RRB- . I asked if they had any Danskos not leathered and they said no ... leather , to me , makes shoes less comfortable because leather is more rigid , harder to stretch out and such . The salesman suggested the oiled Danskos , and they did work better ... but still felt a little too small , even a size up , particularly on the left foot . The salesman stretched out the left shoe , and it eventually felt doable , though not the most comfortable . But I 'd read there was a break-in period , so I went with it . Um , it seems like every time I take the shoes off and put them back on again , they have gone back to being as uncomfortable as the first time I put them on , i.e. they just do n't seem to `` break in . '' At least not quickly , i.e. within a week.Unique -LRB- and these things , as well as some positives about the shoes , are why I give 2 stars and not one -RRB- : - The shoe is uncomfortable , sometimes painful , across the top of my feet , particularly my left -LRB- larger -RRB- foot . I 've seen others say this , too , but I admit to having big , wide feet . I do not have little dainty women feet . I maybe should have asked for the men 's Danskos ... honestly , I do order men 's shoes at times because I have big feet and it 's hard to find women 's shoes in my size at times . But because I had to go up a size with these shoes , I ended up getting the largest size they come in for women ... and I feel like that size is still actually too small for me . It 's actually a little difficult for me to even get my left foot in the shoe , depending on the kind of socks I 'm wearing . Maybe if I could have gotten a better fit for these shoes , they 'd be more comfortable . With the shoes being not quite the right fit , I ca n't really even get cushion-y inserts into them that do n't make the shoes even more uncomfortable . Something to keep in mind for women with big feet.-The shoes are generally fine for about 3 hours or so , but then they start getting more and more intolerable . I work a job where I basically STAND in the SAME SPOT for 8 hours . Most reviews , if not all , I see on these shoes where people are being positive ... are from people who probably are walking and moving about for hours and hours . I do think these shoes are more comfortable when I 'm on the move , though I 'm still not sure I 'd be able to say , if I moved in these for 8-12 hours , things like I see other people writing , i.e. `` my feet feel as good as they did when I first put them on 12 hours ago . '' I really doubt it , especially with , again , the rigid leather material and the hard insole . But I ca n't at all say they feel as good as 8-9 hours before work , with a job where I stand . Again , 3 hours is the ultimate for me . 7 hours in , my feel are hurting to the point where it 's tough for me to concentrate , and all I do is think of excuses I can make in order to sneak off and sit down somewhere . One day , I actually changed out of these shoes and finished my shift in regular shoes because it was so uncomfortable . I have gotten to the point where I take the shoes off regularly during my shift and just stand in my socks/try to stretch out the muscles in my feet . Keep this in mind if you have to stand for hours and hours , and are considering these shoes.-I pretty much always feel as if I 'm going to fall when I wear these shoes . It 's not really the issue others have mentioned , i.e. the heel bouncing up and down in the shoes . It 's how they feel like high heels . If you 're not used to wearing heels ... I 'm finding it just odd . I feel like I do n't have control of my own balance.-I think it might also be important to note that I 'm overweight . It might very well be the case that neither these shoes nor any other are going to help anyone who is putting a lot of weight on their feet for a long time.Positives-With every other kind of shoe , my feet are not the only thing hurting at the end of the day . My back , my legs , even below my stomach area all hurt . I do n't get that with these shoes -- nothing hurts but my feet when I wear these shoes.-I feel completely debilitated after work with other shoes , i.e. I can barely stand or walk for hours after work . With these shoes , my feet do hurt bad after work -LRB- for hours -RRB- , but I can still manage to get around ... I just would rather not ...
 I love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel . I get great arch support and there is plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around . They are fantastic for long hours on your feet.BUT , they are terrible for my ankles . When I wear these shoes I roll my ankles all the time and have fallen a couple of times . They are especially bad for me in a hospital setting where there are cords and such that I risk stepping on . I am also afraid to walk/run in them because I am afraid I will wipe out and fall down.I really want to love these , but I feel that the base of the sole needs to be a bit wider for stability .
 I decided to replace my old Dansko clogs with this style and color . After wearing it for an entire shift at work , I developed blisters . I felt that the insole were hard . I was disappointed with this particular style . I like the color .
 These shoes were advertized as being very comfortable . Nothing could be further from the truth . They were so uncomfortable that I can no longer wear them . I even tried to have them professionally stretched twice , to no avail . They are very tight over the top of your foot . OUCH !! What a waste of $ 100 .
 I used to buy them for my whole office but , we have noticed a big difference in quality . The company use to be a lot more personably and cared about each customer . I had a very bad experience with one of the managers there . There are plenty of really good shoe companies so , bye bye Dansko .
 I bought the Dansko Pro in a wide width because I needed a great pair of sturdy , comfortable shoes to work in . I have owned another pair in the past and was really happy with them , so I did n't even question my decision to order this shoe . No place in my area carries this brand , and the closest place does n't carry the wide width , so I ordered them online . Big mistake on my part!One shoe fits great but is n't nearly as comfortable as my other pair had been , but the other shoe barely fits . It 's really tight all the way around and makes my foot go numb . I realize that they 're handmade , but there should be some way for the company to ensure that both shoes are made similarly enough that they can actually fit as a pair . I was so disappointed that I had spent so much money on a pair of shoes I ca n't wear , for multiple reasons . I had to buy a different pair of shoes and they 're more comfortable , but I still have n't found any that offer what I 'm looking for or what my first pair of Dansko shoes did .
 I decided to get a pair of Dansko clogs because I 've heard and read so much about them , and I do have significant foot problems , which limits the kinds of shoes I can wear . This basic model comes in a narrow , and it fits my foot well , as described . I like the way it rolls forward as you walk . The shoe has a bit of a platform bottom , so it puts you up a little higher than `` flats '' . I thought it was a nice change from my usual Birkenstocks and sneakers . I am leery about rolling an ankle in them , as many have reported , though , as I am a bit accident - prone . I was also leery about the hard foot bed , and my foot did seem sore after wearing them off and on . But my foot problems also can be off and on -LRB- but REALLY on when wearing the wrong type of shoes -RRB- . Overall I liked the look and feel of the shoe pretty well , and really wanted to love them . But after wearing them on a long day with a lot of errands , my soles were so extremely painful that I had to put lidocaine patches on them and take pain meds . So disappointed . The fit is good , and I ca n't get my orthotics into them . Maybe there 's a thin insert that would help ... suggestions ? Apparently my case is unusual , but I would like to see Dansko either 1 . Offer a `` soft footbed '' version , as Birkenstock does for some of its styles , or 2 . Make the insole removable , in case customers want to use their own custom orthotics.Meanwhile , I strongly recommend that if you have foot problems -LRB- mine are plantar fasciitis and tendonitis , aggravated by lupus -RRB- , and you want to try these clogs , do wear them around your house as much as you can for a couple of days , and see how your feet feel , before you decide whether to keep or return them . I wish I had known this , it would have saved me a lot of money and pain , so I Hope this helps someone ! -LRB- actually , this item IS available ; do n't know why it is listed as `` not available . -RRB-
 I can not see if `` made in China '' is stenciled in the upper and there is no serial number , but the shoes I bought from Footsmart could n't cut an 8 hour shift . I wore them around the house the day they came in the mail and they seemed fine , but after I wore them the following day at my busy waitress job , I felt crippled . The stitching around the sides dug into my feet and worse , the ball of my right foot is still sore 30 hours after having taken them off and my toes on that foot are still numb . I ca n't believe these are the same Dansko shoes so many rave about and just maybe they are not . After one wearing , they would not allow me to return them nor would they send me a different right shoe . Now I 'm just $ 100 poorer and have a pair of shoes I will never wear again in my closet . Great . My suggestion is that you buy Dansko 's from a company that takes returns in the event it does n't work out for you . I wish I had .
 It looks very attrative with anything , but the quality is below horrible . It 's not very sturdy to walk in and I have the experience of walking and dancing in 5 in heels with out stumbling . Not made for the everyday woman ; just a couple hours , no more , at a sit down dinner only .
 Dansko 's have a great reputation but buying them on line is a bad idea . Dansko 's need to be tried on as they are individually made and sizes are very difficult to judge . I ordered a pair that I thought would fit perfectly , they were too small and I had to reorder my shoes . And return the original pair . I made my initial order on August 29 , 2009 . Today is September 29 , 2009 and I have not received my shoes . All of my friends that wear Dansko 's love them but have urged me never to buy them on line again .
 This was my second pair of Dansko professional clogs and again , they did n't fit properly . I wear a size 10 and therefore purchased a size 41 on my first purchase . They 're extremely tight fitting across the top middle section of my feet and my feet were actually NUMB after wearing them for just an hour . I could n't stand it any longer than that and did n't want to risk permanent nerve or some type of circulatory damage to my feet . My feet also slipped out of the heels frequently . The second purchase was even worse ! I purchased a larger size , 42 , thinking that it would alleviate some of the problems and ended up barely able to even put my foot into the right shoe and could n't even get my foot into the left shoe at all . They were extremely tight and unforgiving . I HATE DANSKO 'S ! I could n't give them anything less than one star and would actually give that star for the way they look . I actually loved the color and style . They 're just poorly made for the price . I ended up buying Klogs brand which look very similiar to Dansko 's and cost about $ 10 less on average .
 They started out comfortable especially since I travel and work on the hospital floor supporting physicians and nurses during EMR implementations . I had a pair of reliable flats , but I needed something with a heel . It all went south when I went to pick up my rental car in San Francisco . Walking on the pavement , I sprained my ankle and fell in the lot . I simply attributed it to clumsiness and the slanted driveway . It was n't a bad sprain and I wore the shoes without any issues afterwards.That was until I parked my car in the cobblestone driveway and wiped out again when I hit the incline . This time it was a little more bloody . Ended up with a swelling , bloody knee , a tetanus shot and grounded by the Medical Clinic at the airport for three days . I concluded that I could n't possibly be that clumsy . I realized that the only thing that changed was my shoes and both times I wore them walking in a driveway , I went down . So if you must have them , be sure to stay on level ground.Mine went back to the store and I have an appointment with an orthopedics specialist .
 Was disappointed that these Dansko 's are not as comfortable as my other pair of Dansko 's . These run a little big and slide on my heel . Also , the top rubs the top of my instep and something about them makes the top of the bottom of my left foot sore . Will still try another pair of Dansko 's later , however .
 My wife ordered these to wear to work . She is on her feet almost continually . When they did n't fit as well as the REAL Dansko 's she was replacing , we looked inside and saw why . MADE IN CHINA was stenciled on the uppers . We got our money back but no wonder they were such a good `` bargain '' . Always make certain they are not knockoffs when you buy . The original Dansko 's are great shoes for working people .
 I work in restaurants , so I 'm on my feet for 6-14 hours a day , and I heard so many good things about Danskos I thought I would buy a pair . They were really comfortable for a long time , but the first pair I bought was patent leather , and the leather was tearing around the toe and it was squeaking while I walked . So I returned those and got a plain ol' leather pair , and those too were ok for a good 6 months . Now , not even a year later , the colour on the inside of the shoe is rubbing off on my socks , turning my white socks nearly black , and even going through and staining the soles of my feet . On top of that , I come home every night and my feet are stiff and swollen , and I 'm starting to have aches in my knees . I got some gel inserts and they 've helped marginally . I understand I may be putting quite a bit of stress on these shoes , but I think a 120 dollar pair of shoes that markets itself as `` occupational shoes '' should not be doing this in less than a year of use . I wo n't be buying another pair in the future , to save my knees and my back .
 I have worn Dansko 's for over 20 years and never had any problems . They have always been my favorite most comfortable shoes and well worth the cost . In the last year I have had 3 pairs of Dansko 's less than 3 years old fall apart suddenly . It is like the soles just disintergrated . I store my shoes in boxes w / silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated . I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly . I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also . I gather Dansko has changed the material for the soles in the last few years and it is common for this `` dryrot '' issue to occur .
 I bought this for my wife . I ordered brown , and I received old brown.She is a surgeon and needed to replace the previous right away . Because she needed the clogs NOW , and she could n't afford to wait another week for a replacement , she will be stuck with the wrong pair for a while .
 Do n't buy these from Amazon . My wifes pair arrived packaged nicely in the original box but it was clear that the shoes had been worn before . The leather on the left shoe was stretched by someone walking in them and they missed a spot when they wiped off the bottom . White is a hard color to clean dirt from so it was obvious . There was also a nice sweat/dirt line just inside the left shoe . If this pair would have been offered at a shoe store I would have asked for a different pair or a discount . I will no longer trust Amazon for a new shoe purchase .
 the clogs would have great if they were the correct color and came on time . I paid for expedited shipping and should have gotten them in 3 days . It took over a week and they were the wrong color . The shoe company was very nasty and refused to refund my shipping , and when i returned the shoes , they refused to give me a credit , claiming they never got them . UPS sent me the name of the person who signed for them at their store !!! This company is horrible , I would never order from them again . The seller was Shoes Central . Do n't order from them , they are awful . I would give them zero stars but that is not an option
 I have heard nothing but good things about these shoes but when I bought a pair and put them on , I just could n't stand them . I bought a half size larger because I have a wider foot but they just dug into my instep like a torture device . Perhaps they are only for people with narrow feet and low insteps .
 I have bought white pair few years ago and loved it so much I wanted another pair . However , I have recently tried 3 new pairs of Dansko clogs -LRB- all dark colors -RRB- and they all dye my socks . They are extremelly comfortable but I hated to see my white socks dyed after few hours of wearing the clogs . I returned the shoes -LRB- black and blueberry colors -RRB- and ended up with Dansko Nubuck in light blue . The inside is light brown . That too does dye my socks , but at least it is not black.It is still the most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned , but be ready to see your white socks black .
 I have n't even received my order and am furious with Amazon ! I was charged twice for my order by Amazon and when I called Customer Service I was told the first charge was a pre-authorization and I should contact my bank about getting it credited back . So I did call my bank and was told that if Amazon would send a fax explaining what had happened the bank would credit my account for the $ 99.99 . I again spoke to an Amazon Customer Service rep and was told they could submit my request to billing but it would take at least 3 days for my request to be processed . Word of wisdom
 The shoes were very uncomfortable , hard , blistered my feet . And i discovered that the shoes of the same size and make are do not fit the same , maybe i should have bought them from a store . Never again
 I bought the brown oiled leather Dansko 's for a vacation to the UK and returned them promptly after getting back home to the US . I thought since I 've heard great things about these shoes and since Danskos are so ugly , they have to be comfortable . I was totally wrong !! These shoes proved to be the absolute worst choice in footwear for European travel and for those that have low arches!The Dansko 's work great for people with high arches , but I felt like I had a river rock jammed in my arch and the aftermath left me with intense pain in my arches and heels days after switching to my Crocs for the remainder of my vacation.The Danskos also have a thick , stiff arch which is a disaster when walking on uneven pavement or cobblestone as the shoe does n't give . I rolled my ankle countless times while walking on cobblestone and ended up with a mild sprained ankle on the first day of my vacation . I have very strong ankles , excellent balance -LRB- I 'm a yoga instructor -RRB- , and I 'm a lightweight so I 'm not the type of person that takes a step wrong or prone to rolled ankles.Last time I vacationed in Europe , I wore $ 20 clog Crocs and walked 10 + miles everyday without experiencing any problems over the cobblestone . I do n't think I 'll experiment with other shoes such as Danskos for the next vacation I take .
 I was so excited to finally purchase a pair of Dansko 's but I 've tried on clogs before and they always seem to run small . Given that information I went ahead and ordered a size larger than I normally would have . I wear a standard size 10 in US Women 's shoes , I ordered a size 11.5 US -LRB- 42 EU -RRB- in these and there is no way they are this size . I also have several pairs of Birkenstock shoes at size 41 that are longer than these . I wondered if perhaps they sent the wrong size in the box , but it is stamped quite clearly on the bottom of the shoe size 42 EU . It simply is not possible for me to fit my smaller foot -LRB- my left foot is smaller by about half a size -RRB- into these shoes . I am so disappointed as I really was looking forward to having my first pair of Dansko shoes that I 'd heard so many great recommendations on . It is my opinion that at the larger sizes these shoes run very small . I think perhaps one size larger may fit , however I still have n't decided if I 'm going to try a larger size . If I do , I will update my review with how that turns out .
 They are not comfortable at all really do n't like them . If I knew how to send them back I would .
 Dansko 's quality has continually declined since their split with Sanita a few years back in 2007 . Sanita made the Dansko clogs for years until Dansko went their separate way and decided to produce their clog elsewhere , so now Dansko 's are now made in China , whereas Sanita 's are still made in Europe . The quality difference is VERY evident.Not realizing that Dansko was n't held to the same standard as it used to be I ordered a Dansko professional and the professional XP as well . They were so clunky , huge and heavy , I felt like a child wearing my dad 's shoes !! Plus the sizes on the Dansko 's were so inconsistent I was n't able to find a size that fit , even when I went to the Walking company store and tried on several different pairs of the same size , one 38 was almost right , the next was way too tight , one 39 was way to wide , the next just plain huge in every way.Dansko will accredit it to the hand made feature but those of us who have been wearing hand made clogs for some time can attest to the fact that it is so much more than that , Dansko is just not the same shoe that made it famous in the first place . Now it 's just poor quality . I wear a 7.5 US , sometimes an 8 which put me perfectly in a size 38 . Whereas a 38 used to fit me perfectly now they are too short and my big toe smashes every so slightly up against the end to the shoe when I take a step , well no biggie , I 'll just order up one size . So i ordered the 39 which was so huge it flopped off with every step , even with thick socks there was just no way to make them work . 38 's too small , 39 way to big . why the huge jump ?! I have a normal foot , never worn or needed to wear a narrow or wide ever in my life so when these shoes fit so incredibly wide and clompy , I knew that it was n't my foot but their shoe.But the most disappointing point of all was that the quality had noticeably declined.I had the same issue with the XP 's . And a little known fact about the XP memory foam version is that the memory foam base will only last a few months TOPS before going flat , and the cost to replace just the inserts is $ 40 a pair ... ouch ! So after I realized that Danskos would n't work anymore , I decided to search for another clog , that 's when I did some research and discovered that Dansko had made the break from the original maker of the shoe -LRB- sanita -RRB- . I did n't realize that you could actually order Sanita 's until then . That 's when I decided to try a pair of Sanita clogs instead . SOO happy that I did !!! Now I have the quality I remember in a size that fits perfectly . So for those of you on the fence ... try Sanita 's instead . THey were the makers of Dansko that made them famous in the first place . They are better quality , better materials , not made in China , and not so wide you can barely keep them on without sizing down to the point where they are way too small . You wo n't be disappointed . However , due take note because when I went to scrubs and beyond to try the KOI clogs -LRB- made by Sanita as well -RRB- to get an idea of sizing , I did chose to size up so now I wear a size 39 , but who cares ... the quality is back and they actually fit !!
 I was SHOCKED at how uncomfortable these shoes were , after having worn and loved Dansko brand for many years . I found out that the company changed manufacturers -LRB- made in China now -RRB- and the quality of both fit and comfort is so much more obviously underpar ... I literally could not believe how these shoes could pinch and hurt my feet so much in one evening ! I mean , we are not talking about high fashion platform shoes here.I have attached this info from the Sanita shoe website -LRB- the old Danish company that USED to make Dansko clogs -RRB- : `` For many years Sanita manufactured clogs for Dansko . The Sanita and Dansko relationship ended in the Fall 2007 . Since then , all Sanita manufactured products sold in the USA have been sold exclusively under the Sanita brand . `` There you have it . Save your money and your feet . Sanita still makes clogs , thank goodness . Dansko on the other hand ... same high price , but NOT the same shoes .
 I work in a pharmacy and I am on my feet up to 12 hours a day . I had heard so much about how great Dansko shoes are . I got this pair and I was so excited because they are a very nice looking shoe . I wore them 1 day and decided that there was just no way I could keep them . They are way to heavy . I was trying to find a shoe that would help reduce the swelling in my ankle an old injury I still have trouble with -RRB- . My feet were aching and my BOTH ankles were very swollen . Maybe it was just this style ? I have spoken with many nurses that love Dansko and would n't put on any other kind . But for me , I 'm going to have to go back to the Born Toby . Sorry ... I really wanted thee to work out .
 SanFran Jo says : I , too , noticed a difference in fit and also that the pair I recently purchased was made in China . I had to return my pair because they were not comfortable . I already have two other pair of Dansko Professional clogs , and they are very comfortable . I am disappointed in the comfort of the most recent pair I purchased . I have noticed that some of the clogs do say by Danita . Thanks to happy mommy mentioning Sanita , I googled Sanita clogs . Below is a statement found online from the Original Clogs website : For the last 17 years , all Dansko Professional clogs and all Dansko Stapled Clogs have been manufactured by Sanita in Europe . The relationship between Dansko and Sanita ended in August 2007 . Since then , Sanita entered the US market and is now distributing their products directly . If you are looking for the Original stapled clogs with patent number 0060240 stamped on the bottom -LRB- made by Sanita exclusively -RRB- , then look no further as our website features Sanita Clogs ' products exclusively.I ordered the `` original '' clogs by Sanita and they fit as comfortably as the two other pair I have . The number mentioned above is stamped on the bottom .
 first off for $ 120.00 there should not even be any vinyl on them but the plastic vinyl covering the piping is coming off after 1 month of use so i will need to use a black marker to hide it dansko was great till they left sanita now they are cheaply made in china , hungry , italy , and they dont even fit these are some of the problems i have found over the last 3 months i have tried aprox 50 pairs of dansko cabrio professional i should be waring a 37 -LRB- us size 7 -RRB- but now i cant , i need a 38 and most of the 38 are too small also 1 shoe bigger than the other in some pairs the left is tight and the right shoe feels great and in some pairs the right is too tight and the left feels great then after of 3 months and 50 pairs of trying on the pair i did keep the VINYL piping is coming off dansko is no longer good i will now only buy sanita COME ON DANSKO YOU ARE TAKING THE CHEEP AND EASY and you soon will loose customers
 2 consecutive blow outs of the Dansko oiled Cutter style shoes . The first pair split one of the soles at 10 months of use . This was in July of 2009 . Took them back to the store where they were purchased and they sent them back to Dansko to see if they would honor a replacement . They did , although the process took 4 months before I got the replacement pair . Fast forward to last Sept 3 2010 . After less than 9 months of usage one of the soles on the replacement pair not only split completely across the sole but separated on both sides . Plenty of usable tread on the soles so they were not worn out at all . So of course I take them back to the store they came from . Manager of the store calls me today and says they can not help me because now Dansko only has a 6 month warranty on failures and I have to contact them on my own . I 'll see what happens . Dansko = ExpensivePoorly made in China .6 Month warrantyEPIC FAIL !
 I like these shoes but recently they have gotten tight !! Or my feet are swollen I wear them with thin socks and they still are a pain
 I decided to replace my old Dansko clogs with this style and color . After wearing it for an entire shift at work , I developed blisters . I felt that the insole were hard . I was disappointed with this particular style . I like the color .
 These shoes were advertized as being very comfortable . Nothing could be further from the truth . They were so uncomfortable that I can no longer wear them . I even tried to have them professionally stretched twice , to no avail . They are very tight over the top of your foot . OUCH !! What a waste of $ 100 .
 I used to buy them for my whole office but , we have noticed a big difference in quality . The company use to be a lot more personably and cared about each customer . I had a very bad experience with one of the managers there . There are plenty of really good shoe companies so , bye bye Dansko .
 I decided to get a pair of Dansko clogs because I 've heard and read so much about them , and I do have significant foot problems , which limits the kinds of shoes I can wear . This basic model comes in a narrow , and it fits my foot well , as described . I like the way it rolls forward as you walk . The shoe has a bit of a platform bottom , so it puts you up a little higher than `` flats '' . I thought it was a nice change from my usual Birkenstocks and sneakers . I am leery about rolling an ankle in them , as many have reported , though , as I am a bit accident - prone . I was also leery about the hard foot bed , and my foot did seem sore after wearing them off and on . But my foot problems also can be off and on -LRB- but REALLY on when wearing the wrong type of shoes -RRB- . Overall I liked the look and feel of the shoe pretty well , and really wanted to love them . But after wearing them on a long day with a lot of errands , my soles were so extremely painful that I had to put lidocaine patches on them and take pain meds . So disappointed . The fit is good , and I ca n't get my orthotics into them . Maybe there 's a thin insert that would help ... suggestions ? Apparently my case is unusual , but I would like to see Dansko either 1 . Offer a `` soft footbed '' version , as Birkenstock does for some of its styles , or 2 . Make the insole removable , in case customers want to use their own custom orthotics.Meanwhile , I strongly recommend that if you have foot problems -LRB- mine are plantar fasciitis and tendonitis , aggravated by lupus -RRB- , and you want to try these clogs , do wear them around your house as much as you can for a couple of days , and see how your feet feel , before you decide whether to keep or return them . I wish I had known this , it would have saved me a lot of money and pain , so I Hope this helps someone ! -LRB- actually , this item IS available ; do n't know why it is listed as `` not available . -RRB-
 I can not see if `` made in China '' is stenciled in the upper and there is no serial number , but the shoes I bought from Footsmart could n't cut an 8 hour shift . I wore them around the house the day they came in the mail and they seemed fine , but after I wore them the following day at my busy waitress job , I felt crippled . The stitching around the sides dug into my feet and worse , the ball of my right foot is still sore 30 hours after having taken them off and my toes on that foot are still numb . I ca n't believe these are the same Dansko shoes so many rave about and just maybe they are not . After one wearing , they would not allow me to return them nor would they send me a different right shoe . Now I 'm just $ 100 poorer and have a pair of shoes I will never wear again in my closet . Great . My suggestion is that you buy Dansko 's from a company that takes returns in the event it does n't work out for you . I wish I had .
 I just recently purchased a pair of the Dansko professional oiled leather clogs . When they arrived I tried them on , it was difficult to get them on they felt a full size smaller . The feel was stiff and hard not comfortable at all.I have a pair that I purchased in 1997 that were the same size as the new pair that fit perfectly and oh so comfortable.I put the 2 pairs together and it was quite obvious the new pair was a few inches shorter.I contacted Dansko and spoke with 2 different representatives who really had no explanation and suggested that I just return them and exchange them.My concern is was it that particular pair or has the sizing changed.I decided to do some research and have read that the new clogs are manufactured in China and the quality is not the same . I checked inside the shoe and it is printed made in China.I think my best bet is to return them .
 I seriously am not understanding the positive reviews on these shoes , but I fell for them and now I 'm sitting here with sore feet . I think some of the problems are unique to my situation while others could possibly be more universal , i.e. something for everyone to consider when thinking of dropping $ 100 + on these shoes . I 'll break the review down into `` universal '' and `` unique '' issues.Universal : - The bottom , i.e. insole , is hard . Maybe if this were n't the case , these shoes would be less painful for me . There just is not cushioning on the inside . I do n't get it . How are these shoes comfortable to anyone with no cushioning , and why do n't they have any ? - These shoes seem to come at least a size or half a size smaller than normal . This makes it difficult to reliably order online , and I am glad I did actually go to a store and try shoes on . Originally , I had called the store up to get the plain Dansko professional leather shoes set aside for me to pick up , told them my size and they held them for me . I got to the store , and those shoes were just too small and uncomfortable . Went a size up , and still ... could barely get my left foot in the shoe -LRB- my left foot is slightly larger than my right foot -RRB- . I asked if they had any Danskos not leathered and they said no ... leather , to me , makes shoes less comfortable because leather is more rigid , harder to stretch out and such . The salesman suggested the oiled Danskos , and they did work better ... but still felt a little too small , even a size up , particularly on the left foot . The salesman stretched out the left shoe , and it eventually felt doable , though not the most comfortable . But I 'd read there was a break-in period , so I went with it . Um , it seems like every time I take the shoes off and put them back on again , they have gone back to being as uncomfortable as the first time I put them on , i.e. they just do n't seem to `` break in . '' At least not quickly , i.e. within a week.Unique -LRB- and these things , as well as some positives about the shoes , are why I give 2 stars and not one -RRB- : - The shoe is uncomfortable , sometimes painful , across the top of my feet , particularly my left -LRB- larger -RRB- foot . I 've seen others say this , too , but I admit to having big , wide feet . I do not have little dainty women feet . I maybe should have asked for the men 's Danskos ... honestly , I do order men 's shoes at times because I have big feet and it 's hard to find women 's shoes in my size at times . But because I had to go up a size with these shoes , I ended up getting the largest size they come in for women ... and I feel like that size is still actually too small for me . It 's actually a little difficult for me to even get my left foot in the shoe , depending on the kind of socks I 'm wearing . Maybe if I could have gotten a better fit for these shoes , they 'd be more comfortable . With the shoes being not quite the right fit , I ca n't really even get cushion-y inserts into them that do n't make the shoes even more uncomfortable . Something to keep in mind for women with big feet.-The shoes are generally fine for about 3 hours or so , but then they start getting more and more intolerable . I work a job where I basically STAND in the SAME SPOT for 8 hours . Most reviews , if not all , I see on these shoes where people are being positive ... are from people who probably are walking and moving about for hours and hours . I do think these shoes are more comfortable when I 'm on the move , though I 'm still not sure I 'd be able to say , if I moved in these for 8-12 hours , things like I see other people writing , i.e. `` my feet feel as good as they did when I first put them on 12 hours ago . '' I really doubt it , especially with , again , the rigid leather material and the hard insole . But I ca n't at all say they feel as good as 8-9 hours before work , with a job where I stand . Again , 3 hours is the ultimate for me . 7 hours in , my feel are hurting to the point where it 's tough for me to concentrate , and all I do is think of excuses I can make in order to sneak off and sit down somewhere . One day , I actually changed out of these shoes and finished my shift in regular shoes because it was so uncomfortable . I have gotten to the point where I take the shoes off regularly during my shift and just stand in my socks/try to stretch out the muscles in my feet . Keep this in mind if you have to stand for hours and hours , and are considering these shoes.-I pretty much always feel as if I 'm going to fall when I wear these shoes . It 's not really the issue others have mentioned , i.e. the heel bouncing up and down in the shoes . It 's how they feel like high heels . If you 're not used to wearing heels ... I 'm finding it just odd . I feel like I do n't have control of my own balance.-I think it might also be important to note that I 'm overweight . It might very well be the case that neither these shoes nor any other are going to help anyone who is putting a lot of weight on their feet for a long time.Positives-With every other kind of shoe , my feet are not the only thing hurting at the end of the day . My back , my legs , even below my stomach area all hurt . I do n't get that with these shoes -- nothing hurts but my feet when I wear these shoes.-I feel completely debilitated after work with other shoes , i.e. I can barely stand or walk for hours after work . With these shoes , my feet do hurt bad after work -LRB- for hours -RRB- , but I can still manage to get around ... I just would rather not ...
 I love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel . I get great arch support and there is plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around . They are fantastic for long hours on your feet.BUT , they are terrible for my ankles . When I wear these shoes I roll my ankles all the time and have fallen a couple of times . They are especially bad for me in a hospital setting where there are cords and such that I risk stepping on . I am also afraid to walk/run in them because I am afraid I will wipe out and fall down.I really want to love these , but I feel that the base of the sole needs to be a bit wider for stability .
 I bought the Dansko Pro in a wide width because I needed a great pair of sturdy , comfortable shoes to work in . I have owned another pair in the past and was really happy with them , so I did n't even question my decision to order this shoe . No place in my area carries this brand , and the closest place does n't carry the wide width , so I ordered them online . Big mistake on my part!One shoe fits great but is n't nearly as comfortable as my other pair had been , but the other shoe barely fits . It 's really tight all the way around and makes my foot go numb . I realize that they 're handmade , but there should be some way for the company to ensure that both shoes are made similarly enough that they can actually fit as a pair . I was so disappointed that I had spent so much money on a pair of shoes I ca n't wear , for multiple reasons . I had to buy a different pair of shoes and they 're more comfortable , but I still have n't found any that offer what I 'm looking for or what my first pair of Dansko shoes did .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 Thought this was a good looking shoe , not so much when I recieved it . It is good to wear but the color is off and the quality is much lower than it looks .
 Bought these for my son to use for soccer and t-ball . Good price , but got ta do something different . The back of the heel sticks up and rubs the ankle . The cleats are better for turf than grass or dirt . Would be okay for his age if it were n't for the heel issue.Fit was good . They also have a lace flap that is apparently tucked in for their photo .
 My 9 year old wears a 3 1/2 shoe and I bought these a half size bigger in a 4 . His foot would not go in them . They fit more like his brothers size 2 shoe . I returned them the same day ,
 Deseo la devoluci&oacute;n del producto porque no me lo pueden enviar con los demas productos , y ademas la talla elegida es demasiado grande para la medida del ni & ntilde ; o
 I sent mine back -- the toe is REALLY LONG

 I love reef flip flops . But these flip flops run VERY small . I have 5 pairs of reef flip flops of all different styles all in a size 8 but this size 8 I could n't even slide my foot into . They are very nice looking wish I could 've worn them . They are getting sent back .
 Very comfortable and well made flip flop . These flip flops are great if you need cushion and support . Not sure why but I had to return first pair and order 1 size larger than the exact shoe purchased in the store . After wearing them for a few months I have discovered that they are not as well made as the same brand purchased at a surf shop . The rubber hardened pretty quickly and the straps became loose fitting . They say they are REEF but they may be a knockoff .
 I 've previously had the Fannings and loved them . I thought since it was the same company that makes these they 'd be very similar . I was very disappointed to learn that was not the case . These state they 're medium and I 've never had an issue with a 7M before , however , when I try to slide my foot in the back strap near the heel is too narrow and cuts into my arch . It 's extremely uncomfortable and I had to return them due to the discomfort.I should have just stuck with what I 'm used to . I knew the Fannings were comfortable and I these looked so similar I thought I 'd give them a try . Even from looking at the photo of these the straps do n't look like they 're squeezing the foot but either I received an item that was put together wrong or the shoe is the photo is just better.I hate complaining and returning but I really had no choice on these . Looks like everyone else has had success .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .

 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 They are really cute , but they are so uncomfortable that I never wear them . The arch is so high and curved that it 's painful . If you 're one of those pain & beauty people then go for it , but the thing is it 's really not a high quality shoe so there 's no support . I would n't recommend .
 bad quality , not comfortable at all , I returned thess , they are basically a really high heeled cheap shoe . and if i remember correctly were too big

 This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out . Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky , and the fabric does not appear to breathe . I 'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this . For cooler weather , I 'd prefer something like a good pair of tights -LRB- Sugoi for example -RRB- .

 The shoes are fine but the color was not what we expected . Look closely at the picture and enlarge it . It is two toned and pretty drastic . If you like those things , it will be fine , I was expecting a very subtle two tone .
 I ordered a 10 it was to big and the lining had a defect in it , so I returned it and ordered a 9 as they do n't have half sizes it was perfect on my left foot but to small on my right foot so frustrating .
 A good shoe , as the title says , but so narrow that my son 's normal-width foot is too wide . Disappointing for us , but probably good for kids with very slender feet .
 This appears to be a great shoe for the person described above , but that appears to be questionable . As a mild pronating , medium arch runner , I found this shoe to cause big problems . My calfs would hurt after even short runs , maybe because of the low heel placement . Unless you have bought this shoe before , I would not suggest getting it online . Run on a treadmill at your local shoe store , make sure its right for you .
 Just to get to the point , my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water . When it rains or snows , the leather gets soaked and in no time , my feet starts to feel wet . This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole . At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon . Distraught , I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle . But alas , after the first day of rain , my feet were soaked again . I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made . Do n't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis .
 BROWN LEATHER - COLOR - BEWARE !!! IT IS DARK AND UGLY.I bought this in Brown leather last month and got that shipped to Kuwait.The brown color that looks great in the website picture is TOTALLY UGLY AND UNIMAGINABLY DARK AND UNACCEPTABLE.I am not using the shoes at all.Not in a position either to Ship that back to the US and get a replacement becausethat costs me more than the price of the shoe.James
 So happy to see this style still available . My current pair is at least 10 years old and it 's time to order another pair . These shoes are amazing walking shoes and while I do n't wear mine a lot at home , I would n't be caught dead without them on a trip to a walking city such as NY or SF . I can walk 10 miles per day in these shoes and they 're as comfy as going barefoot . Highest recommendation!Update
 I am a fan of Clarks . Probably last 10 years I have n't worn any other shoes except Clarks.Couple of weeks ago I ordered two pairs of this shoe
 My pair of Clarks arrived last week . When I took the shoes out of the box , I was n't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes -LRB- like I thought -RRB- or a cut-down version of a boot . I went back and looked at the picture on-line and , sure enough , I got what I ordered . This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe . With the four eyelets , this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit , plus it looks goofy . The leather , if it really is leather , looks fake . I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered . I also would never wear these shoes with jeans -LRB- if you do , wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek -RRB- . All in all , I give the product a 2 . I would send them back , but it 's not worth the bother . Instead , I 'll wear 'em when I work in the yard .
 These shoes seem to be well constructed , but they are not like the Clarks that I bought 20 years ago . I bought them about 3 months ago , and I wear them 3 or 4 days a week .1 -RRB- They 've lost most of the cushy feel that they had when they are new .2 -RRB- They have an unusual smell that reminds me of band-aids . I had originally thought that the odor would fade , but it has not . I can smell them all of the time , when they are within 6 feet of my person.If it were possible to return them at this point , I would .
 They are very average shoes . Please do n't buy them thinking they are better than any quality shoe on the market . Go to a Vasque dealer and get better shoes .
 The shoe overall was nice , I Like the design and it fits well . However it started tearing at the sides . did not get as much wear from it . I am really disapointed in clarks as I grow up wearing clarks and have to pray for it to damage .
 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape . Because the sole is cracked , the boots are worthless . Save your money and look for a different brand boot .

 Sorry to say that I was very disappointed with these shoes . At first , they seemed very comfortable , but I am in the medical field and on my feet all day . The soles started killing me by the late afternoon despite the shoes fitting me very well . There just is n't much cushion at all . I 've bought SAS shoes in the past and they are great right out of the box and onward . I just wanted something more stylish . But I guess I paid the price . If I ca n't return them now , I guess I 'll have to try some insoles .
 sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe . this case is a classic - you get what you pay for . cheap price for a CHEAP shoe .1 -RRB- this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe .2 -RRB- no arch support whatsoever . The rubber is almost too thick .3 -RRB- i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe . feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST . 3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute . this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned -LRB- this is my # 14 pair -RRB-
 I do n't think these Skechers are made out of leather , so I 'm very disappointed . I thought I was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer , but with such a low price it was `` too good to be true '' .

 I ordered these boots in size 12 m regular toe . They came in a box marked 12 m but the boots were 10 m . They did not fit also they had steel toes that I did not want . I do like these boots I have had 4 pairs that I bought from Sears over the years . I thought I would save some money online but it did n't work out . Just a wast of time . I went back to Sears

 I bought these because the price was great and the reviews were great and Clark 's is supposed to be great so I thought these would be great . I bought my true size -LRB- 8.5 M -RRB- and they are too small . They are very tight but I thought that they would loosen up after wearing them . BIG MISTAKE ! After walking in them for 15 minutes they rubbed several bleeding sores onto my foot - not blisters actual cuts in my foot - that are still healing some time later . The suntan is also an odd color that is n't really neutral and seems to go with nothing really except other pink things . I was totally disappointed !

 I bought two pairs of these super comfortable flats a few years ago when they were made of soft genuine leather and absolutely loved them . I still have a pair that I wear sometimes even though it looks really old and beat up now.I thought the satin version would fit similarly . I bought it in black and was very disappointed . The leather felt so much better on your foot and was soft right away with no breaking in necessary . The satin version looks cheap and the top part just is n't as comfortable.BC Footwear , if you 're reading this , please bring back the leather model ! I would buy several pairs !
 They are soo cute but they squeeze my toes so much I ca n't wear them . Also , I am normally a 7.5 - purached an 8 and they still were ill-fitting .

 I do n't like the fit of the sandal around the toe . Maybe I have a big toe but it is just too snug .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 The Amazon ad does n't tell you that these are `` Birkies '' -LRB- plastic uppers -RRB- and not like regular Birkenstocks.The shoes actually cost $ 40 by the time they added taxes and shipping . I ordered a size 45 -LRB- US 12 -RRB- . When I tried on the shoes they clearly were mislabled . The shoes were at least two sizes too small . I called Champs about a return and they only defended their size chart . They would not address the missized shoes . They said they would refund my money minus $ 6 for shipping . After a number of phone calls and emails , I finally got a full refund from Amazon .
 Like many , I had long associated the Birkenstock brand with comfortable , healthy footwear -LRB- and granola and patchouli and ... -RRB- . When my current pair of Bohn sandals finally fell apart , I happened across this pair of Birki 's at a reasonable price and decided to see what all the fuss was about . Yes , they were lightweight and comfortable , and the cork did breathe really well . For short stretches around the house , they were very comfortable . I discovered on a recent 4 day trip to the Outer Banks , however , that when I wore them for several hours a day or several days in a row , my feet became so sore that I resorted to walking around barefoot unless I absolutely had to have shoes on to enter a business or walk on the asphalt . My heel in particular suffered from the minimal give of the cork footbed . I am beginning to think a pair of Crocs may be more my speed .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I 'm a size 11 but the seller claims the shoes run big so I had to order a half-size smaller . I did get the 10.5 and I love the look and feel of the shoes when I put them on . However as soon as I start walking , the heel part keeps slipping off and I feel pinches all over . I ca n't even walk in these shoes ! Is it the size then ? Are the shoes too narrow for me ? I would like to return them but I 've since lost the box . I threw it away together with the invoice/receipt on the first day and did n't really try them on till about a month later . My stupid mistake .
 ordered online , waited for and did not receive . Did get an e-mail w/a cancellations , and refund .
 I bought these shoes hoping it would let me wear high heels again due to the fact I ca n't after my ACL surgery a few years ago . But they just pinch my toes and the side of my feet from the cheap plastic strap . Also they are n't very comfortable to walk in . I was hoping because they were Dr. Scholl 's shoes they were help my knee and feet , but I was wrong . These shoes killed my knee and feet within an hour . A waste of money in my book .

 These are , far and away , the absolute worst shoes I have ever purchased . I ordered these a half size larger , so that my foot would not hang off the back . -LRB- some of the reviews noted that they run small -RRB- Well , my foot STILL hangs off the back , AND they are the oddest fit . Narrow towards the front and wide in the middle . So my foot doesnt stay in the shoe , they feel like they are going to go flying forward with every step . I never had a pair of shoes like this before , they are just horrible . -LRB- My guess is they werent made in this country -RRB- I agree with the reviewer who noted that she spent the entire time trying to keep them on her feet . I bought these to wear to work -LRB- pre-school -RRB- since we are not permitted to wear sandals in the summer . The sandals would be safer and more comfortable than these . A horrible little waste of money !
 What a bummer ... . I bought these after trying on many pairs of skechers and I * thought * I had picked the best pair . WRONG ! They fit perfectly -LRB- which is so depressing -RRB- because they are near impossible to walk in . It 's like the insoles are made of teflon ! My feet slip out of them on every step . I spend my whole time walking thinking about keeping my feet in the shoes . I think I nearly sprained my foot trying to keep them on as I walked . I wish now I had gotten another pair . I ca n't return them because I 've worn them . Money down the toilet .
 I returned them and ordered a size 9 which has the same problem -LRB- only a bit more so -RRB- than the Keds mules . They run small . I could not get my foot in them all the way with very thin socks .
 I bought these shoes for my boyfriend for basketball . Ever since he 's used them , he has had problems with his ancle and the bottoms of his feet . Not to mention he only had them a couple months and they started to fall apart . I dont recommend any of the Iverson 's !
 i ordered them for my wedding and I got pink ones from converse but i never got the green ones and they charged me for the return . not happy at all
 The Logo was on the inside of the Sneaker not the outside.It was defective . disappointed with Macy 's .

 I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew .

 This came on time but a different color of what I ordered ! I do n`t recommend it !

 Sizing was not accurate . Had to send back the medium and order a large for a foot that wears a size 9 .
 I usually wear a U.S. size 10 -LRB- European 41 -RRB- and I trusted the description that said a U.K. size 8 would fit me . It does n't . Too big . My foot was sliding around and the drawstring was not able to create the snug fit I expected . Also , the sole of the Cactus slip-on may be Arche rubber , but it does n't have the springy quality I have loved in previous Arche shoes . Maybe shoes are something that ca n't be bought reliably over the Internet .
 I ordered these to compare with a pair of Alico Summit boots . A stitched on sole was the one thing I really wanted . These absolutely do not support your ankles whatsoever and I personally think it could actually contribute to turning your ankle . Also the leather seemd more like leatherette or vinyl to me . I asked my wife 's opinion as well and she said , &#34; Are these leather ? &#34; The only saving grace for these was that they are made in the USA . If you are looking for a well made quality boot with a sewn on sole you should seriously conider looking at Alico . Danner has goretex and Alico does n't but there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to keeping water out . This is just my opinion and I would go with Danner since it is a sewn on sole only if there were no other options . Overall very disappointed because I was really really wanting to purchase a boot made in America with sewn on soles but I guess I 'll just have to wait .
 Having owned multiple Danner boot products over the last thirty years and having been 100 % satisfied with previous purchases , I was very surprised at the poor quality of construction of these Mountain Light Hikers . The front eyelets on the right boot were not installed symetrically and the gussetted tongue on the left boot was installed incorrectly . Ca n't understand how this pair slipped past quality control inspection . I am returning them to Amazon .
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !

 Just to get to the point , my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water . When it rains or snows , the leather gets soaked and in no time , my feet starts to feel wet . This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole . At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon . Distraught , I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle . But alas , after the first day of rain , my feet were soaked again . I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made . Do n't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis .
 BROWN LEATHER - COLOR - BEWARE !!! IT IS DARK AND UGLY.I bought this in Brown leather last month and got that shipped to Kuwait.The brown color that looks great in the website picture is TOTALLY UGLY AND UNIMAGINABLY DARK AND UNACCEPTABLE.I am not using the shoes at all.Not in a position either to Ship that back to the US and get a replacement becausethat costs me more than the price of the shoe.James
 So happy to see this style still available . My current pair is at least 10 years old and it 's time to order another pair . These shoes are amazing walking shoes and while I do n't wear mine a lot at home , I would n't be caught dead without them on a trip to a walking city such as NY or SF . I can walk 10 miles per day in these shoes and they 're as comfy as going barefoot . Highest recommendation!Update
 I am a fan of Clarks . Probably last 10 years I have n't worn any other shoes except Clarks.Couple of weeks ago I ordered two pairs of this shoe
 My pair of Clarks arrived last week . When I took the shoes out of the box , I was n't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes -LRB- like I thought -RRB- or a cut-down version of a boot . I went back and looked at the picture on-line and , sure enough , I got what I ordered . This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe . With the four eyelets , this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit , plus it looks goofy . The leather , if it really is leather , looks fake . I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered . I also would never wear these shoes with jeans -LRB- if you do , wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek -RRB- . All in all , I give the product a 2 . I would send them back , but it 's not worth the bother . Instead , I 'll wear 'em when I work in the yard .
 These shoes seem to be well constructed , but they are not like the Clarks that I bought 20 years ago . I bought them about 3 months ago , and I wear them 3 or 4 days a week .1 -RRB- They 've lost most of the cushy feel that they had when they are new .2 -RRB- They have an unusual smell that reminds me of band-aids . I had originally thought that the odor would fade , but it has not . I can smell them all of the time , when they are within 6 feet of my person.If it were possible to return them at this point , I would .
 They are very average shoes . Please do n't buy them thinking they are better than any quality shoe on the market . Go to a Vasque dealer and get better shoes .
 The shoe overall was nice , I Like the design and it fits well . However it started tearing at the sides . did not get as much wear from it . I am really disapointed in clarks as I grow up wearing clarks and have to pray for it to damage .

 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !
 Having owned multiple Danner boot products over the last thirty years and having been 100 % satisfied with previous purchases , I was very surprised at the poor quality of construction of these Mountain Light Hikers .

 I ordered these to compare with a pair of Alico Summit boots . A stitched on sole was the one thing I really wanted . These absolutely do not support your ankles whatsoever and I personally think it could actually contribute to turning your ankle . Also the leather seemd more like leatherette or vinyl to me . I asked my wife 's opinion as well and she said , &#34; Are these leather ? &#34; The only saving grace for these was that they are made in the USA . If you are looking for a well made quality boot with a sewn on sole you should seriously conider looking at Alico . Danner has goretex and Alico does n't but there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to keeping water out . This is just my opinion and I would go with Danner since it is a sewn on sole only if there were no other options . Overall very disappointed because I was really really wanting to purchase a boot made in America with sewn on soles but I guess I 'll just have to wait .

 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note

The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .

 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it .

 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 Having owned multiple Danner boot products over the last thirty years and having been 100 % satisfied with previous purchases , I was very surprised at the poor quality of construction of these Mountain Light Hikers . The front eyelets on the right boot were not installed symetrically and the gussetted tongue on the left boot was installed incorrectly . Ca n't understand how this pair slipped past quality control inspection . I am returning them to Amazon .
 I ordered these to compare with a pair of Alico Summit boots . A stitched on sole was the one thing I really wanted . These absolutely do not support your ankles whatsoever and I personally think it could actually contribute to turning your ankle . Also the leather seemd more like leatherette or vinyl to me . I asked my wife 's opinion as well and she said , &#34; Are these leather ? &#34; The only saving grace for these was that they are made in the USA . If you are looking for a well made quality boot with a sewn on sole you should seriously conider looking at Alico . Danner has goretex and Alico does n't but there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to keeping water out . This is just my opinion and I would go with Danner since it is a sewn on sole only if there were no other options . Overall very disappointed because I was really really wanting to purchase a boot made in America with sewn on soles but I guess I 'll just have to wait .

 It was delivered at time . And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance ; however , it was n't . When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe , which is the reason why I bought it , the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance . Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons . Any way , the prodoct was n't the same value or quality of pumma 's shoes that I have bought in the past .
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !

 I usually like Adidas shoes and I have a good collection . this one is an extreme opposite of what an Adidas should be like.First thing
 I found these shoes by searching the women 's option for running shoes . The name may say Unisex , but there is no indication that the sizing is 100 % male . Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.When the shoes arrived here , they were huge . I tried to return them , but Amazon considers this to be MY fault , and planned to charge back any shipping , promotions and coupons against a possible refund . I had done very well using a coupon , a sale , a `` buy $ 80 worth of shoes and get $ 20 off instantly '' promotion and Amazon prime , so my `` refund '' would be less than nothing.That 's right -- if I return the shoes , I owe money . Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women 's section of the site might be men 's shoes instead . Yeah , that seems fair .
 Amazon represented these as women 's shoes but when I received them they were men 's . It turns out that the company no longer makes these shoes for women but that is how they are clearly listed on Amazon.Even though this was Amazon 's fault , and I sent plenty of support documention , I had to pay $ 9 to return these shoes and was not reimbursed or even acknowledged.I will not order through Amazon again !
 The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product , but rather the company that I purchased them from . I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift . Unfortunately , they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place , so he was unable to wear them , and since they were an online order item , it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return . The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label , so my son could return the original pair . When I spoke to my son last week , he had not yet received the return label . I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item . I am very unhappy with this purchase .
 These are true classics . I remember not liking them when they first came out decades ago , but I ca n't remember why . Anyway , the shoes are really comfortable and fit true to size . This is a VERY subjective thing to comment about - fit . If the proverbial shoe fits , wear it . And for me these fit . Cheers .
 I am not a soccer player , but I liked the style of this shoe . When I recieved them I thought the tongue was ridiculously too big and just looked silly . The arch support in my pair was like having large ant mounds in the soles of my shoes . After wearing them for work for 8 weeks , the ant mounds finally broke in a little bit , but now the heal feels wore out . I would not recommend these except for maybe wearing them for short stints with a pair of jeans to cover the silly looking tongues .
 really pretty bad . hurt my feet . get terrible grip on anything but concrete . held up for a long time on the outside , but not on the onside . only other good thing to say os that they look kinda cool .
 I have owned two pairs of these shoes and lost both of them after the glue connecting the rubber and cloth parts came undone , and I lost the heels . Otherwise they are comfortable , although the arch is somewhat lacking !
 I do n't know if I just got a bad pair but within 4 months of purchase , these shoes got a huge hole in the inside upper heal portion . And the shoe also completely lost its shape . I 've had these shoes before for four years and they were very durable . Perhaps a different vendor ?
 Do n't do it . These are not what I thought they would be . They are cheaply made , definitely not the old Adidas that turned out such great shoes years ago .
 I have owned a pair of samba classics since high school . Loved them ; until this pair . It turns out that when they changed the tongue label to blue it became printed on crappy foam . And it squeaks ... All of the time ... After three days of expecting this to stop , it has n't . I am returning them -LRB- and now I have to find a new shoe ... -RRB- , bummer !!!
 This is not for playing soccer . Do n't get fooled by the word `` classic soccer shoes '' that they use on the web . The shape of this shoes is just like a normal sneakers and not suited for kicking the ball . Just do n't buy this shoes .
 I ca n't believe the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this shoe . This shoe has no arch support . I 've played two pickup games that are n't too serious and I could barely walk after each one . They absorb no impact when you run and even though I tied them as tight as I could , blisters will still forming.The one positive thing I 'll say about them is they get much more traction then my regular sneakers on an indoor basketball floor so I can change direction better , which is part of the reason I get blisters because I cut/change direction very fast . -LRB- I get them with regular shoes , but I was hoping these would stop that -RRB- I suppose if you 're playing on grass or fake grass they might be ok but any hard surface I would avoid these sneakers . Also the extra long shoe tongue is annoying and looks bad folded down . -LRB- on the white sneakers at least -RRB- I went back to my tennis shoes , I 'm getting rid of these .
 I bought these shoes because I wanted something I can wear around town and also play soccer with the shoes . Believe me , you are going to wish you did not buy them if you kick a soccer ball with them . I dont know what and `` indoor soccer ball '' feels like but I tried these shoes on two balls that I have because at first I thought one of the balls that I had was too hevay and hard but it turns out it was the shoes , after kicking 30 yard shots my foot was hurting so I put on my cheap spaldings from walmart and they felt better , now I realize Im going to have to return them and buy some real soccer shoes that are hard so I can kick 30 40 yarders all day long without hurting my foot like I did with these shoes . . my email is rickalex21@hotmail.com if you have any comments send me with a subject of `` amazon adidas mens sambas '' .
 The shoes arrived with a security theft tag on them that said if we tried to break it is would leak ink all over the shoes.After many attempts to contact Bealls unsuccessfully , they finally responded about two weeks later ... too late.We spend a half an hour but carefully removed the tag . Shoes are great , Beall 's is awful.Not ordering anything from Beall 's ever again .
 Dumbest . Shoe . Ever . The SQUEAKING ruins them . Not only is it LOUD , it gets LOUDER with wear . You will sound like an IDIOT when you wear these shoes . Inside , you can hear them at least 15 yards away . Outside , unless a bus is passing by , you still hear them when you walk . Plus , the QUALITY IS BAD . The insole on the right foot is peeling away after less than 2 months . The left is mis-shapen so that my middle toe creeps to the far left of the shoe , causing severe discomfort . Mainly , THE SQUEAKING MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT . Who 's that guy with the loud shoes passing me by in the hallway at school ? YOU . Who 's that moron whose shoes make so much noise at the gym ? YOU . Who 's that guy whose foot hurts b/c he tried to work out in his Sambas ? YOU . I bought these so I could do martial arts , but the squeaking is just irritating and distracting -LRB- thank goodness I 'm not trying to be a Ninja ! -RRB- , and the discomfort renders them useless in a work out after about 15 minutes . OH , and did I mention that the stylish and slick blue Adidas tag on the tongue disappears as the tongue rides down to the inside of the shoe , rendering the logo invisible and the shoes even more uncomfortable ?
 It is a cheap soccer shoe with little support . the tongue extends about 1 '' past the last lacing hole and digs into your ankle , one inch is also not enough for it to be bent back over the laces so it is sufficiently awkward and was enough for me to return the shoe . unfortunately no free returns so i 'll be shopping elsewhere for my indoor soccer shoes . typically i wear a size 13 , however these were about a size too large on me so i 'd wear a 12 in this shoe . i have a pair of asics running sheos , lotto cleats and new balance cross trainers that are all 13 .
 seriously &#65292; these shoes make you clumsy the bottom of this shoe will make such a loud noise with the field &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281; &#65281;
 These shoes look great and have amazing style . Unfortunately , they are cheaply made and have zero comfort/support . I remember having an old pair of these that were amazing ... something is n't quite right about these new ones . Its really too bad , they look cool but are torture to wear . Returned .
 I have experienced both these pairs . Breakdown : CLASSIC : adidas Men 's Samba Classic Soccer Shoe - Larger tongue - easier to slip on/off - medium/enhanced arch support . If you wear air-soled running shoes , you probably wo n't even notice . Personally , I 'm NOT A FAN . - The arch support has changed in the last 3 years -LRB- the last time I bought this pair -RRB- . Be warned!ORIGINALS : adidas Originals Men 's Samba Reflective Sneaker - Smaller tongue - Old-school arch support -LRB- meaning flatter/next to none -RRB- . I have worn nothing but Chucks and older Sambas happily for many years , and identify with the barefoot-running crowd , so for me , flatter is better . - Harder to slip on/off , but once it 's on , it fits like a glove ! - Yes , they squeak like everyone says . Does n't bother me , but then again I 'm not a movie usher , burglar or otherwise occupied in the skulking arts.Some people will prefer one over the other . For me , the clear winner is ORIGINALS .
 I received my pair of size 13 shoes quickly after ordering . Upon trying my shoes on I noticed that the left shoe did n't fit at all like the right shoe . Upon inspection of the shoes I noticed that both shoe claimed to be size 13 as posted on their tongue tags . Next I put the shoes sole to sole and notice a dramatic size difference . The left shoe was 1 to 1.5 inches smaller than the right shoe . I do n't know how this would happen and must be a problem with quality control with Adidas . I have bought other shoes from Adidas but have never had this problem . Buy this style with caution .
 I purchased two pairs . One pair was fine , on the other pair the left insole was n't fitted corrected so my foot felt twisted when I had the sneaker on . That pair got returned and on the replacement pair the right insole does n't feel like it is fitted correctly . I can feel the arch part of the insole against my foot whereas I do not have this feeling with the first good pair or even on the other shoe of the replacement pair . Very disappointed .
 This shoe are supposed to be made out of leather -LRB- it is what I had before for similar prduct -RRB- , this is a man made materials , and are not what I expected . I am disappointed with this product , it seems to be an immitation of real staff .
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !

 Upon wearing this shoes for two weeks , they gave me foot problems . I thought they would get better after a few days so I kept wearing them . Now I need to go to the foot doctor because of the pain on my heels.I would NOT recommend this shoes for people who walk a lot at work or are on their feet for long periods of time .
 Purchased these shoes at the end of September . There are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use . I do n't subject them to a lot of wear and tear ; I work at a desk . This is the second straight pair of Skechers that have lasted me barely a month . Suffice it to say I will never purchase Skechers again .
 The day I got these , I put them on and pressed down with my thumb on top of the shoe ; I wanted to see how much toe-room I had -LRB- everyone does that , right ? -RRB- . My thumb created an indent , essentially caved-in part of the toe area that I still can not get to ` pop out ' . I bought these to replace a nearly identical pair of Skechers that I purchased in '04 that lasted 7 years ! These ones wo n't make it through one season . I question whether the Leather Upper is actually leather at all ! It feels like shiny cardboard .
 Unfortuately , while these Skechers oxfords are initially comfortable and appear rugged , the padded collar is constructed of a very thin , poor-quality leather . After just a few weeks of wear , the finish of the leather in the collar of these shoes cracked and then flaked off . Then the poor-quality leather in this area started to fall apart . So I had a pair of shoes that looked nearly brand new with the collar falling apart and the frayed leather rubbing on the back of my ankle . Also , the pull loop on the back tore after a short time due to the inferior leather . The interior lining is also a cheap , thin embossed cloth that wears quickly in the heel area . You may only get a few weeks of wear before these shoes start to deteriorate in these areas . Other reviewers have also commented on the poor-quality leather and rapid wear .
 My Skechers were very poorly built . I had to return them after wearing 6 times . I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have them replaced and they wo n't give me my money back to get different shoes .
 I purchased a pair of Sketchers Men 's Alley Cat Utility Oxford blacks and they wore out in less than four months . The heel collar is rubbing off and the rubber outsole is ripping apart from the inner leather sole resulting in the shoes flapping like a pair of flip-flops . The initial wearing of the shoe was painful , pinching at pressure points on the foot . After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably , but obviously not for very long . These shoes are an American company brand but are manufactured in China . Given the price and American name brand I expected a little more quality control . I am very disappointed !
 Bought these at a national chain . Wore the occasionally and was very careful with them . The leather bubbled and cracked in several places and the finish wore off the collar part of the shoe all within about 6 weeks . Really bad quality leather . They are good looking and comfortable but 6 weeks is ridiculous . I am very easy on my shoes and always get at least several years out of them . I even have a pair of Elkwoods hiking boots that I used to wear constantly and they are still fine after 10 years . My New Balance sneakers I wear almost every day and are 3 years old with a lot of wear on them I am just now about to replace them . So when these Skechers wore out in 6 weeks I was very upset . The sole look like brand new with no wear on them and now I have to throw them out . This will be the first time I have ever tossed out a pair of shoes with out wearing them out . What a waste of money . I recommend you find another brand . Timberland , Dr. Scholls , Dockers , all make similar shoes that may last longer .
 IT SEEMS LOSING A RETURN TICKET FOR THIS COMPANY IS A MAJOR ERROR . I DID SO AND HAVE N'T BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE MATTER WITH THEM SINCE . NEEDLESS TO SAY , I STILL HAVE THE SHOES AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR RETURNING THEM /
 Never wore them because they smelled like moth balls . The odor was so strong that my whole house started to smell like moth balls . Had to return them .
 I love Skechers shoes and I owned many in my life time , but this paid did not hold up , just couple months of wear the soles came loose well before the shoe got any use and wear .
 I guess my feet are a little wider than most , but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes . These are so tight I can not even wear them . I wear Converse Chuck Taylors all the time and they are snug , but these just hurt the moment I put them on . So if you have big feet , try these on in a store before ordering . Other than that they look like decent shoes , especially for the price .
 Lied about shipping time ! SHIPPING IS S-L-O-W !!!!!! The 3-5 business day shipping is a lie . After not getting my shoes on time from shoes.com I sent am inquiry email . They responded by saying the shoes should arrive in 5-7 business days . So when they want you to buy the shoes it 3-5 business days , but after you buy , 5-7 business days . I will be going to Zappos.com next time . It will be well over a week before I get my order .
 These shoes with the leather uppers are mandatory for my son 's school . After wearing them for three days , the leather was worn completely through the front . All the kids who wear these kids at school have the same problem . Very cheap leather and poor construction .
 I bought these for my husband to wear to work . He loved the fit -LRB- he has a very wide foot -RRB- and found these shoes to be comfy . I bought them because they were Skechers.He came home a couple of days ago and the leather has &#34; peeled &#34; off the top of one shoe and is beginning to peel off on the other . It 's very noticeable , as it is peeling off the toes ! They look horrible . Now , I need to find him another pair to wear to work . I wo n't buy any more Skechers !
 After only 3 months of non heavy-duty use , they have cracks on the top . Very disappointed in this , something you should n't see this early on . Will look for another brand next time I purchase something similar .
 I bought 2 pairs brown and black and the problem was the same . They did n't last for two months . Dont be fool and look for another one .
 the size is ok , it 's comfortable and everything is ok except for the finishing . I ordered the `` Brown '' one which does n't shine , and I got the shiny brown .
 looks nice , but i cant wear them without wearing 2 pairs of socks.cuts into the top of my foot and i literally have a cut on the area above my toes .
 Recently I 've found the quality in Skechers on the decline . The soles come unglued , seams break or leather wears quickly . It 's really too bad because these are really comfortable shoes and used to be pretty durable , price considering .
 I bought a pair of shoes for office work and I have been disappointed ever since . I have owned several other Skecher models and have been somewhat happy with them but these shoes have been downright horrible after about a month 's use . My biggest complaint is the squeakiness on the left shoe . The comfort level also is not so great as the back of the shoe rubs on the back of my heal.The shoes are actually quite good looking and the materials are nice . I 'm not sure if its hit and miss with Skechers or if this particular model has design deficiencies .
 I thought these shoes were a real find . They were comfortable , very sturdy looking , and cheap.One early concern , however , was that it really seemed that the shoes could use another eyelet . The heels slipped a bit on my feet . Even if I tightened the laces very tight , the heels would slip as the laces loosened a bit . -LRB- This is a problem that I have had with other `` utility '' shoes . That is , the soles are not so flexible , and as a result it is difficult to keep the heel from slipping . In my opinion , most of them need to have another eyelet . -RRB- I hoped that the shoe would become more flexible with some wear , and the problem would go away . But the problem did not go away . The shoes usually slip on my feet . And as a result of the slipping , the cloth lining on the inside of the shoe has worn away at the heel.But two other much bigger problems emerged with the shoes , problems that were a bit of a surprise.Problem # 1
 this Chinese made shoe is terrible , i bought this shoe and the upper part of the shoe after few months started to break up , started to pill off . i would not recommend any shoe made in china or this shoe what so ever .
 Skechers are quite possibly the cheapest , worst shoes ever made . I tried on this very shoe at a shoe store and when tightening the laces the eyelet popped out - just trying them on . Others I know have had countless problems with their Skechers as well . Poor stiching that unravels after only a few uses , eyelets that bend or break off , emblems or logos on the shoe that fall off , and so on . If you 're interested in a good looking , hip and trendy , cheap shoe to wear once or twice , then Skechers is your shoe - but if quality is a concern , then do n't bother .
 I 've worn these shoes for years . A few years back one pair cracked after a few weeks . Thinking this was just a fluke I continued to buy them . Within the last 6 months though I 've gone through 3 pairs , all of which have cracked on me . The leather either bubbles , feels as if there is gravel behind it or , as on one pair , there is nothing behind the leather . I have bought my last pair of skechers .
 The medium is actually very very wide , and the stitching on the upper gave way only a month after I bought it . Generally , I like Skechers shoes , but I could only recommend this for people with very wide feet .
 I have been purchasing Skechers shoes for at least 12 year 's and my last 2 pair have failed . The older pair lasted 1 year and the outsole cracked in half across the width of the sole . My latest pair purchased less than 3 months ago had the side seam tear out of its triple stitching . I find this to be unacceptable having 2 pair of shoes fail in 1 year . I work in an office and I sit at a desk 8 hours a day . These are worn maybe 3 days a week . Will never buy this brand again .
 Here 's the simple deal on this one ... . Superb sole . It is super thick and you feel awesome . But , the top sucks . The leather is really fake and will start showing cracks very soon . Of what use is a shoe that looks like crap from the top but is essentially still functional because the sole is great ?? Gave it to the SALVATION ARMY !!!
 We have bought 2 pairs of these shoes for my husband . Both have fallen apart within six months . My husband enjoyed wearing them for work because they were comfortable , however , within months he had problems with water leaking in his shoes and the leather cracking and breaking apart . Although they look nice and are comfortable , I would expect a longer lifespan for a $ 60 pair of shoes !
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !

 Having owned multiple Danner boot products over the last thirty years and having been 100 % satisfied with previous purchases , I was very surprised at the poor quality of construction of these Mountain Light Hikers . The front eyelets on the right boot were not installed symetrically and the gussetted tongue on the left boot was installed incorrectly . Ca n't understand how this pair slipped past quality control inspection . I am returning them to Amazon .
 I ordered these to compare with a pair of Alico Summit boots . A stitched on sole was the one thing I really wanted . These absolutely do not support your ankles whatsoever and I personally think it could actually contribute to turning your ankle . Also the leather seemd more like leatherette or vinyl to me . I asked my wife 's opinion as well and she said , &#34; Are these leather ? &#34; The only saving grace for these was that they are made in the USA . If you are looking for a well made quality boot with a sewn on sole you should seriously conider looking at Alico . Danner has goretex and Alico does n't but there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to keeping water out . This is just my opinion and I would go with Danner since it is a sewn on sole only if there were no other options . Overall very disappointed because I was really really wanting to purchase a boot made in America with sewn on soles but I guess I 'll just have to wait .
 These shoes are so cute but as the day wore on they got tighter and tighter . There is no give in them . I had horrible sores on the back of my feet and toes .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 Purchased as a gift for my wife . She likes the style a lot , but the leather finish faded way too quickly to be acceptable . Pretty disappointing for a shoe that she otherwise likes .

 We have bought dozens of Stride Rite shoes over the past 5 years for our two daughters and been very happy with all of them - until now . This pair , the Trinity , has a serious design flaw

 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape . Because the sole is cracked , the boots are worthless . Save your money and look for a different brand boot .

 the size is ok , it 's comfortable and everything is ok except for the finishing . I ordered the `` Brown '' one which does n't shine , and I got the shiny brown .
 looks nice , but i cant wear them without wearing 2 pairs of socks.cuts into the top of my foot and i literally have a cut on the area above my toes .
 Recently I 've found the quality in Skechers on the decline . The soles come unglued , seams break or leather wears quickly . It 's really too bad because these are really comfortable shoes and used to be pretty durable , price considering .
 I bought a pair of shoes for office work and I have been disappointed ever since . I have owned several other Skecher models and have been somewhat happy with them but these shoes have been downright horrible after about a month 's use . My biggest complaint is the squeakiness on the left shoe . The comfort level also is not so great as the back of the shoe rubs on the back of my heal.The shoes are actually quite good looking and the materials are nice . I 'm not sure if its hit and miss with Skechers or if this particular model has design deficiencies .
 I thought these shoes were a real find . They were comfortable , very sturdy looking , and cheap.One early concern , however , was that it really seemed that the shoes could use another eyelet . The heels slipped a bit on my feet . Even if I tightened the laces very tight , the heels would slip as the laces loosened a bit . -LRB- This is a problem that I have had with other `` utility '' shoes . That is , the soles are not so flexible , and as a result it is difficult to keep the heel from slipping . In my opinion , most of them need to have another eyelet . -RRB- I hoped that the shoe would become more flexible with some wear , and the problem would go away . But the problem did not go away . The shoes usually slip on my feet . And as a result of the slipping , the cloth lining on the inside of the shoe has worn away at the heel.But two other much bigger problems emerged with the shoes , problems that were a bit of a surprise.Problem # 1
 I guess my feet are a little wider than most , but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes . These are so tight I can not even wear them . I wear Converse Chuck Taylors all the time and they are snug , but these just hurt the moment I put them on . So if you have big feet , try these on in a store before ordering . Other than that they look like decent shoes , especially for the price .
 Lied about shipping time ! SHIPPING IS S-L-O-W !!!!!! The 3-5 business day shipping is a lie . After not getting my shoes on time from shoes.com I sent am inquiry email . They responded by saying the shoes should arrive in 5-7 business days . So when they want you to buy the shoes it 3-5 business days , but after you buy , 5-7 business days . I will be going to Zappos.com next time . It will be well over a week before I get my order .
 These shoes with the leather uppers are mandatory for my son 's school . After wearing them for three days , the leather was worn completely through the front . All the kids who wear these kids at school have the same problem . Very cheap leather and poor construction .

 I bought these for my husband to wear to work . He loved the fit -LRB- he has a very wide foot -RRB- and found these shoes to be comfy . I bought them because they were Skechers.He came home a couple of days ago and the leather has &#34; peeled &#34; off the top of one shoe and is beginning to peel off on the other . It 's very noticeable , as it is peeling off the toes ! They look horrible . Now , I need to find him another pair to wear to work . I wo n't buy any more Skechers !

 Never wore them because they smelled like moth balls . The odor was so strong that my whole house started to smell like moth balls . Had to return them .
 I love Skechers shoes and I owned many in my life time , but this paid did not hold up , just couple months of wear the soles came loose well before the shoe got any use and wear .

 These shoes with the leather uppers are mandatory for my son 's school . After wearing them for three days , the leather was worn completely through the front . All the kids who wear these kids at school have the same problem . Very cheap leather and poor construction .
 Upon wearing this shoes for two weeks , they gave me foot problems . I thought they would get better after a few days so I kept wearing them . Now I need to go to the foot doctor because of the pain on my heels.I would NOT recommend this shoes for people who walk a lot at work or are on their feet for long periods of time .
 Purchased these shoes at the end of September . There are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use . I do n't subject them to a lot of wear and tear ; I work at a desk . This is the second straight pair of Skechers that have lasted me barely a month . Suffice it to say I will never purchase Skechers again .
 The day I got these , I put them on and pressed down with my thumb on top of the shoe ; I wanted to see how much toe-room I had -LRB- everyone does that , right ? -RRB- . My thumb created an indent , essentially caved-in part of the toe area that I still can not get to ` pop out ' . I bought these to replace a nearly identical pair of Skechers that I purchased in '04 that lasted 7 years ! These ones wo n't make it through one season . I question whether the Leather Upper is actually leather at all ! It feels like shiny cardboard .
 Unfortuately , while these Skechers oxfords are initially comfortable and appear rugged , the padded collar is constructed of a very thin , poor-quality leather . After just a few weeks of wear , the finish of the leather in the collar of these shoes cracked and then flaked off . Then the poor-quality leather in this area started to fall apart . So I had a pair of shoes that looked nearly brand new with the collar falling apart and the frayed leather rubbing on the back of my ankle . Also , the pull loop on the back tore after a short time due to the inferior leather . The interior lining is also a cheap , thin embossed cloth that wears quickly in the heel area . You may only get a few weeks of wear before these shoes start to deteriorate in these areas . Other reviewers have also commented on the poor-quality leather and rapid wear .
 My Skechers were very poorly built . I had to return them after wearing 6 times . I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have them replaced and they wo n't give me my money back to get different shoes .
 I purchased a pair of Sketchers Men 's Alley Cat Utility Oxford blacks and they wore out in less than four months . The heel collar is rubbing off and the rubber outsole is ripping apart from the inner leather sole resulting in the shoes flapping like a pair of flip-flops . The initial wearing of the shoe was painful , pinching at pressure points on the foot . After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably , but obviously not for very long . These shoes are an American company brand but are manufactured in China . Given the price and American name brand I expected a little more quality control . I am very disappointed !
 Bought these at a national chain . Wore the occasionally and was very careful with them . The leather bubbled and cracked in several places and the finish wore off the collar part of the shoe all within about 6 weeks . Really bad quality leather . They are good looking and comfortable but 6 weeks is ridiculous . I am very easy on my shoes and always get at least several years out of them . I even have a pair of Elkwoods hiking boots that I used to wear constantly and they are still fine after 10 years . My New Balance sneakers I wear almost every day and are 3 years old with a lot of wear on them I am just now about to replace them . So when these Skechers wore out in 6 weeks I was very upset . The sole look like brand new with no wear on them and now I have to throw them out . This will be the first time I have ever tossed out a pair of shoes with out wearing them out . What a waste of money . I recommend you find another brand . Timberland , Dr. Scholls , Dockers , all make similar shoes that may last longer .
 IT SEEMS LOSING A RETURN TICKET FOR THIS COMPANY IS A MAJOR ERROR . I DID SO AND HAVE N'T BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE MATTER WITH THEM SINCE . NEEDLESS TO SAY , I STILL HAVE THE SHOES AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR RETURNING THEM /
 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape . Because the sole is cracked , the boots are worthless . Save your money and look for a different brand boot .
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !

 These are , far and away , the absolute worst shoes I have ever purchased . I ordered these a half size larger , so that my foot would not hang off the back . -LRB- some of the reviews noted that they run small -RRB- Well , my foot STILL hangs off the back , AND they are the oddest fit . Narrow towards the front and wide in the middle . So my foot doesnt stay in the shoe , they feel like they are going to go flying forward with every step . I never had a pair of shoes like this before , they are just horrible . -LRB- My guess is they werent made in this country -RRB- I agree with the reviewer who noted that she spent the entire time trying to keep them on her feet . I bought these to wear to work -LRB- pre-school -RRB- since we are not permitted to wear sandals in the summer . The sandals would be safer and more comfortable than these . A horrible little waste of money !
 What a bummer ... . I bought these after trying on many pairs of skechers and I * thought * I had picked the best pair . WRONG ! They fit perfectly -LRB- which is so depressing -RRB- because they are near impossible to walk in . It 's like the insoles are made of teflon ! My feet slip out of them on every step . I spend my whole time walking thinking about keeping my feet in the shoes . I think I nearly sprained my foot trying to keep them on as I walked . I wish now I had gotten another pair . I ca n't return them because I 've worn them . Money down the toilet .
 I returned them and ordered a size 9 which has the same problem -LRB- only a bit more so -RRB- than the Keds mules . They run small . I could not get my foot in them all the way with very thin socks .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 The day I got these , I put them on and pressed down with my thumb on top of the shoe ; I wanted to see how much toe-room I had -LRB- everyone does that , right ? -RRB- . My thumb created an indent , essentially caved-in part of the toe area that I still can not get to ` pop out ' . I bought these to replace a nearly identical pair of Skechers that I purchased in '04 that lasted 7 years ! These ones wo n't make it through one season . I question whether the Leather Upper is actually leather at all ! It feels like shiny cardboard .
 Unfortuately , while these Skechers oxfords are initially comfortable and appear rugged , the padded collar is constructed of a very thin , poor-quality leather . After just a few weeks of wear , the finish of the leather in the collar of these shoes cracked and then flaked off . Then the poor-quality leather in this area started to fall apart . So I had a pair of shoes that looked nearly brand new with the collar falling apart and the frayed leather rubbing on the back of my ankle . Also , the pull loop on the back tore after a short time due to the inferior leather . The interior lining is also a cheap , thin embossed cloth that wears quickly in the heel area . You may only get a few weeks of wear before these shoes start to deteriorate in these areas . Other reviewers have also commented on the poor-quality leather and rapid wear .
 My Skechers were very poorly built . I had to return them after wearing 6 times . I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have them replaced and they wo n't give me my money back to get different shoes .
 I purchased a pair of Sketchers Men 's Alley Cat Utility Oxford blacks and they wore out in less than four months . The heel collar is rubbing off and the rubber outsole is ripping apart from the inner leather sole resulting in the shoes flapping like a pair of flip-flops . The initial wearing of the shoe was painful , pinching at pressure points on the foot . After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably , but obviously not for very long . These shoes are an American company brand but are manufactured in China . Given the price and American name brand I expected a little more quality control . I am very disappointed !
 Bought these at a national chain . Wore the occasionally and was very careful with them . The leather bubbled and cracked in several places and the finish wore off the collar part of the shoe all within about 6 weeks . Really bad quality leather . They are good looking and comfortable but 6 weeks is ridiculous . I am very easy on my shoes and always get at least several years out of them . I even have a pair of Elkwoods hiking boots that I used to wear constantly and they are still fine after 10 years . My New Balance sneakers I wear almost every day and are 3 years old with a lot of wear on them I am just now about to replace them . So when these Skechers wore out in 6 weeks I was very upset . The sole look like brand new with no wear on them and now I have to throw them out . This will be the first time I have ever tossed out a pair of shoes with out wearing them out . What a waste of money . I recommend you find another brand . Timberland , Dr. Scholls , Dockers , all make similar shoes that may last longer .
 I guess my feet are a little wider than most , but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes . These are so tight I can not even wear them . I wear Converse Chuck Taylors all the time and they are snug , but these just hurt the moment I put them on . So if you have big feet , try these on in a store before ordering . Other than that they look like decent shoes , especially for the price .
 Lied about shipping time ! SHIPPING IS S-L-O-W !!!!!! The 3-5 business day shipping is a lie . After not getting my shoes on time from shoes.com I sent am inquiry email . They responded by saying the shoes should arrive in 5-7 business days . So when they want you to buy the shoes it 3-5 business days , but after you buy , 5-7 business days . I will be going to Zappos.com next time . It will be well over a week before I get my order .
 These shoes with the leather uppers are mandatory for my son 's school . After wearing them for three days , the leather was worn completely through the front . All the kids who wear these kids at school have the same problem . Very cheap leather and poor construction .
 Recently I 've found the quality in Skechers on the decline . The soles come unglued , seams break or leather wears quickly . It 's really too bad because these are really comfortable shoes and used to be pretty durable , price considering .
 I bought a pair of shoes for office work and I have been disappointed ever since . I have owned several other Skecher models and have been somewhat happy with them but these shoes have been downright horrible after about a month 's use . My biggest complaint is the squeakiness on the left shoe . The comfort level also is not so great as the back of the shoe rubs on the back of my heal.The shoes are actually quite good looking and the materials are nice . I 'm not sure if its hit and miss with Skechers or if this particular model has design deficiencies .
 I thought these shoes were a real find . They were comfortable , very sturdy looking , and cheap.One early concern , however , was that it really seemed that the shoes could use another eyelet . The heels slipped a bit on my feet . Even if I tightened the laces very tight , the heels would slip as the laces loosened a bit . -LRB- This is a problem that I have had with other `` utility '' shoes . That is , the soles are not so flexible , and as a result it is difficult to keep the heel from slipping . In my opinion , most of them need to have another eyelet . -RRB- I hoped that the shoe would become more flexible with some wear , and the problem would go away . But the problem did not go away . The shoes usually slip on my feet . And as a result of the slipping , the cloth lining on the inside of the shoe has worn away at the heel.But two other much bigger problems emerged with the shoes , problems that were a bit of a surprise.Problem # 1
 I bought these for my husband to wear to work . He loved the fit -LRB- he has a very wide foot -RRB- and found these shoes to be comfy . I bought them because they were Skechers.He came home a couple of days ago and the leather has &#34; peeled &#34; off the top of one shoe and is beginning to peel off on the other . It 's very noticeable , as it is peeling off the toes ! They look horrible . Now , I need to find him another pair to wear to work . I wo n't buy any more Skechers !
 After only 3 months of non heavy-duty use , they have cracks on the top . Very disappointed in this , something you should n't see this early on . Will look for another brand next time I purchase something similar .
 I bought 2 pairs brown and black and the problem was the same . They did n't last for two months . Dont be fool and look for another one .
 the size is ok , it 's comfortable and everything is ok except for the finishing . I ordered the `` Brown '' one which does n't shine , and I got the shiny brown .
 looks nice , but i cant wear them without wearing 2 pairs of socks.cuts into the top of my foot and i literally have a cut on the area above my toes .
 IT SEEMS LOSING A RETURN TICKET FOR THIS COMPANY IS A MAJOR ERROR . I DID SO AND HAVE N'T BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE MATTER WITH THEM SINCE . NEEDLESS TO SAY , I STILL HAVE THE SHOES AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR RETURNING THEM /

 Upon wearing this shoes for two weeks , they gave me foot problems . I thought they would get better after a few days so I kept wearing them . Now I need to go to the foot doctor because of the pain on my heels.I would NOT recommend this shoes for people who walk a lot at work or are on their feet for long periods of time .
 Never wore them because they smelled like moth balls . The odor was so strong that my whole house started to smell like moth balls . Had to return them .
 I love Skechers shoes and I owned many in my life time , but this paid did not hold up , just couple months of wear the soles came loose well before the shoe got any use and wear .

 Loved the look . The arch hit in the wrong place and it was n't comfortable .
 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape . Because the sole is cracked , the boots are worthless . Save your money and look for a different brand boot .
 My Dad wears a 13 , and this shoe was too tight for him . He 'd need at least a size 14 , and preferably a wide .
 These Shoes are ok but they are overpriced . I have a pair of Bostonian Maldens and they are similar quality . The Bostonian cost less than half of the Florsheims . These shoes are average and I do like them but they do not compare to other 225 shoes on the market.Florsheim customer service was hit or miss . I bought the shoes from the Florsheim website and had them shipped to Canada . Half the time I dealt with with a good customer service rep the other half not so much . My big complaint is that I tried to leave a 3 star review on the Florsheim website and they did n't approve it . It seems they screen all their reviews and if they do n't like what the customer has written they will not publish it . I think this is extremely misleading and dishonest.If you can find these shoes for 150 bucks and do n't have to deal with Florsheim directly then I would recommend them . If it was n't for the price and service I would have given 4 start review because the shoes are nice .
 I 'm really disappointed with the quality and workmanship of the Florsheim shoes . The leather is so tough that they are uncomfortable to wear . I wore them just once and will never wear them again . What a shame !
 I love these colors but the sneaker is not feminine at all . It is definitely a skater 's shoe . It is very think and just very masculine .
 They look cool online ... but they are aweful in real life >> > disclaimer
 I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months . The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on . By the last month i had them , the sole had totally separated from the upper . I thought Florsheim shoes were good ; maybe years ago , but not now . These shoes are NOT recommended at all .
 The box said 8.5 Triple E , but the shoes were 9.5 regulars . I purchased another pair at local business .
 The shoes seems to be well put together for having never been worn , because the fit is horrible ! Why I thought buying shoes without trying them on fist -LSB- knowing my size and wearing Florsheims -RSB- is a mystery I will have to self-solve . These are made in Korea -LSB- stamped right under the flap -RSB- on both pairs and the width is as wrong as the makers mark.Stay away from these no matter what the price . I took them to two shoe makers to have them stretched and they said if they tried , the seems would rip apart and the leather would crack . Not a comforting thought since wearing them should naturally stretch them anyway .
 Do n't buy these . I used to love Florsheim -LRB- I still wear an old pair of Comfortech 's -RRB- but I got a bad pair of these .
 I am so disappointed . Its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size .
 This is the worst pair of florsheims I 've ever had and I 've had plenty . The construction looks cheap and the sizes are a bit off . I ordered several pairs , one for my father and two for two of my uncles , nobody seems to be happy with theirs.They were priced very cheap ... I suppose you get what you pay for . Still , bad choice for $ 30 ...
 please do not buy from this company.Very bad Very poor service product very cheap
 I liked the looks of this boot out of the box . I wore the boots around the house for a couple of times , then went for a walk . By the time I was a half mile from home I was having trouble with the right boot in the heel area . By the time I turned around and arrived back home I had worn the hide off both feet above the heel with blood on my sock on the right foot . I do n't think I ever had a worse experience with a boot . As you draw up the laces it feels like there is something behind the heel area much like a fish line cutting into your skin .
 I have had the shoe less than 2 months and these boots have a hole in the toe ... i had another pair of HI-TEC and they were good . This pair is TRASH ... i wasted 50 bucks . .
 I should have waited for the pictures to load up on my dial up before I excitedly purchased the product . It is not the massaging thong I had hoped for .
 I have been a fan of this road running shoe for the last 5 years but this new version stinks . As I run , I feel that I am going to slip out . The last three versions had a reinforced stitching around the ankle area . This shoes seems to have done away with that and the tread seems cheaper . It feels like a flimsy $ 35 shoe . I have returned my shoes after trying them out once on the treadmill . Dissapointed ex-reebok fan .
 I have worned these boots 2 times and the color is fading off both boots , even though they got a little wet , I 'm still unsatified with the fact that the color is fading away .
 I have not yet received this product , the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month . And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem
 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .

 I ordered a 9N , and it 's NOT narrow . It 's also a lot heavier than it looks . They 're also reaaaallly flat and have little support . Bummer . .
 I bought these for my husband to wear to work . He loved the fit -LRB- he has a very wide foot -RRB- and found these shoes to be comfy . I bought them because they were Skechers.He came home a couple of days ago and the leather has &#34; peeled &#34; off the top of one shoe and is beginning to peel off on the other . It 's very noticeable , as it is peeling off the toes ! They look horrible . Now , I need to find him another pair to wear to work . I wo n't buy any more Skechers !
 After only 3 months of non heavy-duty use , they have cracks on the top . Very disappointed in this , something you should n't see this early on . Will look for another brand next time I purchase something similar .
 I bought 2 pairs brown and black and the problem was the same . They did n't last for two months . Dont be fool and look for another one .
 the size is ok , it 's comfortable and everything is ok except for the finishing . I ordered the `` Brown '' one which does n't shine , and I got the shiny brown .
 looks nice , but i cant wear them without wearing 2 pairs of socks.cuts into the top of my foot and i literally have a cut on the area above my toes .
 I guess my feet are a little wider than most , but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes . These are so tight I can not even wear them .

 Purchased these shoes at the end of September . There are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use . I do n't subject them to a lot of wear and tear ; I work at a desk . This is the second straight pair of Skechers that have lasted me barely a month . Suffice it to say I will never purchase Skechers again .
 The day I got these , I put them on and pressed down with my thumb on top of the shoe ; I wanted to see how much toe-room I had -LRB- everyone does that , right ? -RRB- . My thumb created an indent , essentially caved-in part of the toe area that I still can not get to ` pop out ' . I bought these to replace a nearly identical pair of Skechers that I purchased in '04 that lasted 7 years ! These ones wo n't make it through one season . I question whether the Leather Upper is actually leather at all ! It feels like shiny cardboard .
 Unfortuately , while these Skechers oxfords are initially comfortable and appear rugged , the padded collar is constructed of a very thin , poor-quality leather . After just a few weeks of wear , the finish of the leather in the collar of these shoes cracked and then flaked off . Then the poor-quality leather in this area started to fall apart . So I had a pair of shoes that looked nearly brand new with the collar falling apart and the frayed leather rubbing on the back of my ankle . Also , the pull loop on the back tore after a short time due to the inferior leather . The interior lining is also a cheap , thin embossed cloth that wears quickly in the heel area . You may only get a few weeks of wear before these shoes start to deteriorate in these areas . Other reviewers have also commented on the poor-quality leather and rapid wear .
 My Skechers were very poorly built . I had to return them after wearing 6 times . I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have them replaced and they wo n't give me my money back to get different shoes .
 I purchased a pair of Sketchers Men 's Alley Cat Utility Oxford blacks and they wore out in less than four months . The heel collar is rubbing off and the rubber outsole is ripping apart from the inner leather sole resulting in the shoes flapping like a pair of flip-flops . The initial wearing of the shoe was painful , pinching at pressure points on the foot . After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably , but obviously not for very long . These shoes are an American company brand but are manufactured in China . Given the price and American name brand I expected a little more quality control . I am very disappointed !
 Bought these at a national chain . Wore the occasionally and was very careful with them . The leather bubbled and cracked in several places and the finish wore off the collar part of the shoe all within about 6 weeks . Really bad quality leather . They are good looking and comfortable but 6 weeks is ridiculous . I am very easy on my shoes and always get at least several years out of them . I even have a pair of Elkwoods hiking boots that I used to wear constantly and they are still fine after 10 years . My New Balance sneakers I wear almost every day and are 3 years old with a lot of wear on them I am just now about to replace them . So when these Skechers wore out in 6 weeks I was very upset . The sole look like brand new with no wear on them and now I have to throw them out . This will be the first time I have ever tossed out a pair of shoes with out wearing them out . What a waste of money . I recommend you find another brand . Timberland , Dr. Scholls , Dockers , all make similar shoes that may last longer .
 Upon wearing this shoes for two weeks , they gave me foot problems . I thought they would get better after a few days so I kept wearing them . Now I need to go to the foot doctor because of the pain on my heels.I would NOT recommend this shoes for people who walk a lot at work or are on their feet for long periods of time .

 Never wore them because they smelled like moth balls . The odor was so strong that my whole house started to smell like moth balls . Had to return them .
 I love Skechers shoes and I owned many in my life time , but this paid did not hold up , just couple months of wear the soles came loose well before the shoe got any use and wear .
 This item has never been delivered . According to the Amazon website the estimated delivery date is 26,27 December 06 and yet today is 15Jan07 . There has been no update or offer of options to me.Please advise ,
 Recently I 've found the quality in Skechers on the decline . The soles come unglued , seams break or leather wears quickly . It 's really too bad because these are really comfortable shoes and used to be pretty durable , price considering .
 I bought a pair of shoes for office work and I have been disappointed ever since . I have owned several other Skecher models and have been somewhat happy with them but these shoes have been downright horrible after about a month 's use . My biggest complaint is the squeakiness on the left shoe . The comfort level also is not so great as the back of the shoe rubs on the back of my heal.The shoes are actually quite good looking and the materials are nice . I 'm not sure if its hit and miss with Skechers or if this particular model has design deficiencies .
 I thought these shoes were a real find . They were comfortable , very sturdy looking , and cheap.One early concern , however , was that it really seemed that the shoes could use another eyelet . The heels slipped a bit on my feet . Even if I tightened the laces very tight , the heels would slip as the laces loosened a bit . -LRB- This is a problem that I have had with other `` utility '' shoes . That is , the soles are not so flexible , and as a result it is difficult to keep the heel from slipping . In my opinion , most of them need to have another eyelet . -RRB- I hoped that the shoe would become more flexible with some wear , and the problem would go away . But the problem did not go away . The shoes usually slip on my feet . And as a result of the slipping , the cloth lining on the inside of the shoe has worn away at the heel.But two other much bigger problems emerged with the shoes , problems that were a bit of a surprise.Problem # 1
 I guess my feet are a little wider than most , but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes . These are so tight I can not even wear them . I wear Converse Chuck Taylors all the time and they are snug , but these just hurt the moment I put them on . So if you have big feet , try these on in a store before ordering . Other than that they look like decent shoes , especially for the price .
 Lied about shipping time ! SHIPPING IS S-L-O-W !!!!!! The 3-5 business day shipping is a lie . After not getting my shoes on time from shoes.com I sent am inquiry email . They responded by saying the shoes should arrive in 5-7 business days . So when they want you to buy the shoes it 3-5 business days , but after you buy , 5-7 business days . I will be going to Zappos.com next time . It will be well over a week before I get my order .
 These shoes with the leather uppers are mandatory for my son 's school . After wearing them for three days , the leather was worn completely through the front . All the kids who wear these kids at school have the same problem . Very cheap leather and poor construction .
 I bought these for my husband to wear to work . He loved the fit -LRB- he has a very wide foot -RRB- and found these shoes to be comfy . I bought them because they were Skechers.He came home a couple of days ago and the leather has &#34; peeled &#34; off the top of one shoe and is beginning to peel off on the other . It 's very noticeable , as it is peeling off the toes ! They look horrible . Now , I need to find him another pair to wear to work . I wo n't buy any more Skechers !
 After only 3 months of non heavy-duty use , they have cracks on the top . Very disappointed in this , something you should n't see this early on . Will look for another brand next time I purchase something similar .
 I bought 2 pairs brown and black and the problem was the same . They did n't last for two months . Dont be fool and look for another one .
 the size is ok , it 's comfortable and everything is ok except for the finishing . I ordered the `` Brown '' one which does n't shine , and I got the shiny brown .
 looks nice , but i cant wear them without wearing 2 pairs of socks.cuts into the top of my foot and i literally have a cut on the area above my toes .
 Never wore them because they smelled like moth balls . The odor was so strong that my whole house started to smell like moth balls . Had to return them .

Now I need to go to the foot doctor because of the pain on my heels.I would NOT recommend this shoes for people who walk a lot at work or are on their feet for long periods of time .
 Purchased these shoes at the end of September . There are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use . I do n't subject them to a lot of wear and tear ; I work at a desk . This is the second straight pair of Skechers that have lasted me barely a month . Suffice it to say I will never purchase Skechers again .
 The day I got these , I put them on and pressed down with my thumb on top of the shoe ; I wanted to see how much toe-room I had -LRB- everyone does that , right ? -RRB- . My thumb created an indent , essentially caved-in part of the toe area that I still can not get to ` pop out ' . I bought these to replace a nearly identical pair of Skechers that I purchased in '04 that lasted 7 years ! These ones wo n't make it through one season . I question whether the Leather Upper is actually leather at all ! It feels like shiny cardboard .
 Unfortuately , while these Skechers oxfords are initially comfortable and appear rugged , the padded collar is constructed of a very thin , poor-quality leather . After just a few weeks of wear , the finish of the leather in the collar of these shoes cracked and then flaked off . Then the poor-quality leather in this area started to fall apart . So I had a pair of shoes that looked nearly brand new with the collar falling apart and the frayed leather rubbing on the back of my ankle . Also , the pull loop on the back tore after a short time due to the inferior leather . The interior lining is also a cheap , thin embossed cloth that wears quickly in the heel area . You may only get a few weeks of wear before these shoes start to deteriorate in these areas . Other reviewers have also commented on the poor-quality leather and rapid wear .
 My Skechers were very poorly built . I had to return them after wearing 6 times . I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have them replaced and they wo n't give me my money back to get different shoes .
 I purchased a pair of Sketchers Men 's Alley Cat Utility Oxford blacks and they wore out in less than four months . The heel collar is rubbing off and the rubber outsole is ripping apart from the inner leather sole resulting in the shoes flapping like a pair of flip-flops . The initial wearing of the shoe was painful , pinching at pressure points on the foot . After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably , but obviously not for very long . These shoes are an American company brand but are manufactured in China . Given the price and American name brand I expected a little more quality control . I am very disappointed !
 Bought these at a national chain . Wore the occasionally and was very careful with them . The leather bubbled and cracked in several places and the finish wore off the collar part of the shoe all within about 6 weeks . Really bad quality leather . They are good looking and comfortable but 6 weeks is ridiculous . I am very easy on my shoes and always get at least several years out of them . I even have a pair of Elkwoods hiking boots that I used to wear constantly and they are still fine after 10 years . My New Balance sneakers I wear almost every day and are 3 years old with a lot of wear on them I am just now about to replace them . So when these Skechers wore out in 6 weeks I was very upset . The sole look like brand new with no wear on them and now I have to throw them out . This will be the first time I have ever tossed out a pair of shoes with out wearing them out . What a waste of money . I recommend you find another brand . Timberland , Dr. Scholls , Dockers , all make similar shoes that may last longer .

 I 've bought this style and size of shoe many times before . These were at least a full size smaller than before and I had to return them . Though I asked for a replacement in a larger size I was given a refund and told to re-order . When I did that the price had increased by $ 11.34 . Bait & switch ?
 The labeled sizes on this model are incorrect . I 've been wearing Reebok Ex-O-Fit Lo 's for probably 15 years . I 've even bought them from Amazon before , although never the &#34; clean-label &#34; model specifically until now . I have several pairs from past purchases that are still new in the box , so I was able to directly compare the current version of the model with past versions . -LRB- I 've stocked up on them in case the line is completely discontinued ! -RRB- This version is much too small , at least a full size smaller than what is labeled . I can usually fit a 10.5 -LRB- US sizing -RRB- in my smaller foot for this general model , but with this particular version of the model 's sizing , I just barely fit 11.5 comfortably . The toe area also seems a little more tight generally -LRB- feels somewhat cramped , not just lengthwise -RRB- . Otherwise , the shoe seems to be very well made . I 've long wished there would be a version in which the Reebok label on the heel did n't stand out so prominently , so in that sense , the style of this version is an improvement .
 The process itself was fast , but the product was much too small.There was no indication that the sizes run small . So small , in fact , that I am filing a claim for a full refund .
 If you have any trouble with these shoes Sketchers will not stand behind their product . You will not be easily supported nor will you get a replacement/coupon/reimbursement for or towards another pair of shoes . I had a pair of sketchers that started falling apart after a week . The store would not take the worn shoes back and told me to contact Sketchers . So I did , and sent along pictures for their inspection . I was told that I would have to ship them in at my cost , with delivery confirmation because they are not responsible for packages and they would deem them to either be intentionally damaged or a manufacturing defect . Their Customer service reps are rude , and short and offered me no other options .

 When I received my Columbia 's , I was a little disappointed withthe overall fit . The front part of the sandal is really wide , and feels too bulky and big when I wear them . I prefer a more form fitting flip flop .

 Although pretty , these wedges are uncomfortable . the straps rub and the rubber soul came off after walking from my car to the office , Maybe 60 yards away . -LRB- in optimist mode -RRB- >> > I dont mind saving money but come on now ... the rubber soul came off . In front off the toe , I think its might be because I usually get the wedges that have a curved up toe . Dont know , Dont care it came off
 I absolutely loved these shoes , BUT the second time I wore them they tore where the side of the shoe attached to the top of the shoe . I liked them so much I was even going to buy a replacement pair , but they no longer have them in my size .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 I 'm usually ok with most of the pain that comes with heels . This bends the foot to an awkward form . The hole in the middle just cuts into my foot . It 's pretty though ... !!!

 While I have not tried the Eva sandals , we purchased a pair of Airwalk sandals from Payless Shoes after my Rainbow sandals finally broke after 3 or 4 years of use . Within 3 weeks they were coming apart , after 5 weeks the top layer is almost completely off and hurt my feet . I am gladly going back to Rainbows !

 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I have purchased speedo flip flops many times , these are awful . They are like what you buy in the dollar store , no arch support and a sole that catches and folds up under your toe . I do n't believe these are really speedo 's . Do n't buy .
 The pair I ordered was defective and I had to return them . The strap was placed to far back on the shoe bed , so it did n't fit the contour of my foot correctly . I 've since purchased this shoe elsewhere and I 'm very happy with it .
 I just received these reef sandals in the mail and was totally disappointed . First all they do not resemble any of the other reef sandals I have purchased , in look or quality . They look and feel cheap . Secondly , this is not a great price for them -LRB- $ 19.99 -RRB- , this is the sticker cost , I have since found out .
 Just got these and was so disappointed ! I 've loved reefs all my life and was so excited for this pair , but what came in the mail was not what I expected . I wear 7.5 , 8 tops and since they dont have half sized I got an 8 . What I got was a 6.5 or a 7 max . Although all the stickers say 8 . Not in this world ! Also , the tread is plasticy crap that 's slicker than socks . SHAMEE !!!
 I 've owned at least half a dozen pairs of these sandals over the years . Typically they are excellent . These , however , were much more flimsy and cheaper than my older pairs , and the bottom tread looks completely different compared to my others . They are also too small , even though I 've always worn the size I ordered . Either Reef has gone incredibly down hill , or these are fake shoes .
 The comfort of reef sandals are great -- i have owned several pairs but the metallic colors are plain ugly . oxy-moronic styling in a beach flip-flop . Amazon 's color selection is very limited -- these metallic colors and all black are the only choice . Reef has lots of additional colors -- would be great to see them offered on amazon .
 I wear 8.5 to size 9 . 9 's were an entire size too small . They do n't issue exchanges , by the time I would return them I 'd lose half of what I 'd paid in shipping costs , deducted and what I 'd have to pay to return . They feel pretty flimsy also !
 The big toe divider on these flip-flops were much too long for my small feet and I could n't keep them on my feet . I returned them . I also did n't like the curved sole -- which made walking harder .
 I bought these flip flops to wear at the health club pool . It appeared from the picture that the straps were stiff so I could slip them off and on easily . They are n't . The ` thong ' straps are fabric and they flop so that you have to use your fingers to situate the straps on your foot . Be fine if I was wearing them all day , but I 'm putting them on and taking them off and it 's annoying , especially when your feet are wet .
 The product is great ; but I got sent the wrong color . It was listed as black/blue and turned out to be black/purple and shiny silver . Someone must be color blind .
 I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them . I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material . It used to be dense rubber with some weight to it . The arches were what i loved the most and the durablity . The new material is lightweight and doesnt hold up well . The arches arent as good because the rubber is so soft . I wore them around the pool and they got a bit wet and I left them in the sun . When I returned the sole was acutally curled . I am so disappointed . I can only hope that they go back to using the old material or I will need to find another brand to replace them with .
 Ordered these for my daughter . She normally wears 7 1/2 - 8 Medium width . I ordered 8M for her . When she got these they were smaller than any of her 7 1/2 sandles and MUCH narrower . Totally unusable . Marking on the back was US 8 . NOT ! Also the quality , look , and feel was on par with the $ 3.99 stuff you see in Walmart , et al. . Not worth the trouble of returning . Amazon ... I trusted you and you let me down !!! Amazon should screen their suppliers better , are they trying to grow too fast ??? Reef - you need to watch your quality better - do n't lose your image just trying to make your quartlerly numbers . BTW - the label said `` made in Indonesia '' .
 I bought these flip flops to wear at the health club pool . It appeared from the picture that the straps were stiff so I could slip them off and on easily . They are n't . The ` thong ' straps are fabric and they flop so that you have to use your fingers to situate the straps on your foot . Be fine if I was wearing them all day , but I 'm putting them on and taking them off and it 's annoying , especially when your feet are wet .
 I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them . I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material .

 The product is great ; but I got sent the wrong color . It was listed as black/blue and turned out to be black/purple and shiny silver . Someone must be color blind .
 The comfort of reef sandals are great -- i have owned several pairs but the metallic colors are plain ugly . oxy-moronic styling in a beach flip-flop . Amazon 's color selection is very limited -- these metallic colors and all black are the only choice . Reef has lots of additional colors -- would be great to see them offered on amazon .
 Just got these and was so disappointed ! I 've loved reefs all my life and was so excited for this pair , but what came in the mail was not what I expected . I wear 7.5 , 8 tops and since they dont have half sized I got an 8 . What I got was a 6.5 or a 7 max . Although all the stickers say 8 . Not in this world ! Also , the tread is plasticy crap that 's slicker than socks . SHAMEE !!!
 I 've owned at least half a dozen pairs of these sandals over the years . Typically they are excellent . These , however , were much more flimsy and cheaper than my older pairs , and the bottom tread looks completely different compared to my others . They are also too small , even though I 've always worn the size I ordered . Either Reef has gone incredibly down hill , or these are fake shoes .
 I have purchased speedo flip flops many times , these are awful . They are like what you buy in the dollar store , no arch support and a sole that catches and folds up under your toe . I do n't believe these are really speedo 's . Do n't buy .
 The pair I ordered was defective and I had to return them . The strap was placed to far back on the shoe bed , so it did n't fit the contour of my foot correctly . I 've since purchased this shoe elsewhere and I 'm very happy with it .
 I just received these reef sandals in the mail and was totally disappointed . First all they do not resemble any of the other reef sandals I have purchased , in look or quality . They look and feel cheap . Secondly , this is not a great price for them -LRB- $ 19.99 -RRB- , this is the sticker cost , I have since found out .
 The big toe divider on these flip-flops were much too long for my small feet and I could n't keep them on my feet . I returned them . I also did n't like the curved sole -- which made walking harder .
 I wear 8.5 to size 9 . 9 's were an entire size too small . They do n't issue exchanges , by the time I would return them I 'd lose half of what I 'd paid in shipping costs , deducted and what I 'd have to pay to return . They feel pretty flimsy also !
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 First of all , I 'm Mary Graham , not Jessica Shoemaker . I 'd really like these shoes if the white part were black . Please make some of those shoes , all black , the way you used to .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 If you have any trouble with these shoes Sketchers will not stand behind their product . You will not be easily supported nor will you get a replacement/coupon/reimbursement for or towards another pair of shoes . I had a pair of sketchers that started falling apart after a week . The store would not take the worn shoes back and told me to contact Sketchers . So I did , and sent along pictures for their inspection . I was told that I would have to ship them in at my cost , with delivery confirmation because they are not responsible for packages and they would deem them to either be intentionally damaged or a manufacturing defect . Their Customer service reps are rude , and short and offered me no other options .

 It 's a cool and funky style , but it was too wide and bulky . I returned them .

Be fine if I was wearing them all day , but I 'm putting them on and taking them off and it 's annoying , especially when your feet are wet .
 Ordered these for my daughter . She normally wears 7 1/2 - 8 Medium width . I ordered 8M for her . When she got these they were smaller than any of her 7 1/2 sandles and MUCH narrower . Totally unusable . Marking on the back was US 8 . NOT ! Also the quality , look , and feel was on par with the $ 3.99 stuff you see in Walmart , et al. . Not worth the trouble of returning . Amazon ... I trusted you and you let me down !!! Amazon should screen their suppliers better , are they trying to grow too fast ??? Reef - you need to watch your quality better - do n't lose your image just trying to make your quartlerly numbers . BTW - the label said `` made in Indonesia '' .
 I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them . I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material . It used to be dense rubber with some weight to it . The arches were what i loved the most and the durablity . The new material is lightweight and doesnt hold up well . The arches arent as good because the rubber is so soft . I wore them around the pool and they got a bit wet and I left them in the sun . When I returned the sole was acutally curled . I am so disappointed . I can only hope that they go back to using the old material or I will need to find another brand to replace them with .
 I have purchased speedo flip flops many times , these are awful . They are like what you buy in the dollar store , no arch support and a sole that catches and folds up under your toe . I do n't believe these are really speedo 's . Do n't buy .
 The pair I ordered was defective and I had to return them . The strap was placed to far back on the shoe bed , so it did n't fit the contour of my foot correctly . I 've since purchased this shoe elsewhere and I 'm very happy with it .
 I just received these reef sandals in the mail and was totally disappointed . First all they do not resemble any of the other reef sandals I have purchased , in look or quality . They look and feel cheap . Secondly , this is not a great price for them -LRB- $ 19.99 -RRB- , this is the sticker cost , I have since found out .
 The comfort of reef sandals are great -- i have owned several pairs but the metallic colors are plain ugly . oxy-moronic styling in a beach flip-flop . Amazon 's color selection is very limited -- these metallic colors and all black are the only choice . Reef has lots of additional colors -- would be great to see them offered on amazon .
 Just got these and was so disappointed ! I 've loved reefs all my life and was so excited for this pair , but what came in the mail was not what I expected . I wear 7.5 , 8 tops and since they dont have half sized I got an 8 . What I got was a 6.5 or a 7 max . Although all the stickers say 8 . Not in this world ! Also , the tread is plasticy crap that 's slicker than socks . SHAMEE !!!
 I 've owned at least half a dozen pairs of these sandals over the years . Typically they are excellent . These , however , were much more flimsy and cheaper than my older pairs , and the bottom tread looks completely different compared to my others . They are also too small , even though I 've always worn the size I ordered . Either Reef has gone incredibly down hill , or these are fake shoes .
 The big toe divider on these flip-flops were much too long for my small feet and I could n't keep them on my feet . I returned them . I also did n't like the curved sole -- which made walking harder .
 I wear 8.5 to size 9 . 9 's were an entire size too small . They do n't issue exchanges , by the time I would return them I 'd lose half of what I 'd paid in shipping costs , deducted and what I 'd have to pay to return . They feel pretty flimsy also !
 If you have any trouble with these shoes Sketchers will not stand behind their product . You will not be easily supported nor will you get a replacement/coupon/reimbursement for or towards another pair of shoes . I had a pair of sketchers that started falling apart after a week . The store would not take the worn shoes back and told me to contact Sketchers . So I did , and sent along pictures for their inspection . I was told that I would have to ship them in at my cost , with delivery confirmation because they are not responsible for packages and they would deem them to either be intentionally damaged or a manufacturing defect . Their Customer service reps are rude , and short and offered me no other options .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 The product is great ; but I got sent the wrong color . It was listed as black/blue and turned out to be black/purple and shiny silver . Someone must be color blind .

 If you have any trouble with these shoes Sketchers will not stand behind their product .

 I always wear a 9 1/2 ... I had to send back for a 10 and by sending back cost me 12.95 and had to enclosed a check for 9.95 . . so besides my purchase cost me an extra twenty for the shoes . Its all Elite shoes . Nothing to do with Amazon . . Hope they are comfty .
 The picture does n't accurately show how shiny these shoes are . I wanted a fun looking bowling shoe , but these really do look ridiculous ! They do look like plastic shiny vinyl clown shoes . I felt that they had a really wide fit too , but ran short in the toe . They were really stiff when I tried to walk in them too . Buyer beware , if these shoes need to be returned you must pay shipping AND a 15 % restocking fee -LRB- which was not made clear at the time of purchase -RRB- If you need to buy bowling shoes online , I recommend Dicks Sporting Goods since they offer free shipping , free returns , and no restocking fee ... I wish I had .

 It was delivered at time . And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance ; however , it was n't . When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe , which is the reason why I bought it , the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance . Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons . Any way , the prodoct was n't the same value or quality of pumma 's shoes that I have bought in the past .

 These were the narrowest pair of D size shoes I have ever tried on . I do n't care how nice a shoe looks . If it do n't fit it just do n't fit .

You will not be easily supported nor will you get a replacement/coupon/reimbursement for or towards another pair of shoes . I had a pair of sketchers that started falling apart after a week . The store would not take the worn shoes back and told me to contact Sketchers . So I did , and sent along pictures for their inspection . I was told that I would have to ship them in at my cost , with delivery confirmation because they are not responsible for packages and they would deem them to either be intentionally damaged or a manufacturing defect . Their Customer service reps are rude , and short and offered me no other options .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 I was told that this was the fastest running shoe ever . But when I compared them to Nike 's models , they were clearly inferior.Overall -- slowest running shoe ever .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I ordered this product for a friend 's bday since I got these same boots and loved them . I waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them . Except it NEVER happened . I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago , I call amazon and they tell me to call macys . I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon . I 've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail . Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it 's been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order . Although now i 've told my friend she 's getting these boots and now she 's not . I 've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved . Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w / Aerosoles . I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again . WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now .
 I bought these boots after reading countless reviews of how comfortable they were . I was looking for a pair of cute , black suede wedges that I could wear during my commute and at work . These are not the right boots for that . First of all , your balance gets all thrown off in these boots - you feel like you 're teetering around on the balls of your feet . I 've seen other girls in the same boots and they all walk the same way , like they 're going to fall on their face any second . I added an inner sole to try and soften the pressure on the balls of my feet , but it did n't help much . Also , when I tried to waterproof them , one turned a funny , faded shade of black while the other one stayed normal , so that did n't help the situation . Cute boots , just totally uncomfortable and hard to walk in , and obviously not meant to be waterproofed .
 I wear a 6 1/2 in women shoes , with this shoe a 7 waas tight and the 7 1/2 was to big . Also I happen to be in a store in NYC and seen the same shoe for $ 19.00 what 's that about ?
 It looks cute in the picture but not in reality and not at all comfortable

 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .

 These shoes are too cute ! But even though I ordered a half size bigger than usual they were still too small . Order a whole size bigger . Overall very cute slides .

 My husband has worn Florsheim Imperials for 30 years . A typical pair for him lasts about 5 years and undergoes at least 3 resoles in that time with no problem . In less than 2 months , wearing them only 2-3 times per week , the sole on one shoe has split . We 've never seen such poor quality in a Florsheim shoe . Makes me wonder if the low cost found on Amazon means we were sold an irregular product to begin with . We have to have them repaired as he needs them right away and we can not wait for replacement process . Not an ideal situation on a $ 150 purchase .
 The sole on one shoe has delaminated twice since purchased . I was surprised since I had purchased this item before . Very disappointed .

 This is the third pair I have bought over the course of 5 + years . I order the brown/brown color.First pair was 5 stars , the next 4 stars . This one three stars
 I 've worn Timberlands of various kinds since the mid-1970s . They used to last seemingly forever , but a pair of boat shoes I bought in 2008 was worn through at the heels in a year , and my next pair was shot even worse after a few months , plus the inner soles decomposed in a matter of weeks . Both pairs , however , showed little wear on the upper leather , and the stitching remained intact . Unfortunately , excellent uppers on crummy soles still makes a crummy shoe . No more Timberlands for me .
 These shoes cost about $ 90 and Timberland can not even cough up the $ 2 to waterproof them . To add insult to injury , the footbeds are as thin as a piece of paper.One could buy Rockport , Nunn Bush , Florsheim , Deer Stags , etc. all for a lower price and all of them would be more comfortable and waterproofed !
 Fit is loose . Outer soul is very thin and flimsy . Looks cheap for this brand . I ended up buying a `` comparable '' shoe from Docker , that was much more comfortable , with far better looks and durability .
 This was my first time buying shoes online . I got the shoes + they were too big , I wore them about a day to see if I could get used to them , but I could n't because they were slipping off too much . I emailed Footsmart about this , informing them that I have wore them . They emailed me back saying go ahead and return them . So I paid for the postage + everything , but I did n't get the money back and they had the shoes for about a week now . So I contacted them again , now they are saying they ca n't give me a refund , because the shoes have been wored , but I stated that in the email . I ask for a supervisor to give me a call back -LRB- because the rep said she was n't able to help me with , that a supervisor would have to get involved -RRB- . That never happen , after me calling back four times , I demanded to speak to a supervisor , without having to wait . The supervisor pretty much told me that the email I had from them , saying that I could go a head and return them , was useless . That the rep that sent the email back to me , probably misunderstood me . I have it in writing that I can return them , so up the ladder we go . Be very careful ordering these shoes through .
 I have never had problems with shoes until I purchased these . A month after wearing the shoes , the front toe began to tear . I had to throw them away after a few months since they were hardly functional . They look cool ; however , they are n't very comfortable and they certainly do n't take wear well .
 Someone said the sizes run big . But these run small ! I 've been an 11.5 my whole life . And I 've warn pumas my whole life . Suddenly 11.5 is too small for me.I do n't think my feet have grown so be careful . I was really disappointed .
 Left shoe got a hole after 2 months . First time something like this happen to my Puma 's . Other ones were okay .

They used to last seemingly forever , but a pair of boat shoes I bought in 2008 was worn through at the heels in a year , and my next pair was shot even worse after a few months , plus the inner soles decomposed in a matter of weeks . Both pairs , however , showed little wear on the upper leather , and the stitching remained intact . Unfortunately , excellent uppers on crummy soles still makes a crummy shoe . No more Timberlands for me .
 These shoes cost about $ 90 and Timberland can not even cough up the $ 2 to waterproof them . To add insult to injury , the footbeds are as thin as a piece of paper.One could buy Rockport , Nunn Bush , Florsheim , Deer Stags , etc. all for a lower price and all of them would be more comfortable and waterproofed !
 Fit is loose . Outer soul is very thin and flimsy . Looks cheap for this brand . I ended up buying a `` comparable '' shoe from Docker , that was much more comfortable , with far better looks and durability .
 This was my first time buying shoes online . I got the shoes + they were too big , I wore them about a day to see if I could get used to them , but I could n't because they were slipping off too much . I emailed Footsmart about this , informing them that I have wore them . They emailed me back saying go ahead and return them . So I paid for the postage + everything , but I did n't get the money back and they had the shoes for about a week now . So I contacted them again , now they are saying they ca n't give me a refund , because the shoes have been wored , but I stated that in the email . I ask for a supervisor to give me a call back -LRB- because the rep said she was n't able to help me with , that a supervisor would have to get involved -RRB- . That never happen , after me calling back four times , I demanded to speak to a supervisor , without having to wait . The supervisor pretty much told me that the email I had from them , saying that I could go a head and return them , was useless . That the rep that sent the email back to me , probably misunderstood me . I have it in writing that I can return them , so up the ladder we go . Be very careful ordering these shoes through .

 I ordered this shoe and returned it . It was no way worth $ 200.00 . More like $ 50.00 . The workmanship was way below standard for a Charles David product . I have heard of price mark ups but this is totally crazy .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 I was tracking this product hardcore and on the day that was suppose to arrive , it did n't come . I was home all day , and nothing . I did n't receive any notes or anything , but the website said person was n't home , which is bull because I was home all day . I suppose that 's UPS 's fault though.The sneaker itself was n't what I expected . Yes it did look like what it was on the picture , but when I looked carefully , it looked like it was put together poorly . The top pieces of the sneaker , the plastic part with the lace holes were misaligned to the sneaker . Towards the toe , also misaligned pieces .

 Stacy Adams shoes are great and made in the USA . Unfortunately after ordering this shoe in a men 's size 11 , I received instead a child size 11 pair of green plastic shoes with alligator faces . Since the last time I had a problem with an order , Amazon told me to contact the seller , I did so and they insisted that we had ordered the green alligator shoes . After much discussion including sending our confirmation she contacted amazon and confirmed that I ordered the Stacy Adams . They had them in stock , but wanted to refund rather than send them at the low advertised price . I insisted that she send the correct shoes and she agreed . She sent us return labels and we imediately returned the shoes.we waited a week and called Amazon , the out of country call centers are a nightmare to work with . Even though I made it clear that we did not want a refund , Amazon agreed to a refund . I would have loved to have these shoes at the advertised price . Unfortunately this was a bait and switch . Amazon is losing a lot of good will by using these call centers that disregard what the customer says . I only wanted the shoes we ordered from a seller who had them in stock . Amazon was n't interested in making it good . That is sad . Any money Amazon might save in outsourcing is more than offset in loss of good will .

 It broke the first time I used it . I would not ever buy this product.i thought for what I paid for this it would last .
 My feet are an 8 1/2 wide , these boots are made in China and the with is smaller than any other boots I have ever ordered . The next time I will do alittle more digging before I buy .
 the boots were ok . nice looking , with the seems sturdy and well made . at least for the one I was given . the only problem that I had was the fit . I ordered extra wide but the extra wide was more for a regular fit . so I was very upset . I would recommend that anyone do more research and not get persueded on price .
 The first thing I noticed about these `` bargain '' boots is that the unlined shaft has no foldover hem at the top , like every other pair of harness or engineer boots I 've worn -LRB- about a dozen pairs -RRB-

 Love the look of this shoe , and normally this brand , but this flat is very small and very narrow !! I wear a 9.5 , but I ordered this in size 10 . Even the 10 was at least an inch too short and felt very narrow . Unfortunately I had to return them .

 I ordered my usual shoe size . It was too short and very narrow . I tried to return it , now I have no shoe , and no credit - I was told it was never received back . Very disappointing .

 Does not produce results as expected . I have had better , not sharp Would have expected more from Martha Stewart . Sorry
 I was very excited about receiving these Crocs , until I was sent two left feet in the mail . What a disappointment ! If it was n't for having to return them , I may have enjoyed these as they felt comfortable -LRB- on the one foot -RRB- and are not as bulky as the original model of Crocs .
 material looked faded -LRB- definitely not as deep of a black as picture and felt stretched out . Also right shoe straps keep coming unclipped which is very annoying .
 These crocs are too narrow for my feet , I have another size 8 pair and they are wider , what 's UP ? The seller did not say they were a narrow size .
 I 've been trying to wear these maryjane croc during the summer months for the past 3 years . I am finally giving them up as worthless for me . Before I explain what has not worked I will say that Crocs are great indoor/outdoor messy chore shoes being protective of my toes , waterproof and easily cleaned . Because they 're cushiony and easy on/off -LRB- especially with the heel strap removed -RRB- I liked to wear them as house shoes . For this use , I was content with the style since I wear a womens size 10 and the the maryjane is definitely less bulky than clog style.Unfortunately , if I wear these shoes any extended length of time for walking or standing such as grocery shopping , cooking and washing dishes , etc. . I end up with aching feet . I mean painful ! As shock absorbing as they seem to be , I guess the support is just not there . It 's not like they 're flat either , they have some built in arch . I never had this problem with my feet with any other sandal or flip-flop before . Not sure if that 's coinciding with the onset of middle age and being more susceptible to plantar fasciitis or the fact that I tried to wear these shoes alot because of their benefits . Another drawback I tolerated for too long is that the bottom of this shoe tends to `` grab '' on a hard or tile floor and can cause a trip or fall while walking . Definitely annoying if not dangerous!I 'm sure the plastic they 're made of will last forever , so I feel really guilty about putting them in trash , but for me the cons of crocs outweigh the pros .
 I BOUGHT A PAIR OF THE MARY JANE STYLE HOPING THE STRAP WOULD HOLD THEM ON MY FEET.THEY STAY ON BUT THEY LOOK RIDICULOUS . I HAVE AN A2 FOOT AND THESE CROCS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE PERSON WITH LESS THAN A MEDIUM OR WIDE SIZE FOOT . TOO BAD FOR ME AS I WOULD BUY SEVERAL COLORS . OH WELL - I TRIED .
 Mary Jane Crocs showed up with a torn strap and when I went to send back and re-order , none were available in the size and color I wanted . was refunded money with shipping costs .
 I Loved these shoes sooooo much when they arrived that I turned around and bought another pair . Then she wore them . Nuf said ! The entire front -LRB- toe area -RRB- is actually painted on so the paint wears off immediately . I mean , she wore them one time and I would never put them on her feet again . They look like they are 10 years old and she wore them once . I was sooooo dissapointed because they are sooooo cute !
 I purchased this Easy Spirit shoe expecting a nice comfy shoes but was totally disappointed . I wore it a couple of times for work and could barely walk after a few hours . I got a medium/wide fit but it was very tight in the front squeezing my hammer toes . It looked nice but did not provide any comfort at all ...
 The water shoes wore blisters on my daughter 's heels after the first wear . No thanks !
 She has worn water shoes multiple times in the past , these rubbed her poor little feet raw in one day .
 After reading the reviews , I bought my 2 yr old a size 5 . Didnt want to get them too big . They are difficult to get on , and I had to cut the elastic . the sole is right , its the mesh around it that is too tight . I like the cheaper Kmart style water shoes MUCH better . and they are half the price !!! dislike !
 These shoes are super cute , and I was excited to get them today ... a few days and we are off to the Bahamas . One problem THEY ARE HUGE !!! My 2 year old son wears an 8 so I ordered the 8/9 . They are a good 2 , 2 1/2 inches too long . Hoping we can do an exchange before we leave .
 The sizing chart indicated that a size 5 Toddler is 4.75 inches long . However , when I ordered these , the 5T size was longer than 6 inches . I had to return the shoe , because it was too big for my toddler.Do not trust the sizing chart on the shoe . The shoe itself looks nice , but unfortunately , I didnt get to try it out on my child .
 I bought two different pairs to see if the first one was defective but its the way the shoe is made . The right shoe will give your child blisters because the inside stitching indents into the left side of the right foot causing the skin to rub against it and causing blisters . Weird how the left side is perfectly fine and doesnt touch the skin !! Do not buy !!!!!
 These shoes are cute and seemed to fit well , but the seam and tag in the insole left blisters on both of my two-year-old 's feet ! I 've returned them and am ordering some from a different brand .
 Got S for my 14 months old , who wears size 5 or 5.5 wide right now and L for my almost 4 year old , who wears 8.5 or 9 . Initially , they were just using the shoes during daycare splash days and the teachers all liked them ... However , when we took them to a water park and experienced them ourselves , we did not like the shoes at all.For my 14 months old , she got a wide feet and we find it very difficult to put the shoes on . Took us a few tries to find ticks to get her feet in without getting her little toe caught and bend backwards , causing her to scream and kick.My 4 year old shoes was easy to put on but it was a little big . Got about 1 finger size room ... After two days at water park , we find both kids got blisters on their right feet -LRB- both right handed kids -RRB- . The blisters are in the arch , which is a odd place to get one.My older one was n't as bad , probably because her shoes was bigger . My 14 months old shoes was a good fit , but her blister was a bad one.I think the shoes are good for 1 to 2 hrs use , maybe to and from the swimming pool but not one that wears while playing in the water .
 I was hesitant about buying running shoes w/o trying them on first or getting fitted , but these were true to size and oh so comfortable . You really can feel the difference . Their return policy -LRB- 60 days , used -RRB- also reassured me that if they did not work out , I was n't stuck with them . * UPDATE * I 've had the shoes for a few months now -LRB- well passed the 60 day return period -RRB- and the rubber at the bottom is starting to become unglued -LRB- towards the sides of the shoes -RRB- . I most definitely do n't run everyday so this is quite disappointing to see happen already . Substracting some stars ...
 First , I have to admit the shoes look gorgeous . That is why I ordered them and gave 2 stars here . But it is so difficult for me to walk because the wedge heels lack elasticity so for every step the shoes would slip off the heels of my feet . I kind of feel myself like an acrobat on these high wedge heels . Have to return them although they look beautiful .
 The shoes are great looking , but the heels are very heavy . The style of the top of the shoes is flattering , however , there is nothing to help keep the shoes on my feet . There is no flexability to the heel at all , so when my foot bends ... the heel stays down and I walked right out of the shoes . I do n't care for ankle straps , but I think this shoe needs something . I usually LOVE the comfort of Nine West shoes , so I was disappointed .
 Looks can be deceiving ! This shoe is so cute and stylish , but it hurts my foot like crazy . I used shoe stretch , asked my daughter to walk in them , hoping for some kind of relief . The sole is hard an does not bend making me walk very strange and uncomfortable . NOT a walking shoe , but if you want to sit and be cute , nice shoe ! Sorry Nine West .
 I bought this show after having my child 's foot measured . He wore it once and his big toe blistered up about double in size from rubbing the inside of the hard shell-top of this shoe . Dad did n't learn his lesson the first time and bought the same shoe a few months later in a larger size of course and the same thing happened again . My advice , buy shoes made for children and not miniature adult shoes .

 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 These slippers smell like a bad car air freshener . I could feel myself getting a sore throat a few minutes after taking them out of the box . I put them on the porch over night . No help . And they did feel small , as others have mentioned . Perhaps they would stretch to a comfortable fit , but by then the toxic fragrance would have killed me . USPS charged me nearly $ 10 -LRB- which Amazon generously refunded -RRB- to return this hideous footwear . I finally found some great slippers locally .
 I got these slippers to relax and walk around the house on my days off and when I got them they are sooo skinny !!!!! I had ordered them in a size bigger like the one review said and I have narrow feet so I ordered them in regular width . When I got them they were too big and so dang skinny my foot felt like it had a headache . Anyway I returned them -LRB- had to pay for the shipping back MYSELF & 12 . -RRB- to exchange it for my right size and the extra wide width . The slippers came size fits fine but even the width on the extra wide one is still dang skinny ! It feels the excact same !! The only thing that was a plus was the color and the bottom of the slipper . Very thick rubber and I would think they would last a long time but who cares if you hate the feel of the slipper !!!!
 It 's tough to find ankle slippers , so I had high hopes for these . They fit great , and feel fine . I 'd be delighted , except they really smell bad , right out of the box . It 's a heavy sweet fake-vanilla smell that comes from the soles . I 'm not sure if someone thought that perfumed slippers was a good idea , or if it 's some other chemical . I 've tried airing them out , rinsing , washing , whatever . Nothing will get rid of the smell , so I 'm probably going to have to return them .
 Purchased these for my dad . We both wear 9-9 .5 D.I ordered 10E . These are not an E width.Returning for 11E .
 These sneakers feel good and are warm . However , I 'm very concerned with the materials and checmicals their made from . With the many disasterous products coming out of China . I have never smelt anything like this and its still so strong , months after my purchase . How might we have this tested ??
 these slippers fit like a size smaller , they run very short and narrow . tried to wear them to see if they would stretch but they didnt .
 They have a very narrow toe area and my instep is to high for the opening . I was scared of tearing the stitching out putting them on .
 I wear a size 10.5 so ordered an 11 figuring a slipper needed to be a little roomy . With a sock on I could not get my foot into the top of the slipper and even with my sock off , the slipper felt tight . So my suggestion is to either buy a full size plus larger and hope the top stretches out so you can get them on in the first place or find another style that has a larger opening at the top for your foot .
 I bought those based on reviews about a month ago . I wore them 5 or 56 times and the plastic sole started falling apart . If you dont mind vacuuming your house after you wore them , than those are the right slippers for you ... Any rating above 3 must be from someone working for the company that makes/sales them ...
 Followed recommendations from this site and ordered slippers a full size bigger than my shoe size . They were marked the size I ordered , but were so tight I could not put them on for fear of tearing them . Unless they are intended for foot torture , they are not properly sized by at least two sizes . The quality is no better than what you can find at Walmart for half the price . I returned them and had to eat the $ 9 postage . Despite the amount of feedback to the vendor regarding this problem , they have not corrected their marketing information . I do n't recommend this product .
 These slippers were miss-sized . They are supposed to be a size 12 , but they are closer to 10-11 . I purchased these for my husband for Christmas and he could not wear them . He has the same exact slippers purchased years ago , and they are a size 12 . I had to return these slippers because they did not fit.Sincerely , Norma
 Bought these for my grown son for a gift . He wore them a week , and the pull on tabs on the heel broke off . Very hard to get feet into . Not worth what I paid for them.His ten dollar slippers from Walmart were a better value .
 Even ordering a full size larger , there is no way you can easily put these slippers on . The opening is just not big enough ! Not at all like other Tamarac slippers we have purchased .
 The look and feel of the slipper is nice , but it 's nearly impossible to get on a man 's foot . The ankle-high opening is cut much too tight .
 My teen son bought these for me at Christmas because of the affordable price . I returned them mainly due to them seeming to be at least 2 sizes smaller than labeled , but there were also a couple other issues . First , the bottom was extremely slippery -LRB- pun intended -RRB- . Maybe this would improve with wear -LRB- like outside on concrete -RRB- , but I nearly killed myself a couple of times on our tile floor . Second , the tag for the slippers sits squarely in the middle of where your foot sits inside the shoe . I could feel it clearly , even with socks on . I would have needed to cut this tag out if I had not returned them due to the size problem .
 Too difficult to get on even though stated size is two sizes larger than my previous slippers . Once on size is just adequate
 I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly . I have extra wide feet , so I was hoping these would be wide . They were NOT at all . Maybe a medium width , but more like narrow . Too bad . I wish I could find shoes that work . I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress , but wo n't look like one without the proper shoes .
 I bought this shoe for use working in a theatre . After a few months I had to have it re-heeled , and then shortly after the heel broke right off , causing me to fall down the stairs . I 'd beware of this shoe , not made well at all .
 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 I really like these shoes , I 've worn them before . I ordered one size a different size was sent . I think it was a problem with the ordering system , and told the company that . The company promptly returned my money but did not refund the return shipping . Wo n't order from them anymore

 This purse is super cute . That 's where it ends though . I used the bag once , did n't over fill it , just a few evening essentials and came away with pink hands -LRB- the dye from the sequins rubbed off on my hands -RRB- and seams -LRB- where the handles are attached -RRB- coming undone . Find a cuter bag some place else !
 I purchased this bag for our daughter . It was a little pricey for dress-up play , but if it did n't fall apart so easily I 'd say it is worth it -LRB- she loves it -RRB- . It was falling apart when it arrived , but I could n't get a replacement from Amazon so I had it repaired . It has since broken again twice , due to a flaw in its design . The bag is attached to the handle with thread -LRB- it is sewn into holes in the metal handle/frame -RRB- and when the metal rubs against the thread it cuts it just like a knife . It 's a poor design , plain and simple . If you buy it , expect to repair it .

 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 I was so excited to get these shoes to wear in a wedding , but I had to return them ! The toe was way too big and too pointy . Plus there is not enough shoe to hold on the foot . I thought , a night of dancing and walking at a wedding , it is not going to work . I think if you have very narrow and pointy feet , then these will work for you , but if not , do n't waste your time ...

 I love Vaneli and I 've been wearing them for years . These are wonderfully comfortable and chic looking shoes . The style really makes an outfit pop!They are available either online or at Marmi Shoes . I loved these shoes the moment I laid eyes on them.However , this is the first time I have had a problem with any of their shoes . The colorful buttons applied to the shoes are glued on rather than stitched on like Vaneli 's of old.I wore them out to dinner and by the time I got home I had buttons missing from each shoe . Mind you I just sat and had cocktails and nibbles . I did n't move my feet other than to sit , stand , and walk to the little girls room.These wonderful Italian shoes are no longer produced in Italy , but China -- and it shows . I 've compared my older Vaneli 's -LRB- 73 pairs -RRB- to my new Vaneli 's and there is a significant difference.The sole is cheap leather rather than the thick durable leather found in their early versions . The sandal straps on the new Vaneli 's are sown under the liner rather than at the foundation . Making them easier to break.I 'm very disappointed . These were no sale item . I paid full retail .
 These shoes are very cute and are very high quality , however there is absolutely no padding on the shoe . Very uncomfortable when you walk . I returned them because I could n't imagine wearing them for a long period of time .
 I have been wearing Vaneli shoes for many years . . Own many pair . . purchased the Vaneli Bice Slide approx . 1 - 2 months ago and they are already pulling apart around the mesh binding . I have really enjoyed the shoes and was going to purchase in several colors . . but not now !!! Very Very Disappointed .
 They are not comfortable at all really do n't like them . If I knew how to send them back I would .
 The shoes were very uncomfortable , hard , blistered my feet . And i discovered that the shoes of the same size and make are do not fit the same , maybe i should have bought them from a store . Never again
 I bought the brown oiled leather Dansko 's for a vacation to the UK and returned them promptly after getting back home to the US . I thought since I 've heard great things about these shoes and since Danskos are so ugly , they have to be comfortable . I was totally wrong !! These shoes proved to be the absolute worst choice in footwear for European travel and for those that have low arches!The Dansko 's work great for people with high arches , but I felt like I had a river rock jammed in my arch and the aftermath left me with intense pain in my arches and heels days after switching to my Crocs for the remainder of my vacation.The Danskos also have a thick , stiff arch which is a disaster when walking on uneven pavement or cobblestone as the shoe does n't give . I rolled my ankle countless times while walking on cobblestone and ended up with a mild sprained ankle on the first day of my vacation . I have very strong ankles , excellent balance -LRB- I 'm a yoga instructor -RRB- , and I 'm a lightweight so I 'm not the type of person that takes a step wrong or prone to rolled ankles.Last time I vacationed in Europe , I wore $ 20 clog Crocs and walked 10 + miles everyday without experiencing any problems over the cobblestone . I do n't think I 'll experiment with other shoes such as Danskos for the next vacation I take .
 I was so excited to finally purchase a pair of Dansko 's but I 've tried on clogs before and they always seem to run small . Given that information I went ahead and ordered a size larger than I normally would have . I wear a standard size 10 in US Women 's shoes , I ordered a size 11.5 US -LRB- 42 EU -RRB- in these and there is no way they are this size . I also have several pairs of Birkenstock shoes at size 41 that are longer than these . I wondered if perhaps they sent the wrong size in the box , but it is stamped quite clearly on the bottom of the shoe size 42 EU . It simply is not possible for me to fit my smaller foot -LRB- my left foot is smaller by about half a size -RRB- into these shoes . I am so disappointed as I really was looking forward to having my first pair of Dansko shoes that I 'd heard so many great recommendations on . It is my opinion that at the larger sizes these shoes run very small . I think perhaps one size larger may fit , however I still have n't decided if I 'm going to try a larger size . If I do , I will update my review with how that turns out .
 I seriously am not understanding the positive reviews on these shoes , but I fell for them and now I 'm sitting here with sore feet . I think some of the problems are unique to my situation while others could possibly be more universal , i.e. something for everyone to consider when thinking of dropping $ 100 + on these shoes . I 'll break the review down into `` universal '' and `` unique '' issues.Universal : - The bottom , i.e. insole , is hard . Maybe if this were n't the case , these shoes would be less painful for me . There just is not cushioning on the inside . I do n't get it . How are these shoes comfortable to anyone with no cushioning , and why do n't they have any ? - These shoes seem to come at least a size or half a size smaller than normal . This makes it difficult to reliably order online , and I am glad I did actually go to a store and try shoes on . Originally , I had called the store up to get the plain Dansko professional leather shoes set aside for me to pick up , told them my size and they held them for me . I got to the store , and those shoes were just too small and uncomfortable . Went a size up , and still ... could barely get my left foot in the shoe -LRB- my left foot is slightly larger than my right foot -RRB- . I asked if they had any Danskos not leathered and they said no ... leather , to me , makes shoes less comfortable because leather is more rigid , harder to stretch out and such . The salesman suggested the oiled Danskos , and they did work better ... but still felt a little too small , even a size up , particularly on the left foot . The salesman stretched out the left shoe , and it eventually felt doable , though not the most comfortable . But I 'd read there was a break-in period , so I went with it . Um , it seems like every time I take the shoes off and put them back on again , they have gone back to being as uncomfortable as the first time I put them on , i.e. they just do n't seem to `` break in . '' At least not quickly , i.e. within a week.Unique -LRB- and these things , as well as some positives about the shoes , are why I give 2 stars and not one -RRB- : - The shoe is uncomfortable , sometimes painful , across the top of my feet , particularly my left -LRB- larger -RRB- foot . I 've seen others say this , too , but I admit to having big , wide feet . I do not have little dainty women feet . I maybe should have asked for the men 's Danskos ... honestly , I do order men 's shoes at times because I have big feet and it 's hard to find women 's shoes in my size at times . But because I had to go up a size with these shoes , I ended up getting the largest size they come in for women ... and I feel like that size is still actually too small for me . It 's actually a little difficult for me to even get my left foot in the shoe , depending on the kind of socks I 'm wearing . Maybe if I could have gotten a better fit for these shoes , they 'd be more comfortable . With the shoes being not quite the right fit , I ca n't really even get cushion-y inserts into them that do n't make the shoes even more uncomfortable . Something to keep in mind for women with big feet.-The shoes are generally fine for about 3 hours or so , but then they start getting more and more intolerable . I work a job where I basically STAND in the SAME SPOT for 8 hours . Most reviews , if not all , I see on these shoes where people are being positive ... are from people who probably are walking and moving about for hours and hours . I do think these shoes are more comfortable when I 'm on the move , though I 'm still not sure I 'd be able to say , if I moved in these for 8-12 hours , things like I see other people writing , i.e. `` my feet feel as good as they did when I first put them on 12 hours ago . '' I really doubt it , especially with , again , the rigid leather material and the hard insole . But I ca n't at all say they feel as good as 8-9 hours before work , with a job where I stand . Again , 3 hours is the ultimate for me . 7 hours in , my feel are hurting to the point where it 's tough for me to concentrate , and all I do is think of excuses I can make in order to sneak off and sit down somewhere . One day , I actually changed out of these shoes and finished my shift in regular shoes because it was so uncomfortable . I have gotten to the point where I take the shoes off regularly during my shift and just stand in my socks/try to stretch out the muscles in my feet . Keep this in mind if you have to stand for hours and hours , and are considering these shoes.-I pretty much always feel as if I 'm going to fall when I wear these shoes . It 's not really the issue others have mentioned , i.e. the heel bouncing up and down in the shoes . It 's how they feel like high heels . If you 're not used to wearing heels ... I 'm finding it just odd . I feel like I do n't have control of my own balance.-I think it might also be important to note that I 'm overweight . It might very well be the case that neither these shoes nor any other are going to help anyone who is putting a lot of weight on their feet for a long time.Positives-With every other kind of shoe , my feet are not the only thing hurting at the end of the day . My back , my legs , even below my stomach area all hurt . I do n't get that with these shoes -- nothing hurts but my feet when I wear these shoes.-I feel completely debilitated after work with other shoes , i.e. I can barely stand or walk for hours after work . With these shoes , my feet do hurt bad after work -LRB- for hours -RRB- , but I can still manage to get around ... I just would rather not ...
 I love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel . I get great arch support and there is plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around . They are fantastic for long hours on your feet.BUT , they are terrible for my ankles . When I wear these shoes I roll my ankles all the time and have fallen a couple of times . They are especially bad for me in a hospital setting where there are cords and such that I risk stepping on . I am also afraid to walk/run in them because I am afraid I will wipe out and fall down.I really want to love these , but I feel that the base of the sole needs to be a bit wider for stability .
 I just recently purchased a pair of the Dansko professional oiled leather clogs . When they arrived I tried them on , it was difficult to get them on they felt a full size smaller . The feel was stiff and hard not comfortable at all.I have a pair that I purchased in 1997 that were the same size as the new pair that fit perfectly and oh so comfortable.I put the 2 pairs together and it was quite obvious the new pair was a few inches shorter.I contacted Dansko and spoke with 2 different representatives who really had no explanation and suggested that I just return them and exchange them.My concern is was it that particular pair or has the sizing changed.I decided to do some research and have read that the new clogs are manufactured in China and the quality is not the same . I checked inside the shoe and it is printed made in China.I think my best bet is to return them .
 the clogs would have great if they were the correct color and came on time . I paid for expedited shipping and should have gotten them in 3 days . It took over a week and they were the wrong color . The shoe company was very nasty and refused to refund my shipping , and when i returned the shoes , they refused to give me a credit , claiming they never got them . UPS sent me the name of the person who signed for them at their store !!! This company is horrible , I would never order from them again . The seller was Shoes Central . Do n't order from them , they are awful . I would give them zero stars but that is not an option
 I have heard nothing but good things about these shoes but when I bought a pair and put them on , I just could n't stand them . I bought a half size larger because I have a wider foot but they just dug into my instep like a torture device . Perhaps they are only for people with narrow feet and low insteps .
 I have bought white pair few years ago and loved it so much I wanted another pair . However , I have recently tried 3 new pairs of Dansko clogs -LRB- all dark colors -RRB- and they all dye my socks . They are extremelly comfortable but I hated to see my white socks dyed after few hours of wearing the clogs . I returned the shoes -LRB- black and blueberry colors -RRB- and ended up with Dansko Nubuck in light blue . The inside is light brown . That too does dye my socks , but at least it is not black.It is still the most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned , but be ready to see your white socks black .
 I have n't even received my order and am furious with Amazon ! I was charged twice for my order by Amazon and when I called Customer Service I was told the first charge was a pre-authorization and I should contact my bank about getting it credited back . So I did call my bank and was told that if Amazon would send a fax explaining what had happened the bank would credit my account for the $ 99.99 . I again spoke to an Amazon Customer Service rep and was told they could submit my request to billing but it would take at least 3 days for my request to be processed . Word of wisdom
 I have worn Dansko 's for over 20 years and never had any problems . They have always been my favorite most comfortable shoes and well worth the cost . In the last year I have had 3 pairs of Dansko 's less than 3 years old fall apart suddenly . It is like the soles just disintergrated . I store my shoes in boxes w / silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated . I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly . I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also . I gather Dansko has changed the material for the soles in the last few years and it is common for this `` dryrot '' issue to occur .
 I bought this for my wife . I ordered brown , and I received old brown.She is a surgeon and needed to replace the previous right away . Because she needed the clogs NOW , and she could n't afford to wait another week for a replacement , she will be stuck with the wrong pair for a while .
 Do n't buy these from Amazon . My wifes pair arrived packaged nicely in the original box but it was clear that the shoes had been worn before . The leather on the left shoe was stretched by someone walking in them and they missed a spot when they wiped off the bottom . White is a hard color to clean dirt from so it was obvious . There was also a nice sweat/dirt line just inside the left shoe . If this pair would have been offered at a shoe store I would have asked for a different pair or a discount . I will no longer trust Amazon for a new shoe purchase .
 I can not see if `` made in China '' is stenciled in the upper and there is no serial number , but the shoes I bought from Footsmart could n't cut an 8 hour shift . I wore them around the house the day they came in the mail and they seemed fine , but after I wore them the following day at my busy waitress job , I felt crippled . The stitching around the sides dug into my feet and worse , the ball of my right foot is still sore 30 hours after having taken them off and my toes on that foot are still numb . I ca n't believe these are the same Dansko shoes so many rave about and just maybe they are not . After one wearing , they would not allow me to return them nor would they send me a different right shoe . Now I 'm just $ 100 poorer and have a pair of shoes I will never wear again in my closet . Great . My suggestion is that you buy Dansko 's from a company that takes returns in the event it does n't work out for you . I wish I had .
 I decided to get a pair of Dansko clogs because I 've heard and read so much about them , and I do have significant foot problems , which limits the kinds of shoes I can wear . This basic model comes in a narrow , and it fits my foot well , as described . I like the way it rolls forward as you walk . The shoe has a bit of a platform bottom , so it puts you up a little higher than `` flats '' . I thought it was a nice change from my usual Birkenstocks and sneakers . I am leery about rolling an ankle in them , as many have reported , though , as I am a bit accident - prone . I was also leery about the hard foot bed , and my foot did seem sore after wearing them off and on . But my foot problems also can be off and on -LRB- but REALLY on when wearing the wrong type of shoes -RRB- . Overall I liked the look and feel of the shoe pretty well , and really wanted to love them . But after wearing them on a long day with a lot of errands , my soles were so extremely painful that I had to put lidocaine patches on them and take pain meds . So disappointed . The fit is good , and I ca n't get my orthotics into them . Maybe there 's a thin insert that would help ... suggestions ? Apparently my case is unusual , but I would like to see Dansko either 1 . Offer a `` soft footbed '' version , as Birkenstock does for some of its styles , or 2 . Make the insole removable , in case customers want to use their own custom orthotics.Meanwhile , I strongly recommend that if you have foot problems -LRB- mine are plantar fasciitis and tendonitis , aggravated by lupus -RRB- , and you want to try these clogs , do wear them around your house as much as you can for a couple of days , and see how your feet feel , before you decide whether to keep or return them . I wish I had known this , it would have saved me a lot of money and pain , so I Hope this helps someone ! -LRB- actually , this item IS available ; do n't know why it is listed as `` not available . -RRB-
 I bought the Dansko Pro in a wide width because I needed a great pair of sturdy , comfortable shoes to work in . I have owned another pair in the past and was really happy with them , so I did n't even question my decision to order this shoe . No place in my area carries this brand , and the closest place does n't carry the wide width , so I ordered them online . Big mistake on my part!One shoe fits great but is n't nearly as comfortable as my other pair had been , but the other shoe barely fits . It 's really tight all the way around and makes my foot go numb . I realize that they 're handmade , but there should be some way for the company to ensure that both shoes are made similarly enough that they can actually fit as a pair . I was so disappointed that I had spent so much money on a pair of shoes I ca n't wear , for multiple reasons . I had to buy a different pair of shoes and they 're more comfortable , but I still have n't found any that offer what I 'm looking for or what my first pair of Dansko shoes did .
 SanFran Jo says : I , too , noticed a difference in fit and also that the pair I recently purchased was made in China . I had to return my pair because they were not comfortable . I already have two other pair of Dansko Professional clogs , and they are very comfortable . I am disappointed in the comfort of the most recent pair I purchased . I have noticed that some of the clogs do say by Danita . Thanks to happy mommy mentioning Sanita , I googled Sanita clogs . Below is a statement found online from the Original Clogs website : For the last 17 years , all Dansko Professional clogs and all Dansko Stapled Clogs have been manufactured by Sanita in Europe . The relationship between Dansko and Sanita ended in August 2007 . Since then , Sanita entered the US market and is now distributing their products directly . If you are looking for the Original stapled clogs with patent number 0060240 stamped on the bottom -LRB- made by Sanita exclusively -RRB- , then look no further as our website features Sanita Clogs ' products exclusively.I ordered the `` original '' clogs by Sanita and they fit as comfortably as the two other pair I have . The number mentioned above is stamped on the bottom .
 first off for $ 120.00 there should not even be any vinyl on them but the plastic vinyl covering the piping is coming off after 1 month of use so i will need to use a black marker to hide it dansko was great till they left sanita now they are cheaply made in china , hungry , italy , and they dont even fit these are some of the problems i have found over the last 3 months i have tried aprox 50 pairs of dansko cabrio professional i should be waring a 37 -LRB- us size 7 -RRB- but now i cant , i need a 38 and most of the 38 are too small also 1 shoe bigger than the other in some pairs the left is tight and the right shoe feels great and in some pairs the right is too tight and the left feels great then after of 3 months and 50 pairs of trying on the pair i did keep the VINYL piping is coming off dansko is no longer good i will now only buy sanita COME ON DANSKO YOU ARE TAKING THE CHEEP AND EASY and you soon will loose customers
 2 consecutive blow outs of the Dansko oiled Cutter style shoes . The first pair split one of the soles at 10 months of use . This was in July of 2009 . Took them back to the store where they were purchased and they sent them back to Dansko to see if they would honor a replacement . They did , although the process took 4 months before I got the replacement pair . Fast forward to last Sept 3 2010 . After less than 9 months of usage one of the soles on the replacement pair not only split completely across the sole but separated on both sides . Plenty of usable tread on the soles so they were not worn out at all . So of course I take them back to the store they came from . Manager of the store calls me today and says they can not help me because now Dansko only has a 6 month warranty on failures and I have to contact them on my own . I 'll see what happens . Dansko = ExpensivePoorly made in China .6 Month warrantyEPIC FAIL !
 Dansko 's quality has continually declined since their split with Sanita a few years back in 2007 . Sanita made the Dansko clogs for years until Dansko went their separate way and decided to produce their clog elsewhere , so now Dansko 's are now made in China , whereas Sanita 's are still made in Europe . The quality difference is VERY evident.Not realizing that Dansko was n't held to the same standard as it used to be I ordered a Dansko professional and the professional XP as well . They were so clunky , huge and heavy , I felt like a child wearing my dad 's shoes !! Plus the sizes on the Dansko 's were so inconsistent I was n't able to find a size that fit , even when I went to the Walking company store and tried on several different pairs of the same size , one 38 was almost right , the next was way too tight , one 39 was way to wide , the next just plain huge in every way.Dansko will accredit it to the hand made feature but those of us who have been wearing hand made clogs for some time can attest to the fact that it is so much more than that , Dansko is just not the same shoe that made it famous in the first place . Now it 's just poor quality . I wear a 7.5 US , sometimes an 8 which put me perfectly in a size 38 . Whereas a 38 used to fit me perfectly now they are too short and my big toe smashes every so slightly up against the end to the shoe when I take a step , well no biggie , I 'll just order up one size . So i ordered the 39 which was so huge it flopped off with every step , even with thick socks there was just no way to make them work . 38 's too small , 39 way to big . why the huge jump ?! I have a normal foot , never worn or needed to wear a narrow or wide ever in my life so when these shoes fit so incredibly wide and clompy , I knew that it was n't my foot but their shoe.But the most disappointing point of all was that the quality had noticeably declined.I had the same issue with the XP 's . And a little known fact about the XP memory foam version is that the memory foam base will only last a few months TOPS before going flat , and the cost to replace just the inserts is $ 40 a pair ... ouch ! So after I realized that Danskos would n't work anymore , I decided to search for another clog , that 's when I did some research and discovered that Dansko had made the break from the original maker of the shoe -LRB- sanita -RRB- . I did n't realize that you could actually order Sanita 's until then . That 's when I decided to try a pair of Sanita clogs instead . SOO happy that I did !!! Now I have the quality I remember in a size that fits perfectly . So for those of you on the fence ... try Sanita 's instead . THey were the makers of Dansko that made them famous in the first place . They are better quality , better materials , not made in China , and not so wide you can barely keep them on without sizing down to the point where they are way too small . You wo n't be disappointed . However , due take note because when I went to scrubs and beyond to try the KOI clogs -LRB- made by Sanita as well -RRB- to get an idea of sizing , I did chose to size up so now I wear a size 39 , but who cares ... the quality is back and they actually fit !!
 I was SHOCKED at how uncomfortable these shoes were , after having worn and loved Dansko brand for many years . I found out that the company changed manufacturers -LRB- made in China now -RRB- and the quality of both fit and comfort is so much more obviously underpar ... I literally could not believe how these shoes could pinch and hurt my feet so much in one evening ! I mean , we are not talking about high fashion platform shoes here.I have attached this info from the Sanita shoe website -LRB- the old Danish company that USED to make Dansko clogs -RRB- : `` For many years Sanita manufactured clogs for Dansko . The Sanita and Dansko relationship ended in the Fall 2007 . Since then , all Sanita manufactured products sold in the USA have been sold exclusively under the Sanita brand . `` There you have it . Save your money and your feet . Sanita still makes clogs , thank goodness . Dansko on the other hand ... same high price , but NOT the same shoes .
 I work in a pharmacy and I am on my feet up to 12 hours a day . I had heard so much about how great Dansko shoes are . I got this pair and I was so excited because they are a very nice looking shoe . I wore them 1 day and decided that there was just no way I could keep them . They are way to heavy . I was trying to find a shoe that would help reduce the swelling in my ankle an old injury I still have trouble with -RRB- . My feet were aching and my BOTH ankles were very swollen . Maybe it was just this style ? I have spoken with many nurses that love Dansko and would n't put on any other kind . But for me , I 'm going to have to go back to the Born Toby . Sorry ... I really wanted thee to work out .
 I like these shoes but recently they have gotten tight !! Or my feet are swollen I wear them with thin socks and they still are a pain
 I decided to replace my old Dansko clogs with this style and color . After wearing it for an entire shift at work , I developed blisters . I felt that the insole were hard . I was disappointed with this particular style . I like the color .
 These shoes were advertized as being very comfortable . Nothing could be further from the truth . They were so uncomfortable that I can no longer wear them . I even tried to have them professionally stretched twice , to no avail . They are very tight over the top of your foot . OUCH !! What a waste of $ 100 .
 I used to buy them for my whole office but , we have noticed a big difference in quality . The company use to be a lot more personably and cared about each customer . I had a very bad experience with one of the managers there . There are plenty of really good shoe companies so , bye bye Dansko .
 Dansko 's have a great reputation but buying them on line is a bad idea . Dansko 's need to be tried on as they are individually made and sizes are very difficult to judge . I ordered a pair that I thought would fit perfectly , they were too small and I had to reorder my shoes . And return the original pair . I made my initial order on August 29 , 2009 . Today is September 29 , 2009 and I have not received my shoes . All of my friends that wear Dansko 's love them but have urged me never to buy them on line again .
 This was my second pair of Dansko professional clogs and again , they did n't fit properly . I wear a size 10 and therefore purchased a size 41 on my first purchase . They 're extremely tight fitting across the top middle section of my feet and my feet were actually NUMB after wearing them for just an hour . I could n't stand it any longer than that and did n't want to risk permanent nerve or some type of circulatory damage to my feet . My feet also slipped out of the heels frequently . The second purchase was even worse ! I purchased a larger size , 42 , thinking that it would alleviate some of the problems and ended up barely able to even put my foot into the right shoe and could n't even get my foot into the left shoe at all . They were extremely tight and unforgiving . I HATE DANSKO 'S ! I could n't give them anything less than one star and would actually give that star for the way they look . I actually loved the color and style . They 're just poorly made for the price . I ended up buying Klogs brand which look very similiar to Dansko 's and cost about $ 10 less on average .
 They started out comfortable especially since I travel and work on the hospital floor supporting physicians and nurses during EMR implementations . I had a pair of reliable flats , but I needed something with a heel . It all went south when I went to pick up my rental car in San Francisco . Walking on the pavement , I sprained my ankle and fell in the lot . I simply attributed it to clumsiness and the slanted driveway . It was n't a bad sprain and I wore the shoes without any issues afterwards.That was until I parked my car in the cobblestone driveway and wiped out again when I hit the incline . This time it was a little more bloody . Ended up with a swelling , bloody knee , a tetanus shot and grounded by the Medical Clinic at the airport for three days . I concluded that I could n't possibly be that clumsy . I realized that the only thing that changed was my shoes and both times I wore them walking in a driveway , I went down . So if you must have them , be sure to stay on level ground.Mine went back to the store and I have an appointment with an orthopedics specialist .
 Was disappointed that these Dansko 's are not as comfortable as my other pair of Dansko 's . These run a little big and slide on my heel . Also , the top rubs the top of my instep and something about them makes the top of the bottom of my left foot sore . Will still try another pair of Dansko 's later , however .
 My wife ordered these to wear to work . She is on her feet almost continually . When they did n't fit as well as the REAL Dansko 's she was replacing , we looked inside and saw why . MADE IN CHINA was stenciled on the uppers . We got our money back but no wonder they were such a good `` bargain '' . Always make certain they are not knockoffs when you buy . The original Dansko 's are great shoes for working people .
 I work in restaurants , so I 'm on my feet for 6-14 hours a day , and I heard so many good things about Danskos I thought I would buy a pair . They were really comfortable for a long time , but the first pair I bought was patent leather , and the leather was tearing around the toe and it was squeaking while I walked . So I returned those and got a plain ol' leather pair , and those too were ok for a good 6 months . Now , not even a year later , the colour on the inside of the shoe is rubbing off on my socks , turning my white socks nearly black , and even going through and staining the soles of my feet . On top of that , I come home every night and my feet are stiff and swollen , and I 'm starting to have aches in my knees . I got some gel inserts and they 've helped marginally . I understand I may be putting quite a bit of stress on these shoes , but I think a 120 dollar pair of shoes that markets itself as `` occupational shoes '' should not be doing this in less than a year of use . I wo n't be buying another pair in the future , to save my knees and my back .
 I bought this shoe for use working in a theatre . After a few months I had to have it re-heeled , and then shortly after the heel broke right off , causing me to fall down the stairs . I 'd beware of this shoe , not made well at all .
 I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly . I have extra wide feet , so I was hoping these would be wide . They were NOT at all . Maybe a medium width , but more like narrow . Too bad . I wish I could find shoes that work . I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress , but wo n't look like one without the proper shoes .
 I absolutely loved these shoes , BUT the second time I wore them they tore where the side of the shoe attached to the top of the shoe . I liked them so much I was even going to buy a replacement pair , but they no longer have them in my size .
 The seams started to come apart after only a couple times wearing these slippers . I expected better quality from a Woolrich product .
 I bought these shoes brand new a few weeks ago , and wore them at Splashin ' Safari water park earlier today for the first time . Big mistake ! Within the first 30 minutes I developed a huge blister above both heals do to the hard mesh friction rubbing agianst my skin . Speedo did a really poor job on the construction of these shoes . They need to go back to the drawing board . Why put such a hard material in the shoe heal for god 's sake ?! It 's a water shoe ! You do n't wear socks with them ! The bottom line here is that the Speedo XP 's are like wearing a cheese grater strapped to your heal . I 'm done with water shoes . I 'll stick to wearing my sandals in the water . They 're a lot more comfortable . I 've never had a whole lot of luck with water shoes anyway , and this pair was definitely no exception . The Speedo XP 's are the worst I 've worn by far . I recommend everyone stay away from them !
 I took this to Bahamas with me in October . Although I guess it 's my fault , I thought they were slip on shoes and did n't tighten up the laces . It caused a nasty blister on my Achilles tendon that lasted for the whole week ! Yucko !! One could wear them with socks though .
 Not sure what was going on.If maybe I got a returned pair of shoes but both shoes came with no insoles at all ! # % ! # $ ! # ^ # ! ^ WTF , , , , , , , , I could see the white bottom and glue from the insoles . Promply returned them and now in market for something else .
 While the pricing was good , the sole started to peel on the back . The sneaker had a `` P '' on the side and NOT like my previous pair that has `` Propet '' spelled out in full on the side .
 Ordered the white shoes first and they were great . Placed an order for the black and they were a different model and not even close in size to a wide shoe .
 WARNING !! Do n't buy from Shoebuy !! They do n't send the size that was ordered . Ordered Medium and got 5E . I did not look at the box when I got them , until I twisted my ankle because they were to loose . Then I saw that the box was sized 10.5 XX -LRB- 5E -RRB- . The shoes are OK I have had better for less money . I would give the shoes 3 stars .
 I bought these in black on another site . all I can say is that they are junk . Feel nice but the shoes develop splits in the soles after a month or two . This did n't happen just once but TWICE . The first pair cracked , I sent them back and the replacements did the same thing.I do like the fit and comfort but they do n't last more than 3 months . Total junk.Update
 Wow ! The shoe looks better in the side-picture on Amazon than what you see or get when you finally pull the shoes out of the box they arrive in . They look , feel , and shout `` Made in China ! '' These shoes have a kind of French name , but they are explicitly made in China , and if I had known this , I would have not bought them . What is n't made in China , you say ? It 's my fault . I was n't thinking.The shoes I ordered were size 11 , 3E . You 'd think I had ordered a very wide shoe . Well , though these shoes are labeled size 11 , 3E , they are much more narrow than I had anticipated . The man-made plasticized texture and material of these shoes are such that the top of the shoe buckles when walking , like a wrinkled raincoat , and just looking at the bulging and the buckling spells c.h.e.a.p. -LRB- for C.h.i.n.a. -RRB- I 've only worn them one day , and I will have to loosen the ties or shoe strings for greater comfort , but the shoe nominally is comfortable . There 's a `` feel '' of softness and comfort , although , again , a wide shoe possibly may not exist in Chinese manufacturing , no matter what numbers you specify.Maybe , too , if I chose another color other than white , these shoes would n't shout `` Bargain basement shoes bought with senior discount coupons ! `` The toe looks round in the picture , but the actual shoe tapers or narrows toward the tip , cheating the foot of a lot of the extra space a size 11 3E ought to give with a round toe . I wo n't buy these again . ****** I 've been trying to wear these shoes more often and have given them a week 's worth of wear . They are not comfortable after all . Widening the laces , letting them `` stretch , '' etcetera does nothing to enhance the comfort of this shoe . These shoes are not meant for wide feet , no matter the size . The material the shoes are made out of does n't stretch . I pretty much threw my money away . I have reduced my rate from three stars and totally just okay to two stars , totally just not okay . It 's not okay to spend more than fifty bucks on shoes that do n't fit and are n't comfortable and shoes that ca n't be returned because they 've been worn .
 These shoes do n't stand up to normal wear . The soles are separating after three months , the tops are splitting at the seams , and the left shoe has a section cut out of the sole . These are the worst walking shoes I have ever purchased . Buyer beware ! These are $ 40 shoes at best .
 I am returning these shoes . I do n'tknow if they are mismarked but much too wide . After wearing for two weeks shoes are turning in . No support .
 I love the look of this shoe , but after only wearing them a few hours , the lining is already falling out .
 I purchased these in Oct 2005 , they have been worn so little that there is no wear pattern on the soles and heels ; however the upper is separating from the sole making the boots next to useless . Very dissatisfied with the durability of these boots , especially when campared to other brands I 've worn .
 I have the white and silver shoes . They are really tight . I would n't buy them again . The seller was great though and shipped the item in time .

 They looked really cheap compared to the picture . Did n't like them at all . I have other eastland shoes I really like . I was surprised how bad they looked . shipped back right away .
 Looked cute out of the box . The description said it was leather , yet when it got here it clearly stated on the shoe that it was made of `` man made materials . '' Still , I kept them because they were cute and my daughter liked them . The sole separated from the upper in a few weeks and the shoe basically fell apart . Not worth the money .

 Do n't waste your money . The soles have fallen off this shoe . I called Amazon and since it was over the 30days , they do n't back them either . Never buying shoes from Amazon again . Or buying these shoes . They looked cute , worked well with my cloths , but cheap quality .
 I bought these slippers for my wife . She wore them around the house for a couple months and the heels wore out , shredded . The inner padding was showing . Our house is all carpet except for the kitchen , which is linoleum . There 's no way these slippers should have worn so badly in such a short time . FootSmart would not exchange them since it was past the 60-day exchange period .
 This would have been a great slipper except for the fact that they placed a VERY stiff elastic material on the top of the shoe . I am returning the pair I bought from another website , as I know from feeling it that this would be extremely uncomfortable . I think they should use a different material there or leave it out altogether . I purchased the Foamtreads Madison slipper and just love it but it is difficult to find now in my size -- they are discontinuing that one . I am now ordering the Foamtreads jewel style -- hopefully it will be comfortable .

 Even though these shoes have the same model number and design I 'm used to , the leather material and feel are n't the same . Too bad ... I guess I 'll have to look for a new shoe .

 i PURCHASED THESE SHOES FROM MACY 'S AND THE SHOE FELT AND LOOKED GREAT , WHATS A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A SHOE ? 6 MONTHS ,1 YR , 2YRS ? WELL THEY ONLY LASTED ME 6 MONTHS AND THE WOOD COLOR ON THE BOTTOM WAS GONE IN 2 WEEKS . I SPENT 80.00 ON THEM BACK THEN . THEY ARE ONLY 10 BUCKS CHEAPER ONLINE ... I BET YOU CAN FIND A BETTER SHOE THAT LOOKS AS NICE FOR CHEAPER PRICE . . I 'D RATHER BUY A REAL SHOE FOR 80.00 ... THE SOLE IS GONE ON THE SHOE . . DO N'T BUY UNLESS WANT TO BUY ANOTHER PAIR SIX MONTHS LATER ... EDDIEP.S . DO N'T BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 This boot is FAR inferior to thew other boots that 5.11 produces . I have owned several paires of 5.11 boots and have never had to think abouth what size I am ordering . I get the boots and put them on and they fit , NOT the case with these boots ! I got them out of the box the other day , put them on and imediatly had to take them off ! Not only were they nowhere near the 12 that I have worn for the past 3 years , but the construction of these boots was nothing like the other 5.11 boots . Nedles to say Amazon can keep this boot and I will be getting a pair of the ATAC Storm , or ATAC shield !
 I have had these boots for about a year , at first I was wearing them for a couple hours at a time , mostly sitting in a classroom environment . Recently I have been wearing them for the hands on portion of the class and I have to say these boots are horrible . You may possibly get away with wearing them for 3 to 4 hours at the most . But , if any longer than that be prepared to buy some insoles -LRB- which is absurd to consider when paying 100 bucks for a shoe -RRB- . The actual insole in this boot is a joke . NO cushion at all . I 'm about 5 ' 3 115 pounds so I 'm pretty sure its not a weight thing nor have I ever had any issues with boots like this before . The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the outside of the boot and otherwise how the boot has held up is pretty well . No issues with the zippers like some people have mentioned or any kind of issues with the leather . This boot would be perfect if only they could figure out how to make it more comfortable for people who are actually working 12 hour shifts on their feet .
 I wear 10.5 and trying them on when they arrived today they are at least 1/2 to maybe 1 full size to small . I love the boot but trying to exchange for a larger size amazon is sold out of 11 and 11.5 so i guess i will be bootless for awhile longer .

 Very attractive shoes - the perfect warm , rich brown with the flirty cross buckle ; I though they 'd be wonderful casual work shoes . Unfortunately , the rise comes to far up on the top of the shoe for comfort or style . It cuts into the middle part of the foot -LRB- painfully if you try to do a whole day with them -RRB- and the high cut makes my foot look even wider/longer than typical . I love walking cradle , but this higher cut on the top of the foot just does not work .
 the shoe was really hard and offered no support for arch . Hurt the top and bottom of my foot . I wore once and bagged for goodwill .
 I did not order this as a dance shoe , I ordered it as a casual shoe , because it had a 20s look . I figured that since it was a dance shoe , it should be comfortable and sturdy . That was not the case , I might as well be walking on banana peels , it has absolutely no traction at all.The soles are flimsy , and I had to wonder what the 30 dollars was paying for .
 i regret purchasing this pair of heels.they 're cute , but they 're completely uncomfortable . they apparently run small and therefore pinch . what a disappointment .

 I got these shoes for walking exercise , so I am somewhat picky on my expectations . I recently purchased a pair of New Balance walkers for about the same price , from Amazon of course . Those are great for walking . These Propets however , produce the noise in the title of this review , very loudly/noticeably at that , first the noise from the heel , then the same thing from the toe . It drives me crazy . I have never had shoes that did this . You may not mind the ker plop - if you do n't , these could be great - they appear to be well constructed -LRB- perhaps too well !! -RRB- , but it prevents me from wearing them .
 Top material is akin to cardboard . Upper toes wore out first week . I have to keep gluing the toes to keep dirt and water from entering . So far , used 2 tubes of GOOP so as to keep them useable . Sorry excuse for a shoe ; SHAME !! . . Popet
 I purchased a pair of these shoes 4 months ago at Academy Sporting Goods . I was pleased at first , but my satisfaction quickly turned to disappointment . 2 weeks after I bought them , the soles started coming off . The tread wore out quickly and there are already holes worn in the soles . I have only had these shoes 4 months and they are already due for replacement . Not good quality and I will not be buying more . I do not recommend this shoe .
 I purchased this model and brand of shoes after reading recomendations from previous buyers to my disappointment.What was wrong ? 1 . I purchased the shoes a half size bigger and wider than I normally wear because previous buyers stated Propets shoes ran a little smaller than their stated size , not the case with mine so their to big .2 . The shoes make a lot of stretching noises when I wear them drawing unwanted attention .3 . The shoes do not breath and my feet get hot after wearing them a short time .4 . Poor foot support and heavier than I expected.Previously I had New Balance brand shoes because their one of the few brands you can buy along with Propet in a 4X wide.The New Balance shoes were far better made , lighter and supported much better and breathe.If your like me and need to wear 4X wide shoes I highly recommend you purchase New Balance brand instead just like my next shoe purchase will be .
 These shoes look great and if it was n't for the fact that they have a terrible insole they would probably be good . . These shoes suck so bad that I would give away the pair I bought size 12 if you are interested.Don ' t buy they are the most uncomfortable shoes I have bought in my life!I wish I could give them a Minus Star .
 These shoes lasted one week before they started to break down . After a month of wear the sole of the shoe has seperated from the shoe on both shoes . In the shoe 's defense , I do have a very active job that requires alot of bending and kneeling . That said , I have never had a shoe in this price range wear so quickly .
 Althogh these were to be 5E width . The only way to get foot in was to remove liners and still did n't fit . Waste of time and money since I had to pay for the return S/H and then refund was reduced by $ 5 for S/H . Extreemly disappointing experience .
 I was disapointed with the width and straps of the propets . US 10 is definatley a wrong measurement for the shoe . . The rockports are excellent and fit as per description in the order.The same measurement but different sizes . I have worn both pairs for similiar time and the PROPET brand are very shy of good quality . -LRB- Very Disapointed . -RRB-
 Although the description is `` strap '' oxford , the picture shows tie shoe . Due to disability , I needed velcro and ordered the strap shoe but received a tie shoe . The shoe had to be returned .
 Very nice product , but its not true to size . So be careful when buying it . Because trying to make a return shoes back to Amazon 's customer service is comparable to beating your head against a brick wall ...
 Take it from someone who has very tough feet to make happy ! This Leo shoe is way too stiff for someone with bunions or bad feet . It ca n't compare with the Capezio 700 t-strap which worked well for me once I got it stretched a little .
 I ordered this shoe in a 10W along with another pair of Life Strides based on a review of wide shoes . I found this shoe to be way too narrow through the toes .

 I 've got these shoes and they look good , but after some minutes of constant using you will feel the hardness of the sole and they will become uncomfortable.Recommended only for using occasionally and for some minutes . Otherwise you will end with feet pain .

 I bought this and after 2 days of wear the buckle fell off on both shoes . I tried to jimmy it back on to no avail , they are sitting some where under some stuff in my closet and I am unable to wear them . I should have sent them back but I forgot about it , and now it has been too long since I bought them . Very cheap !
 not bronze , pewter is more accurate ; had to return as one shoe defective , sharp plastic trim dug into side of foot & both really narrow ; I 've had AK shoes before , I hope quality is n't going downhill ; gave 2 * for design , one for each shoe ...

 According to this seller , my order was shipped one month ago but I did not receive the item yet . The seller wo n't respond to my emails . Not recommendable . I hope to get my money back from Amazon .

 I bought this and after 2 days of wear the buckle fell off on both shoes . I tried to jimmy it back on to no avail , they are sitting some where under some stuff in my closet and I am unable to wear them .

 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 Ok , I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother . I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color . I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes . Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones , The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2 . WTF ? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time . Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift . The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA .
 A few years back -LRB- though it seems like forever ago -RRB- , I was in graduate school for anthropology . I was the studious type and had gone straight from college to grad school , so I 'd never had time for a girlfriend . Sure , I 'd had my dalliances , but when it came down to it my only sustained love was anthropology . It was Spring Break , and I 'd gotten a grant to travel to the Oaxaca region of Mexico and study the indigenous Zoque tribe . Figuring I 'd need a sturdy pair of sneakers and impressed with the rubber shell toe design , I ordered a pair of Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoes -LRB- White/Black -RRB- on Amazon . They arrived the morning of my flight.That day I flew to Mexico City and then took a bus to the city of Oaxaca , where I transferred to another bus to get to the base of Monte Alban . I then climbed Monte Alban to reach the peak , where I 'd read the Zoque tribe could be found . At this point I 'd been on my feet for nearly 16 hours , but I had nary a blister or even a foot ache to speak of . I was beginning to really like my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . But they were caked in dirt and I was getting tired , so I decided to take a break at the summit . As I was about to wash my sneakers in a puddle of water , I heard a rustling of leaves . I looked up and all of a sudden 10 Zoque warriors were surrounding me , spears drawn . I knew a few Zoque phrases from my studies , so I told them , `` Tuk ` ay Tum , '' -LRB- `` I am your friend '' -RRB- but perhaps my dialect was off because that only enraged the warriors more . Soon , the Zoque Chieftan had his spear within an inch of my throat . At that moment , I was certain I would die right there in my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs.But just then , a female hand grabbed the spear and threw it on the ground . I looked up , and standing in the golden sunlight was the most beautiful girl I 'd ever laid eyes on . Her tawny skin glistened like a lake on a cool summer night , her jet-black hair was so soft it made horses jealous , and her eyes were like two perfect almonds . `` I Almika , '' she said , gesturing toward herelf . `` I Dan , '' I timorously replied , awestruck by her beauty . `` Why joo here ? '' Almika asked innocently . `` Study , '' I answered . `` Joo study Zuque ? '' Almika continued . I nodded in the affirmative . At this , Almika 's eyes beamed with excitement . She said something in Zuque that made the warriors lower their spears.Relieved and relaxed , I strolled with Almika toward the Zuque encampment . Between her limited English , my limited Zuque and some hand gestures , we were able to communicate with one another . I learned that she enjoyed weaving and playing traditional Zuque songs on her ocarina , and more importantly that she was looking for a man but was having trouble finding one in her tribe . It was important to her that a man be brave and strong , as many men in her tribe were , but she also wanted a man who was cultured and could show her the world beyond Monte Alban . It was clear to her that I was worldly , but in order to win her heart I knew I 'd have to prove that I was brave and strong . So that night as I fell asleep on my straw bed in the encampment , my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs still caked in dirt , I resolved to show her that I was tough.I rose early and quickly learned that the Zuque men were setting out to fetch firewood . I waved to Almika and then followed them into the woods . Fortunately , I 'd had some experience gathering wood for the fireplace at my parents ' country house in Massachusetts . So I quickly noticed the dry pieces of wood , which impressed the Zuque men . When we returned to camp at midday , I had a haul of firewood in my hands as I espied Almika roasting a cob of maize over a tiny flame . `` Better fire '' I said , and threw some of my wood onto the fire . The sudden burst of flames frightened Almika and she dropped her maize on the ground . Without flinching , I picked it up and held it near the enlarged fire . When it was perfectly crisped , I proudly handed the cob of maize back to her . Beaming , Almika bit into the maize and exclaimed `` Ees tasty ! `` The rest of the afternoon was spent helping the Zuque men fix up one of the elders ' adobes . My repair skills honed on D-I-Y projects with my Dad at our country house in Massachusetts came in handy here . I impressed the Zuque men by patching up a small hole in the roof using some Trident chewing gum I 'd brought in my backpack . When we returned to camp at dusk , the men relayed tales of my handiwork to Almika , who smiled and locked her piercing brown eyes with mine . She walked toward me and we sat on two boulders around the fire during the communal tribe dinner of rattlesnake stew , flirting and laughing all the while.As dinner was winding down , I had my arm around Almika and was about to suggest we take things to an empty hut on the periphery of the encampment . But just then , we heard the shriek of a Zuque child . I looked over and racing toward us was a gigantic jaguar galloping at full speed . Instinctively , I grabbed a bow that was lying next to me and loaded it with an arrow . I 'd learned archery at day camp near my parents ' house in Massachusetts . My parents did n't want me to go because they thought the camp was run by a bunch of ne'er - do-well Hippies , but fortunately I convinced them to let me go . I pulled the bow string back , and released . It was so dark I could barely see what had happened . But then I heard the noise - first a whisper and then a full-on chant `` Dan ! Dan ! DAN ! DAN ! DAAAAN ! '' and when I looked closely , I saw that I 'd hit the jaguar squarely between the eyes ! Almika ran up to me and gave me a bear hug . I held her and just wanted to be with her , but jaguar blood was everywhere - on my arms , on my legs , and on my already dirt-caked Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .
 Take it from someone who has very tough feet to make happy ! This Leo shoe is way too stiff for someone with bunions or bad feet . It ca n't compare with the Capezio 700 t-strap which worked well for me once I got it stretched a little .

 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 The leather is really stiff . Despite the previous person I think these ran small , not big . About a 1/2 size to full size too small . For over $ 400 you expect something great quality but these look no better than lower priced brands like Nine West . I would only get these boots if there is a great sale , do not pay a lot for them .
 These boots run HUGE . If you want them to fit , buy a half size smaller than you usually wear . Also , the bottom of the boots are extremely slippery !
 These are most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn . I understand that there is a break in period for leather , but you ca n't possibly wear these enough times to ever break them in -LRB- if they ever do -RRB- . I feel like I have two boards strapped to my feet . They pinch in the heel and leave blisters within a few hours . The manufacturer may want to condition , rub 'em or whatever to make these a bit softer before they sell them .
 I bought this and after 2 days of wear the buckle fell off on both shoes . I tried to jimmy it back on to no avail , they are sitting some where under some stuff in my closet and I am unable to wear them . I should have sent them back but I forgot about it , and now it has been too long since I bought them . Very cheap !
 These shoes were too small and looked like it has been used . The soles were supposed to be black , but they were gray . Somehow , I tried these at the store and the size was fine . However the ones Amazon sent did n't fit . Overall , I was very unhappy with this purchase ; therefore , I returned it for a full refund .
 Had I written a review for Docs when they were made in england , I 'd given them a 5 easily . They were rugged -LRB- most pairs lasted me several years -RRB- , were made from quality leather and the look and smell of them suggested a superior boot.Since they started to manufacture them in China , the quality has gone down . The leather is stiff as cardboard , signs of wear show more rapidly -LRB- surprising since I dont run in them like I used to -RRB- and it 's not just my observation but others as well.Considering that they cost as much as they did when they were made in england , I 'll be looking for another brand once these wear out .
